  "title:": "(19F) How can I escape hookup culture?",
  "text": "So I've never been in a relationship or done anything intimately. I'm a freshman in college and all anybody seems to wanna do here is hookup :/ and personally, all I want is to just have a relationship for a few months. I went to all girls school for some context...it wasn't because I was waiting. A few nights ago, my cheating floormates have a threesome in my shared shower. I mean people are freaky. I'm assuming it's because they're out of the highschool relationships phase and just want to experiment....but I'm not even at stage 1 of kissing. People always tell me \"Oh well relationships aren't worth it, and heartbreak sucks....\" but I'd like to atleast experience it to learn. I mean I want to get married one day and I'd like to atleast know how to be with someone. I feel so behind. Like I get excited at the idea that guys would even so much as put their arm around me on the couch watching a movie. And people just say \"awww that's cute, you don't even know how to cuddle.\" It doesn't help that people get shocked when I tell them I haven't had a boyfriend before. All I really want is to feel important to somebody for a little while y'know. Anyways, what can I do? Where do I begin? I'm lost & confused...I need help.",

      "text": "Most of the stuff already said has been very good advice. Something I would add is to find a good friend group who is supportive of your mindset, even if they don\u2019t share it. I\u2019m a 21M in college and I personally prefer the hookup thing rn but my best friend is more of the relationship type like yourself. When we go out, our differences in mindset never becomes an issue because there\u2019s just a level of respect there. I know in college, especially as freshman there\u2019s a lot of added pressure to get out there but if you find the right friends, they can really take away some of that pressure & help you stay true to yourself.",

I\u2019m not into hookup culture as I\u2019m really old fashioned. I\u2019d honestly rather court someone then date them. But instead of focusing my lack of experience with girls, I focus on other  hobbies/interests like school , church, my cyber security career, comic books. So try pursuing a few hobbies, join clubs, etc and you\u2019ll find someone who wants a real relationship, hopefully we both will. Hang in there!",

      "text": "It sounds like you\u2019re putting a lot of pressure on yourself to find what you\u2019re seeking and maybe feeling insecure about your own background and where you feel you stand in comparison with your peers. You\u2019re not alone or weird though, trust me! What you\u2019re hoping for is honestly more likely to come to you when you\u2019re minding your own and least expecting it, in my experience.\n\nHookup culture often seems a lot more pervasive than it actually is honestly, so don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you\u2019re the only romantic left at your school. With college being a time of exploration, yes, a lot of people go about that sexually, but so many people go for romantic exploration, too. Both are equally valid! You just have to make sure you\u2019re looking for your fellow romantics in the right places\u2014you\u2019re probably more likely to meet who you\u2019re looking for in your study group for bio than you are in the club on the weekend, for example. It\u2019s also going to help if you\u2019re communicating your intentions clearly when you start talking with someone\u2014saves a lot of wasted time and hurt feelings for both parties when you\u2019re up front about what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nOverall, be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey\u2014keep talking to and meeting people in your classes, clubs, dorm, etc and don\u2019t be afraid to take a social leap every so often. Allow yourself to just see where things go when you let them develop naturally! Again, odds are the opportunity you\u2019re hoping for will come the moment you stop looking for it, at least that\u2019s been my experience, personally. Remember there\u2019s nothing wrong with where you are now or what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t let your fun college years of self discovery pass you by because you\u2019re spending it all yearning for romance, keep doing you! It sounds like you just have to get out there and see who you click with. Have fun! :)",

      "text": "As a guy my best advice would be find a guy you think is attractive. Talk to him like you would a new friend, super easy to do before classes each day, then do stuff around campus together, events, class, study, eat, etc. If you like his personality just ask him if he wants to go on a date. Do all that within a week or two, too long and you'll be friend zoned. Girls hardly ever make the first move and if you wait around for a guy to do it you might graduate by then.",

      "text": "First of all, others don\u2019t make personal choices for you, you make them for yourself. Many people choose to allow others and their environment to influence them heavily in their personal choices, but that is their choice too. If you don\u2019t want something and you have the control to decide whether you do it or not, don\u2019t do it. This, however, takes a strong will and a personal concept of yourself that isn\u2019t easily influenced by what you see going on around you. And that\u2019s particularly true when everybody else seems to be doing what you don\u2019t like, but you still don\u2019t do it because you simply don\u2019t like it (and it doesn\u2019t matter to you if you are the only one who doesn\u2019t like it). So, I will answer your question now and give some advice too. I know this isn\u2019t easy because I myself haven\u2019t found this \u201cspecial person\u201d yet, but this is an answer indeed. The answer or solution to \u201cescaping hookup culture\u201d is to find another person of the opposite sex who does not like hookup culture either; who cares more about long-term happiness and love than about quick pleasures; and who, indeed, values love and a deep spiritual-connection more than just thrills and orgasms (note: you can have both, but it is far more common to NOT find the first, because it takes a special kind of person to choose to be that way). So, how do we find these people who don\u2019t fit with hookup culture and who want true love \u2764\ufe0f? Here comes the advice \ud83d\ude09. They are good-hearted people. So, that\u2019s the #1 quality that you should look for then. The problem is that for dating, sex, and relationships, the majority of people don\u2019t have that quality as their true number 1 must-have. Even nice people have qualities, such as exciting, interesting, or cute, in a higher ranking than good-hearted. However, if you want long-lasting and reliable love, the person has to be good-hearted. Someone who isn\u2019t is far less likely to live up to the \u201cone true love\u201d dynamic, because that\u2019s not what they value the most or what makes them happiest. The #2 is that this person has to care about this stuff (like I do, for example). Even if they are good-hearted nice people they might not be necessarily looking for \u201cthe one\u201d when you talk. So you will have to ask them what they think about it to get a better understanding of whether they are truly seeking the same you seek or not. Finally, I want to point out that these nice or friendly people with a heart of gold (who are more likely to be \u201ctrue love prospects\u201d) will not have toxic friends and they typically do not come from toxic parents either. You really can tell a lot about anyone if you know who their favorite friends and their parents are.\n\nIn short: look for other people that hate hookup culture too; look for those that want true love and that aren\u2019t reluctant about saying it if they are questioned about it. How to identify them? They have non-toxic friends and parents, and they don\u2019t add toxic people to their life.\n\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0e",

      "text": "I'm 24 (M) and have only had one \"GF.\" And that was back in high school, so didn't even feel legit. \n\nUnfortunately, the hookup culture is pretty rampant wherever you go. I go to a religious school so it's not nearly as bad, but the mindset of most people is still the same. \n\nOverall though, do what makes you comfortable and be true to yourself. Like others have mentioned - have a relationship because you want to get to know and be with the INDIVIDUAL, not because you want a *relationship.* \n\nI promise if you set boundaries and standards for yourself beforehand it'll make life a lot easier when people are trying to push you to do things that may not be in your comfort zone. Just remember not to be critical of others for choosing to live differently from you, and you can expect the same respect from them. \n\nAs for how I get away from it, I find groups and sports that get me connected with others! Everywhere you go you should be able to find people like yourself that want to create meaningful friendships (and later on relationships). It just takes a little more work considering how those individuals seem to be the needles in the haystack.",

      "text": "The good thing is that you can directly choose whether you want to participate in hookup culture. The other good thing is that you can also choose who you hang out with in college. If you are more inclined to get wasted 3+ times a week, smoke out of a bong and attend sorority parties, then you are probably ending up engaging in hookup culture. The easiest way to weed out people would be to clearly state that you are not going to have sex with them for the first 6 months/1 year of the relationship...or be even more ambiguous with it. If you sleep with a new guy after 2/3 weeks you are practically just hooking up with them.",

If your mind already thinking of break up then might as well not get involve in a relationship. It is pretty heart breaking for both, and we know who benefit from it. Only you. \n\nI'm speaking from perspective of someone who is in relationship before, and talk to many people who went through break-up and down side of relationship. \n\nI know one girl who break up with her bf so she could explore her option out there. She ended up being single around 36 while the dude found someone better, that love him. \n\nFor your answer, I would not date anyone who think about going to a relationship, just to break up. Like other guy said, it pretty much like hook up. I would suggest you to find a guy friend and just befriend with him. Learn about men first before get into any relationship. Also look, dont matter much for dude who into relationship vs someone who into hook up. So we pretty much dont give a shit if you are hot. Sex maybe but not going to invest more time on someone we know will break up with.",

      "text": "(20+ F) I just recently graduated this year and I can definitely feel your pain. I so badly want a genuine relationship with no hookups or leading me on just to sleep with me and dump me, type of dynamics. \n\nIn college I had finally went on Bumble one day and met this amazing guy who I thought was everything I could want in a man, but when I met him in real life I felt almost no attraction and got turned off from how pushy he was about saying I\u2019m the love of his life, etc. I had never kissed anyone in my life and I was like 20yrs old at that time. He went in for a peck and I was frozen with my eyes wide open. I realize I just couldn\u2019t love him as much as he loved me and broke it off the next day. He was my first ever \u201cboyfriend\u201d (he asked me to be official with him that night and I agreed only because I was overwhelmed by him). He wasn\u2019t a dude looking for hookups or anything, but going through that taught me something about myself. I needed to stop playing up the idea of \u2728Relationships\u2728 and start to be honest with myself. I needed to be 100% honest with any guy that I date and tell them what I\u2019m looking for and my comfort levels. I don\u2019t want a fast paced relationship where someone\u2019s asking to marry me after 3 months or a guy who only want to sleep and dump me, etc. My advice is to be true to yourself and don\u2019t give in and settle for a relationship just to be in one. If a guy asks you out, get to know him and have an honest conversation. Me and my date from that day had a deep conversation about what we wanted and we both had some of the same boundaries and some differences that we would\u2019ve needed to work out. Being honest is necessary in a relationship.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re feeling \u201cleft behind\u201d or \u201crushed\u201d to be in a relationship. We all desire it, but we have to do what\u2019s best for us in this moment in time. I haven\u2019t dated since that last guy, because I realized that I have a long time to lol for someone or for someone to find me. I\u2019m only in my early 20s and will definitely be going through so many different stages of my life right now. Maybe my future husband is the man who will sit next to me in my next job? Maybe something crazy will happen and I\u2019ll be sent to Singapore and I\u2019ll find him there? Who knows! All I know is that I don\u2019t want to settle for a relationship I don\u2019t want. And the only way to escape that is to keep moving forward and waiting till things feel right. There are plenty of men in the world and many of them are looking for serious relationships, but maybe you just haven\u2019t met them yet. And out of that group there will definitely be a man you\u2019re meant to be with. Don\u2019t lose hope and just push through. Maybe you\u2019ll look back and see that it was worth it. Sorry for the mega rant, but clearly I\u2019ve thought about this issue a lot bc I\u2019m having that same struggles lol.",

      "text": "I understand it can be tough to be around hookup culture especially since college normalizes it. But college is really about finding yourself. Some people do that by experimenting sexually or with drugs, but you do not need those things to be happy. In fact, the most important thing is focusing on yourself.\n\nI am currently in a long distance relationship, so at times, I feel alone. While it sucks to be in a LDR, it has really helped me to develop who I am as a person and grow as an individual. Growing separately has made my relationship with my partner stronger. I know I am currently in a relationship and you said you don\u2019t have experience with romance, but I feel like this could also be useful information for you too. Just think: right now, your future partner is growing themself so that when the time comes to be with you, they are their best selves. That is what is most important in the end. The goal is finding someone that will value you.\n\nI know it may feel difficult to see those around you in relationships, but rushing into something for the sake of having \u201cexperience\u201d is not worth it.\n\n\u2014 First off, heartbreak does not need to be from a romantic partner, it can be from friendships or really just any loss, so heartbreak will come with time as long as you have people that you care about in your life.\n\n\u2014 Secondly, ignore what others around you are doing. Most of the time people are just figuring life out, so it does not mean they are doing life correctly. Just because people around you are participating in the norms of the surrounding culture, does not make it right. There truly is no right way to live life and sometimes you just need to hop along for the ride.\n\nIn the end, you most likely cannot escape hookup culture. The college atmosphere especially surrounds you in it. You just have to be able stick to what you know will be good for you in the end: Meaningless relationships just to say you have gained \u201cexperience\u201d or developing a deep connection with someone that you can spend the rest of your life with. Don\u2019t rush things and make sure you find yourself in the process.\n\nTDLR: Focus on you and the rest will come. Ignore what others are doing and do what is best for you.",

I've gone on a few dates because I was lonely but really didn't like the people right off the bat. Absolutely not worth it.  I also tried dating apps in college, and while I honestly met some good friends off them, I think it's way more fun to meet someone organically. Hasn't happened for me yet, but personally I just try to talk to people in my classes, and join clubs. Try not to let people make you feel bad! Everyone experiences things at their own pace. I used to feel insecure but I know my time will come, and yours will too!",

Although cant really say for certain because Ive never been in a relation ship ( 20M ), but Im pretty sure thats because I lacked those 2 things, mostly confidance. Just open up while staying true to your self.",

I'm too confident & I'm very smart...a common theme I find with the girls I know who get guys super easily is that they act dumb. The way to get guy at my age is basically by acting like you don't know what they're talking about so they can explain it to you. You nod your head and look all dreamy eyed the whole time he speaks. So many people I know have told me this trick. I didn't believe it at first, until I tried it. It worked! A guy in turn liked me for the very first time in my life. Unfortinately, I'm not like that at all & I'm not gonna pretend to be.\n\n2. They get scared off by the fact that I've never been in a relationship or had much of any dating experience. I try not to answer questions about my dating history but when it comes up & I answer people generally get really turned off because they think that I'll be like their first highschool girlfriend that was clingy and ended badly.\n\nThe first one is definitely a difficult one for me. I think for me, I know I'm beautiful and smart and a great person and I don't need anybody to tell me otherwise. But I do want somebody who knows themself like I do to be my partner in crime y'know? I just want somebody think of me as important...much like anybody would want.",

I mean, I could go off on a rant explaining why are they in a wrong and why you should absolutly not change, but you said you were smart so I guess you already know all of that. \n\nAlso about not being in relationship once before 20 is nothinf that uncommon ( just read this thread lol ). So I would say you mostly met dumb,imature, insecure and now that is making you second guess your self. \n\nI CAN ASSURE YOU, there are guys who like smart girls and well....better is to say we dislike dumb girls with passion. For me personaly, I want a girl with whom I can be on equal grounds with, to tease each other, and enjoy each others company. First time i met girl who was all smart but teasy as well my mind was blown, I was unaware how intersting it can be just to talk to girls. ( you could maybe call this seduction ? Im not sure. ).\n\nNow, you could maybe try good old seduction, act dumb for first few minutes, than tease with smarts, than again dumb than again smarts ( I think you get the point ). This would show oposite sex who are into dumb girls and too scared off by smart ones that you are willing to play the game but not to change your self. Also know that if they dont want you just because your are confidante and smart, than they dont deserve you dear and that shouldnt even bother you. You will find your special someone who will love you for who you are ( those are rare but you said you dont want hookups, so wait and play thr game ). \n\nBut also know this. Dumb girls is the ones they want to have sex with, the smart ones are the ones they want to have an actual relationship. Its very insuferable to be constantly arouns dumb people, and rarely who can withstand it. So again if you are turned down because you show some spunk and fighting spirit, they never wanted a relationship in a first place. \n\nSorry for a longer post. But people our age are very fragile at this point and I though you needed to hear that you should never lower your self to some level just to please another. I wish you all of the best, and find that someone!",

Just remember, there's nothing wrong with not partaking in hookup culture, and there is nothing wrong with partaking in it either - it's just about finding your own personal boundaries and enforcing them!",

Later on, we might grow apart but that's just a part of life. \n\nLike some others have said, DO NOT enter into a relationship just because you're desperate to be in one. It will never last and won't be an accurate representation of a healthy loving committed relationship (like what you would have in marriage hopefully). \n\nYou're only a freshman and you have a TON of time to gain experience before marriage. Focus on doing what you love, join a club, try new things and strive to be a better you.

      "text": "I know it\u2019s probably not the answer you\u2019re looking for, but hookup culture has always and likely will always be part of the college experience/lifestyle. Solely because of the setup; your years at college are likely the first and last time in your life that you will be surrounded by that many people of a similar age range in such close proximity with such little supervision. And apps like Tinder, which despite being advertised as a \u201cdating\u201d app, make seeking out hookups/casual relationships that much easier. So in this regard, since it will always surround you to some degree, there\u2019s no *escaping* it. The most you can do is simply refuse to partake in it. \n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t to say that you\u2019re the only one on your campus not interested in the hookup scene. Far from it. There are hundreds if not thousands of other individuals at your school alone who feel and think exact same way as you. In my case, I knew it was there, but was never overly interested.\n\nRegarding a relationship, I\u2019d agree with what u/nataliazm indicated; it\u2019s better to wait and naturally meet someone you\u2019d like to be in a relationship with than to pursue a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship. Otherwise, you\u2019re sort of putting the chicken before the egg, so to speak. While there are a lot of positives associated with healthy relationships, there are also hardships, as people indicated. They require a lot of time, effort, and work to remain equally beneficial to both people.",

My personal opinion is that you should hold out to share those experiences with someone with whom you share a deep intimate connection with, not just some random person at a party\u2026..having tasted both fruits, sharing something like that with someone you truly love and care about feels much better and seeds an even deeper connection than wasting your first experiences with someone you don\u2019t care about and who is essentially using you for some personal pleasure. If I have learned anything from my life experiences, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about that other person and doing something to please them. I don\u2019t give a shit about what I feel, I want to make them have a good time and the other person should do the same so it creates a symbiotic relationship of mutual enjoyment and pleasure. Most likely a hookup will not do that for you. After ending a 2 year relationship with the love of my life who we both experienced everything together for the first time and then thinking that random hookups will make me happy after we split made me realize how important that connection is\u2026..there was no feeling, there was no love, and there was no passion. There was no point of doing it anymore and from that moment on I realized what type of person I am and it\u2019s not the hookup type. I also realized that there is nothing more In this world that made me happier than her, and I would do anything to have her be mine again, forever\u2026..\nSorry to go on this rant but I promise you, everything happens for a reason, yes it may suck that you have not gotten to experience intimate things with someone else yet but don\u2019t force it. Like I said before, the best things happen when you aren\u2019t expecting it. And I promise you, coming from a guy, the things you said are desirable traits, at least in my own opinion. It shows that you value yourself and show value to intimate activities. So hang in there, use my mistakes as a lesson of what not to do. Or completely ignore what I said and make your own choice, whatever you choose, Just make certain that it\u2019s the right one for you and no one else. Don\u2019t let the \u201cpressure of college\u201d persuade you to change your values, take hold and don\u2019t let go. Good things are on the horizon, there is someone out there for you who feels the same and will be everything you could ever want and more, and you will thank yourself for waiting on a relationship to explore the beauty of intimacy.",

What if i get diagnosed with cancer tomorrow, what if my ex comes back into my life. I have spend so much time in my life worrying about what if\u2019s and trying to read the future but you will drive yourself insane. The future is scary, it\u2019s uncertain and you don\u2019t know what will happen. But you need to see the beauty in that. I never thought I\u2019d meet that one special person but things just lined up and worked. I promise you, life has a very weird way of working. I am unaware on your religious beliefs but I can certainly tell you something that has gotten me through the rough times. \u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d, you may not like the outcome but when one door closes another door opens. I often am placed on your shoes as well. I wonder what will happen with my relationship mainly, you read my post and understand my situation a bit and genuinely I am kind of lost without her. Yesterday would have been our 3 year anniversary and I still made sure to text her and she responded well. I hope that one day we will fix it because I truly believe in my heart and soul that she was the only woman for me and that we were meant to be together. Could that be my young mind grabbing onto the first love? Maybe, But i know what I want and even though it hurts sometimes, I fight for it. I constantly question whether we will end up together or if she will fade into another chapter of my life. I am kept up at night by the thought that I will never meet someone like her again and I will never find someone to love like her and it\u2019s terrifying. You and I are not so different, so if I were you, I\u2019d start living day by day, don\u2019t worry about the future, don\u2019t feel like something will or won\u2019t happen. Be there for yourself, love yourself, be the best version of you, for you, and not for anyone else and I promise you something good will happen. Don\u2019t force it, just live in the moment and love life. Everything happens for a reason, it is your job to decipher that reason and play the game of life. So instead of giving yourself anxiety about what could happen tomorrow, be happy for today, love today, love your neighbor and love life. Because I promise you, the only way things have worked for me, is when I wasn\u2019t expecting it, and that\u2019s the truth and blessing that many folks overlook.",

Everyone is at different stages and it's perfectly okay you are wanting to experiment with relationships and love and not just looking for sex. When you find a guy you like and are comfortable with just let them know you haven't really done anything before and if they respect you they won't pressure you and will be okay with taking things at your pace.

                      "text": "I think you\u2019re spot on and you are totally in your right mind to stick to your guns on this one. It is your preference, don\u2019t let anyone change your mind unless that change comes from within. I\u2019m here to testify that there are perfectly \u201cnormal\u201d guys out there who don\u2019t just want to hook up. Be patient, and patience will probably reward you. If someone does try to hook up with you but you like them too, make them wait. Literally. You are within your rights to do so, and their response will show their character. \n\nOn the flip, you can\u2019t really plan to be in a relationship for just a few months. Unless the other party is very clear that they want exactly that and nothing more, someone is bound to get more attached and things could easily get pretty messy if you just arbitrarily try and end it. Plus, IMO having a sort of weird arbitrary time limit will really put a damper on getting to know that person and letting one another \u201cin\u201d so to speak. I wouldn\u2019t do it that way. It\u2019s too \u201ctechnical,\u201d like some sort of a practice run. Too much thinking, not enough doing. \n\nThere are other people who are in the same boat as you, too. I was when I was a freshman three years ago. For both relationships I have been in, I made the mistake of \u201cforcing\u201d something that should not have been. That\u2019s what happens when you put pressure on yourself to make something happen. So my advice is to *let something happen*. Put yourself in a position to meet the right kind of people. I don\u2019t know your ilk, but if I wanted a relationship that didn\u2019t start off with a hookup I probably wouldn\u2019t go straight to big \u2018ol parties looking for someone to date. You might find someone else there like you\u2026but for a more dramatic example\u2026would you go to a strip club looking for guys/gals that weren\u2019t horny? I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nPeople in college do a pretty good job of self-selecting. Put yourself around people with similar interests! Open yourself up, take little leaps if you find someone you like\u2026let them know you\u2019re interested in subtle ways. That can be as simple as making a point of talking to them daily. Sit next to them on purpose. Little things like that. \n\nRelationships are really complex. On a deep level they bring out our unresolved issues and insecurities, likewise in the people we date. It\u2019s a really awesome experience, but be ready to learn a lot, set boundaries in a kind way, communicate like never before, and trust in a whole host of new ways.\n\nSorry for the long response, but that\u2019s my two cents!",

That mindset alone probably puts us in very different camps of worldviews, given that's not how most people see dating/hooking up today.\n\nWhen you are hooking up and having intimate relations with people with who you don't have any intention of creating a long-term connection with you weaken the bonds that can be created between yourself and your future spouse later on in marriage. Even without marriage as a goal, it diminishes the importance and satisfaction of making it to these relationship milestones with long-term love interests, because you are making sexual and intimate encounters a regular occurrence with random individuals. \n\nI totally agree with the feeling that hooking up cheapens yourself/the experience. It may feel good in the moment, but the cost is less meaningful/fulfilling connections later.",

Simply that the more you normalize those encounters, *the less special/unique more permanent bonds may feel later on.* Sex is obviously a very powerful and fulfilling experience, otherwise, it wouldn't be so popular :)\n\nThere's a decent amount of research going into marital happiness and its relationship to sexual activity prior to marriage. \n\n`\"Americans who have only ever slept with their spouses are most likely to report being in a \u201cvery happy\u201d marriage. Meanwhile, the lowest odds of marital happiness\u2014about 13 percentage points lower than the one-partner women\u2014belong to women who have had six to 10 sexual partners in their lives. For men, there\u2019s still a dip in marital satisfaction after one partner, but it\u2019s never as low as it gets for women\"` Source: [Atlantic Article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/sexual-partners-and-marital-happiness/573493/)\n\nAt the end of the day though, we all have our own life goals and preferences. One's personal standards and background play a big role in determining what is acceptable/fulfilling for them. Long-term joy comes from different life experiences for all of us, so it comes down to discovering what that is for you personally and then staying true to it.",

Reducing a woman to her physical appearance doesn\u2019t sound like a guy who \u201clikes\u201d or respect women at all.

It's the opposite for men as they start to make their most amount of money as they hit age 40+. Also, the other reason a woman loses value as she gets older is she gets past the point of being able to provide children. Men can usually get a woman pregnant at almost any age. Coach Greg Adams is talking about much more than a woman's appearance when it comes to a woman's value. Ask you mother to read his two books and see what she thinks because I think she'll agree with much of what he says.",

You'll find somebody eventually...\" And then I'll be 30, desiring children, and won't even know how to even pursue a guy...or I'll get stuck with some guy and won't know how to get out of it because I didn't have experience to begin with. I mean man, I suffer from depression and a big factor to it is the fact that I have been by myself for nearly 2 decades of my life. The literal point of life is to love, why should I be denying my own anatomical & biological needs & desires? I'm alone & it sucks and I don't want to have one night stands. Friends don't cure your intimate desires.",

It's definitely hard a s a girl to make the first moves, but I'd say just go for it :) talk to someone casually, and try to make the moves to make it more than that, like meeting up socially or hanging out together. I wish u the best of luck :)\n\nAnd as a guy, we are basically oblivious to read any signs lol so u may have to make it pretty obvious that you wanna get to know a guy better",

      "text": "I wanted a relationship and was quite ugly for a while (I'm a 20 year old man in college). I hit the gym and got hot. Finally got a gf. It's fun, but only if you like that person a lot. It's a lot of time and mental energy. Enjoy being the single and the adventures that come along with it. It's really not that big of a deal until you meet the right someone, and a bad relationship can be very very draining. Go out and do an activity you like. That'll help you meet men who like the same things you do.",
