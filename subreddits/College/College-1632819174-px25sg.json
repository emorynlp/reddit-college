I'm a freshman in college and all anybody seems to wanna do here is hookup :/ and personally, all I want is to just have a relationship for a few months.

I'm assuming it's because they're out of the highschool relationships phase and just want to experiment....but I'm not even at stage 1 of kissing. People always tell me \"Oh well relationships aren't worth it, and heartbreak sucks....\" but I'd like to atleast experience it to learn. I mean I want to get married one day and I'd like to atleast know how to be with someone. I feel so behind. Like I get excited at the idea that guys would even so much as put their arm around me on the couch watching a movie. And people just say \"awww that's cute, you don't even know how to cuddle.\" It doesn't help that people get shocked when I tell them I haven't had a boyfriend before. All I really want is to feel important to somebody for a little while y'know. Anyways, what can I do? Where do I begin?

You\u2019re not alone or weird though, trust me! What you\u2019re hoping for is honestly more likely to come to you when you\u2019re minding your own and least expecting it, in my experience.\n\nHookup culture often seems a lot more pervasive than it actually is honestly, so don\u2019t be fooled into thinking you\u2019re the only romantic left at your school. With college being a time of exploration, yes, a lot of people go about that sexually, but so many people go for romantic exploration, too. Both are equally valid! You just have to make sure you\u2019re looking for your fellow romantics in the right places\u2014you\u2019re probably more likely to meet who you\u2019re looking for in your study group for bio than you are in the club on the weekend, for example. It\u2019s also going to help if you\u2019re communicating your intentions clearly when you start talking with someone\u2014saves a lot of wasted time and hurt feelings for both parties when you\u2019re up front about what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nOverall, be patient with yourself and enjoy the journey\u2014keep talking to and meeting people in your classes, clubs, dorm, etc and don\u2019t be afraid to take a social leap every so often. Allow yourself to just see where things go when you let them develop naturally! Again, odds are the opportunity you\u2019re hoping for will come the moment you stop looking for it, at least that\u2019s been my experience, personally. Remember there\u2019s nothing wrong with where you are now or what you\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t let your fun college years of self discovery pass you by because you\u2019re spending it all yearning for romance, keep doing you!

Many people choose to allow others and their environment to influence them heavily in their personal choices, but that is their choice too. If you don\u2019t want something and you have the control to decide whether you do it or not, don\u2019t do it. This, however, takes a strong will and a personal concept of yourself that isn\u2019t easily influenced by what you see going on around you. And that\u2019s particularly true when everybody else seems to be doing what you don\u2019t like, but you still don\u2019t do it because you simply don\u2019t like it (and it doesn\u2019t matter to you if you are the only one who doesn\u2019t like it). So, I will answer your question now and give some advice too. I know this isn\u2019t easy because I myself haven\u2019t found this \u201cspecial person\u201d yet, but this is an answer indeed. The answer or solution to \u201cescaping hookup culture\u201d is to find another person of the opposite sex who does not like hookup culture either; who cares more about long-term happiness and love than about quick pleasures; and who, indeed, values love and a deep spiritual-connection more than just thrills and orgasms (note: you can have both, but it is far more common to NOT find the first, because it takes a special kind of person to choose to be that way). So, how do we find these people who don\u2019t fit with hookup culture and who want true love \u2764\ufe0f? Here comes the advice \ud83d\ude09. They are good-hearted people. So, that\u2019s the #1 quality that you should look for then. The problem is that for dating, sex, and relationships, the majority of people don\u2019t have that quality as their true number 1 must-have. Even nice people have qualities, such as exciting, interesting, or cute, in a higher ranking than good-hearted. However, if you want long-lasting and reliable love, the person has to be good-hearted. Someone who isn\u2019t is far less likely to live up to the \u201cone true love\u201d dynamic, because that\u2019s not what they value the most or what makes them happiest. The #2 is that this person has to care about this stuff (like I do, for example). Even if they are good-hearted nice people they might not be necessarily looking for \u201cthe one\u201d when you talk. So you will have to ask them what they think about it to get a better understanding of whether they are truly seeking the same you seek or not. Finally, I want to point out that these nice or friendly people with a heart of gold (who are more likely to be \u201ctrue love prospects\u201d) will not have toxic friends and they typically do not come from toxic parents either. You really can tell a lot about anyone if you know who their favorite friends and their parents are.\n\nIn short: look for other people that hate hookup culture too; look for those that want true love and that aren\u2019t reluctant about saying it if they are questioned about it. How to identify them? They have non-toxic friends and parents, and they don\u2019t add toxic people to their life.\n\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0e", "author": "BooksLoveTalksnIdeas", "created": 1632893607, "upvotes": 2}, "heou8u5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px25sg/19f_how_can_i_escape_hookup_culture/heou8u5/", "text": "I'm 24 (M) and have only had one \"GF.\" And that was back in high school, so didn't even feel legit. \n\nUnfortunately, the hookup culture is pretty rampant wherever you go. I go to a religious school so it's not nearly as bad, but the mindset of most people is still the same. \n\nOverall though, do what makes you comfortable and be true to yourself. Like others have mentioned - have a relationship because you want to get to know and be with the INDIVIDUAL, not because you want a *relationship.* \n\nI promise if you set boundaries and standards for yourself beforehand it'll make life a lot easier when people are trying to push you to do things that may not be in your comfort zone. Just remember not to be critical of others for choosing to live differently from you, and you can expect the same respect from them. \n\nAs for how I get away from it, I find groups and sports that get me connected with others!

He went in for a peck and I was frozen with my eyes wide open. I realize I just couldn\u2019t love him as much as he loved me and broke it off the next day. He was my first ever \u201cboyfriend\u201d (he asked me to be official with him that night and I agreed only because I was overwhelmed by him). He wasn\u2019t a dude looking for hookups or anything, but going through that taught me something about myself. I needed to stop playing up the idea of \u2728Relationships\u2728 and start to be honest with myself. I needed to be 100% honest with any guy that I date and tell them what I\u2019m looking for and my comfort levels. I don\u2019t want a fast paced relationship where someone\u2019s asking to marry me after 3 months or a guy who only want to sleep and dump me, etc. My advice is to be true to yourself and don\u2019t give in and settle for a relationship just to be in one. If a guy asks you out, get to know him and have an honest conversation. Me and my date from that day had a deep conversation about what we wanted and we both had some of the same boundaries and some differences that we would\u2019ve needed to work out.

But college is really about finding yourself. Some people do that by experimenting sexually or with drugs, but you do not need those things to be happy. In fact, the most important thing is focusing on yourself.\n\nI am currently in a long distance relationship, so at times, I feel alone. While it sucks to be in a LDR, it has really helped me to develop who I am as a person and grow as an individual. Growing separately has made my relationship with my partner stronger. I know I am currently in a relationship and you said you don\u2019t have experience with romance, but I feel like this could also be useful information for you too. Just think: right now, your future partner is growing themself so that when the time comes to be with you, they are their best selves. That is what is most important in the end. The goal is finding someone that will value you.\n\nI know it may feel difficult to see those around you in relationships, but rushing into something for the sake of having \u201cexperience\u201d is not worth it.\n\n\u2014 First off, heartbreak does not need to be from a romantic partner, it can be from friendships or really just any loss, so heartbreak will come with time as long as you have people that you care about in your life.\n\n\u2014 Secondly, ignore what others around you are doing. Most of the time people are just figuring life out, so it does not mean they are doing life correctly. Just because people around you are participating in the norms of the surrounding culture, does not make it right. There truly is no right way to live life and sometimes you just need to hop along for the ride.\n\nIn the end, you most likely cannot escape hookup culture. The college atmosphere especially surrounds you in it. You just have to be able stick to what you know will be good for you in the end: Meaningless relationships just to say you have gained \u201cexperience\u201d or developing a deep connection with someone that you can spend the rest of your life with.

My personal opinion is that you should hold out to share those experiences with someone with whom you share a deep intimate connection with, not just some random person at a party\u2026..having tasted both fruits, sharing something like that with someone you truly love and care about feels much better and seeds an even deeper connection than wasting your first experiences with someone you don\u2019t care about and who is essentially using you for some personal pleasure. If I have learned anything from my life experiences, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about that other person and doing something to please them. I don\u2019t give a shit about what I feel, I want to make them have a good time and the other person should do the same so it creates a symbiotic relationship of mutual enjoyment and pleasure. Most likely a hookup will not do that for you. After ending a 2 year relationship with the love of my life who we both experienced everything together for the first time and then thinking that random hookups will make me happy after we split made me realize how important that connection is\u2026..there was no feeling, there was no love, and there was no passion. There was no point of doing it anymore and from that moment on I realized what type of person I am and it\u2019s not the hookup type. I also realized that there is nothing more In this world that made me happier than her, and I would do anything to have her be mine again, forever\u2026..\nSorry to go on this rant but I promise you, everything happens for a reason, yes it may suck that you have not gotten to experience intimate things with someone else yet but don\u2019t force it. Like I said before, the best things happen when you aren\u2019t expecting it. And I promise you, coming from a guy, the things you said are desirable traits, at least in my own opinion. It shows that you value yourself and show value to intimate activities. So hang in there, use my mistakes as a lesson of what not to do. Or completely ignore what I said and make your own choice, whatever you choose, Just make certain that it\u2019s the right one for you and no one else. Don\u2019t let the \u201cpressure of college\u201d persuade you to change your values, take hold and don\u2019t let go. Good things are on the horizon, there is someone out there for you who feels the same and will be everything you could ever want and more, and you will thank yourself for waiting on a relationship to explore the beauty of intimacy.", "author": "kylewardbro", "created": 1632833260, "upvotes": 23}, "hel7nng": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px25sg/19f_how_can_i_escape_hookup_culture/hel7nng/", "text": "Hookups always seemed over rated to me, there no connection or love its only about getting your rocks off which is something you can probably do better with your hand anyway.

If you find a guy your interested in just be honest. Tell them you aren't looking for a hook up and would love to get to know them more.

It saves you heartbreak and time invested and they also know what you are comfortable with. Don't feel like everyone out there is just going crazy in college. Everyone is at different stages and it's perfectly okay you are wanting to experiment with relationships and love and not just looking for sex. When you find a guy you like and are comfortable with just let them know you haven't really done anything before and if they respect you they won't pressure you and will be okay with taking things at your pace.
