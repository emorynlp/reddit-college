  "text": "Guys I really need help! I don\u2019t know which classes I need to take before I transfer so a bigger college and pursue my major in Speech Pathology. Right now I\u2019m in General Studies in my first semester as a freshman at a smaller college close to my home. From what I understand I\u2019m taking some of the basic classes that I\u2019ll need for my major here so that I can save money and be in smaller classes. My first semester went great, but I\u2019m worried for my Spring Semester! I think this is the last semester I have left at this college before I transfer. My advisor gave me a random list of classes and I feel like they\u2019re not right. I was told in the past I would need to take a Public Speaking class but she didn\u2019t list that. People have said the advisor I got is not reliable. What should I do to make absolutely sure I\u2019m taking the right classes needed for my major? Please help!",

      "text": "There are two steps to determine what classes you need to be prepared to enter your major at a larger university.\n\nFirst, you need to know what classes you need to take. These can be found by searching the college's website. I would try typing \"<major> <university> bulletin,\" \"<major> <university> academic plan,\" or simply \"<major> <university> class list,\" into a search engine like Google. If that does not lead to anything, go to the program page for your major and find the academic advisor for that major. They will have a list of pre-major courses available if you email them.\n\nThe second step is less simple. Universities usually have a transfer credit system that will match whatever class you need to take at their school with the class that is equivalent at a smaller college. These are called \"transfer credit tools\" at my university. It is a website found by simply searching for \"<university> transfer credit tool.\" It may go by a slightly different name for the college you are interested in. If there is no such site for the university you are planning to transition to, contact Admissions or a transfer student office at the university. They may be able to help.\n\nAfter cross checking the list of classes, you should be able to produce a list of classes that you need to be prepared to enter your major at the university when you transfer.\n\nAcademic advisors suck. They have a hard job and, unless your advisor is very motivated or hardworking, they're often not good at it. Stay strong!\n\nIf you would like help with a specific universities resources, feel free to PM me so I could find some of these sources for you.",
