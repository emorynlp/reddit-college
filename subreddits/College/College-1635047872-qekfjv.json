  "text": "I go to class on campus next semester and sometimes feel a little apprehensive. Most people on campus are 17-22, and I won't graduate until I'm 32. I'm 29 in a few months. I have my reasons for going to college at this age. Mainly just because I couldn't take the horrible jobs, and I'd like to be a CPA and start or buy an accounting firm. It just feels weird going on campus. What would be your first thought if you saw someone near 30 on campus in your undergraduate class?",

Don\u2019t give it too much though because I guarantee nobody cares as much as you think they do.",

But I was studying early childhood at the time.\n\nWhen I went back to school for engineering years later I thought it might be weird being in my 30s and having kids, you know? But at community college a good number of my classmates were in very similar positions to me. \n\nI thought when I transferred to university it might be weird for some people and make study groups and friendships weird. But its not, and actually, I have a classmate who is twice my age.\n\nI'm old enough and have enough going on in my family life that I'm not really interested in hanging out with my classmates or going to parties, but we still lean on each other for academic help. I've told classmates casual stories about my kids and they still wanna study with me so I guess they don't find it too weird.",
