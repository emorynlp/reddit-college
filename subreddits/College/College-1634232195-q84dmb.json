  "text": "I'm planning on double majoring in Western Languages and Literatures & Psychology. I love working hard and studying makes me my most productive, happy self. I really want to get a degree in PSY and saw that my college offers it as a second major to WLL. Is it worth it do double major? Has anyone have any advice based on their experience? I don't want to feel burnt out or make my life a living hell by putting myself through a lot of stress.",

I take 5/6 classes a semester instead of the 4 (average class load for one major) and i\u2019m still graduating on time. If it helps you niche yourself for the career you want than it\u2019s worth it.",

      "text": "I\u2019m double majoring in medical lab science and statistics. The credits line up so I\u2019m meeting my required classes and electives. As for content, I\u2019m passionate about these subjects so I don\u2019t mind at all. Sometimes it is more work but I enjoy learning it. But I\u2019m mostly double majoring because it is really convenient for me to do so.\n\nAs for burnout, some semesters I take it slow and some I don\u2019t mind. Ask your advisor what she recommends each semester because a lot of content you\u2019ll be able to make connections across classes",
