      "text": "Done.\n\nI feel like there is a gap on the financial side. Why not ask about their current consumer debt and good debt? Or their current combined savings and assets? What percent of their income they are saving and how they feel about it? Income doesn't necessarily translate to wealth or financial security. There is a correlation but also a lot of middle income folks who have more savings than upper income folks. Debt and financial security are *very* strong influencers on stress and happiness so I think those would have been important to ask. Otherwise you might have data from high income earners who live a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle or low-middle income earners that manage expenses very well, which could lead to the wrong conclusions being drawn.",
