  "title:": "Asthma in a College Dorm.",
  "text": "For those of us with asthma, we know how it is moving to a different environment. Me personally, my body takes a week or so to adjust to the air quality of a new area. I live in michigan and my parents live 40 minutes from where my university is located. That being said, I get extremely weary about using my nebulizer (the asthma machine that people use with a mask) in my dorm. It\u2019s extremely loud and I feel like someone is constantly listening to me and they can hear everything going on in my dorm and I really don\u2019t want to be rude or wake anybody up. That being said, if it\u2019s my life or someone\u2019s sleep\u2026 I choose my life. However, I would like to hear peoples thoughts and opinions on it. What would you do if you were me? How would you feel if you heard it? All thoughts, opinions, questions welcome!",
