  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in high school planning my schedule for next semester and was wondering if 4 college classes and 1 AP class is too much? As of this semester I\u2019m taking APUSH, honors science (kinda irrelevant), college Spanish 1, and college pre cal algebra and am doing fine. Next semester I\u2019m planning on taking AP Lang, college American government, college pre cal trigonometry, college psychology, and college Spanish 2. I just wanted other peoples input if this would be too much or if it\u2019s manageable?",

      "text": "If you're dual enrolling at a community college that's a pretty easy schedule.  The AP class will probably be your hardest class.  Community college general education credits are almost always really easy.  It just depends on how mature of a student you are.  If high school has consistently been too easy for you, go for it.",
