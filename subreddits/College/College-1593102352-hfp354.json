While the thought of visiting a professor in their office might sound scary (or maybe you don't want to admit you have no clue what's going on), the alternative of not asking for help and potentially failing a course is much worse. Going to office hours might seem scary the first and second time, but after that, it becomes much easier. Hell, you might even develop a good professional relationship with your professor! \n\nJust please...don't get parents involved if you're struggling in a course.", "author": "bibliophile322", "created": 1593108967, "upvotes": 29}, "fvz8dzx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hfp354/do_not_ask_your_parents_to_contacts_your/fvz8dzx/", "text": "my parents are both university professors and they won\u2019t even talk to parents.
