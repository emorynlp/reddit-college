  "text": "I see people online occasionally talk about how they are an incoming freshman/sophomore in college and they provide a detailed explanation of how they plan to get their parents to \u201ctalk\u201d with their professors. This is generally taken \n negatively. Once you get into college, you are expected to handle difficult or potentially awkward confrontations yourself. If you are having trouble in a course it\u2019s always best to take the initiative and schedule an appointment/send an email yourself.\n\nEDIT: *Contact.",

Then all of a student a parent barges into the door and demands to speak to the department head- who was my professor- and ask about the masters program. The parent bought the student along with her. The department head told them to schedule an appointment.\n\nThis was a very nice and soft spoken professor. As soon as the parent and the daughter left the room, the professor turned to me and said \u201cwhat a bunch of f\u2014 annoying duo\u201d \n\nI was so taken aback by this comment especially from a very nice professor. I still laugh about it to this day.",

She spoke to the head of the department and he listened to her. Told my instructor no he can\u2019t do lessons at his house and changed the rules for my scholarship so that my instructor could meet me with his \u201cbusy\u201d schedule and had to EXPLAIN how lessons were supposed to be structured, even though my instructor claimed to have taught lessons for years at my school. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend having your parents talk to your professors, but in this case I needed it.  Neither of them took me seriously until my mother spoke to them. \n\n(PS I have since quit my instrument.

          "text": "I'm a TA and my mother teaches cegep. Talking to parents is like playing broken telephone. I care about the student and their learning. Parents are just noise. Let's take two examples:\n\nAsking about ressources : If a student says they're struggling with X and need help finding ressources, I'll have a ton of questions. First, I'll talk about what I can do as a TA. I might probe a bit about details, if appropriate, to gauge what's really going on. I'll discuss ressources and try to gauge what would work best for their needs and schedule. If they're anxious because their course load is crazy, I'll probably suggest seeing an advisor about dropping a course rather than enrolling in a weekly stress-managment workshop. If their course load is normal but they just don't enjoy it, I might suggest switching programs. And there are lots of cases where I will mention the various study skills and mental health services. Trying to do all that through a parent would suck.\n\nAsking for a regrade: If a student asks for a regrade, I'll need them to argue why, walk me through their process, point out what I missed. If the original grade stands, I can help the student learn by pointing out what exactly was wrong. The parent didn't write the solution and they typically don't know the material. They're utterly useless.\n\nSo basically, talk to your profs, TAs etc. We typically do want to help. If you have a big problem and you feel you need someone on your side, work within the system. Your student union, academic advisor, office for students with disabilities, certain student clubs etc. know the ropes and can help you advocate for yourself. Or even, within a course, your favourite TA or instructor may be willing to pass on your requests to other members of the course team. I've done it plenty of times.\n\nThere are precisely two contexts where I want to talk to parents. If your parents are visiting and you want to bring them to my office so they can put a face to the name, I'll happily say hi, shake their hands and tell them it's a privilege to have you. Otherwise, if you're in the hospital and they want to turn in an assignment on your behalf, I'll take it, tell them to give you my best, and send them off with a Kleenex and a piece of candy. Otherwise, I really don't want to see them.",

Get your work done, on time, see the TA with questions on content and you\u2019re done.  No need to email the professor.",

While the thought of visiting a professor in their office might sound scary (or maybe you don't want to admit you have no clue what's going on), the alternative of not asking for help and potentially failing a course is much worse. Going to office hours might seem scary the first and second time, but after that, it becomes much easier. Hell, you might even develop a good professional relationship with your professor! \n\nJust please...don't get parents involved if you're struggling in a course.",

I was somewhat amused with the novelty of the situation and actually responded to them to explain how students can still repair their grade later in the course without going into specifics. I later learned that I was not allowed to interact with parents (university guidelines). In any case, even if they were allowed, a parent contacting me would never result in favorable treatment. It would leave me with a slightly negative impression of the student, if anything, but won't affect my grading in any way.

So it's really important to think carefully about how things will play out.\n\nFor example, I had a run-in with an absolutely awful professor in undergrad. He was a great teacher, but he was a horrible human being. Anyway, I got a shitty mark on my final, which didn't make sense, so I contacted him to view my exam and discuss it. He replied with threats. At that point, I considered bringing my dad to the exam viewing because I could trust him to sit quietly, make me feel safe, and remember everything that was said or done in the room. Thankfully, that wasn't necessary in the end. The matter got escalated to the department chair who was wonderful.

It is not, but it would be hard for someone to know this unless taught. Abuse and harassment by parents (and occasionally other family members) is INCREDIBLY difficult to escape from because people do not understand how abuse tactics work and are easily manipulated into unknowingly aiding the abuser. This is especially dangerous when those people have some kind of privileged access to the victim, such as landlords, uni employees, police officers, security guards, secretaries, postal workers, and so on. It's tough, but if such a situation arises you need to treat it as a random adult trying to gain access to another potentially unwilling random adult. If they actually want to be in contact, it will work out. You can still be kind without crossing lines.\n\nETA: 1 in 10 american households experience domestic violence every year. If you're reading this and think you don't need to know how to handle abuse, this \"hypothetical\" victim IS SOMEONE YOU KNOW. This applies to you.",

People learn plenty of life skills in college, and there is inherently more value in getting an education than serving in the military. 70%  of the population maybe identify as Christian because of their parents, but how many are practicing? I know throughout my time serving probably less than 10% of the people I served with went to a church service, and of that 10%, probably less than half were christians. You have this idealized version that doesn't mesh with reality. Why don't you go serve instead of being all talk? Go join up so you can learn those life lessons you so desperately crave for others, otherwise you're just a sad hypocrite.\n\nThey edited their comment, first the claim they didn't say anything about Christianity or christians.

Theres nothing stopping them from going there to gain those life skills, except their own free will. What you're saying now is a far cry from what you were saying earlier, a mandatory conscription for everybody in the nation, one you would conveniently be exempt from. Like I said, you have this idealized version of the military when you know nothing about it. Tons of veterans get out of the military and go right back to living with their parents because they can't function on their own. Its not the be-all end-all of becoming an adult. Its honestly not any better than going to college because all of these people have their housing and food taken care of so they actually don't learn to take care of themselves. Sure, for many people who join, it helps them transition to being an adult and functioning in the world, but for just as many it coddles them for four years and spits them out. They might know how to patrol a village or disassemble their rifle or any specific job the military taught them, but how does that help them in the real world? It doesn't. Not to mention all of the baggage you pick up in the military. You ever look at the rate of disability for people leaving the military? Do you know how much of that is mental versus physical? You don't, at all. I do understand you a bit better now. You were barred from getting in because you're disable, so now you have this idea in your head that it can turn everybody into a functional adult. You are wrong, completely, full stop.  You have no idea what you are talking about and it makes you look really stupid to pretend otherwise.",

Stop sucking the militaries cock when you're just some Fucking civilian that doesn't have a clue. Your arrogance is astounding for one who was barred from service. Look at the disability rates veterans suffer, both mental and physical, and extrapolate how that will compound on a population that doesn't even want to be there. That's not even discussing the immorality of conscription anyways. The military is not some club you join to learn life skills, it's a serious Fucking organization designed to kill our enemies. Idk why you want to send more young people into harms way, i guess its some unfulfilled wish of yours since they wouldn't let you in because you're a broken person, but get the fuck over it.",

When your arguments are that wrong, that misdirected, and you're trying to appropriate a lifestyle, you're going to upset people. Just because you don't curse doesn't mean its not incredibly offensive.\n\nHere's a logical argument: how can we as a moral society force people to serve in the military? Conscription is inherently immoral. You're trying to take away peoples free will for a perceived greater good that is only up to your standards. You're trying to force your beliefs onto others, completely disregarding the first amendment. We have the right to our own belief system, even if it doesn't line up with yours. As a person experience both in the military and college, specifically with a job assisting transitioning students, veterans and otherwise, I told you that your choice is ill informed and misdirected.",

People who didn't finish high school grew up REAL FAST. \n\nBelieve me, the majority is not fucking having shit easy. Most people had to start making a living REAL FAST at 18 or earlier/soon after to contribute. \n\nMost people get hit by life pretty hard. I didn't need the military to help me out. I had my mother die my senior year and had to raise a 9yo to make me get my shit together REAL FAST.\n\nIts ignorant to think people aren't going through shit and becoming adults quickly. Do remember that most Americans do not graduate with a bachelor's degree. Most Americans go right into the workforce where they earn mediocre wages that go mostly into rent, bills, & food.\n\nAnd the military people I know? All sleeping with multiple women, divorced by 25.. some even 20, with expensive cars. Almost none have savings accounts... they spend what they get. Maybe making every 18yo go into the military is a TERRIBLE idea.",

I can definitely agree with you on that, which is why DE isn't for everyone. I would say, however, that it worked rather well for me. I would have my funny moments, too, but I tended to act more mature than my HS peers and struggled to fit in because of that.\n\nMy parents only gave me a little bit of guidance on handling my academics in college, but that helped me navigate college quite a bit early on. I think sooner is better, and I always recommend DE over AP because I think it preps HS students better, credits are about as transferable, and you don't have to pay any fees at all (at least, that's how it is in my state).",
