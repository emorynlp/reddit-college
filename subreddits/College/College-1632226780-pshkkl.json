I basically had major knee surgery (torn ACl, MCL and Meniscus) around 4 weeks ago. As of now I\u2019m dealing with physical pain, mobility issues and managing my time with everything. Which is affecting the way I study and get assignments done (most of the time I\u2019m home alone so I\u2019m taking care of myself as well, doing physical therapy 3-4 times a day icing it myself and going to an actual physical therapist 2 times a week ext.on top of check in\u2019s with my surgeon.) I\u2019ve already applied for disability but my surgeon hasn\u2019t gotten to sign the paper work yet. Most of my classes are online but  I wonder if this knee surgery would even apply due to it being an acute disorder not a chronic one. Either way, it\u2019s affecting the way I work and I have some professors who aren\u2019t communicating well with me on the issue even though I\u2019ve notified them.
