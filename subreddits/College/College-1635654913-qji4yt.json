  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, so I started college in the 18-19 academic year. I performed very poorly due to irresponsibility, and it hurt me bad. Here I am in what now should be my senior year, and due to my past failures and some part time semesters/changing majors early in college I still have 2 years remaining after this year. \n\nI feel like such a failure, watching my friends all about to graduate and I just wanna get out into my field, get married, and stop feeling like this. Please tell me I\u2019m not alone in this",

Wayyy too young to worry about being \"behind.\" Life is not a race. You are NOT a failure. You took the time to figure out what was important to you, and you were able to get back in the saddle after hitting some rough patches. Honestly? That's impressive.\n\nWhat do you think shows more strength, dedication, and willpower: sailing a ship on calm water or sailing a ship during a storm? You got caught in a storm, my dude. You haven't capsized.\n\nAnd remember, graduating is a big milestone accomplishment. But every day that you work toward your goal is an accomplishment, too. Take pride in those little milestones.",

You're not laying around idle, you're working towards building a better future for yourself and you have a goal. It doesn't matter how long it takes you to get there and it certainly doesn't matter how long it takes others to get there I comparison. What matters is your own journey and destination. In 5 or 10 years, being 2 years \"behind\" won't even be a thought that crosses your mind, you'll have moved on to another stage of your life. Also, I put \"behind\" in quotes because you're not behind, you're simply following a different path. There is no set path for college, despite what we may think. Yes, people consider it ideal to enter at 18 and leave 4 years later with a degree. But there are people from all walks of life attenting college, with some even graduating at 80+. Focus on your journey, not what you think is expected of you. Best of luck \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

You can be sad that your friends are leaving college, but don\u2019t let that morph into feelings of inadequacy. I would suggest, whenever you start feeling that way, remind yourself that you\u2019re still in school despite your mistakes, that you\u2019re making forward progress, that you\u2019ll get there!

I can only image in another 10 more years from now how quick two years will seem. \n\nUse the next to years to observe your friends and make connections. It your friends make bad decisions after graduating, look at what they did and see how you can learn from it. It your friends land awesome jobs in the field you are going into, ask them what their employer is looking for and use that knowledge to standout from the pack. Just because you feel like your behind doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve ruined your life from the start.
