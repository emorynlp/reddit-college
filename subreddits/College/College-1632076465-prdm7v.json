  "text": "I have changed my major three times so far and I\u2019m barely a sophomore. Originally I wanted to be into medicine, then engineering, and now Finance. I am fine with Finance right now and I have been getting A\u2019s. But I have interest in medicine again. I think I\u2019m going to volunteer to provide medical care to homeless people in my town just as a way to explore. I am not going to change my major because I am already starting to get into my major requirements and I don\u2019t mind the coursework. But I still feel like I want to do a bunch of different things when it comes to my career. I like medicine and science. But I don\u2019t want to deal with the stresses of the medical field but I want to help people. I just like jumping back and forth between possible career choices and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.",

      "text": "Students should be trying new things and changing their interests and minds\u2026up until a point. Unless your school admits by major, this point is when you declare your major at about half credits to degree. The push to \u201cdeclare\u201d as soon as you enter is harmful, in my opinion, to student mental health and is antithetical to the purpose and goals of college. \n\nMy advice, always, is to think interdisciplinaryly. What major or courses are at the intersection of your various interests? What does finance, engineering, and medicine have in common? That commonality may not even be housed in any of these three majors!",

      "text": "Yes, it's very normal for someone your age to be indecisive. It took me until my mid to late 20's to figure out what field I want to get into, and it's something totally different than what I got my undergrad degree in. While it is intimidating getting into something you didn't major in, it's a lot easier than you'd think. In that sense, there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" major. Just pick something to do right now, and if some time in the future you want to do something different, then go and do something different.",
