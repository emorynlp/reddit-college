  "text": "My college got rid of spring break, but ofc that didn't stop people (rich people who could also let themselves have a week off from studying) from travelling all across the country. I feel like people who stay are being punished for doing the right thing and I hate it. I hate quarantine, I hate being stuck in my crappy appartment having no associates that even want to carry a phone convo with me, I hate profs who load us up with HW because we have a day off so we can afford to do it, I hate myself (before you ask I already am going to therapy and taking anti-depressant) because I feel like a dunce since even though I am working my ass off 7 days a week I am failing two of my classes. No real point to this, I just need someone to talk to that isn't my therapist or parents. I hate college. :(",

      "text": ">but ofc that didn't stop people (rich people who could also let themselves have a week off from studying) from travelling all across the country\n\nWe didn't have our break removed and I was one of these people you are talking about. My parents don't support me with money for anything beyond basic necessities -- I have always paid on my own for travel and do sometimes get irked by people who's parents pay for it (I don't think they value the experience as much). It's not as expensive as you think, especially if you can split some of the costs with other people. It really only gets expensive if you aren't financially disciplined. Most of the people who traveled during break, at least at my university, did not come from rich families.\n\n>I feel like people who stay are being punished for doing the right thing and I hate it\n\nYou can leave and still do the right thing if you wanted to. The \"right\" thing just means \"don't create unnecessary risk or do stuff that is stupid\". Many of us found low-risk ways to enjoy travel such as road trips or camping (plus these ones are cheaper, too!). In my opinion, those crowded beaches you see a ton of students at are heavily overrated and I don't enjoy them much at all. Obviously if you are concerned about COVID you would probably have similar distastes but for different reasons.\n\nI would probably have still done something over break even if we didn't get that week off. In my opinion I could keep up with most of the work anyway plus it would really be mostly on the university for not giving any breaks (if a company can still give PTO right now then it's a small ask from any university). I'm not going to blame myself for taking a break nor let a university I am paying to attend blame me for doing so.\n\nI guess the general point I am trying to make is don't let the university run your life. There are probably several options at your disposal if you are willing to get ahead a few days and take a long weekend break with friends. Many of these probably work with your level of COVID-related risk tolerance.",

People save their own money or use refunds etc. to go on spring break trips ...you don\u2019t have to be rich for that , especially when going with friends , SO, or etc. people just split costs. \n\nStudents that travelled were likely going through the same stress OP was going through and that\u2019s why they decided to travel . Spring break doesn\u2019t have to be some mega superspresder event like you can\u2019t still do activities that don\u2019t put yourself at risk . People were still masked up, socially distant in public, in outdoor settings etc. , not everyone was out there partying & being reckless. \n\nI definitely would\u2019ve taken some kind of short weekend break if my university didn\u2019t let us have a spring break either. I think some people have made themselves super miserable during the pandemic then blame it on others who have found ways to still enjoy themselves . I\u2019m not saying go out and be careless but there are low risk ways to still enjoy yourself",

If you can't understand why taking time off college is unrealistic, I'm wondering what type of grades you are getting and what degree you're in.  Also, teachers assigning the same work to all the students is one of the stupidest fucking arguments I've ever heard.  Not everyone takes the same 4,5, or 6 classes in the same order or at the same time.  Each student could have completely different workloads.  I have a really fucking heavy semester with only 4 classes.  Last semester I had 5 classes but the workload wasn't as heavy.  Tbh, you're coming off as ignorant or part of the wealthy minority that OP is talking about.",

The reality is, some people can spend money and travel during Spring break, and be in a beautiful city or vacation location doing schoolwork, and in the off hours they are still in the vacation spot rather than at home.  That's the difference.  Most college kids can't afford that.  And a lot more don't have the luxury of always being able to take care of their mental health.  Some of us have been pretty much completely alone during the entirety of quarantine.  It sounds like you haven't been.",

It's not even up for debate.\n\nBefore I went to Cancun, I was depressed, sleep-deprived, and my sleep schedule was absolutely horrible (I literally went to bed at around 4 and 5 AM every single night). It was not good. \n\nFor the past 2 weeks, I've felt refreshed, I'm no longer as depressed (depression never truly goes away, but it definitely helped clear my head a lot and I feel much better now), and I've been going to bed at around midnight-2AM every single night now. I've truly never felt better.\n\n>i don't think you understand what mental health is\n\nI absolutely do.\n\n>Edit: there are chronically ill and otherwise immunocompromised people who have literally been shut in since march and have not been able to leave their homes at all. your unnecessary travel is indirectly contributing to them being locked up. \n\nOh shut up with that talking point. I'm not in any way the reason for the spread of COVID. I'm in literally no way responsible for immunocompromised people being shut in since March.\n\nLet's see: I haven't left my house since last March except on a few rare occasions, I've worn a mask every single time I've been in public, I've socially distanced from people, etc. There's really not much more I could've done to \"help slow the spread of COVID.\"\n\nI've been vaccinated. I wore a mask every second I was in the airport and on the plane. I was also tested for COVID before traveling back to the US. Now, after reading all that, please try and legitimately tell me *I'm* the reason COVID has spread. Your argument won't stand up in the face of reality.\n\n>whose mental health do you think is actually suffering?\n\nThe immunocompromised individuals and myself (and *millions* of other people too).",
