My parents don't support me with money for anything beyond basic necessities -- I have always paid on my own for travel and do sometimes get irked by people who's parents pay for it (I don't think they value the experience as much). It's not as expensive as you think, especially if you can split some of the costs with other people. It really only gets expensive if you aren't financially disciplined.

The \"right\" thing just means \"don't create unnecessary risk or do stuff that is stupid\". Many of us found low-risk ways to enjoy travel such as road trips or camping (plus these ones are cheaper, too!). In my opinion, those crowded beaches you see a ton of students at are heavily overrated and I don't enjoy them much at all. Obviously if you are concerned about COVID you would probably have similar distastes but for different reasons.\n\nI would probably have still done something over break even if we didn't get that week off. In my opinion I could keep up with most of the work anyway plus it would really be mostly on the university for not giving any breaks (if a company can still give PTO right now then it's a small ask from any university). I'm not going to blame myself for taking a break nor let a university I am paying to attend blame me for doing so.\n\nI guess the general point I am trying to make is don't let the university run your life. There are probably several options at your disposal if you are willing to get ahead a few days and take a long weekend break with friends.
