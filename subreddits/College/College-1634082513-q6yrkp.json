  "text": "I'm pursuing my BS in Chemistry, a field that I love - and I'm absolutely dying. I'm taking forever to earn my degree as I switched majors at an inconvenient time (spent a year of just doing basic classes irrelevant to chem but requires for a BS), and during quarantine I essentially would enroll full time, only to withdraw down to two classes because my mental health was failing, and to comply with my scholarships and grants requirements. So I'm essentially two years behind. \n\nI'm sick of school. I love lab, people and learning, but I just can't handle classes while having financial instabilities and working part time on and off. Along with keeping my depression in check. \n\nI wake up miserable, can barely do assignments, and I feel as if I'm in Hell. Part time isnt an option per my financial  aid. I could drop put and try my luck with full time, chemistry related jobs that'll accept me. But, my dad would be so disappointed in me - I'm about to cry just thinking about it. \n\nI don't think I can continue like this. What the hell should I do?",
