  "text": "I have been at my university for more than 2 months now. Living on campus, freshman dorms, probably so easy to meet friends right. \n\nWell yeah, but no. If you\u2019re like me and introverted, 0 friends. I have met 0 friends and have nobody to hangout with, I eat alone every single meal, but it\u2019s partially by choice. I could just ask my acquaintances to hangout with me but I feel too awkward doing so, and I tbh wouldn\u2019t be that excited to hangout with them and they have their groups now. Also the events, I don\u2019t want to go to football games and other events alone so\u2026 I just never go. \n\nBut given that, I still feel hopeless and depressed every single morning I wake up. Why haven\u2019t I made any friends? Everyone on snapchat and instagram made friends, even the weird ones from high school have their friends\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with me? \n\nI am the weird one now. I try to just say I don\u2019t give a fuck, and focus on working out and playing instruments, but to face facts I am really just missing out on the dorm social life. Every day it\u2019s just as impossible to make friends as it was yesterday, or even more impossible because now groups are starting to form. \n\nNow I just see people with friends on campus (90% of yall) and wonder what it\u2019s like. Partying on weekends, making memories with people, meeting new people, going off campus to different restaurants or clubs. \n\nI feel like I just squandered my opportunities for friends by being introverted the first few days, now it\u2019s feels just impossible. I feel inherently unapproachable, socially awkward as fuck, and just a loser. \n\nSo if you are a lonely freshman you\u2019re not alone.",

      "text": "I was once a lonely freshman too. I transferred colleges and am now as happy as ever. I finally made genuine friends and meet people that are similar to me all the time. I was never the problem, it was my environment. I wish it didn\u2019t take me until my junior year to realize that.",
