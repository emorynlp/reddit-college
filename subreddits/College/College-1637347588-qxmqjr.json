  "text": "So throughout my last 3 semesters in school I've been struggling hard with figuring out what I actually want to do and I think its been stressing me out to an unhealthy extent.\n\nWhen I came in as a Freshman I wanted to do film/video but the job prospects worried me and basically what I've learned about myself is that I like the idea of stability in the future more so than following my \"passion\".  I've since decided to switch into Polytech, doing a \"Web Programming and Design\" major where I've been taking basic programming classes. \n\nLong story short I've really been liking it, I've been doing a lot of programming on my own time too, but yet again I feel a sense that this major is not enough. Many say that Web Programming is not something that requires a 4 year education, which I can understand, and I feel like if I'm interested in programming and what to get my money's worth I should just try to get a CS degree instead. \n\nWeb programming as  a major seems limiting whereas CS seems like its open to many more job opportunities. That's the basis on my judgement here. \n\nI spoke to a CS advisor and they said that if I switched to CS it would take 2-3 extra semesters to complete. (5 years +1 semester). So I my big question is:\n\n**Is sticking it out for another year+ worth getting a degree in CS vs Web Programming?** \n\nKeep in mind I don't exactly know what I want to do as a career yet, just that I'm interested in the field, but I am interested in the prospect of becoming a Software Engineer/Developer.",
