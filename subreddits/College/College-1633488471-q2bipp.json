  "title:": "How do you have fun at parties without drinking/smoking/etc?",
  "text": "I went to a frat party with a group of friends last weekend, and I felt super out of place. Almost everyone was drinking/or had drunk a bit, and that seemed to be like the main activity besides listening to music. I had a lot of fun, but I don't drink or smoke because of some childhood shit, but I don't mind being around it especially when its girls my age and stuff like that. But every time I declined an offer to smoke or drink people looked at me weird, even my friends, and I felt like sort of on the outside?? They weren't pressuring me or anything but they seemed to think that there was no point in me coming, or at least they gave off that vibe if that makes sense. So I guess I'm wondering what else to do at parties besides drink (not there's anything wrong with it!! It's just a personal choice on my end) or just how to deal with it without killing the vibe?",

Some of my craziest, wildest and most fun parties were the ones where I didn\u2019t drink. \n\nIf you have fun and enjoy yourself, most people won\u2019t even notice if you\u2019re not drinking. \n\nAnd hey, get the cup if it makes you feel better, but I\u2019ve never once had people insist once I\u2019ve gone \u201cnah, I\u2019m not drinking tonight\u201d \n\nA couple of times they didn\u2019t even believe I was sober lol. \n\nA thing you will learn if you continue going to parties and not drinking: people always assume everyone else is as drunk as they are, regardless of their level of drunkness. \n\nJust have fun :)",

Something I did do though, aside from carry my own red cup of water, was start picking up all the empty cans and bottles once I saw someone drop and break one. People would ask me what I was doing, I\u2019d tell them, if they acted weird I just said it\u2019s better than someone getting cut on broken glass, and from there a conversation of some kind would be started. I met a lot of cool people and got some free recyclables. Just an idea, the people who own/live in the house will probably think you\u2019re pretty cool at least.",

Having a cup full of water is a nice distraction for drunk busybodies who just MUST comment.",

Second, hit the dance floor. Most parties have one, you don't have to be a great dancer (most people won't notice good or bad by the end of the night) but as long as you're vibing to the music and look like you're enjoying yourself people feed off of that.\n\nAnd if they aren't your scene, that's fine too. A lot of organizations have parties they throw that probably won't be as crowded or consumption-centric.",

      "text": "If you still want to go to frat parties, bring your on drinks. Seltzer water, canned juice, whatever. Even play drinking games with them. Turns out you can play any drinking game exactly the same way with just a nonalcoholic drink. If you have something in your hand, people are much less likely to ask you if you want a drink. If you explain to people that you're sober most people will respect it. People that don't aren't worth your time anyways. I have a frat brother that doesn't do any substances any more because of how much he did in college and does exactly these things now. Whenever we're playing drinking games he just brings his own nonalcoholic beverage. If parties really aren't you're seen, try to find a group of friends where partying isn't everything they do. Paries are exhausting. Small social/board game nights are tons of fun and you have a better chance of getting to know people much more intimately.",
