  "text": "I moved to college a couple of weeks ago and it hasn\u2019t been going great. I\u2019ve really been struggling to settle in and make friends, however I don\u2019t want my parents to worry so I\u2019ve been lying to them. They think I\u2019m really happy and I\u2019ve been settling in great. Today I got a card from my mum saying how happy and excited she was that I\u2019ve settled in and made friends and it made me feel so much worse. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.",

It sounds like you and your parents are close and they\u2019d understand why you lied.. because you didn\u2019t want them to worry (and that is out of love). It will make you feel a whole lot better.\n\nIf the adjustment is hard, you could try getting more involved with clubs or use BumbleBFF to help with making friends to those close by.",

As a mom, it would hurt me even more if my child wasn\u2019t telling me the truth, that they were suffering on their own. \n\nAlso, many of my friends have children that just started college this year. They all say their kids are struggling, adjusting to being away, making new friendships, etc.",

      "text": "You don\u2019t have to tell them it\u2019s all good or all bad. Hardly anything is ever black and white.\n\nI would be honest. You can preface it by saying that school is ramping up and its harder than you thought. And that the friends were fleeting. Don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to be too positive when you\u2019re not feeling it. But maybe it would help to keep a gratitude journal and relay some of the things you find enjoyable to them to help brighten both of your spirits. That way you can tell them good and bad things without having to lie.\n\nIt\u2019s hardest when you don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re letting them down, but they would want to be able to be there for you. They would be happy to hear both the good and the bad because it means you trust them to confide in them. Parents will worry regardless. The only thing you can really do to help ease their minds is to check in with them and let them know what\u2019s happening. Your parents have your back!",

Yet, my parents are there to support me. \n\nThe first thing that I can tell you, judging by what you say, is that you must be honest with them. They are keeping in contact with you because they care and love you. The least you can do is be honest and open with them. Come clean. Don't be afraid. Worst that can happen is that they give you some tips on how to improve.\n\nIf you need some from around, I'll give you a quick tip:\nFocus on yourself. You'll make friends along the way as you go places and start to share with likeminded people like in card shops or group projects. Don't stress. Just focus on your studies.",

      "text": "Sometimes colleges can be clique-y and make you feel ashamed for being alone. I didn't make too many friends at college, just a few close ones, and over time I started to feel more comfortable doing stuff on my own. Let me tell you a secret--all these friends people are making are still superficial. They won't last! And almost everyone feels like they are struggling to adjust and make friends. It will take time, but friends will find you (or you'll find them)! \n\nMy now best friend from college messaged me randomly one day and asked if I wanted to get tea. I said yes! At this point I hadn't spoken much to her, but she lived next door. We just drank tea in the dining hall and talked.\n\nHere's my tips!\n1) Since everyone is struggling to make friends and adjust, just text someone who interests you and ask if they want to get lunch or coffee!\n2) Like others have said, join clubs.\n3) Talk to the person next to you in class.\n4) Talk to professors and custodians and cafeteria workers. I've made great friends this way! College students get annoying sometimes lol.\n5) Community service is a great way to connect with kind people, and to get to know the community you've just moved to.\n6) Keep in touch with your friends from high school, and your family. They are important lifelines and care very much about you.",
