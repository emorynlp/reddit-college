  "text": "I\u2019m a college freshman and so I\u2019m pretty new to the whole college thing. I woke up this morning and saw a guy in my roommates bed. He scared the living shit outta me so I ran to my friends room down the hall, but I need to get ready for my 10am class! What\u2019s the normal response when your dormmate has a guy over? Should i be in the room? (I should add that I\u2019m not friends with my roomie so we aren\u2019t close or anything)",

Just as your roommate shouldn't be able to prevent you from having reasonable guests. But your roommate should do her best to inform you that x person is/may spend the night. And you're within your rights to refuse if you have some important studying to do or a midterm the next day or something. \n\nBut you also want to be a reasonable and flexible roommate, just as you'd want your roommate to be as well. \n\nIt's college. People stay over and stuff happens over the course of the night. They shouldn't be having sex while you're there, but it's not unreasonable for your roommate to have a dude sleep with them in their bed. It's okay that this is new to you, but that's pretty common in college and something you'll want to adjust to. Again, that's as long as everyone is respectful about it.\n\nOh and if it was just the guy there alone, without your roommate, that's a different story. That should be expressly cleared with you always. Period.",

So long as its a reasonable hour, we can ask each other to go into \u201csexile\u201d for a little bit; go to the library and study, whatever lol, while we do the deed.  \n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable having men sleep over, then that\u2019s fine, but if you\u2019re not then that\u2019s 100% understandable.  College can be scary, especially when strange men are in your dorm room.  Just make sure you make your wants clear with your roommie.",
