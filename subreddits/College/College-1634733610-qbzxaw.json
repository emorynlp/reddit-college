  "text": "I\u2019m a college freshman and so I\u2019m pretty new to the whole college thing. I woke up this morning and saw a guy in my roommates bed. He scared the living shit outta me so I ran to my friends room down the hall, but I need to get ready for my 10am class! What\u2019s the normal response when your dormmate has a guy over? Should i be in the room? (I should add that I\u2019m not friends with my roomie so we aren\u2019t close or anything)",

Ask them to ask you first next time or ask them not to bring anyone in while you\u2019re sleeping or whatever you want the boundary to be. If they break your boundaries, you can go to your RA.",

      "text": "I'd argue that the 'normal' response is not to panic and run down the hall. Finding a man in a college dorm room is not the same as finding a bear in a college dorm room. You can simply ask them to leave.\n\nHowever, you should talk to your roommate and inform them that you're not comfortable with them having strangers over in the middle of the night.",
