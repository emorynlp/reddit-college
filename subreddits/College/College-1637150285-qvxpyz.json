  "text": "So yesterday, my class got 20 different terms in a study guide sheet. On the test, which is approaching tomorrow, we have to write down their definition and two other things (one being connection to key terms). I'm currently writing them in a Docs and plan to transfer them to paper so I can hammer some of the terms. The catch is only 10 will be on the test. \n\nAny suggestions for how I cab remember these definitions? I'm not the best at recalling terms, especially when only half are chosen.",
