  "text": "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a prestigious college or anything, so it might not even be a big deal, but I\u2019d be embarrassed.\n\nMy enrollment advisor is asking for my HS transcript. I had bad grades, but good test scores.\n\nI also went for my GED, which counts as an HS diploma for some reason, and had good grades and test scores.\n\nCan I send in my GED as a substitute?",

      "text": "A GED can stand in for a HS diploma because that\u2019s what it\u2019s designed to be. If for whatever reason you struggled to complete Highschool, never finished, etc - it says you\u2019ve completed an equivalent education.\n\nIf your GED has a better GPA/better scores I would absolutely use it instead.\n\nIn any case, as someone else mentioned, community college is a great option - here\u2019s why:\n\nNo one cares where you went to school for most of it, they care where you graduate from. While it might be hard to get straight into where you\u2019re trying to go, it can often be easier to get accepted as a transfer student. You can do your gen Ed\u2019s in CC and as long as you work hard and get good grades, that transcript can be what you use to get admitted, instead of the crap grades from HS.\n\nCommunity College is also much more affordable, and for gen Ed\u2019s, the quality of the courses isn\u2019t really important.",
