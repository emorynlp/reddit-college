  "text": "Hi, i had a group project that had 3 parts, one part is 50% of the work and the other two are the other 50%. We decided that i was going to do the two parts and my partner we going to do the last part.\n\nOn the submission date i was in the hospital with my uncle and submitted the work late. The prof said it was okay. Suddenly i get an email from her that we got a 0 because the project was copied from Wikipedia word for word. Yesterday i talked to the professor by phone and she said she will look into it. Now she is saying the grade stays and it is not her problem. \n\n I sent the prof a hospital admission paper and chats with my partner saying that he will do that whole part but its in a different language and she is not willing to hear me out. I had a 98% in the course and now i have a 72%.\n\nWhat should i do?",

      "text": "Hi Omani,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you have a family member who is hospitalized. I think that your professor could have taken a more nuanced approach in this particular situation, but their behavior sounds like it is within the bounds of reason.\n\nIn response to your question, \"what should I do?\": \n\nChin up. You are still passing with 72% and it does not sound like you are facing disciplinary action for the plagiarism issue. Look at this as a valuable lesson that you will always remain responsible for any work you choose to delegate, even in a group of peers. In future assignments, remain involved in all parts of a group assignment throughout the process. Include time for verifying, and possibly correcting, any delegated group work. Otherwise, you are just gambling on the quality of the final product, which reflects poorly on you. Employers will respect your ability to manage and lead others to consistently produce quality work. Also, consider including what you learn from this situation in a future personal statement when you apply for things after college. Stories of personal growth are valuable in themselves.",

OP -- and most students if r/college is anything to go by -- seems to be making assumptions about the pedagogical purpose of group work. It's usually _not_ to be a way to divide a time-intensive project; instead it's to mirror how academic (and most professional) work is done beyond the undergraduate world. There is no such thing as a co-produced biology article, op-ed, legal brief, architectural design, etc. where one party produces one part of it and the others assume their work is fine; rather, every person checks it, because every person is signing their name to it.\n\nIf that's who OP's professor views it (and if that's what the syllabus says or implies), the professor should reasonably expect OP to 1) mention there is a family reason the work may be turned in late -- which OP did -- but 2) use some of that time to review the partner's work.",

I doubt the university would let a  professor do 100% MC given how incredibly easy it is to get high marks  on those. What a bad point. \n\nSure they can. I have the ability to make them 100% of the course grade. In several years at a few institutions I've never heard of a \"cap\" on quizzes or exams. \n\n> No, universities have in mind to profit from as many students as  possible. Professors have incentive to do as little as possible for  their students so they can focus on research. Group work is one of the  laziest ways a teacher can give out work, and like I said yes, it helps  out poor students at the expense of the hard work of the good students.  The only way to properly have a university is to separate the professors  who teach and the professors who research, and also make the university  not dependant on tuition, otherwise there is always a conflict of  interest between the students and the university. \n\n This is a lot of opinion without any evidence. If universities wanted to profit as much as possible, they would just have a model where the professor teaches as many sections of 100+ students and all M/C exams. \n\nGroup work actually takes a lot of time if done well. I don't know why you keep saying it is \"lazy\" without evidence. \n\n> Instead of repeating like a parrot about studies and thinking  critically, how about actually giving a response? Can you critically  think and give a response? Or are you going to bullshit like every other  teacher about oh that's the way things are as they prepare you for real  life or this is good for you do to 100% of the work of the people in  the group. From your responses it sounds like you yourself aren't  exactly sure given how you don't actually want to give a direct response.\n\nYou say that I'm \"repeating like a parrot about studies.\" Are you suggesting that faculty not follow research on pedagogy and effective learning strategies? Of course I am going to say I follow best  practices in class learning - which is also my answer here. I would strongly encourage you to read the literature before you pass any judgements.",

If the  hard working student had put his efforts of managing his braindead  teammates into studying more, thered without a doubt be better learning  outcomes for the hard working student with regard to academics.

I know the literature. I don't have to prove it to you. If you want to convince faculty like me, you need some sort of evidence - the point I'm trying to show you here.

You still haven't  justified why you give group work except some studies out there say it's  good and that's how it's always been. Classic excuses which piss  students off.

I  guess at least the students are your university are below you in your  mind so you like to act as a figure of authority.

Why should it then be on OP that they weren't able to check their partner's work last minute while in the middle of an emergency? And besides that, why would it be held to OP at all? If someone is seriously stupid enough to copy/paste Wikipedia, it clearly wasn't a coordinated effort to cheat, and is the fault of 1 member not both. How are you supposed to avoid that as the member who did their work legitimately? Are you supposed to see that your partner finished their work last minute, but that it's all plagiarized, and write the equivalent of days of work yourself in the timespan of an hour just so it isn't plagiarized? How are you even supposed to tell that your partner plagiarized their work if it isn't as obvious as this case? The whole \"if one person cheats, everyone fails\" argument is absolutely ridiculous, especially in cases where you don't get to choose your partners. It's clearly only the fault of one person here, so why should the blame be extended beyond that? At the *worst*, OP should be given an opportunity outside of the group setting to make up the work that their partner plagiarized. It's just ridiculous to hold a student accountable to the actions of someone outside of their control.",

                                  "text": "And my argument is that OP should not be held liable for the work of others in this setting *period*, which directly contradicts your previous statement. Sure, if you were employed and worked on a paper with other employees, each member should check the paper on at least a basic level. However, in a work setting, the manager in charge of the project would keep track of who wrote what and hold them accountable for their mistakes. The *manager* and/or a team of editors are the ones that will do a deep chack on everything and ensure everything is fact checked and not plagiarized. After all, it wouldn't make sense to risk firing a good employee for the mistake of someone else, as that would cost the company money in the long term.\n\nThere's no reason then, that each member of a team should be held accountable for the mistakes of others if they dramatically impact the project. After all, college students aren't employees, and they have no inherent control over how another group member chooses to complete their portion of a project, and that's assuming they even submit anything. It doesn't matter how many times you ask them to do their work, they aren't at risk of getting *fired*, so if they were willing to cheat, you better bet they don't care how it'll affect other group members. If it's the way they would've handled an individual project, then it'll still be the way they handle a group project, no matter what they're told.\n\nIn this scenario, the member who plagiarized should receive proper reprimand, be taken off the group project, and the work of the group should either be graded by what the rest of the group was able to complete themselves, or the group (or individuals) should have an option to make up the work of the student who cheated. In the worst case scenario, the group should have an opportunity to compare an entirely new make-up project. In *no* case should students who completed their work legitimately be held liable for those who did not. Teachers use paid software to check for plagiarism, and students don't have access to that software without purchasing it themselves. Even if the students went through and checked for plagiarism in that manner, they can't be guaranteed that the student who plagiarized submitted their work in time for them to catch it and rewire the section. After all, the whole group has a single due date that the project needs to be in by, it's inevitable that some students will post their sections within hours of the due date, not allowing time for it to be rewritten. In fact, the same students who cheat are almost certainly going to procrastinate beforehand, so I'd *expect* that plagiarized work would be turned in last minute.\n\nNo matter the case, if someone is willing to plagiarize, they will plagiarize. It doesn't matter if the rest of their group wants them to do it legitimately, the rest of the group *doesn't have a choice*, nor do they know beforehand that someone is going to plagiarize. The only solution to that would be that every group member wrote the entire project on their own just in case *anyone else* plagiarized their work, and replaced it with their own work immediately upon finding out. But at that point, it's better off being an individual project, since everyone is writing the entire project themselves anyways.",

I\u2019m fairly certain OP would be found guilty, which is at minimum a fail in the class and at maximum expulsion. Personally this is not grounds to go that route. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s my bias as a student talking, but I feel for OP. I certainly wouldn\u2019t refuse to listen to their story. If I could determine certainly that they were unaware of the violation, I would give them the chance to re-do the work their partner was supposed to do honestly, and then re-grade the assignment in its entirety as if that was originally handed in. Give OP that grade and report the other student. \n\nAgain, maybe too time-consuming or idealistic. I feel it\u2019s pretty fair to all parties involved, though.",

Yes they\u2019d have to do some more work, but they could receive a whole grade. \n\nFinally, giving a student a 0 as punishment at my school is not generally something a professor can do unless the student admits to an academic integrity violation. Anything in dispute goes to judicial affairs to be reviewed and they award the punishment. So assigning a 0 essentially is equal to pursuing an academic integrity case, at least for me. It\u2019s another assumption, but it\u2019s one I did make.",

When other students inevitably hear of it, who are displeased with their group assignments, what is your response to the inevitable emails demanding individualized assignments/grading? \n\nI can assure you that giving a student a 0 as punishment is absolutely something professors do all the time because we don't want to deal with the bullshit of having to substantiate the most obvious plagiarism cases by having to answer questions like \"but does your syllabus explicitly say that plagiarism isn't allowed?\" Also, while higher education is a Kafkaesque bureaucracy, it doesn't work in the way you describe.

Ive gotten denied from my program application, and also spoke to a department head about how I only needed one class in it to complete, which resulted in them letting me in after a short appointment. \n\nI have even stupidly FORGOTTEN to drop classes for a masters degree program and didnt find out I was enrolled until the semester ended, resulting in me owing tuition, but I came in and spoke to the necessary party, explained my unfortunate situation and did the necessary paperwork to get an application approved for tuition costs being removed.\n\nUnless you are speaking to someone at the very top of the chain, you need to speak up more. If the professor wont listen, go to their boss, their department head, make yourself heard. Im telling you right now, reading through the list of comments here and I see alot of BS. Forget the professor, talk to their department head. \n\nAs I said before, its easy to forget, especially if you are out of highschool where you have no voice or power. But in college, there are alot higher expectations for schools to adhere to. Professors are unwise to think they decide whats fair. So ask the department head to mediate. Best of luck, be brave and speak up.\n\nEdit: seeing some of the replys so let me say this. If you think you deserve to take the L and not do anything, then thats fine, learn a lesson by dropping 2 letter grades. If you already learned the lesson, its time to pursue action and start remedying the situation instead of letting your education fall apart.",

Non profit schools are not a business where you exchange money for services rendered. If that was the case, every student would demand to be entitled to 4.0 GPA and glowing letters of recommendation as they PAID for it. \n\nThere are formal complaint processes and policies at school to address professor deficiencies. Follow those, don't just write an email to the department head asking to see the manager.",

If some sentences were not borrowed from online and passed the test, could it be the rest of the sentences? how would OP know the work was even from online to start with, instead of from other sources?  If the OP insisted to continue, the ultimate solution seemed to be run an official plagiarism test as there are infinite combination of plagiarized words and sentences that could come from online and offline as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot that I'm saying one should leave the work and take no responsibility for the authenticity, but I do believe to make sure the to confirm no plagiarism beforehand was pretty much about a personal credit, and there's no way to check that unless once it's been revealed after.

The only flawed logic around here is the people who do not realize that both students were equally responsible for all parts of the project regardless of how they divided the work because truthfully dividing up the work and being completely uninvolved in the other part of the project is not the point of group work. Also, it doesn't matter if OP knew whether or not his partner cheated. I am saying he should have assumed that from the get-go. On every group-project assume there is one knucklehead that is not pulling his weight or screwing up. You can be a baby and let the project fail because of it, or you can take responsibility for GROUP WORK, and figuratively be your brother's keeper on this one. The choice is yours, but I can tell you, in the real world refusing to take responsibility for collective work shortfalls will lead to you getting fired. No one wants someone who every time a group-project comes up, \"Hey, I'm just gonna do this part, and I don't want to give you all any input on any other parts of the project.\" The nature of our world, and business as a whole, is that stuff has to be done together a lot of times. You can't get around it, and deflecting blame for a group shortfall is childish.",
