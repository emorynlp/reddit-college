If that guy thinks he can plagiarize from wiki none the less he should be taught a huge lesson and either get expelled or an f in the class. Plagiarizing is a huge mistake and no college let\u2019s students get away with it. You being that persons partner should\u2019ve looked it over. I would accept the grade and be glad you\u2019re not getting an F in the class.

Aka if the employee wont listen to your complaints, demand her boss. I figured this out much after college, but if something doesnt feel right, you need to speak with the person up top.\n\nDont think of yourself as just a student, YOU ARE A CLIENT. You pay the school to assess your knowledge, the school is not above you. They work side by side with you. You aren't even just a customer, you are basically their partner. Sometimes its easy to forget. Explain the unfair situation with the department head, send them an email or call them. \n\nIve complained about a professor's credibility due to their sloppy and factually incorrect lectures, which resulted in the department head coming in to assess them in class. Ive gotten wrong information from school office clerks and had to speak to the department heads personally to get right answers about programs. Ive gotten denied from my program application, and also spoke to a department head about how I only needed one class in it to complete, which resulted in them letting me in after a short appointment. \n\nI have even stupidly FORGOTTEN to drop classes for a masters degree program and didnt find out I was enrolled until the semester ended, resulting in me owing tuition, but I came in and spoke to the necessary party, explained my unfortunate situation and did the necessary paperwork to get an application approved for tuition costs being removed.\n\nUnless you are speaking to someone at the very top of the chain, you need to speak up more. If the professor wont listen, go to their boss, their department head, make yourself heard. Im telling you right now, reading through the list of comments here and I see alot of BS. Forget the professor, talk to their department head. \n\nAs I said before, its easy to forget, especially if you are out of highschool where you have no voice or power. But in college, there are alot higher expectations for schools to adhere to. Professors are unwise to think they decide whats fair. So ask the department head to mediate. Best of luck, be brave and speak up.\n\nEdit: seeing some of the replys so let me say this. If you think you deserve to take the L and not do anything, then thats fine, learn a lesson by dropping 2 letter grades.
