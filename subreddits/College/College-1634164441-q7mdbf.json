  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman currently in an Engineering Physics / Mech E. Program. The schedule that I was assigned with and had no choice in is 3 Gen-eds (Calc 1, Physics, and Chemistry), 2 Labs (3 hrs each) a music elective, and 1 intro to astronomy class.\n\nI hate to say it, but I\u2019m completely overwhelmed. I basically have 3-4 hours of homework daily, and I start my days around 8am and don\u2019t get out until 5-6pm.\nMy schedule feels way too packed and I absolutely do not understand what\u2019s going on in any of my classes.\n\nI never took an official calculus class in highschool, and took chemistry and physics freshman year, so I\u2019m very rusty at everything.\n\nAdditionally, I haven\u2019t been able to read my textbooks to try and help myself catch up in any of my classes because I genuinely don\u2019t have time to at all. I go to class all day, do homework, get some food and then sleep.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m completely lost. I don\u2019t know whether or not I want to even continue pursuing this major, or if I even can.\n\nCompounded on top of that, I genuinely really dislike the school I have chosen; the professors are rude and don\u2019t help explain anything at all, and make us do a lot of surveys for their research. (Maybe a bit picky, but the school just isn\u2019t right for me)\n\nI really plan to transfer next year, but I\u2019m not sure if I will even be able to get into another school with how I\u2019m performing right now.\n\nI want to reach out to the mental health services here because I feel like I\u2019m at the end of my rope.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone has any suggestions but I am just so tired and feel like I needed to write this out. I\u2019m doing so poorly academically and also mentally.\n\nIf you took the time to read this, thank you.",
