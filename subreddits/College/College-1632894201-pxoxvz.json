I wanted to be a dentist, but I\u2019m starting to think that it's not the right fit for me. My true passion is making music and audio engineering. I\u2019d like to pursue that bc yolo but still get a degree as a backup so I dont fail in life. Even if I don\u2019t keep making music, I want a career that allows me to have visible tattoos. I would be happy with just arms and legs, but I honestly want them on my neck and hands too. I know there are degrees for more creative or tech oriented jobs out there that would allow for them, I\u2019m just not sure what those jobs are/ how much they pay. To some this may sound dumb but I literally can\u2019t see myself not having tattoos. It\u2019s just the type of person I am.", "author": "alphabet03", "created": 1632894201, "retrieved": 1632945387, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"heoxx4z": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxoxvz/best_degrees_for_someone_who_wants_visible_tattoos/heoxx4z/", "text": "Start by forgetting about the tattoo issue. Work on exploring and narrowing it down to a short list based on your skills, abilities, and interests, and on job prospects, etc.\n\nAfter you've identified a few potential  career paths, you can examine them in terms of tattoos and narrow it down. When you get to that point, be sure to talk with people in the actual field not just random people who may be basing their answers on stereotypes and assumptions.\n\nIn sussing out a tattoo-friendly career, keep on mind that things have changed and are changing rapidly, in the direction of more acceptance. So don't rely on just one person's opinion, especially if they are older.\n\nWithin many fields it will vary. Geographical location matters. Also the type of job within a field. Say within biology, as a professor at a university, tattoos might be perfectly fine, but not so much working for a medical company or whatnot.\n\nKeep your options open, do what you want to do. Even a dentist, though stereotypically you don't think of them having a tattoo, maybe it would be refreshing to have a dentist who seems more chill. \n\nI'd be more concerned with just make sure the content of visibly tattoos is work appropriate.", "author": "Violet_Plum_Tea", "created": 1632895692, "upvotes": 7}, "heow799": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxoxvz/best_degrees_for_someone_who_wants_visible_tattoos/heow799/", "text": "I work at a game company.
