      "text": "I changed my major from mechanical engineering to comp sci because I just had a feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to like mechanical engineering due to it being very hands on. I was more someone who just wanted to think through a problem without being too hands on, and computer science seems like just the major that will fulfill that need. I also really just chose comp sci out of the blue and it\u2019s all working out well so far",

              "text": "I think my parents were pretty surprised when I told them I switched from mechanical engineering to comp sci, but since I switched before freshmen orientation at my school, I feel that it was no harm no foul to them since I hadn't actually done any classes yet at my university. I just told them that I wanted to actually be happy w my major and not do the major just because mechanical engineering was a \"hard major\" (even though comp sci is considered hard as well), and I'm pretty sure they understood my point after that.",
