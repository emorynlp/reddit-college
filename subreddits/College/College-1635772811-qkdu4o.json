      "text": "I changed my major from mechanical engineering to comp sci because I just had a feeling that I wasn\u2019t going to like mechanical engineering due to it being very hands on. I was more someone who just wanted to think through a problem without being too hands on, and computer science seems like just the major that will fulfill that need. I also really just chose comp sci out of the blue and it\u2019s all working out well so far",
