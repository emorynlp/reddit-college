  "text": "I wish people would just leave me the hell alone. I always feel like I have to justify myself when I say I live in campus dorms cause everyone gives me funny looks or has something to say.\n\nI got a private room, and it's convenient, okay? And it was the cheapest option available to me coming in as a transfer grad student who doesn't know anyone or the area.\n\nPeople act like I'm living in an underground bunker without electricity or water. I'm so close to telling them all to either buy me an apartment or mind their own damn business.",
