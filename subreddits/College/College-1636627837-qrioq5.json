It\u2019s totally doable, it just seems to require a lot more actual effort",

I myself haven't gone to class in pajamas, but I have gone to the student center and hung out in the dorm common room in a flannel nightgowns.\n\nETA: a frequently referenced joke is that we look like the \"gays going to brunch\" meme.

It does happen, but not nearly as often as you think, and when it does happen you kinda just see right through it.  \n\nI've seen the \"crazy shit\" that you see on these accounts, and most of it is completely idiotic, forced behavior for clout that no one would be partaking in if there werent cameras being shoved in their face.  \n\nAnnoying freshman girls screaming the lyrics to UCLA in your ear, drinking lukewarm natty lights and $10 bottles of vodka, and developing a mild nicotine addiction is not something that is amazing and exciting for all four years. \n\nI honestly dont know what I would've done with myself if i went to a top party school.  I love going to a city school where theres plenty of things to do besides get blackout drunk on a Wednesday night.
