  "title:": "Caught for plagiarising 3 lines of code",
  "text": "I have been called out for plagiarising 5 lines of code, in a 400+ line of code assignment. The reason I ended up taking these lines of code and tweaking them was due to me being disadvantaged by being put weeks behind by software malfunction, while I had a lot more on my plate. During the course of this assignment my dad was diagnosed with cancer and I was in a suicidal state. I've put in a stupid amount of time into this assignment 70 hours easily, and the accusation has made me depressed again. If I fail this unit I'll have to wait til the end of next year to graduate. What are my options?",

      "text": "Tell the truth.  You know you plagiarised and while I can sympathise with your family situation (been through it myself) that's no reason to plagiarise part of your assignment.  If you felt you were that disadvantaged then you should have requested to drop the class or to get an extension/incomplete so you could finish the work due to family and personal medical reasons.  I'm sure other kids in your class had their own personal struggles they were dealing with yet they apparently were able to complete the work.",
