  "title:": "How hard are public speaking classes, in terms of getting a good grade?",
  "text": "I was looking at the class requirements for the major I want to go into and one of the requirements is a public speaking class. \n\nI'm bad at public speaking. Like comically bad. It's not even the fact that it makes me nervous, which it does, a lot, but nerves aside I just suck at speaking in general. It doesn't matter if it's in public, private, or if I'm literally talking to myself in my head, it takes me a long time to put my thoughts together in a coherent way. I stutter and ramble on about nonsense every time I talk. \n\nI do think it will be extremely beneficial for me to take this class because it will help me with the skill that I struggle with the most, but the main thing I'm worried about is the fact that I don't want to get a bad grade and hurt my GPA. \n\nSo basically what I'm asking is: how strictly are people graded in public speaking classes? Are grades purely based on the quality of your speaking skills? Because if so, I'm literally at the bottom of the barrel compared to my peers, and even if I try, I'll get a bad grade. Or are there still ways to get a good grade even if you're objectively garbage at public speaking like I am?",
