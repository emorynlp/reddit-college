  "text": "hello, so i\u2019ve been kind of struggling with something for the past month. i don\u2019t know how to clearly explain this but i often feel like i don\u2019t deserve success. for ex, when i get good grades on an assignment i feel like i was just \u201clucky,\u201d and that i\u2019m not actually smart. i don\u2019t believe that i belong in the class. my professors might find out that i\u2019m not as \u201csmart\u201d as they think i am. i mean, i am a human, not a robot. i\u2019m bound to make mistakes, but i still feel like a fraud or something. i feel like if i make mistakes, i\u2019ll just be seen as a failure and nothing more. do i really even know what i\u2019m doing? not really.\n\nis anyone else currently going through this?",

It's very common and you can find lots of support and advice  on how to cope with it now that you know what it's called.",

      "text": "Yes! I went to massage therapy school and graduated with a 4.0 but I told myself it was easy and \"it wasn't real college.\" I'm going to State College of Florida and have 106% in one class and 99% in the other and I'm telling myself \"this is community college, so that's why I'm getting good grades. If I was in a university I wouldn't be doing this good.\" Still, when I get less than 100% on a test or assignment I beat myself up about it instead of being happy with the 96.\n\nThis sounds horrible but what helped was when I was talking with my study buddies about the test we'd gotten back and they got mid-70's and I had a 98. I realized that everyone is taking the same classes, and we all deserve the grades we get. Some people aren't as serious about college as others. I show up to class, pay attention, turn in assignments on time, take notes and make sure I am 100% prepared for the tests. This leads to good grades. It sounds like you're the same way! If you're doing what you're supposed to be doing and getting good grades, it's because you're a good student. You're not cheating the system or tricking anybody, you're just doing what is asked of you. \n\nAlso, I've never met a smart person who thinks that they're smart. \"I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.\" \\_-Socrates.\n\nYou know that there's a lot to learn and it sounds like you're working hard to learn it! Think about people that you find smart and you might find that you have more in common with them that you think. Or next time someone says something about how you're smart, say \" I don't understand why people say that. Why do you think I'm smart?\" The answer might surprise you and help you realize you deserve your grades and your place. But honestly, it might not ever go away. People have been telling me I'm smart for years and I genuinely don't believe them and think that I must be tricking people somehow because let me tell you I'm a dumbass 99.99% of the time. Keeps me humble.",
