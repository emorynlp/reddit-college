  "title:": "Having a current undergraduate student as your assigned undergraduate advisor?",
  "text": "Currently a senior and my last advisor just retired. I have a new advisor and to my surprise, it was someone who I was close friends with in high school. We went to homecoming and prom together. She\u2019s in the same grade I am, so it\u2019s very odd that she\u2019s my academic advisor. It also makes me uncomfortable to talk to her about the issues I\u2019m having with my classes.\n\nIs it normal or even right to have someone in your own grade be your academic advisor? In other departments, their advisors have MAs and PhDs. Most of the undergraduate advisors in my department aren\u2019t even out of their undergraduate program yet.",

      "text": "Yeah, that is strange. All of the advisors at my university are professors from our department who have real life experince in the field. I feel like a fellow undergraduate student just wouldnt be qualified enough to be an academic advisor. Your school must really be scrambling for staff or they just want to pay people less, neither of which are good signs.\n\nI would request a new advisor. Your reasons are completely valid.",

You talk to department advisor for administrative stuff like registering for courses, what to do for graduate school, checking degree progress, letting them know you are graduating this semester.",
