I want to be sure I attend a school where I will learn. Of course I want a degree, but I don\u2019t want to simply go through the motions and do the bare minimum to pass. \n\nThat\u2019s said, I am interested in attending either Bellevue University or Maryville University. The Major I\u2019m going for is Mathematics and it will be online. \n\nI can hardly find anything related to these schools when I search for reviews and student experiences, so I\u2019m hoping to find some here. \n\nBoth schools are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Their curriculums also differ in courses offered and semester length. If anyone could share their experiences I would be ever grateful.
