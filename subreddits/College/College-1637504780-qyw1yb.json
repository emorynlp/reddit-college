  "text": "I go to a small liberal arts college in Illinois and although I have some friends and am involved in different clubs, I have been considering transferring. I was extremely unhappy from a few weeks in until about mid November for multiple reasons: cockroaches in my dorm (had to move out and then back in), bad food (we live in a food desert), not in any classes for my major, don\u2019t like the classes I\u2019m in and the work we have to do. I\u2019ve been considering transferring for reasons I\u2019ll list below but I\u2019m also feeling a lot better and feel more adjusted, however I\u2019m worried I\u2019m thinking more about being comfortable in the social scene and not my actual academics and how that\u2019s going to affect me. \nReasons to transfer: \n- tuition is expensive (25k a year, but idk if I\u2019ll get cheaper at another school)\n- I want to be a Neuroscience major but the major outline doesn\u2019t involve any science classes unless you want to take an upper level of biology for an elective, but you have to take the beginning bio classes \n- can\u2019t get into the beginning classes like bio because there are no seats left and pre-med majors are priority, a lot of classes in general get taken up and a lot of people have a hard time getting in the classes they need \n- not starting any classes for my major until sophomore year (don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to fit biology and basic science classes to set a foundation)\n- heard from friends the science classes are hard for no reason \n- seems we have been having issues with professors (one was fired for failing students intentionally, a dean was fired, people have issues with another teacher for harassing students)\n- there\u2019s not a lot of help and it seems like advisors don\u2019t care and just tell you to \u201cnot worry about it\u201d and want you to take the liberal arts courses instead",
