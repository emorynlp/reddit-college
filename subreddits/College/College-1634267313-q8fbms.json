  "title:": "My school is allowing a professor to fail everyone so he can keep his job",
  "text": "So I am currently taking a 200 level class as a senior due to the fact that the professor wouldn\u2019t take more than 30 kids back in 2018. This professor is notorious for failing students and I was told by other professors to take it at a community college the school is partnered with, rather than doing it here. When I went to sign up for it, I was told they weren\u2019t allowing people to take it elsewhere anymore. I found out later this was not true, but I had already decided to wait and just try it here. Fast forward to today and literally everyone is failing this class. The average(no joke) was a 66.66% on our first test. We have no assignments so we rely on these tests. Many of the students in this class were talking about dropping and just taking it at the community college. Well yesterday, apparently it got around that the chair of our program was planning on blocking us from taking it there. Which now that I understand how this works, he cannot block us from taking a class at a school we are partnered with. However, the class we are in is the only class this professor teaches. So if we did in fact all take it elsewhere, he wouldn\u2019t have a job. I\u2019ve always wondered up until this point why they require us to even take this class in the first place as it doesn\u2019t relate to our major. But now I\u2019m realizing, this guy has been here forever(he\u2019s in his late 70s and refuses to use a computer) and literally has no other people to teach to. It\u2019s unfortunate, but the fact that we all have to fail just so this guy can continue to do a poor job is extremely irritating to me.",

The chair is the one that suggested I take it elsewhere, but he actually wasn\u2019t even the chair until this year. Now he\u2019s attempting to block us from taking it at the community college. I don\u2019t get the switch up from him, but it\u2019s irritating to say the least. \n\nThis class is considered a prerequisite, but it doesn\u2019t relate to the upper level classes we take after it. I did a class override and passed the advanced classes with an A very easily. Now I\u2019m taking this and struggling. It\u2019s extremely odd. He has taught other classes in the past, but this one is his passion. If he didn\u2019t have it I don\u2019t think he\u2019d even want to teach here tbh.",

There is a difference between a hard exam and an unfair exam. The average alone doesn\u2019t really show the difference.

Or \u201cyou should know this already\u201d when we couldn\u2019t possibly know this since nothing we\u2019ve taken has related to this.
