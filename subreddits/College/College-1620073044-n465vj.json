  "text": "So my graduation date is this Saturday May 8th, I got a job lined up and I start Monday. I just got a call from my advisor saying he made a mistake and I\u2019m somehow missing a core business class I need to graduate. I\u2019ll still get to walk but have to take a 10 week online class over the summer. Don\u2019t really have many people to talk to about this so thought I\u2019d turn to Reddit. Just disappointed I was sitting here thinking I was studying for my last exam, I feel defeated and unaccomplished.",

I took \u201cweightlifting\u201d which was a \u201cpass/fail\u201d.  I worked my overnight shift (Television Operations) and went to the 8:30AM class after work.  Half the time I snoozed on the bench press.  My diploma is a year later than my friends, but the school still counts me in the earlier class.\nEnjoy being a student a little longer.  Get over it.",

It was a detail about how a course was classified that could be interpreted two different ways based on the way a couple different places in the catalog were phrased. Anyway, I got a professor I knew well (obviously not the advisor who failed me) to help. They ended up letting me graduate after he talked to the Dean, but the prof was willing to make my job an \u201cindependent study\u201d with him to satisfy the requirement if we had to. Not sure if something like that might apply in your case but worth considering. Maybe the advisor who screwed up would do it with you and fix his error in a sense. \n\nThe funny part was that I graduated a semester early in December and the prof told me they had bragged about me in the end-of-semester faculty meeting how I had landed an impressive job. Then, after the holidays during my first week on that job I got call I hadn\u2019t really graduated.",

Try to make the most of this experience if it turns out that's what happens but seriously 10 weeks will go by sooo fast!",

I haven't had it happen yet (knock on wood), but I am **relentless** about making sure my students understand their degreeworks and what they need to do to complete the degree because it's on both of us to ensure things are tracking the way they're supposed to. I check it every time we meet. You did mention you noticed one class wasn't counting but figured your advisor knew better than you - for others reading - even if you think that's the case, ask the question when you notice it!  \n\n\nI would tell your job about the situation. It may not be a big deal, especially if you're able to enroll in the class online over the summer - and see if people can advocate for a capacity override if the class is full given that you're in the situation because your advisor made a mistake. You mentioned you're back and forth about telling your employer - if you choose not to tell them, that's a risk. If they find out, they're likely going to be far more upset that you withheld information from them than they would have been if you explain the situation and what you are doing to remedy it.\n\nSome institutions use faculty advisors, who are already stretched so thin with their research, service, and teaching commitments.  Some faculty advisors are great, but I generally find that they have good career advice, good advice about selecting courses in their major, but most tend to be woefully underprepared to manage university requirements, especially if they change frequently. I'm a professional academic advisor, which means this kind of stuff is my full-time job.  My college regularly surveys students about advisor satisfaction and we consistently do well on those surveys, so for our population, what we're doing seems to work. However, advisors are sometimes put in terrible, untenable positions (like advising 1000+ students) and we're human; we make mistakes. Plus, like any field, there are good advisors and bad advisors.  I don't know the whole story so I won't make a judgment on your particular advisor, just wanted to provide some insight.",

In 2019, I was in my second to last year of college, severely depressed, suicidal, close to being dismissed for a second and final time, all while battling a very serious substance abuse/addiction problem that I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about.\n\nIt\u2019s now 2021,  and I started my first big boy job at the height of the pandemic making close to six figures. \n\nlooking back, i can\u2019t believe I made it out of that dark spiral. At the time it was literal hell, like I actually wanted to die but I can\u2019t help but look back and smile and see how much I overcame. \n\nMy point is, don\u2019t sweat it. It will work out. My school was extremely accommodating. Schools measure their success by the success of their student. They are there for you. Regardless, even if they can\u2019t work something out if you\u2019re honest with your company, there is no reason why they wouldn\u2019t work with you. \n\nReach out if you need",
