  "title:": "How do we choose the right major? Is it normal to regret choosing a major?",
  "text": "I just started college and I regret choosing my major. In high school I always thought going into science would be the  best choice . I took all the science subjects my school had to offer and I honestly really enjoyed them, even though they were difficult.\n\nI\u2019m starting to dislike my classes. I used to really enjoy doing labs but now it feels like a chore, something I don\u2019t want to do anymore. Idk if I\u2019m feeling this because it\u2019s my first year or if I\u2019m genuinely not happy with my major. Just feeling a little confused.\n\nAny advice or has anyone gone through the same thing? If yes what did you do? Any piece of advice would help.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the advice and information. I didn\u2019t expect to get this many replies. Thanks a lot!",

      "text": "I went to design school for three semesters at a really good school. The school was abroad, but it was among the top five in the nation. My major was industrial design. I\u2019m (or was) a creative type, really imaginative and talented when it comes to create something out of nowhere and reimagining things. I was excelling in my school, I was the best on my design classes. I enjoyed the topics I was learning about, but everything became shallow all of the sudden. I started perceiving my major as a mundane activity. I couldn\u2019t see any worthy reason as to why I wanted to be there. I didn\u2019t want to spend more time there. I started looking for my true calling and I didn\u2019t care about my classes by the third semester. So I dropped out. I took a 2-year gap. I used that time to get to know myself, what I really liked and disliked. I explored many disciplines on my own, a little bit of this and that. I also just took time to do things I wanted to do that weren\u2019t related to the academic world. I went camping and explored the different scenes in the city. I really tried out and moved around different circles. I also had a job, so like, I was working as well. \nEveryone is different, it took me two years to find my true calling. I didn\u2019t set a timeframe, everything just sort of happened in two years. I went trough a lot of emotional distress and second guessing myself every other month. My relationship with my family even deteriorated. That might\u2019ve been because I was in my own world trying to figure things out and not really communicating. But it really took me that long to find my true calling. \nI\u2019m now in my final stretch of community college in the US, ready to transfer to a four-year institution. \nI\u2019m not telling you to drop out, I said everyone is different, that was my process, now is time for you to start your process. I\u2019m not saying you have to chage to a different major, that only can be decided by you. You asked for a similar experience, that\u2019s what I gave you. \nMy best advice, be 100% transparent with your parents, or with the people financing your education. Tell them exactly how you feel and what you are thinking. No matter what their response is, telling them is going to help you figure things out. Don\u2019t be afraid, is part of the process. \n\nP.S. If you are religious, praying and trying to find meaning in a major through your beliefs can help as well. \n\nWish you well :)\n\n[edit] \nMy mentality when approaching this issue was: it is better to spend a few years trying to figure out something I really love than to spend a lifetime doing something that I do not love. I\u2019ve met people in their 30s that are miserable in what they are doing, but on a way, they are stuck with their career so they bear the pain every day because they already have a stable job that provides for them. I did not want to be that.",

Looking at the study plan it\u2019s looks almost the same a a general biology major plan. I\u2019m just disappointed with experience so far.",

                      "text": "When I hear of the intersection of biology and computer science, I think less biotech and more bioinformatics. \n\nThat said, if you can learn enough material regarding the technology side of things through self-study, you should end up fine. Bonus points if you can demonstrate some of that through a senior project.\n\nAs long as your degree can adequately demonstrate your strong background in biology (is it accredited?), and your resume/interview can demonstrate your grasp on the technological side of things, you may stand a fair chance at getting into the positions you want to.\n\nAnecdote: I work in a very programming intensive area of electrical engineering, and the expectations of programming ability generally exceeds what most ECE program graduates can do - my extracurricular work with playing with embedded microcontrollers helped me close that gap and secure the job position.\n\nSidenote: In many professions, they have to train you from the ground up in numerous facets, especially the particulars in technical aspects. A strong enough theoretical foundation is the only thing that they expect to be associated with the college degree.",

Youre not really going to find a career that deals with both anatomy and environmental science, its kind of either-or for those. You can go the medical route and go things with vaccines, prosthetics, pharmaceuticals, lab work like blood testing, genetic engineering, etc. Or you can go the environmental route and do soil or water testing, wastewater treatment, animal or fish diseases, etc.",

I have personally experienced this. Ive taken equivalent classes at both a community college and a state 4 year school. At the community college, the information was conveyed very clearly, the tests were very fair, and it was clear what we were going to be tested on. The same course at the 4 year school, totally different. This school has a single digit acceptance rate and besides that they make certain freshmen classes exceedingly difficult. Like 1/3 of people dont pass, and of those people a good amount end up dropping out. Its just how it is. No college expects every single freshmen to graduate, and some of them dont want them to *if* they cant handle a certain rigor of coursework.",
