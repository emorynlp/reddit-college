I took all the science subjects my school had to offer and I honestly really enjoyed them, even though they were difficult.\n\nI\u2019m starting to dislike my classes. I used to really enjoy doing labs but now it feels like a chore, something I don\u2019t want to do anymore. Idk if I\u2019m feeling this because it\u2019s my first year or if I\u2019m genuinely not happy with my major. Just feeling a little confused.\n\nAny advice or has anyone gone through the same thing? If yes what did you do? Any piece of advice would help.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for the advice and information. I didn\u2019t expect to get this many replies.

The school was abroad, but it was among the top five in the nation. My major was industrial design. I\u2019m (or was) a creative type, really imaginative and talented when it comes to create something out of nowhere and reimagining things. I was excelling in my school, I was the best on my design classes. I enjoyed the topics I was learning about, but everything became shallow all of the sudden. I started perceiving my major as a mundane activity. I couldn\u2019t see any worthy reason as to why I wanted to be there. I didn\u2019t want to spend more time there. I started looking for my true calling and I didn\u2019t care about my classes by the third semester. So I dropped out. I took a 2-year gap. I used that time to get to know myself, what I really liked and disliked. I explored many disciplines on my own, a little bit of this and that. I also just took time to do things I wanted to do that weren\u2019t related in the academic world. I went camping and explored the different scenes in the city. I really tried out and moved around different circles. I also had a job, so like, I was working as well. \nEveryone is different, it took me two years to find my true calling. I didn\u2019t set a timeframe, everything just sort of happened in two years. I went trough a lot of emotional distress and second guessing myself every other month. My relationship with my family even deteriorated. That might\u2019ve been because I was in my own world trying to figure things out and not really communicating. But it really took me that long to find my true calling. \nI\u2019m now in my final stretch of community college in the US, ready to transfer to a four-year institution. \nI\u2019m not telling you to drop out, I said everyone is different, that was my process, now is time for you to start your process. I\u2019m not saying you have to chage to a different major, that only can be decided by you. You asked for a similar experience, that\u2019s what I gave you. \nMy best advice, be 100% transparent with your parents, or with the people financing your education. Tell them exactly how you feel and what you are thinking. No matter what their response is, telling them is going to help you figure things out. Don\u2019t be afraid, is part of the process. \n\nP.S. If you are religious, praying and trying to find meaning in a major through your beliefs can help as well. \n\nWish you well :)\n\n[edit] \nMy mentality when approaching this issue was: it is better to spend a few years trying to figure out something I really love than to spend a lifetime doing something that I do not love. I\u2019ve met people in their 30s that are miserable in what they are doing, but on a way, they are stuck with their career so they bear the pain every day because they already have a stable job that provides for them.
