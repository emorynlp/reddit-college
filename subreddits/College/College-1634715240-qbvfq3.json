  "text": "I\u2019ve been so stressed lately and I cried while in call wish I hadn\u2019t but they just came. \n\nI made sure to record the phone call to use in case I needed to report her.\n\nShe kept fucking pestering how me needing to reply to her emails or else she\u2019d deduct points? Like ducks sake she doesn\u2019t want us doing anything on camera \n\nMy school email that I didn\u2019t know you were supposed to set up wasn\u2019t going through so I have no way to see her messages since I only have Gmail.\n\nAnd god black boards a piece of shit I didn\u2019t realize the work wasn\u2019t submitting halfway in",

      "text": "Are you new to college (as in knowledge) in general?\n\nI don't think a professor going out of their way to let you know you need to submit assignments in is intentionally pestering you maliciously. Most would just fail you and move on.\n\nYou need to make sure you set everything up to stay on top of things and submit. Going to college can be a difficult transition, but you also need to take some responsibility as a student.",

              "text": "Yeah it's difficult adjustment for most, but you need to stay on top of it as well. There are some posts that give some great info such as how the professors needs to reach out to you in an official capacity, so it's important to have that email set up.\n\nAlso by the sounds of it, the professor is making a real effort for you to do well in class. It's best you try and take the help they are offering.",

      "text": "Most colleges will have some kind of new student task page, which will show you how to set up your school email before classes start. \n\nAs u/hdorsettcase said, most schools are going to have policies about students solely using their school email to communicate with university faculty or staff. A lot of school servers will even put emails from personal accounts (gmail, yahoo, etc.) right into spam folders. \n\nIt sounds more like she\u2019s trying to make sure you\u2019re keeping on task with things? And if she hasn\u2019t been able to reach you through email she\u2019s trying to call you because from her side of things, it\u2019ll seem like you\u2019re just ignoring her. \n\nIt\u2019s time to set up your school email. If you haven\u2019t gone into it yet you likely have thousands of emails, as we\u2019re about halfway through the fall semester. If you\u2019re having trouble with blackboard, you need to reach out to your professor(s) to have them teach you how to use it. Blackboard should show you when you\u2019ve submitted an assignment, so if it\u2019s not doing that then you haven\u2019t been submitting work.",
