  "text": "I find that textbooks are boring, usually outdated, and always expensive, so I either hand out articles or assign videos to watch.\n\nI don't give exams because I feel like rote memorization is outdated and I would rather my students come to class and listen/enjoy the lecture, and soak up info that way, rather than just trying to memorize things for memorization's sake. In lieu of tests, my students do projects, papers, etc.\n\nI know that this method pleases many students, because they tell me, but I can also see it leaving some students nervous without the \"anchor\" of a textbook or the relative predictability of a series of exams. I do put some recommended book titles in the syllabus, but only if the student wants to read them.\n\nFor reference, I teach business courses and I generally do not have non-majors in my classes. \n\nAs a student, what do you think?",

This is because they are learning the material to *understand* it, not to memorize it for a test just to make the passing grade. That leads to cramming, which affects longterm memory in a negative way. Students will not retain the information as much as they would without testing.\n\nNow, I understand the need for exams in rigorous STEM fields like engineering or medical (i.e. Surgery classes) because you have to know your shit or you could seriously fuck something up with extreme consequences, but as for general courses like business and psych and etc. this is an extremely good method of teaching because students will probably be more willing to engage with the course material.",

There's a cost/benefit analysis to be done, however, because some textbooks are so expensive the students won't buy them. The right answer has to suit your institution and your own preferences.\n\nOn testing, consider doing at least some paper or online exams. I find that my students often flounder with projects, and I have more students fail project-based classes than classes with tests and quizzes. On a test, at least I know I have most of the students' attention on a certain time and date. I use them as learning opportunities.

I would hate classes where the professor would expect everyone to read the textbook before the lecture and ask questions because I would get nothing out of it and my question would basically be \"can you do a full lecture on the topic\".  Sometimes, books would be a useful additional resource, but never useful as a primary tool.  However, I know some students make much heavier use of textbooks than I did.\n\nTests were almost the opposite for me.  I was a good test taker so I would love classes where the bulk of my grade would be doing a test.  Meanwhile, projects and papers were my big weak point and I would always struggle with them.  I'd find the time management of working on these things on my own time difficult and would often end up feeling overwhelmed by them.  Studying for tests was much easier as for many classes I would feel like the lecture was enough to pass the test and for the others, it would only require a relatively small amount of studying.\n\nIn a few classes, I would actually do the math on grade weighting and decide to skip certain projects and papers because I decided I could pass the class with a zero on that assignment and would be better off spending that time either studying for a test or working on a different project/paper.  Classes that didn't assign any projects or papers were generally easy A's for me but if I had a semester where every class was a \"no tests, just write some papers\" it would be a struggle for me to pass anything.  Overall, the trade-off of \"you will get a B in this class if you write a paper or a C if you don't\" seemed like a fair trade to not write the paper.\n\nAn ideal class for me would be one where the main source of information was a lecture but then the grade would be coming from a test.  The test could be open-ended with short answer or essay sections to avoid the rote memorization problem, but having the grade come from a distinct test was the best for me.",

In my negotiation class, there was no test. Just grades based on negotiation where you can get full points for 95% of the class by preparing to negotiate, roleplaying, and writing a reflection on it.

While saying you provide recommendations that's very much not the same since it would take effort in looking for specifics in the same topic being taught and if someone is already confused they might not know what to look for. Along with they could go through the wrong path in trying to learn a concept.\n\nI prefer projects overall, but that's the style for my major as exams and test don't really make sense for more theoretical work or are abstract.",

I haven't taken too many bizz courses though so it could just have been the ones I had. That stung, paying a prof $50 for him to print econ probs on printer paper, lol.\n\nI def prefer papers and projects over exams.

      "text": "I think it depends on subject matter, but as a liberal arts major and current grad student most of my classes had this structure. Only for some classes like macroeconomics did it make sense to have exams since there are certain concepts that you should really know leaving the class. I think having a mix of sources is really helpful too, I remember a class I took on pop cultures that would have us reading academic articles but then also watching music videos and commenting on them, art pieces, virtual museum visits, etc and the content was very memorable in this way.",

More professors need to be transparent about whether the textbook is necessary or not. As for tests, I don\u2019t think that works for every class, but I love it when there are none.",

      "text": "Love this!! Those professors are always my favorite. I retain much more from the classes where I'm applying knowledge and doing projects and engaging with the material more than classes where I'm doing exams and reading textbooks. Very few of my classes use textbooks these days, and it's pretty split half and half on how many use exams and how many test your knowledge in other ways. I believe both work, but personally I feel I benefit more from classes that focus on apply knowledge in practical ways and multiple projects, papers, or activities than classes that just require me to memorize stuff and spit it back out on exams.",

That was the only reference material because they were licensed from Harvard. The instructor taught the areas he wanted us to focus on within the class.",
