  "title:": "I'm a professor who doesn't use textbooks or give exams. From the student perspective, is this a good thing or a bad thing?",
  "text": "I find that textbooks are boring, usually outdated, and always expensive, so I either hand out articles or assign videos to watch.\n\nI don't give exams because I feel like rote memorization is outdated and I would rather my students come to class and listen/enjoy the lecture, and soak up info that way, rather than just trying to memorize things for memorization's sake. In lieu of tests, my students do projects, papers, etc.\n\nI know that this method pleases many students, because they tell me, but I can also see it leaving some students nervous without the \"anchor\" of a textbook or the relative predictability of a series of exams. I do put some recommended book titles in the syllabus, but only if the student wants to read them.\n\nFor reference, I teach business courses and I generally do not have non-majors in my classes. \n\nAs a student, what do you think?",

This is because they are learning the material to *understand* it, not to memorize it for a test just to make the passing grade. That leads to cramming, which affects longterm memory in a negative way. Students will not retain the information as much as they would without testing.\n\nNow, I understand the need for exams in rigorous STEM fields like engineering or medical (i.e. Surgery classes) because you have to know your shit or you could seriously fuck something up with extreme consequences, but as for general courses like business and psych and etc. this is an extremely good method of teaching because students will probably be more willing to engage with the course material.",

Testing highly incentivizes memorizing everything, including low yield material you'll probably just look up later (because you'll forget it in a year). 80/20 rule. That low yield stuff never matters that much outside of a specific niche, but the high yield stuff is broadly applicable, so why waste your time drilling students on the minutiae? That's why I think exams just discipline students into being professional hoop jumpers. I'm a 4.0 student, I don't remember jack shit about the Calvin cycle. Stuff goes in and stuff comes out.",

I know I will have to be providing context myself if I go without, so often I will teach a new course (especially a survey or intro) with a textbook the first time. I'm not going to be an expert in every topic, so I'm learning from the textbook myself when I'm out of my subfield. There's a cost/benefit analysis to be done, however, because some textbooks are so expensive the students won't buy them. The right answer has to suit your institution and your own preferences.\n\nOn testing, consider doing at least some paper or online exams. I find that my students often flounder with projects, and I have more students fail project-based classes than classes with tests and quizzes. On a test, at least I know I have most of the students' attention on a certain time and date. I use them as learning opportunities. I teach literature and you'd better bet that every famous passage from what we've been reading is going right on that test so they have to run their eyes over it at least once!",

I would hate classes where the professor would expect everyone to read the textbook before the lecture and ask questions because I would get nothing out of it and my question would basically be \"can you do a full lecture on the topic\".  Sometimes, books would be a useful additional resource, but never useful as a primary tool.  However, I know some students make much heavier use of textbooks than I did.\n\nTests were almost the opposite for me.  I was a good test taker so I would love classes where the bulk of my grade would be doing a test.  Meanwhile, projects and papers were my big weak point and I would always struggle with them.  I'd find the time management of working on these things on my own time difficult and would often end up feeling overwhelmed by them.  Studying for tests was much easier as for many classes I would feel like the lecture was enough to pass the test and for the others, it would only require a relatively small amount of studying.\n\nIn a few classes, I would actually do the math on grade weighting and decide to skip certain projects and papers because I decided I could pass the class with a zero on that assignment and would be better off spending that time either studying for a test or working on a different project/paper.  Classes that didn't assign any projects or papers were generally easy A's for me but if I had a semester where every class was a \"no tests, just write some papers\" it would be a struggle for me to pass anything.  Overall, the trade-off of \"you will get a B in this class if you write a paper or a C if you don't\" seemed like a fair trade to not write the paper.\n\nAn ideal class for me would be one where the main source of information was a lecture but then the grade would be coming from a test.  The test could be open-ended with short answer or essay sections to avoid the rote memorization problem, but having the grade come from a distinct test was the best for me.",

If it's busn 101, marketing, or Branding or Retail strategies, then I would love it. \n\nIn general, I agree with many others in that I enjoy classes like this. In my Branding or Retail strategies class, our final was a project we worked all semester on about rebranding some small businesses that the teacher introduced us to and create products for them. In my negotiation class, there was no test. Just grades based on negotiation where you can get full points for 95% of the class by preparing to negotiate, roleplaying, and writing a reflection on it. Socratic seminars were annoying to do when most of the class didn't read through the assignment but it works too. These were way better and a bit more fun than tests.",

      "text": "Over my years textbooks are rarely ever worth the cost because of how limited the course is often on in cover them thoroughly. At most you utilize a few chapters out of the dozen or so and even then the course often can only go through so much. Plus information is plentiful with internet access it's really not an excuse to say textbooks are better in these days.\n\nIt's hard to say depends on the execution as I can understand the hesitation if there isn't reference material directly correlating with the course for those struggling. While saying you provide recommendations that's very much not the same since it would take effort in looking for specifics in the same topic being taught and if someone is already confused they might not know what to look for. Along with they could go through the wrong path in trying to learn a concept.\n\nI prefer projects overall, but that's the style for my major as exams and test don't really make sense for more theoretical work or are abstract.",

When they do, they typically list which editions are okay so you can have a higher chance of buying used. This makes life a hundred times easier.\n\nThere are too many readings to expect students to subscribe to a hundred journals to access, so readings are shared.\n\nThe only exceptions are business school professors, because they tend to sell their own books and homework as well as in one case, charge for tests. I haven't taken too many bizz courses though so it could just have been the ones I had. That stung, paying a prof $50 for him to print econ probs on printer paper, lol.\n\nI def prefer papers and projects over exams. They give you an opportunity to get feedback and improve- plus most 'real world jobs' are going to be closer to working on projects and papers than exams. \n\nEdit: just remembered, some cases I guess exams are sensible- like esp in environ science where careers will require mass memorization of thousands of species, concepts, soil types, etc.",

I speak up during nearly every class lecture with relevant info, always read the readings, make the forum posts, and take the lead on group projects - and somehow the participation grade is always, *always* what brings my grade down.

I much prefer courses that don't have exams but projects or essays like yours.\n\nHowever, I personally love having textbook options so I don't have to go searching everywhere for a source if my understanding of a certain topic is lacking, if that makes sense. Textbooks give me a sense of comfort of knowing where to look if I need extra info.",

In practice that meant that only about 20% of class time was actually providing me with any learning and it was so spaced out that there's a good chance I would get distracted during the downtime and miss the actually helpful part, too.\n\nThat in mind, textbooks saved my life by letting me cover the material outside of class at my own speed. Your method sounds great, but be sure your recommended reading isn't missing any crucial information that's only covered in lectures. Everyone learns differently and for some folks a textbook is a valuable resource and shouldn't be removed unless it's replaced with other, equally comprehensive resources.",

To me, it shows you're more dedicated to helping students learn than following an outline of how most teach. \n\nThe professors (thank God it's been multiple) I've had that have been willing to be conversational and fuel discussions in their class are easily the best Ive had. It actually feeds the students souls instead of forcing us to burn them as we try to force our way through pounds of reading, assignments, and tests. The latter stuff ends up all feeling the same eventually and tends to lose meaning. It's a great way to make students not care. Of course, I'm not saying don't do any of it... But try not to standardize. \n\nI had a philosophy professor that did his tests orally. He presented the material in the same way and order he taught them and would give contextual information to help students remember. Easily the best form of testing I have run into. \n\nYou've got to realize: it's not often that students just don't want to talk- it's that students just don't want to engage in the way they are being forced to engage. \n\nThank you!!

One could argue that it helps keep morale up high and as a result, learning goes up too. \n\nHowever, as much as I hate this and am forcing myself to say this, books and testing are majorly necessary.\n\nTesting is a good tool to cram information into somebody. This applies mainly to stuff with numbers (like bussiness) as it enforces a practice = improvement mindset. History and theory can be debated as it just makes you barf information and the learning part is proportionate to how much a student enjoys a subject/class. \n\nBooks however are relative. If you give out all the information necessary, then books are not required. Howrver, if you give a PowerPoint with 11 slides to cover a chapter, then yes you need a boom because that doesn't go deep enough and will cause you to fail _(cough my physics 2 class cough)_.\n\nIn my humble opinion, business should have at least tests as it helps students actually worry for your class and retain some knowledge. Could be simple tests, don't have to be complex. Just something high school level to make sure they understand their fundamentals. \n\nNot be fricking engineering tests where they teach you a couple of things and in the test the exercises are stupidly creative to the point where you're better off being told to screw off.",

As for textbooks, i'd be fine with them not required for the class and there being no required readings, but I do appreciate it when professors take the time to outline where things in the book line up with class, because sometimes it's hard to figure out. It's really helpful when I'm lost in class or missed class from being sick, even when there's no requirement to read.",

      "text": "I loved professors who didn't do textbooks, since I couldn't really comfortably pay for them. Honestly, I usually just didn't buy the textbook and was mostly fine with the lectures and presentations.\n\nThe test thing is probably *better* according to research, but the fact that it's new and weird for students might take them by surprise. Still, not having any way to double-check if the students are engaging with the material isn't how I do my classes, at least.\n\nWhile classic A-through-E dry tests aren't something I advocate for, there has to be *a way* to tell your students are learning the basics of your course as opposed to just enjoying your presence. Your class can be a really fun place to be at, but if it's just because the student knows they get to relax, then you're not actually teaching anything.\n\nI usually end up doing end of term papers that are only completable if the student has understood some of the class. As in, it requires them to have a basis on the material that they wouldn't have if they didn't pay attention at all. This way they get to not have any classic homework and they get to not have to read all the material, but they *have* to stay engaged in class and ask me questions. \n\nUltimately, I would say it's more worthwhile making sure the student can recontextualize absorbed knowledge as opposed to minutely repeat it back at a piece of paper. No tests mean you need somewhere else to make that happen.",

Consider a supplementary textbook. Make sure students enrolled in your class know months ahead of time it is not necessary to purchase the textbook. This will allow the students who want to do more readings (and any upper-year courses that are in the similar department) are able to.\n3. If you can, do as little group-work as possible. If you must do group work, make it only necessary for in-class seminars/tutorials/workshops etc. Many reasons I am against group work for schoolwork. Coordinating between large groups of students is damn-near impossible. Also, the caliber of work expected between students never matches, and you end up with good students who get poor grades and poor students with decent grades as a result. I don\u2019t want to help someone get a degree they don\u2019t deserve.\n4. Make your expectations very clear from the beginning. Make sure students have the syllabus from day 1, as well as supplementary documents giving expectations and instructions for each assignment/project. The more clear you are, the less emails you will receive from confused students.\n\nIf you do these, you will continue to set your students up for success. It\u2019s refreshing to see a professor doing so many of these things already and to see one who is clearly invested in the student. Best of luck in your career.\n\nOptional 5. Consider optional assignments. I\u2019ve had one professor give the option where you can do 3 extra mini papers, or not, and the only penalty of not doing them is that the final exam is weighted slightly more. Or, maybe give an option of a paper or a final test. It would be a challenge to make sure you balance this out in a fair manner, but if you could accomplish this, I can\u2019t see many students complaining.",

It takes surprisingly few days of this system to cover a topic and leaves most of the class time open to questions, example problems, labs, homework assistance, or whatever else.
