Plus A\u2019s aren\u2019t everything in college, but if you feel like you don\u2019t have enough time to study, you could ask your work if they offer temporary academic leave or something",

      "text": "It depends on how many classes you take. I worked full time and got an A in all the Calcs I took (1 through 3) BUT I also only took Calc, no other classes, for that semester. If you're working part time with a small course load, say, 12 credit hours or less, and Calc 2 is your only hard class, and you're working part time? You might be able to get an A just fine.",
