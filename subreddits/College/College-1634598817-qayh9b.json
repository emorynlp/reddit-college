  "text": "When comparing living in a dorm vs an apartment, what needs to be taken into consideration aside from rent, utilities and the legal aspects of the lease? Any advice on the benefits or pitfalls either way?\n\nMy son currently pays just under $12K to live in the dorm with the meal plan, and has the opportunity to live in an apartment next year for about $7K not including his utilities or food.\n\nThank you for any insight!\n\nEDIT:  Thank you all for your great suggestions!",

      "text": "Where the apartment is located. The traffic might might make him have to wake up way earlier for school and work. He can just take a quick nap or grab homework he forgot way faster if he's on campus. That said if covid gets really bad again he might be left with little notice before they kick him out. Other situations could also really affect people living on campus with boiling water advisory, Internet outage, no parking, no privacy or separation of school from the rest of his life. Personally, I stayed in the dorms my first year and it sucked and the rest of the time I've been staying in an Airbnb. They have discounts for longer stays and the contracts can be as long or short as you need them. Plus I don't have to pay utilities and it's furnished.",

          "text": "Airbnb can be really good depending on the city. I've seen cities with crazy good deals, most of them being outside the US but you can potentially still find domestic bargains.\n\nWith getting kicked out of the dorm, that's something you need to consider when reading the lease (housing agreement is what they'll call their lease, it's basically the same thing but very tenant hostile). Does it include a clause about COVID and refunds? A lot of universities got sued for breaking their housing contracts, they weren't refunding money for services not rendered, and many have since updated their agreements to shift risk onto the student. That being said, I personally doubt it will happen again seeing the direction most countries are going.",

      "text": "Parking at the apartment. Differences of parking passes for campus for on vs. off campus. Look into laundry at an off campus apartment and the cost differences (ie. Quarters or not). Many off campus places will have security deposits, also may have application fees and \u2018activity fees\u2019 so consider those. Also dorms will be furnished most (but not all) off campus apartments are unfurnished, so you need to evaluate furniture. If it\u2019s an unfurnished apartment will he take his furniture from home and how expensive will that be or will you be buying new/used furniture just for the college apartment. Also dorms have meal plans where you usually don\u2019t have to cook. Off campus you can buy a meal plan but will likely cook some or all meals. You\u2019ll need pots and pans, and a will to cook vs. convenience of campus dining",

      "text": "The specific costs depend a lot on\u2026 well, the specifics. It completely depends on how much he would spend on average in utilities, food, personal items, etc. and that depends also on the area.\n\nLike, I pay utilities monthly split 4 ways that comes to about (* ETA: in case it\u2019s not clear, this is 1/4 total utility expense) $15 for internet, $40-50 for gas and electric, and then every other month it\u2019s like $60 for water. But I\u2019m in a room in a house, and an apartment would I assume be using less.\n\nI spend like $150-200 on food a month, but I also have food stamps to take care of that for me thankfully. But I also don\u2019t have parents to help me out if something else takes more $ from my pocket in another area (let\u2019s say for example my car battery decides to die today, I\u2019m out like $120-200 ish). So there\u2019s budgeting and planning max spending limits that needs to be done on his part.\n\nAlso important is how many people will be living in this apartment and if he can put up with them. Some housemates are hard to deal with and you can\u2019t just go to an RA and request a room change, you\u2019d need to stick it out till the lease is up and search yourself for a new place- which is a part time job in and of itself! Sometimes you get duds, especially when it comes to last minute housing search (I usu rec like 2-3 months before move-in to start looking, and lock in a month before classes actually begin).\n\nCommute time and costs are also a big part to consider. For example, I was renting a room close enough to walk to campus, but even though I was saving on gas and maintenance I hated walking the location because of getting harassed by homeless people, plus walking while carrying my heavy backpack sucked on my back. I moved a little further away but within a short driving distance, and I\u2019m much happier even though it costs a bit more. In my situation it made more sense to live further from campus for my sake.\n\nIf he really likes living on campus and money isn\u2019t really a big deal, living on campus can be worth it for the extra money. If it\u2019s a matter of needing a little wiggle room in the budget, it\u2019s worth it to save the money and just deal with the extra commute and expenses that require more effort of personally tracking. BUT if the expenses end up being the same or more than living on campus, might as well just live there.\n\nSincerely, a 28 year old lady that\u2019s been there done that and will finally be graduating at 30!",

      "text": "Maybe you guys should crunch numbers exactly how much he could expect to spend cause some people spend like 30 bucks on groceries a week some people can get away with 15 some people spend a 120 depending on what their dietary restrictions are... Also maybe have your son talk to some upper classmen that live off campus near the University and find out exactly what their utility costs usually run in that area electricity and electricity and water depending on where they are if they have a private water source can be kind of expensive in addition to anything else he needs utility wise like heat if it's gas.... Is in addition to all of that if he gets free laundry services on campus which is a rarity you would need to calculate that as well if he needs to start going to a laundromat if the apartment doesn't have laundry facilities in the unit... In addition to transportation costs and things like toilet paper and the paper and hot water expenses.... So maybe have your son talk to some of the upper classmen at his University gauge what their standard expenses are and in general it's really a good idea to if you get an apartment to get one with a couple roommates we're mates have your own room that kind of thing but to share expenses it can be cheaper",

      "text": "It\u2019s truly a matter of personal preference however I found it much less stressful living in a dorm than living on my own. \nWhen I was my own it was the added cost of the broker\u2019s fees, renters insurance, setting up a wifi connection, groceries, utility bills, general rowdy neighbors (unregulated, on campus people follow rules more). If there\u2019s any issues with the apartment, universities will send people to fix it for free whereas you\u2019ll have to look for someone on your own if you don\u2019t live on campus. \nI found the cost of being in an apartment only slightly less than being on campus but I\u2019m just so much more relaxed now. I also don\u2019t have to worry about being far away from classes, friends and people my age.\nI also found it a bit more stressful trying to manage an apartment on my own + my studies side by side, but again it\u2019s just personal preference.",
