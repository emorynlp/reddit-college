Campus was basically dead.\n\nIt was quite nice actually, I'm a loner by nature and enjoyed the peace and quiet. I talked to maybe one or two people total in all my classes. And my class size was tiny, about 2-5 people a class.\n\nBut this semester the campus is absolutely buzzing with people and activity. I've had multiple guys stop me and compliment me on what I'm wearing, people will say \"good morning\" or otherwise greet each other, and generally are a lot friendlier and more social than last semesters. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it just due to lack of social connection for the past year?", "author": "depressedstudent25", "created": 1632494673, "retrieved": 1632800362, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"he5b3nt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pulags/are_people_being_more_friendly_this_year/he5b3nt/", "text": "this is such a crazy coincidence my ethics prof was talking about this today. he said that this is the first year where his students are thanking him for class and wishing him a good day/weekend (MWF class). i think people are being nicer after being isolated for a year", "author": "EdelwoodOil", "created": 1632521987, "upvotes": 1}, "he3y3q3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pulags/are_people_being_more_friendly_this_year/he3y3q3/", "text": "Not in my experience.
