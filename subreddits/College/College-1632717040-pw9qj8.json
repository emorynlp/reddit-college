My plan was to go abroad for about a year and then return for grad school (hopefully UCB) but I graduated June 2020 and was unable to due to covid. I thought it this wouldnt last very long, so I went to stay with my BF in TN until I could leave. I forwarded my mail to TN and changed my mailing address on some things, but I did my taxes in CA because I was recieving unemployment through CA. I don't really feel like I am a TN resident at all. My only job has been remote tutoring and I dont really have roots here. I am not even sure if I could establish residency here if I wanted to. Not sure if it is worth noting, but I was also in MT for part of this time, about three months. I do have a friend's house that I still get mail at sometimes, if that helps. She has my old car so I get stuff from the DMV sent there occasionally, but they're selling it soon. She or my grandma will also let me use their address for mail, but I dont know if that that will help.\n\nI will be so sad if I lose my residency. Ca is so expensive and I had moved away for that reason at 17 but I moved back in spite of the cost so that I could go to school here. Moving to TN didn't really feel like a choice, my plans just fell apart because of covid and it was always meant to be temporary. Any advice or answers would be really appreciated!", "author": "smolpepper", "created": 1632717040, "retrieved": 1632945814, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hegesel": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw9qj8/will_i_lose_residency_if_i_go_abroad/hegesel/", "text": "It sounds like you need to figure out if you even have California residency now.
