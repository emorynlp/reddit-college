  "text": "Okay, I'll have to start by saying I've always been one of THOSE students. Always focused on school and a generally good learner. I currently have a 3.95 GPA. But I'm pretty sure that's about to change... I have a class this semester that just hasn't been going according to plan. All my other classes are 90s and this one... well.... if I try hard enough for the next 2 weeks I MIGHT get a 70...    but honestly... I don't understand a BIG PART OF IT and really...  I don't want to try anymore. I kind of want to fail so I can retake it next semester and take the time to focus on the things I don't understand.  This is a prereq class (also a stats course) so the class I currently have for next semester builds on this one. I don't want to start next semesters class not understanding shit and going through the same thing I'm going through this semester.... \n\n\nMy worries: \n\nHow BAD could  failing one class effect my FASFA?\n\nShould I even push at this point??? \n > just let myself take the failing grade now and focus on my other classes for the next 2 weeks\nOR\n>keep pushing for that possible 70?\n\nNow, I have just now learned to accept that failing is a possible outcome. For the last 3 weeks I've been stressing so bad I've been making myself physically ill. I've come to accept it and it's gone down a lot but I just don't know what to do at this point",

Retake it next semester and actually grasp the information needed for the follow up class.",
