  "text": "Im currently enrolled in college as a sophomore and I am not having the best time. Im unmotivated and have no idea what i want to do with my future at this point. I have considered applying to my colleges engineering program because i am interested in that and think i could do well. However, i am considering taking this upcoming semester off to have a major back surgery that i need to have. Will taking a semester off affect my chances or getting into the engineering college? Should i take a semester off to refocus myself?",
