  "text": "Well, I have been spending too much money on outside food, just because I have no privacy at my home, and it's really bothersome to cook without my Mother yelling at me, or someone interrupting me. Excuses aside, it's just a huge inconvenience at my home, also I have been super lazy getting up and my only option to avoid not missing class is to Lyft, and as a result I have spent almost 200$ on that alone, and I'm slowly starting to realize I'll be penniless at this rate. Any tips on how I can get my act together, and avoid the urge to eat at like Chick Fil a when I can save up. I am also looking for a job on campus at my university but it's a long process, however I'll get to that! Insight?",
