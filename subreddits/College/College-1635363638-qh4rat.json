  "text": "Hi. I am a freshman at a CC who is majoring in comp sci and minoring in psych. I joined a CC first because the end of my highschool grades got really bad and CC was a way for me to start over.\n\nI am taking 4 classes and working and in the 3 classes, I am confident in except for calc. I deal with intense anxienty at school, and I believe I unconsciously self-sabotaged and it might be too late to resurrect my grade.\n\nI am greatly considering a W but I am terrified when I transfer schools will take that into account. I began CC to start over and do well but now I feel like a failure. On top of that, on my other CC transcript when I was in high school, I got a 'EW' because when transitioning online during covid, I was having techniquel  difficulties and the school DID NOT RESPOND!  (The other 2 classes I took were As).\n\nI am thinking of transferring to UCs as well as small liberal arts colleges, and some want my high school grades and \\*all transcripts\\*, so including my EW. \n\nI also read on my school's site that getting a W will affect financial aid and I am no longer making \"satisfactory progress\"??! Does that strip away my chances of all different scholarships for the rest of my undergraduate career?? I kind of needed them. HELP",
