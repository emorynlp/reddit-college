  "text": "I am in my second year of college and decided to change my major I have no idea what I want to do though so I\u2019m just going through. A lot of people tell me it\u2019s okay to not know but I just feel like I\u2019m wasting my time luckily I\u2019m California they give two years free in community college so that\u2019s really helping me out. I was wondering if anyone has went through the same thing and how did you guys overcome that obstacle?",
