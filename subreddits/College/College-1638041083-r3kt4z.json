  "text": "In Michigan covid cases are at an all time high. 2 of my friends have covid, and they also know several people with covid. My office made us come back in person and my school hasn\u2019t talked about shutting down. I\u2019m vaccinated, but I\u2019m still really nervous. The long term effects of covid terrify me. I can\u2019t believe my school just doesn\u2019t care.",
