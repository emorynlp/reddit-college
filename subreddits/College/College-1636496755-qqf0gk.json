  "text": "Hello there.\nI am a student in the first year of college for a month and as I have noticed, it started to feel repetitive and also boring as the time goes on.\nMeanwhile, I am kinda losing motivation to note what\u2019s important in the course and seminary, relying on my printer to do most, if not, all of the things teacher wrote for us.\nThe worst part is that I am attending it remotely, due to pandemic, which means that the experience isn\u2019t going to be awesome as most say about college.\nMidterms are approaching by December on certain classes I attend and the exams, on February. (midterm is used to lower the workload needed for February exams)\n\nWhat should I do in this case? I am aspiring to become a software engineer or an entrepreneur at some point in my life, but how do I become one if I feel tired and unmotivated after a while of repetitiveness?",

      "text": "College is less about *what* you learn, and more about jumping through hoops to prove that you are able and willing to jump through hoops.\n\nThe best thing I can say is: you gotta \"pay your dues\". You have to pass your classes to get your degree.\n\nThe alternative (specially with software engineering) is to learn any and all languages on your own, pass the certifications on them to get a job that route instead of college. The downside of this, is that you won't be guided by professors, and your learning will likely be one-sided without humanities/art/english/etc, which all can help with interpersonal relationships at work and/or when trying to be an entrepreneur.\n\nYou also have to consider that compared to high school, each individual class is a independent. Your english 120 professor doesn't know or care if you are taking 6, 12 or 20 units, so they are going to end up repeating a lot of the same information that you hear in all the other classes. Of course, everything being online/remote is absolutely going to suck; you're stuck in the same room all day. My suggestions is to force yourself to change settings if possible. Maybe you make yourself take your english class in your room, the math class in the living room, and the humanity at starbucks. Force yourself to hand-write the stuff instead of just printing it, to give yourself some sort of interaction that will help you remember the material.\n\nHopefully by next year (spring 22?) physical classes will return and you'll get the experience you're looking for.",
