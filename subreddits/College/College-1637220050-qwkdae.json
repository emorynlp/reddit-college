  "text": "I heard about some folks in the past who got caught cheating because they signed up for a class and then they had one of their friends send them all of the coursework for them to start it early, which I thought was stupid, outside of the cheating of course. Y'all know that you can just ask the professor to sort of do that for you right? Most of the time if you're just curious about a subject or a course they will be happy to send a copy of their last semester's course syllabus (not the assignments though, obviously). And then from there you can delve a bit into the subject and then decide if it's a course that you feel interests you or not. So for example maybe out of three courses you don't know which one to choose to fill up a semester, or you want to take a 3-week winter class and want to have an understanding of the workload to be expected: Do this. \n\nJust a thought.",
