Some courses are EDX, where you will receive something called \u201cverified certification\u201d, basically a signature from the professor/some other credibility as well (I believe). The thing that I do not know is if the EDX courses can just be the \u201cproof of certification\u201d scenario where you don\u2019t pay, since I think you will be limited to the studies given to you along with the assessments. Someone in the Reddit who has experienced taking CS50 said that in that particular class, you can choose either edx (verified certification) or proof of certification. I personally believe that not all the courses for EDX can be done in the section of just a \u201cproof of certification\u201d, which is free. \n\nPerhaps someone can answer that?\n\nEDX is $99 (verified certification)\n\nThe free one is (proof of certification).\n\nWhen checking the classes, you can see if it says take EDX, meaning you pay $99, or you can take it and study it without the assessments (or if I\u2019m wrong, limited assessment)\n\nOnce again, if anyone can answer if I\u2019m wrong in any particular area of this comment, let me know.\n\nThe good news is some courses are free and you can get proof of certification. I hope I helped in any way",
