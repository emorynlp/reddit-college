  "text": "I plan on bringing my gaming pc and my second monitor up to school with me (along with my razer keyboard and mouse). I already have my ps4 and a monitor here with me. I don't plan on playing on it a whole lot (maybe once in a while), I mostly just want it here since it has a lot of stuff on it that I can't get on my laptop due to storage space. Is it safe in a dorm (suite housing)?",

A PC with shit hooked up to it isn\u2019t exactly easy to steal quickly, and it\u2019s likely to be password locked. It would be easy for other people to spot \u201cHey, what are you doing with so and so\u2019s PC?\u201d\n\nOTOH, my roommate and I had probably 2k in camera shit, printers, PS3s, Xbox one, and 3 computers between the two of us. We never had any issues and generally had people in and out frequently. Another guy on our floor had a REAL expensive gaming rig he left pretty open that nobody ever touched.\n\nHell, when I first got to school there were EIGHT of us living in a lounge, and the Saudi kid had a pretty baller laptop that he just left out.",

The university I work for (same one mentioned above) has a very strict firewall. I remember not being able to play GTA Online on my Xbox when it came out because, for whatever reason, my university would not allow the Rockstar servers to connect to my Xbox through the firewall.

      "text": "How far from home is college? If it's in the realm of 1-3 hours away from home, then no: I would leave it home. I take 2 hours from home to college or vice versa without a car (that I don't have), so for example my Fender Stratocaster stays in my hometown and I only brought a cheap guitar and a basic amp to plug headphones into to my apartment to minimize risks. Unless you need the processing power for schoolwork, in which case, do bring it. If home is like 1 hour away pff leave the nice computer there.\n\nIf you can lock the door to your room, problem solved. I always lock my roommate's room when I have people over (he has an expensive gaming pc and I am not taking any chances, in case we get too drunk or something). If you can't lock the door to your room, consider your environment. How often do you have people over? To do what? What kind of people? What's the crime rate on campus and in that city?\n\nI personally don't pay any special measures because my machine is a budget laptop from 2-3 years ago, but I would pay at least some attention to protecting your expensive machine.\n\nOther things that I would suggest looking into are:\n\n* Surge protection. You don't know how electricity is at your college, you don't want to plug your PSU straight into it.\n* Invest in one of those anti-theft locks to prevent your expensive computer (and keyboard etc if possible) from being removed from your desk if you are really paranoid. I personally cannot be bothered and trust the people I invite to my room.\n* Make sure full-disk encryption is properly set up (Bitlocker on Windows, LUKS on Linux)",

May as well leave it on a dollie for the thief since you guys don't lock doors.\n\nThe worst thing that happens if you buy a trunk and noone tries to steal your shit is you spent $~90 on the trunk and lock. The worst thing that happens if you don't is you lose $??? from the computer and game system. Don't trust people. They're selfish. Don't plan to rely on enforcement either campus or law, because they won't give a damn either. Protect yourself. You're the only one who can. If you don't, you'll get fucked.",

Once I calmed down and got used to visitors and strangers they were all pretty honest and on the level.\n\nIf you're super bothered there are some tactics:\n\n\\- Hook up obvious security cameras in your room (make sure it's backing up to cloud or something so destroying it won't mean shit).  I spent \u00a330 on a camera for our kitchen window that I could hook into from my phone at work if movement was detected).  Even a fake camera is a good deterrant.  \n\\- Don't brag about what you've got or make it obvious e.g. (pc in a cupboard with a door that shuts or a non-fancy case).\n\n\\-- Make sure the security on your computer is sound (I'm not sure how technical you are, but drive encryption, boot up passwords that sort of thing can increase the security of your data after it has been stolen).\n\n\\- If you can install tracking software/ hardware in your devices that'll really help with insurance/ police investigations in the worst case scenario someone takes them.\n\n\\- Get insurance!  Photo and document your important items share these with the insurance company if they exceed a certain value etc... if you have serial numbers on things like Bike frames etc photo and document that.\n\n\\- Talk to people around you, feel them out they probably just want to get on with you.  Paranoia and fear is only useful in small doses, when it gets out of control it's harmful like stress.\n\n\\-The halls of residence I stayed in were a bit of a fortress (Huddersfield, UK), there was an outer gate into a courtyard that needed a bluetooth fob.  There were doors in the inner courtyard into various blocks that also needed a fob.  Rooms were in clusters that had an outer door, only 4 people had a key for (excluding security) and then we had a key that got into our individual rooms.  There were cameras everywhere.  You'd have to get through 2 fob doors and 2 key doors to get to my room (which was up 7 flights of stairs).  It was probably way safer than my house I live in now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBe mindful at uni, people will take the piss, but don't let paranoia get unhealthy and drive you mad.  Most of all learn, enjoy, explore, experiment ;)",

I work at an electronics trading shop and if we've bought in a stolen item the police can immediately figure out which one it is (of the 30 PS4s etc. we have) by checking the serial numbers and will reclaim it from us. Without the serial number there's not a lot they can do if the person has sold it to a store like mine. \n\nThe serial number will usually be by the barcode and may have S/N: followed by the number. For a phone you will usually want to get the IMEI number instead which you can get by typing in \\*#06\\* as if you're going to call someone (it'll be IMEI1 for newer phones).

Most know not to touch things that aren't theirs, and if not, you can always tell them you prefer them not to touch it. I've never had a problem with stealing, and I leave my door open even when I use the bathroom and such. Depends on how comfortable you feel with those coming in and out of your space.",

Gaming pc's did occasionally go missing at my school and they wouldn't take an Xbox that was much more accessible.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't risk it. Try to get some of the security cables/keep it locked up whenever you're not there. Yes, someone can still get in but it's a deterrent and you will feel better.\n\nIt'll cost maybe $50, more like $30 for locks and the cable. I think the peace of mind would certainly be worth it. Plus, this stuff is reusable for when you move into an apartment.",
