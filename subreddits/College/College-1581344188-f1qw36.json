Once I calmed down and got used to visitors and strangers they were all pretty honest and on the level.\n\nIf you're super bothered there are some tactics:\n\n\\- Hook up obvious security cameras in your room (make sure it's backing up to cloud or something so destroying it won't mean shit).  I spent \u00a330 on a camera for our kitchen window that I could hook into from my phone at work if movement was detected).  Even a fake camera is a good deterrant.  \n\\- Don't brag about what you've got or make it obvious e.g. (pc in a cupboard with a door that shuts or a non-fancy case).\n\n\\-- Make sure the security on your computer is sound (I'm not sure how technical you are, but drive encryption, boot up passwords that sort of thing can increase the security of your data after it has been stolen).\n\n\\- If you can install tracking software/ hardware in your devices that'll really help with insurance/ police investigations in the worst case scenario someone takes them.\n\n\\- Get insurance!  Photo and document your important items share these with the insurance company if they exceed a certain value etc... if you have serial numbers on things like Bike frames etc photo and document that.\n\n\\- Talk to people around you, feel them out they probably just want to get on with you.  Paranoia and fear is only useful in small doses, when it gets out of control it's harmful like stress.\n\n\\-The halls of residence I stayed in were a bit of a fortress (Huddersfield, UK), there was an outer gate into a courtyard that needed a bluetooth fob.  There were doors in the inner courtyard into various blocks that also needed a fob.
