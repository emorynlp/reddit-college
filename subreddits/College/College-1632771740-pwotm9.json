And the background is really short. There's this dorm room on my floor that has a whiteboard on it. Everyone just drops their Snapchat usernames and they can get new friends that way. But this time, they're offering Halloween party invitations and you just have to drop your Snapchat username to get the invitation. So I wrote mine down and now we wait.\n\nI've never actually been to a college party before. I thought those were only a thing at larger colleges. I've heard people say they are one of the best parts of college. So I may as well get that out of the way as soon as I can.\n\nHowever, I'm also a highly introverted individual who has only 2-3 really good friends that I regularly hang out with. So I'm worried I'll regret going if I go through with this and if I back out, I'll see photos of it and wish I had gone. But given that this is a small college, I'm expecting to come across at least one person I know and it will definitely be a more laid-back event.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way before their first college party?", "author": "Some1inreallife", "created": 1632771740, "retrieved": 1632800147, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hej8vph": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotm9/i_might_go_to_a_college_party_for_the_first_time/hej8vph/", "text": "Can you get a friend to go with you?
