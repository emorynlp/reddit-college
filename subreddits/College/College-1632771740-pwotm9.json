And the background is really short. There's this dorm room on my floor that has a whiteboard on it. Everyone just drops their Snapchat usernames and they can get new friends that way. But this time, they're offering Halloween party invitations and you just have to drop your Snapchat username to get the invitation. So I wrote mine down and now we wait.\n\nI've never actually been to a college party before. I thought those were only a thing at larger colleges. I've heard people say they are one of the best parts of college. So I may as well get that out of the way as soon as I can.\n\nHowever, I'm also a highly introverted individual who has only 2-3 really good friends that I regularly hang out with. So I'm worried I'll regret going if I go through with this and if I back out, I'll see photos of it and wish I had gone. But given that this is a small college, I'm expecting to come across at least one person I know and it will definitely be a more laid-back event.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way before their first college party?", "author": "Some1inreallife", "created": 1632771740, "retrieved": 1632945494, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"hemmwyt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotm9/i_might_go_to_a_college_party_for_the_first_time/hemmwyt/", "text": "Nobody cares if you\u2019re vaccinated or not.", "author": "Cult_of_Sly", "created": 1632855134, "upvotes": -2}, "hekrkf5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotm9/i_might_go_to_a_college_party_for_the_first_time/hekrkf5/", "text": "I know it's easier said than done but don't think too much :) If you don't like it at the party, you can leave as soon as you like (I assume) and never look back or even come back the same evening if you were just too scared before. You could also take a break and go outside a little and then walk back in (if it's not a party where you have to buy tickets and get no little thingy to walk out and then back in \ud83d\ude05). Or hide in the bathroom or pretend there's something really important on your phone or something like that. The nice thing is you can do whatever you want! I'm pretty introverted too (don't know if more or less than you of course) and college parties are something I love to remember and wouldn't want to have missed. They can be so much fun! It helped to have friends there though. But I also remember going places alone sometimes, which, too, turned out to be some of the most memorable nights often times! College is a great opportunity to find out what you like and maybe find out new sides of yourself you didn't know before. In school, I wasn't really outgoing but in college, that changed a lot and that was a good change. But that also was kinda thanks to the friends I made there and the creative envinronment (bachelor industrial design). And if you don't like parties, at least you can be sure and not wonder for the rest of your life if you missed something. Hmm, that kinda sounds a little pressuring, so: If it's not this party, it can still be the next one! I'm sure this won't be the only party-opportunity in your college-years, so you don't even have to pressure yourself to go or not go to this particular party. And if you don't like college parties, you can still have a great college-experience having barbecues with your friends or doing college sports and hopefully studying interesting subjects! Or maybe throwing better parties yourself ;) And always remember to be safe and listen to your gut!", "author": "itssnotmeee", "created": 1632822059, "upvotes": 2}, "hej8vph": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwotm9/i_might_go_to_a_college_party_for_the_first_time/hej8vph/", "text": "Can you get a friend to go with you?
