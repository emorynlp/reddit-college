  "title:": "Am I annoying my professor?",
  "text": "I am doing an asynchronous class, and at the beginning my prof was really on top of everything, but lately not so much\u2026 for the last 4 weeks I had problems accessing the course. At least one task is not available or it is put in for the wrong date. I have found that other people in the class really don\u2019t care, they post everything very last minute and I had to reach out twice to the professor to tell him I can\u2019t react to the forum because no one else posted. This week is thanksgiving and as of Tuesday  nothing is available in the course, and the homework is due Thursday. I have messaged him twice last week and my friends told me that I must be annoying to him and trying so hard. I really just want to do my class work and be able to submit it, and it\u2019s frustrating that I have to ask for that, but I also don\u2019t want to be annoying\u2026 I was hoping someone else will message him but it will have to be me again. Do you think I\u2019m annoying him or he appreciates it? ( I never correct grammar or things like that, just let him no that I can\u2019t access schoolwork or that the dates are wrong). He was always very nice about it but my friends swear that he must hate me for being such a know it all",

Keep on keeping on - get through the semester and be mindful of that professor for future courses.",

      "text": "Are you sure there's homework due on Thanksgiving, and you don't just have the week off?\n\nI'm a professor, and I don't get annoyed when a student points out a mistake I've made. I'm typically happy to hear about it as soon as possible, so that I can fix it before it becomes an issue for everyone.\n\nThe one thing that does annoy me is when students email to ask about assignments that haven't been posted yet when we're still within a reasonable timeframe for posting them. For example, if I post the assignment on Tuesdays but not at any particular time, you don't need to email me promptly at 5pm to ask about it; my workdays are longer than that. And you \\*really\\* don't need to email and ask about it if you're not even going to do it until Wednesday afternoon.",

But if I'm randomly changing that time or date, then I *am* dropping the ball somewhere (and not utilizing my time or resources correctly).",
