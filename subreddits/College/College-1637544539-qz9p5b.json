  "text": "Like, staying on campus over break sucks, but like now I\u2019m not sure how to break to my parents that I\u2019m likely not coming home. I also don\u2019t know how to tell my profs I can\u2019t come in without them thinking I\u2019m just gonna skip town or something or that I\u2019m leaving early.\n\nAny advice? I\u2019m kind of just shocked right now and don\u2019t know what to think",

You could send them whatever documentation you have to prove it but that\u2019s probably not needed. \n\nParents probably different, if I was sick over break my parents would probably just be worried that I\u2019m sick and want to send me things.",
