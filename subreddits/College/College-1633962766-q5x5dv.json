  "text": "I am considering asking my professors tomorrow if I can join class via video tomorrow (this is an option due to COVID) and keep my video off.\n\nI started antibiotics for strep throat last Friday. While my sore throat/fever are gone, I developed an insane face/scalp/hand rash that I am still waiting on blood test results to tell me wtf is going on and if it is an autoimmune disorder (my grandfather died of leukymia, my dad has a different autoimmune disorder).\n\nSo even though I feel better, my face feels like it is on fire and looks like I have a chemical burn. My fingers are hardening up and numb. It's super embarassing and I would like another day to let this go away.",

If it will impede on your or your classmate\u2019s abilities to learn comfortably or safely, you\u2019re better of staying at home until you feel better. If your profs don\u2019t understand that, you should be able to take it to your health center and/or your college Dean\u2019s office.",

You can\u2019t learn in a social environment when you\u2019re not comfortable being with others; also, emotional safety is something my prof hammers into us regularly\u2014if you\u2019re in a situation that compromises your mental and emotional well-being, you have every right to remove yourself from said situation. Of course, you may have a different threshold for dealing with ailments/etc, so I won\u2019t try to speak for you; this is just my advice (that, quite frankly, I wish I\u2019d have taken in the past instead of pushing myself too hard) :) I hope your situation improves regardless of what you choose to do, mate!",
