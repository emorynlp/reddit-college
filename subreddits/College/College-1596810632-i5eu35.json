  "title:": "My college just said all campus facilities will be closed, and off campus students are discouraged from using their apartments",
  "text": "I have a lease for this upcoming school year, now all campus facilities shut down meaning I won\u2019t have a job and little reason to even be there\n\nSo my school just announced that instead of running a hybrid model and having campus facilities open everything will be remote, and there will be no access to dining halls or any campus facilities. This leaves me with little reason to go to my college town. I\u2019m really lost on what I should do regarding my lease, as it feels like a huge waste of money paying 700+ each month for a place I don\u2019t even need. The place does allow subletting, and I think my roommate is still staying. Any advice on what I should do?",

At my school, nearly everyone besides freshman lives in student apartments unaffiliated with apartments. Regardless if classes are in person or not, asking a kid to pay $800 a month and not live there and have fun is unrealistic. It almost seems moot if classes are in person or online, if kids have apartments they have to pay for they will go.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to break student leases where I go to school, and who's going to sublet knowing classes will be online?",

I\u2019m a senior so my class sizes may be small enough, but some other classes tend to have like 600 people and I don\u2019t see any way of doing that non-remotely.",

I understand Canada is having some of its own struggles with reopening and you guys are directly impacted/influenced by how poorly we're handling it.\n\nI disagree with your last paragraph. There is definitely a safe way to reopen schools at partial capacity. Online. Anything short of that will come with risks.\n\nAside from a few select labs, every thing can be done remotely. In 2015, I took a zoology course with 5 dissections remotely.  The specimens and tools were a part of the supply cost.  Same thing with Botany in 2016. That's 4 & 5 years ago.  The software for virtual Bio labs today is incredible today.  Using layered digital models, there's no real need for physical specimens. Some higher physics and chem labs definitely need to be in person, risk can be mitigated with minimal class sizes.",

I don\u2019t see any way in which my classes couldn\u2019t work online, which is the same for a lot of jobs tbh. I\u2019m not in science but I also agree that digital labs are a good solution.
