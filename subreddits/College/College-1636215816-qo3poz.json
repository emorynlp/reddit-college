  "text": "First 4 years of my high school I basically had no one I'd call a friend, it was more like forced business partners; I let them copy my quiz and homework and do them favors and they do me favors like letting me copy homework I forgot to make (I have ADHD so it was somewhat helpful, but I think I could've done without that relationship and survive). It was in senior high where I made who I'd call friends somewhat but COVID ended it early. \n\nNow I'm in college and people just offer to do favors without being friends? It's kind of surreal and it actually makes me quite anxious; three days ago I just declined someone offering to let me copy their homework because the teacher forgot to send me the link and I'm making it past the deadline. This is the second time someone offered me answers.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How kind are college classmates supposed to be? Can someone give me an idea on how much kindness I could expect?\n\n2. Can I always simplify a function before taking its derivative?\n\n3. Does someone have a guide on how to simplify functions?",

As I have got older I realize there are some people who are just nice people with no alterior motives.  They are great people to get to know. These people are not many but they have become my closest friends due to their innate goodness.  I personally would decline the offer to copy the homework but perhaps ask if next time you could study with them",
