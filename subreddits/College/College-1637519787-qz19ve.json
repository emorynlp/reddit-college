  "title:": "Starting To Get Somewhat Frustrated. Any Advice?",
  "text": "So with the semester winding down, I am starting to get a little frustrated with college. There are just a lot of things from dorms to meals to classes that are really started to just take a toll on me. I am still gonna finish strong and still go the next semester, but I just feel more and more out of it. I love finance and really want to go into that field and manage money, but I am just not happy with the 'college experience'. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. <3",

Set your priorities where you want them and ask yourself if you're in it for the experience itself or the outcome of having a degree? You can have both... but don't do something you will regret in the future.",
