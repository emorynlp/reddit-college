  "text": "So basically, I am a student at a public state university. I came into college as a homeschooled student with practically no STEM education (we're talking a VERY elite SAT English score coupled with a very bad SAT math score) and the intention to major in linguistics and Arabic. In my first year, I took one gen ed in neuroscience which is known for being one of the hardest gen eds at my university, paralleled by just a few other science options besides one astronomy course. I fell in love with it and spent all my free time studying cognitive neuroscience. I did very very well, got to know the professor very well (he still likes my tweets and we chat on campus!), and realized that I LOVE neuro. So I added a major.\n\nNow here's the problem\n\nI am seriously struggling in my prereqs for this major. In my first semester, I took 24 credit hours including graduate-level courses and got a 4.0. In my second semester, I did the same thing. I also took advanced linguistics and Arabic courses over the summer and excelled too. But ALGEBRA? Just plain algebra- I got a C. I'm currently in gen chem and microbiology and getting what keeps fluctuating between a B and a C in both of them. I'm not entirely sure whether I am low intelligence or if it is simply the fact that, again, I did not take these subjects in elementary, middle, or high school and it is all new to me.\n\nFortunately, my university is THE place for linguistics right now, so they offer a track in the neuro program that is rooted in mostly cognitive science and even neurolinguistics. Because I have taken so many courses in cognitive neuro and neurolinguistics now, I'm actually well on my way through the major, mainly just needing a few courses on tracking pathology, neurophysiology, cognitive neuro, etc and then I'm all done. Looking at the quizlets, it seems like I can pull these future classes off. But I also have to take physics and calc, which is freaking me out.\n\nPeople who know me and don't know about the Bs and Cs seem to think I'll be competitive for grad school. Indeed, I'm almost done with my linguistics and Arabic courses already, have worked with some pretty big names (I helped host an event with a\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\*cough\\* among-most-cited-scholars-of-all-time, household name-level person). I have every linguistics prof and many neuro profs in my department following me on twitter or linkedin, I have a lab position, I do lots of EEG work and will published as a coauthor in the next year or so, and will be doing an honors thesis. My recs will be GOOD, and my interests are NICHE, so I'm hoping this will make me competitive. I have one prof at an overseas university we have read a lot about in my classes, and i'd love to work under him for grad school... now we are friends on linkedin. So I think most of my application will be nice. I also calculated- if I get Cs in bio and chem this semester, my GPA will be above 3.75 still, so not bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT WHAT IF GRAD SCHOOLS SEE THAT I STRUGGLE WITH BASIC MATH, CHEM, AND BIO AND REJECT ME? What if they're like \"wow yeah she can do all this stuff but does she KNOW WHAT DIPOLE MOMENT IS??? This girl cannot do freshman-level work.\" and then reject me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't even struggle with the concepts. I have been called a \"top student\" in my chem lab, I get perfect or near perfect scores on research projects and quizzes. I could explain concepts to another student- people sometimes even ask me for help. But then the exams are all like. 20 questions, all of which are trick questions and deliberately designed to be difficult. I wasn't raised on exams like this, as most people were, and I get very confused and then get Ds on exams, bringing otherwise fabulous grades due to lab work, homework, etc alllllll the way down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do? Will this affect anything? It's so frustrating to feel very close to cutting-edge research and then also struggle in \"freshman\" classes. It's my own fault, I need to learn better study skills I think, and I'm working very very hard to do better. I just simply do not know where to go from here, and I am very very concerned about taking physics next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I'm not cut out for hard STEM. The easy option would be to drop neuro and graduate with a higher GPA. But life is too short- if I don't explore neuro now, even if I'm not very smart when it comes to science, I just KNOW I will regret it in 30 years and spend all my time reading scientific papers about neuro anyway, so I MUST try my best to keep going.",
