  "title:": "Unexcused absence for an oncology appointment",
  "text": "Today I have an appointment with my oncologist, which I assumed would warrant an excused absence from my accounting class. NOPE! I explained to my prof that I had an appointment with my oncologist, which is IMO enough information. He said he needs more specifics of my appointment and would only grant an excused absence if it is urgent for a sudden medical issue. A non-urgent appt is unexcused. In all of my prof's accounting genius, I don't think I  need to disclose my private health information for him to decide whether I receive an excused absence or not. The very nature of an oncology appointment is not routine. I requested to watch a zoom recording of the lecture, because I have class during his other sections. \n\n I finished my chemo less than a year ago, and the whole purpose of the appointment is to assess my health and see if the cancer is back. Scheduling these appointments is made far in advance, and if I need to reschedule, I would be seen at least a month later. \n\n**I would greatly appreciate it if anybody could provide me with their own perspective or experiences.** \n\nI think he's being an unreasonable jerk but I'm biased.",

I have doctor's appointments all the time and I have never once had to explain anything past \"I have a doctor's appointment on this day and I will be missing class. Please let me know what I will miss that day so I can make sure to stay caught up.\" I get notes from a classmate and that's that. It's not like you are missing class to get a haircut or see a movie. This is not an elective appointment you can change or miss.",
