      "text": "What year in school are you and what are your living location intentions after graduation? I was an out of state student who rarely went home and new I wouldn\u2019t be moving back to the city my parents lived in upon graduation. Because of this it was the best financial decision to take my bedroom furniture from my parents home to my apartment by college. Now I\u2019m in grad school and use the same furniture so I\u2019ve had it with me for the past 4-5 years and only had to pay to drive it up from my parents house. I had a really nice mattress so that was the dealbreaker for me",

      "text": "Whats the thrift store scene in the area your moving to? I know a lot of people who have furnished a (small) place on a rather small budget by thrifting, if you think buying furnished is too expensive (it probably is). And you can bring it right back to another thrift store if you move away with no big loss. I would say the one thing you should get new is a mattress.",
