The best you can do is prove that your brain is bigger than your dick, if you know what I mean? We're all naked underneath, don't let it derail you from the real reason you are at school. The last thing you wanna do is self isolate and eventually feel much worse than when it started. Meditate on confidence and self worth.

You will be required to arrive on time, be attentive, and attend the full session to receive credit for attending, and failure to do so will count as a tardy.\n\nIt would be shitty if a professor decided to start enforcing cameras without it being in the syllabus. The syllabus is a binding agreement with students of the class and straying too far from it could get a professor in trouble with school leadership. But if it's in the syllabus, it's enforceable.",
