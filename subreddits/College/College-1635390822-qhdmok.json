  "text": "I\u2019m not taking about grades or gpa, or anything like that. What I mean is, do they teach completely new stuff in college, or are you supposed to remember stuff from high school? For example, if you\u2019re required to take a math or science course (I have no idea how courses work, so I don\u2019t even know if these are requirements) are you expected to remember the Pythagorean theorem or all of the elements on the periodic table? Is it just a fresh start?",

          "text": "I was going to comment something similar. Yes, pretty much math and English are the two main ones where previous knowledge is expected. Although, English tents to be more flexible due to the fact that sometimes rewriting assignments is permitted by some professors. One can see the errors pointed out in the paper and fix them. Hence, learning. I personally dislike that some math professors won\u2019t go back to refresh some basics, something like order of operation for example. I know this is something that can be seen as extremely simple, but it troubles some students because not everyone remembers. This is especially true for people that have taken gap years. I\u2019m not saying that professors must refresh some basics, but it would be nice if they briefly did.",

In that case, I should have included the information that I did have to take prerequisite math courses (foundation of algebra and intermediate algebra I believe?) before college algebra since I did not pass the placement exam. \n\nBut I don't really feel like the prerequisite courses helped all that much with college algebra? I think I recall everything was brand new to me in the college algebra class, or if it did use things the previous classes used, I had completely forgotten how to do them even though it'd only been one semester since then. \n\nI don't learn well from teachers teaching us material or from videos teaching you how to do problems. How I learned the college algebra was by staring at problems, the steps, and the solution until I could understand how it was done. \n\nThis is also how I passed the GED--I just stared at problems in the textbook until I could understand how it worked. I do think this is probably unconventional. From kindergarten to 9th grade, I did always score above 95% on all math exams I took, so it's possible I am somewhat a math genius. (But on the other hand, I've had people tell me not to consider myself good at math until I've taken calculus or harder math courses, so who knows!)\n\nIn any case, most colleges have tutoring, and there are great resources out there like Khan Academy, so I still would tell OP not to worry too much.",

What ideas you have a knowledge from HS\u2013 find a way to learn it, to remember them like a history of your mind maybe they'll be something you can use or they can be unaffecting but you can always fashion your learning pace of what will be substantial and which have now more weigh (edit) in college.\n\n Also health matters too so take care of yourself while your at attendance to whatever you'll do while in college (this q implies to me that you'll admit in college hahaxx)",
