  "text": "I\u2019m not taking about grades or gpa, or anything like that. What I mean is, do they teach completely new stuff in college, or are you supposed to remember stuff from high school? For example, if you\u2019re required to take a math or science course (I have no idea how courses work, so I don\u2019t even know if these are requirements) are you expected to remember the Pythagorean theorem or all of the elements on the periodic table? Is it just a fresh start?",

If you haven\u2019t taken AP courses to test out of entry level classes there will be some repeats such as bio or English which are GEs. Once you get those out of the way you\u2019ll be learning new concepts for whatever your major is.",

Otherwise most college courses are rehashes of high school courses. For example my Chem 101 was literally high school chem. So it really depends on your major and interests",

Those you've learned in HS are going to be helpful for you and still you'll be learning one after another, its something called banking, what concepts you've previously learned you'll find some of them mentioned or tackled in much in depth but its a matter of maximizing your comprehension and questions about what you're learning so instead of just learning what it is all about, it's to see and experience more truths given than HS education of course. What ideas you have a knowledge from HS\u2013 find a way to learn it, to remember them like a history of your mind maybe they'll be something you can use or they can be unaffecting but you can always fashion your learning pace of what will be substantial and which have now more weigh (edit) in college.\n\n Also health matters too so take care of yourself while your at attendance to whatever you'll do while in college (this q implies to me that you'll admit in college hahaxx)",
