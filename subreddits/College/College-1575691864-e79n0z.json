I think we should also consider how different profs over viewed. \n\nI had a prof who had her physical appearance heavily criticized in her ratings when she taught while pregnant, about how her shape was gross and distracting, etc. Pretty bad stuff. \n\nProfs with foreign accents, people of color, women (esp when they're pregnant or have kids), LGBT people, & any combo of those, tend to suffer in ratings compared to StraightWhiteAmericanMen. \n\nObviously, I don't think this means you should only ever leave bad ratings for the Maximum Privileged Professors, or that you have to positively rate a prof who sucked just bc of their background, but it's good to be a little reflective when we're writing evals I think! \n\nOkay that's my two cents into this Disc Horse. Happy rating & good luck with finals, everyone!",

She made a comment it was probably someone who only show up for one day and written her off as a bad educator because of it. I think you should trust people you deem trustable for their opinions because they won't lie because of their dislike of the professor.

A lot compared to what? Easy compared to what? \n\nJust helps provide some extra data that isn't skewed by emotion, a bad grade, or personal distaste of the professor.",
