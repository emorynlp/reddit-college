My Fall 2020 semester was really hard for me, having gone through a hurricane and that really messed up our house and just having a really rough time mentally. The whole time I was taking classes, I was pretty much miserable. My mental health took a sharp decline as I was in a major that I feel absolutely no passion in whatsoever. Even now, I still don\u2019t even know what I would want to pursue in college. I never really had a career choice that I could see myself working in for the rest of my life. At some points, my mental health was so bad where I was nearly suicidal. Because of this, I did not register for classes in the Spring 2020 semester. I lied to my parents and told them that all of my classes were online, made even more plausible by a certain pandemic. I told myself that I would go back to the fall semester but that did not end up happening. I lied again and told my parents that I\u2019m taking online classes again this semester. I\u2019m tired of lying to my parents and it\u2019s eating away at me that I\u2019ve been lying to them this whole time. I\u2019m so afraid of they\u2019ll react when I do eventually tell them and thats the main reason why I havent told them yet. I need advice on how I should tell them. Thank you.\n\nPS: Just in case anyone asks, I am also working two retail jobs at the moment. My parents have not had to pay out of pocket for any of my classes except the one class I took during the summer, which my dad insisted on paying for. I had scholarship money for my first year then had a loan from FAFSA for the Fall 2020 semester. I do plan on going to school again, but not until Ive decided on an actual career that I have actual interest in, which probably wont be for a long while.", "author": "Simple-March-9966", "created": 1632030589, "retrieved": 1632801478, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdfl3us": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr2azc/i_have_been_lying_to_my_parents_about_me/hdfl3us/", "text": "If you tell them it would be a great relief to you.
