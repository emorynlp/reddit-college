Our school years were cut short, trips were cancelled, and we were *forced* inside all summer. As college students have all faced some sort of hardships during this time that need to be understood\u2014and possibly given some compassion in how you deal with us.\n\nI am now a freshman in college, and it honestly does not feel like it. I sit at home all day, losing the motivation to do anything\u2014especially school. I sit behind a camera and listen to...\n\n**Lecture after**\n\n**Lecture after**\n\n**Lecture...**\n\nIt is getting Exhausting\n\nIn high school, I was never one to procrastinate, but ***now*** it\u2019s normal for me because home was always a place for relaxing, and limited learning. Online classes make me feel like I have all the time in the world to finish assignments, but then I get assigned even more homework in another class. At that point, I get stressed with all the work I have to do that *could* have been finished at an earlier time.\n\nThere are many distractions surrounding us at home and it is hard to block them out. Whether it be our family talking, our pets making noise, or just our minds wandering. It is not easy to keep one\u2019s mind focused on a screen for a whole class period, the mind does start to wander.\n\nThere have been times where I am in a class and **BOOM** I completely blank and I start to think about other things and miss something important that the teacher was talking about. Yes, I had this problem in person-to-person classes too, but *never* as bad as I do now. Teachers are not there to get you back on track, so it is up to you to keep yourself engaged, which is hard when you are on a screen for most of your day and have little to no interaction with fellow classmates or teachers. \n\nTo help us stay engaged small group discussions often can help. This gives us time to talk to our peers we usually don\u2019t get to and hearing other people\u2019s comments can really help to understand a subject.\n\nThis little to no interaction with teachers and fellow classmates is difficult, but it is also hard because I was looking forward to making new friends during college, and now, it seems almost impossible. There\u2019s no time for us to get to know each other, other than when we get put in a breakout room for no more than 20 minutes. Even then, I feel isolated. \n\nWhen you cannot make new friends due to not having the time to get to know each other, life becomes lonely. And loneliness has had a huge effect on my school year, forcing me to shut down at times because I do not know where to go for help when I need it, and I do not want to disturb my friends when they are going through the same things.\n\nWithout the interaction I\u2019m used to, I find it hard to wake up in the morning knowing that I will have to stare at a screen for how many hours of homework I happen to get that night. I feel like my whole life is school now and there is no time for me. I know I am not the only one feeling this way. \n\nMy friends and I have talked about our experiences with online college and most of the opinions were *not* positive. Our lives have become the same routine everyday.\n\n# Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\n#                            Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\n#                                                     Wake up, get online, do homework. \n\nWith all of the screen time everyday that students have, you could give us breaks throughout the lecture and give us time to take a step back and breathe. Time away from the screen is important. \n\nFor me, school is easier to get through when you have friends that are there to help you. Since the start of the fall semester, I have not talked to many of my friends that I used to talk to everyday. \n\nPhysically being at school was *so* much easier because we knew that it was a place to focus and get work done. Now after a long school day, we just close our laptops and *pray* we make it through the semester.\n\nThis is a new experience for all of us. Most students were going to school in person before the pandemic started and now everything is different. It is hard to go through change so fast and sudden. We never expected a pandemic to derail our lives, but it has. \n\nTake the time to think of the way we are feeling and understand that many of us would rather be in person, just like you would.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Stressed Student", "author": "ILoveCats924", "created": 1605104290, "retrieved": 1632946876, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1923, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gclz2ks": {"link": "/r/college/comments/js8wb0/a_letter_to_professors/gclz2ks/", "text": "I feel related here.

I've had professors break down in class and have seen my class mates struggle. I did online community college through out most of high school but this seems to be a different monster. None of my teachers are trained in online learning and end up making it closer to onsite learning through zoom. This isn't healthy for either side so the current format is not the best. Some students don't have an appropriate place to turn their camera on in class and then the professors complain about us being lazy. Most of my classmates have never had to deal with online school before so it is a challenge. The professors aren't used to this  format and end up making waaaay harder than it needs to be. We need to understand each other more in this hard time and be more compassionate on both sides. I see this comment section becoming into an age war when it isn't. We all miss our friends and we are all anxious to go back on campus. Just don't start pointing fingers at each other on who's to blame and who's harder to deal with. I do agree that the homework needs to be a little easier for those who have not been online but I also agree that the students need to give their professors grace. Most of us have lost a family member to this pandemic and we are all grieving.

What I'd be interested in would be your concrete suggestions for how to be better.\n\nHere's the puzzle:\n\nImagine you are instructing an 800-person intro to sociology lecture. \n\nYou have to give everyone a grade based on their mastery of the material. All of your policies have to be fair and will be used by try-hard students, students who are trying to game the system, depressed students, students who are working, students who have families and full time jobs. So you better make them fair. \n\nAlso, you have to manage 8 TAs, who have weekly sections.\n\nHow do you make people show up for section and actually interact with each other (and turn on their cameras)? \n\nHow do you have the TAs grade them? Based on participation? Do you force students to turn on their cameras? Do you make them do unsupervised breakout rooms? Do you have them all in a big conference call? One way to help them participate is to force them to turn on their cameras. That is considered cruel by many. Another way is to give them a pre-section assignment so they all show up prepared. But that's extra work (busywork)--the price for a better discussion. The payoff is that students get to talk to each other. \n\nHow do you do lectures? Live lectures are incredibly awkward. You're talking to an empty room of 800 squares. And if you mess up in some way you could be recorded and distributed on the internet as a meme. Plus managing the chat is difficult.\n\n Asynchronous lectures are boring for students and unmotivating to watch.\n\n... Do you upload slides? Well, if you upload slides with every word, they won't watch the lectures. They'll just use the search function when they need to, thus not learning the material.\n\nHow do you do exams? You can't stop cheating. Students create massive group chats and share answers. Do you make them open note? Now you have to write a tricky exam for students that's hard enough, easy to grade 800 of, and not easy to cheat on. Good luck.\n\nYour best bet in many cases is to just give more individual, un-cheatable assignments... But it's more work. And not just for the students--for you too, grading. And with extensions.\n\nPlus, how do you deal with it when a student misses an exam because of internet issues? Or because their family member dies? Or because they have to work? How strict are you?  If you're not strict at all/have no rules, you're making it demotivating to do the work. \n\n(And also, it's a royal pain to give extensions in a class over 20 people--you have to keep track of them, and remember them and enter them correctly. Good luck with your 800-person lecture). \n\nAnd if you're kind/lenient, what happens when it becomes a pattern? If a student misses 6/10 sections, do you grade them the same as other students who didn't? If a student doesn't do half their assignments because they're depressed, what grade do they deserve? (Which is to quantify their learning of the material). \n\nAlso, as others have mentioned, teaching isn't fun right now. I'm getting so many emails all the time, and they're all bad news. They have some issue with the class, or they need an extension with something. Almost all of my interactions with students are time consuming, and neutral or mildly unpleasant.\n\nPlus, we are dealing with the isolation too.  We all live in our rooms also. Many of the students have moved home. You are living with your families, near your friends. A lot of instructors are graduate students, or professors who aren't from here. They often have very few friends, and no family nearby. Plus, we are supporting ourselves. Many have children too. Grad students are instructors, students, AND research slaves. \n\nAnd... it's a lot of work to plan a class, and make the above decisions. Plus, to write tests. Plus, to be familiar with the material well enough to teach. Teaching a class (especially for the first few times) is about the same amount of work as taking 2-3 classes. You are responsible for all the deadlines and assignments (you have to do them to design/explain/grade them). You have to answer to a lot more people.\n\nBut the hardest part is the emotional labor to show up, and deal with students. Not only do we have to make these decisions, but we are expected to make material that's so engaging that it can compete with other things on your computer--that you'll want to do it over Netflix, or video games, or other content put out by massive corporations with huge budgets, huge teams, or at least (like tik tok) no educational material to bake into their entertainment.\n\nIt's not that teachers don't care. (Well, sometimes they dgaf, but that's not a coronavirus thing, that's a problem with the incentive structure for tenure... They're graded on their research, and their teaching is like small homework assignments).  \n\nIt's more that it's a truly difficult task, and we don't know how to deal with it better.

Let me elaborate and give you a real life scenario.\n\nWaking up to kids unexpectedly crying, or maybe parents who need medical attention, have to drive to pharmacies to pick up meds. Kids getting sick/needing shots/ etc.\n\nOk, you ran and handled kids needs, but now you have to skip breakfast, ok just coffee, fuck coffee no time, prepare mic and laptop ASAP, lecture, answer emails, grade homework, write/revise research proposals, online office h, update lecture materials, answer colleagues emails, zoom meeting with student, zoom meeting with department head or admin, zoom meeting with program officer, screen applicants, zoom meeting with undergrad committee A B C D, international zoom meeting with collaborators, zoom meeting with conference organizers. Review grants, review peer-reviewed papers.\n\nLearn this new online platform that the department proposes to use, learn how to use another platform that your colleague prefers to use. Switch from Microsoft to Google to Apple accounts and whatever the fuck the Univ decided to use within several min. Meanwhile got emails from impatient students \u201cdid you get my email my dear servant professor?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m submitting a regrade request because I deserve partial credit and I know how to grade my exam better than you do\u201d\n\nAs you make the plan to Write and revise academic papers, handle student complaints, ... then it hits you.\n\nOh, spouse is washing the dishes and changing the diapers, at least I have to cook lunch, and dinner, and kids want to play with you. Wait we are out of milk... pick up your phone, and got a text from dept head. Oh one student got corona, now you have to switch assignment and make it \u201cnot too stressful\u201d. Oh one colleague also caught it, and potentially others, another zoom meeting to discuss worst case scenario. \nOh now conference can\u2019t go but it\u2019ll switch to online.\nHey new online platform to learn.\n\nThen as you tried to wind down, catch a quick rest, spouse said \u201cI think I will have to quit my job/ our company is doing massive layoffs\u201d\n\nAnd you sighed .. you also remembered that you haven\u2019t showered or... (did I skip brushing my teeth? Did I shower yesterday? Do we still have enough toilet papers?).\n\nAnd you get an email. Your best friend/colleague, a non citizen, told you that his parents have passed away but he cannot go to visit because our case is the highest. By the time he finishes his quarantine his parents would have been buried. You are wondering .. how do I console him..saying nothing is the best perhaps but.. you can\u2019t be there with him because he is in a state with the highest outbreak rate!!\n\nYou think students life is tough?? Are you that self-centered?? Sorry to say this, fuck your motivation. Just imagine that we are in the midst of another World War. People back then don\u2019t think about losing motivation.

And professor is not at the worst situation, doctors, nurses, grocery store workers, funeral workers are at a much worse situation. At least you don\u2019t hear in the news that one professor is dying after another.\n\nEveryone is greatly suffering here because the leaders of this country have been grossly incompetent, and approx. half of the America wanted another 4 years of this.\n\nAnd to boldly said \u201cliberate state X Y Z !!\u201d , \u201copen the country\u201d \u201cI think the science doesn\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWe have to take back the country from doctors\u201d.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let COVID dominate your life\u201d\n\nHa?

I lecture each day to an empty room. \n\nThe only time I hear from students are the last minute e-mails before a major assignment comes due begging for mercy. Students expect unlimited slack and sympathy over COVID-related matters, while I have to triage more complaints about my lectures and course material than ever before.\n\nOften, the same students that demand compassion from me are merciless in their reviews. We, too, are just doing our best in a radically altered teaching environment without adequate resources. And yet, we receive no sympathy or leniency. \n\nI am willing to listen to students and adapt, but you have to meet me half-way. If students want me to alter my expectations, I'm going demand the same of my students.", "author": null, "created": 1605117620, "upvotes": 106}, "gby8ieb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/js8wb0/a_letter_to_professors/gby8ieb/", "text": "I\u2019d award this if I could. It describes my experience\u2014all of our experiences, really\u2014perfectly.\n\nIn addition, my school decided to break this fall semester into two 7.5 week periods so that we would only have to take at max 2-3 classes versus 5-6 at a time. In some ways it\u2019s helped, but in others it just causes more stress.\n\nMy professors haven\u2019t condensed the material they\u2019d normally teach under normal circumstances. They\u2019ve just accelerated the rate at which we cover things. We skim over topics that would justify a deep dive for the sake of time. I retain next to nothing from Zoom classes and have to find ways to regurgitate as much of it as I can into assignments to receive passing grades. For the first time in my career as a student, I\u2019m solely concerned about my grades and grades alone rather than my comprehension of the actual material.\n\nAdditionally, because we\u2019re compressing 15 weeks of material into 7.5 week chunks, my school has elected to hold classes on days we\u2019d normally have off. Labor Day, Columbus/Indigenous People\u2019s Day, Veterans Day, etc. In addition to being a student, I also work a part time job 5-6 days a week to help my family make ends meet. I haven\u2019t had a day where I didn\u2019t have school, work, or both since the end of August. Even weekends are spent either catching up on assignments and studying, or working at my job. \n\nI know I\u2019m fortunate to be able to receive an education and working during these times, but honestly, I\u2019m so stressed. I haven\u2019t had a day to myself. A day to sleep in. A day to binge-watch Netflix. A day to play video games. A day to read a non-school related book. A day to spend quality time with my family and friends. A day to go on a walk my dog.\n\nI\u2019m spread thinner than I\u2019ve ever been as a student, and am just hoping I finish this semester with my head above water.", "author": "bakedpotatowcheezpls", "created": 1605114103, "upvotes": 3}, "gby8d2q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/js8wb0/a_letter_to_professors/gby8d2q/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1605114032, "upvotes": -20}, "gby742e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/js8wb0/a_letter_to_professors/gby742e/", "text": "Honestly, One of my professors is terrible.

Don\u2019t get me wrong some people are thriving doing online school/work, but there\u2019s a lot of us that aren\u2019t. Humans aren\u2019t built to live in isolation. It\u2019s unnatural to us and that shows in our reaction to it. So don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. You\u2019re totally normal and not alone. Give yourself days where you don\u2019t do any work and other days actually write out a realistic schedule and follow it. Make time for exercise even if it\u2019s just putting on music or a podcast and doing some stretching for 10 mins. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t do anything super dangerous, but you should still be visiting with friends/family.
