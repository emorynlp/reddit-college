  "text": "My parent pulled me out of school so I could pursue a GED High school equivalency, I would be a junior in high school this year. I will be aiming to take my ACT and SAT eventually, since those will be needed to get into college, and I understand that if I earn a high score on all my GED tests that I will be able to earn some college credit, but I\u2019m still wondering if it\u2019s possible to enroll in a college credit course with a GED and what procedures I would need to go through?",
