      "text": "Speaking as someone from the US, our schools tend to have more holistic entrance entrance requirements than other countries. Even pre-covid the SAT/ACT were falling out of favor as a means of assessing college readiness, and covid just accelerated that trend. \n\nIf I recall correctly, high school GPA and rank is one of the strongest predictors of college success, so many colleges weigh that the most heavily. In addition, colleges in the US look at extracurriculars that students are involved in, essays they've written, and recommendations they've received. \n\nA quick google does also show that in my state they currently have testing sites open for the SAT, indicating that there's reason to think that colleges may still want to use these exams to make admissions decisions. That being said, my state has about 75% of the population vaccinated and has more or less gone back to normal with the exception of mask requirements, so it makes sense to have in-person exams at this point. \n\nLast year though most schools scrapped entrance exams from what I can tell and just used other metrics to make decisions.",

              "text": "In my opinion? Depends. Some exams are better than others so it depends on the specific exam and how it's designed. If an exam that doesn't accurately predict college success is used, then the exam is useless. But if the exam is actually good at predicting college success, then it's reasonable to add it as another data point to influence admissions.\n\nEdit: I should be clear that I'm very much in favor of \"holistic\" admissions, but that means basing admissions decisions on a wide variety of information, and it's okay if a test is one piece of that information, but it should be everything, just like GPA shouldn't be everything, but it makes sense to count them heavily if they're well correlated with success.",
