I\u2019m in my first semester back in \u201cacademic\u201d school in 2 years. I recently got my certifications in EMT and Firefighting and am quickly realizing it\u2019s a whole different ballpark compared to studying for EMT and firefighting and was hoping you all could drop some habits that work for you all.

That'll keep you from procrastinating and hating to study everything within a few hours when exams come up.

I would get notecards and cover the name of the body/plant parts and try to remember what it was. I usually did it in a series of 5. Try to remember 5, once you have that down, do 5 more. It\u2019s like a sequence; start again with the first 5, then second 5, third 5, etc. People complained about biology classes, like Zoology, because there were a lot of classes, names, scientific names, parts, etc to remember. However, this really helped me get through it.  \n\nFor reading quizzes and whatnot, I\u2019d read whatever it was a few days before and then again the day of; usually right before the class started (if it was short). I didn\u2019t bother with highlighting text. I didn\u2019t see the point in it; it was just a waste of time. Although, it could work for you. \n\nI found it best to study before going to sleep. It helps you retain more information than it would if you studied in the morning and went about your day. But do that too, if needed. But always do a refresher before each class and go over the material for the test/quiz.", "author": "Drew_Ferran", "created": 1632243489, "upvotes": 1}}}
