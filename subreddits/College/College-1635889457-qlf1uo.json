  "text": "Hey Folks. I'm new to Reddit and came to this community because I am curious about the experiences that others have had with the writing centers and labs at their individual schools. What is the good the bad and the ugly that you have experienced with these sorts of places? What are some things that would help improve them?",

      "text": "My school's writing lab gives students 30 time slots with their tutors. I like to write my paper and then take it to them to have a 2nd eyes on it. I provide my paper and the assignment prompt and any specific concerns I have with it. My main concern is usually \"do I answer the prompt adequately?\" The tutor offers their opinion and might make minor spelling or grammar corrections but won't offer huge corrections so they can't be accused of writing the paper for me.\n\nA negative might be that the tutor I get isn't great at what I need help with. APA vs MLA for instance.\n\nIn general I like taking major grade papers (stuff worth large % of final grades) to them to at least check that I've answered the prompt and not wandered off topic which I'm prone to doing.",
