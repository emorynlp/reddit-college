  "text": "My project for my undergraduate research this semester is to write a literature review (instead of a formal research report). I've been reviewing studies for specifically targeted event-related potentials and oscillations, and I have 50 studies that I've thoroughly looked at - I was supposed to review and do a synopsis of \\~5 studies a week. I need to get started on the lit review now because I have several 3000 word finals due a month, but I really have no idea where even to begin.\n\nAny tips, tricks, advice for me?",

      "text": "If you have access to journals, then you should have access to literature reviews as well. Take a look at one or two. Generally you briefly describe the subject and then go into a paragraph or two with a selected figure for each article. If you can group articles into subsections then do so.",
