  "text": "Hi everyone so I wanted to talk about my first semester of college. It\u2019s not done yet I still have one more month then the first semester is done. I haven\u2019t been doing to bad I\u2019m in television broadcasting which is cool but the industry is so competitive to get into. Every assignment I had anxiety and some days I didn\u2019t have an appetite because of all the assignments and quiz\u2019s. I stress a lot and always worry about my future in life. I\u2019m not to sure if I\u2019ll ever graduate college but I\u2019m trying my best to finish. I\u2019m just so scared that one day I\u2019ll fail and upset my family. Television is cool but I don\u2019t wanna do that in the future I\u2019m just taking something to make my family happy. If I do decide to leave this program I\u2019ll probably do police foundations but if I fail that then I\u2019ll just get more work experience. I\u2019m just so lost. Thank you and cya guys have a great week.",

      "text": "What are you doing dude? Police foundations? If you're in the US you can just go work as a cop. No degree necessary unless you want to move up to administration. Even then you can work as a cop and get a degree at the same time. If you're that worried then switch to physics or drop out. Those are your best bets. I'm not 100% certain that television broadcasting is the best direction to go.",

          "text": "Ya. It\u2019s a really hard industry to go into. I\u2019m from Canada. My brother in law works for td security he actually had no degree and they were going to hire him but my sister just told him to get a police foundations degree and he did but he was going to get a good job either way. I agree with what you\u2019re saying. I always think that a college degree will make you successful but I realized it actually doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m 18 and I\u2019m just figuring out what I want to do. Thank you for commenting \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd",
