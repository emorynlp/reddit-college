  "text": "Nothing has been decided yet (no election has been held) but at the first meeting my friend said she\u2019d love to be president for the club that does not have any executive members (covid messed up quite a few plans). I said I\u2019d be secretary but the more I think about it the more I want to be the head. How do I tell her that I\u2019ve changed my mind without hurting her feelings?",
