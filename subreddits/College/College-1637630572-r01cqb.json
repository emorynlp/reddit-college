  "text": "Have you guys ever quit a job two months after working there because of school? I\u2019ve never done anything like this before since the last two jobs I\u2019ve had, I either stayed for 2+ years or for more than 6 months. I\u2019m planning to study abroad February and realized I haven\u2019t told my employer about leaving so soon. Should I tell them now or wait until I put my two weeks in??",

      "text": "If it\u2019s a part time job, this is far from uncommon. My girlfriend quit her job she was only working at for a month to study abroad for the summer. Part time employers of students expect a lot of turnover, so you shouldn\u2019t feel guilt about it. The courteous thing to do is let them know as soon as possible, but you only really owe them the two weeks notice.\n\nJust tell them that an exciting and unexpected opportunity popped up and that you\u2019d love to reapply when you come back (or not).\n\nSafe travels! :)",
