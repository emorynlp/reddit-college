I found that I've gotten progressively better at structuring my thoughts naturally without having to lay out a plan for essays, and I very rarely have to change words or fix grammar because I've gotten so used to checking my work as I write. Of course, I'll still read over it a couple times before I submit it, but my point is mainly that I do the best when I crunch it out in a matter of hours with no breaks. That way I don't lose concentration or have any change in the way I want to write. I've done a good handful of finals like this and gotten As on most of them, but in the past when I've taken a few days to write essays, they end up getting lower scores. As an aside, I also don't go through multiple drafts with my papers, but instead write the final draft immediately. It saves a lot of time for me, and I've always had an easier time skipping to the final draft instead of doing a rough draft. Perhaps it's just the way that I write that facilitates it, or maybe I've just developed that skill over years of taking shortcuts; who knows?\n\nSurprisingly, the same thing happens to me for studying. When I study for multiple days before a test, I do worse. It's probably because I'm trying to remember information for multiple days, or I'm trying to remember things that are ultimately irrelevant to succeeding in the class.

How you do your writing won\u2019t make an impact if you\u2019re trying to prove the sky is green. The other thing is being willing to utilize writing resources. Anytime I had long stints of writing I ALWAYS used grammarly or similar software and asked others to read my work.

I do a ton of reading and gathering sources (most of the time) the week before, and then don't actually start trying to write until the day before at the earliest.

I \"can't\" do it (air quotes bc I can, it just stresses me), but with papers, I work way better closer to the deadline. It may be in part because I like to procrastinate, and it may just be in part that I actually do write more information dense and better papers when I have a deadline to beat. Not sure if I subconsciously take it as a change or what, but thats just how I write. Sometimes I would have a major paper due on the 13th at 8:00am, and I would start writing it 9:pm on the 12th.
