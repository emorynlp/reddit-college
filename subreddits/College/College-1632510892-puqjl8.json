I\u2019m currently a business major and I have a 3.6 GPA. I\u2019m a hard worker and I know I\u2019ll be good at whatever I do, but I\u2019m getting Nervous that I\u2019ll choose the wrong career and won\u2019t be happy/successfully. I\u2019m leaning towards management, but that\u2019s only because I don\u2019t like everything else (finance, economics, marketing, etc). One week I\u2019ll be confident with Management then the next week I\u2019ll be questioning it and wondering if I should be doing Law or psychology or something else that I don\u2019t even know about. Does anyone have similar experience or a story where they found out what they wanted to do?", "author": "Wisdomseekr79", "created": 1632510892, "retrieved": 1632800384, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
