I feel like I never have any free time to do what i enjoy even when I technically do and when ever I try to relax all I feel like I can do think about what I should be doing. I spend about 5-6 hours a day on work/studying which never feels like enough but also like an overwhelming amount at the same time.  I feel like everty time im doing school work i think about how everyone else is out having fun, and when ever im trying to relax i think about how everyone else is beinh productive and studying and im just being lazy peice of shit who will amount to nothing in life.
