We don\u2019t need to have these workweeks in our lives again.",

Non-stop pestering so the person can\u2019t continue to sleep. We\u2019d take turns staying awake since we both had the tendency to crash and sleep for 10+ hours after an all nighter. Did it during finals weeks and thesis writing weeks...I think the longest we did it for was 2 weeks straight. It works, but would not recommend since you feel awful. You also better like the person because you both become really crabby.",

Then on the final 10 hours I took about 900 milligrams of caffeine and studied with no break up till 5 minutes before my test, I got a 89 percent on the test and the class average was a 65 percent. So apparently I worked but I got really sick after it and would never do it again",

I once saw a dude across the hall pull out of his backpack, one of those [store display boxes](https://www.google.com/search?q=5+hour+energy+shots&client=firefox-b-1-d&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVmf_UmPLwAhUHip4KHRORCEAQ_AUIxQMoAQ&biw=1920&bih=910#imgrc=ABPcykiUWWHMLM) for 5-hour energy shots. The box was full of those shots and--one by one--he opened and poured, like, seven 5-hour energy shots into a water bottle... then proceeded to *down the whole damn bottle in one go*, only to then go back to whatever he was studying like there was no problem at all. \n\nIt was really hard to study after witnessing that, because I was fully prepared to call an ambulance soon whenever he showed any symptoms related to a caffeine overdose. However 30 minutes had passed and he still looked fine(?), so I left the hall afterwords to continue my studies somewhere else.\n\nI didn't see any local news articles, nor a story about it on something like Chubbyemu about a 5-hour energy related incident, so he's probably still alive, I guess. None of my peers believe me when I told them this story, and honestly I wouldn't either. Regardless, it should go without saying **don't go overboard on your consumables. Read the nutrition labels.**",

In hindsight, I'm sure the professor would've been understanding if I explained what happened, especially since it was blatantly obvious that I was freshly injured. But I was a bit too obsessive about academics for my own good.\n\nTake care of yourself, everyone. All that education doesn't do much good if your brain and body aren't cared for.\n\nEdit: Since I'm guessing the follow up is gonna be asking how I did on the midterm, iirc I got a B on it.",

Everyone always likes to point out that I could use quizlets that other people make, but I always make my own because the process of making them gets the material into my brain better than anything else.  Sometimes I make quizlets and then literally never look at them again because all I needed was to make it.  \n\nAlthough, I have found the \u201clearn\u201d and \u201cwrite\u201d tools to be very good for learning a foreign language.  It helps me make sure I know how to spell the words and place accent marks correctly.  I don\u2019t usually use them for anything but vocabulary lists though.",
