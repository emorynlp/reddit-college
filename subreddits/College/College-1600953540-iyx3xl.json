Mondays, Tuesday\u2019s, and Wednesday\u2019s I wake up (sometimes really late - like 11), shower , run any errands if I need like groceries, than come back, make food. What I do next depends - I either workout first or do my schoolwork first. Usually 3 or 4 assignments per day. After that\u2019s all done, make dinner, relax for the night with family. \n\nThis week was particularly good. We had a vacation booked all week so last week I did a ton of work on extra days. Here at the hotel I\u2019ve done 3 assignments and tomorrow after I get home I\u2019ll do my last ones which are due tomorrow and Sunday. It was stressful but worth it to work ahead.",

My asynchronous classes I just look over lecture slides during my work shifts and use them to complete any homework. \n\nWhen I say free time it means anything from chillin with my boyfriend watching movies to doing laundry, dishes, cooking, etc. I also volunteer for my college\u2019s Covid testing program which I have short shifts for every few weeks. \n\nIf I were to give you advice,  just make sure your grades stay decent, take this time to relax, and maybe sign up for some type of volunteer program or club. Things like volunteering help to keep you busy and also are really great for meeting people and getting recommendations for internships and such. \n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t already have a job it might be worth it to ask around for any campus jobs you can go to for a few hours a week to make some pocket money.

Sticking to my routine is what has kept me grounded through all of this craziness. If I were you I'd start off with simple routines, like making your bed every single morning. It starts your day off with an accomplishment and keeps things tidy. Do that for a week and add another thing, like going for daily walks. Before you know it you'll have your own routine set in stone.\n\nAlso +1 for using deduction, you've got me feeling like some sort of philosopher over here.",

Then before I go to bed every night I brush teeth and floss, take a shower, take my evening supplements and set my morning ones out on the alarm clock along with my water bottle, and then read a book in bed until I\u2019m ready to go to sleep. You could also browse Reddit or whatever if you have more discipline. None of these things are any drastic life-changing habits. You don\u2019t have to run 5 miles every morning. It\u2019s just about having a morning routine, and having an evening routine. Your brain craves routine, so just by doing the same little things every day without compromise, your brain will kind of regulate itself and organize itself better. I feel more excited and ready for the day after I complete my routine and find myself fresh and dressed and fed",
