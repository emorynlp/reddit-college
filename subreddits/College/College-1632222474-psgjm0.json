I\u2019m kind of in a bit of a rut at the moment and I don\u2019t know what to do/ the way forward. I\u2019m studying computer science and was in first year but failed 2 of my 13 modules so therefore I cannot progress into second year. Last year I could have progressed with 2 fails but it was just the one this year. I\u2019ve a meeting with a careers advisor tomorrow to go through my options. I can repeat the year, I can try out an apprenticeship, I can drop out of college and explore the world of work. Any advice?", "author": "joshman12344", "created": 1632222474, "retrieved": 1632946678, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
