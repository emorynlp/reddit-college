  "text": "my parents are no help. one can argue that they set me up for failure except i know it's not their fault. i wish i could be like the other kids at my school and have help from my family members. my parents are old immigrants who did not even pass the highschool education level of their country. \n\nso anyways, i have no clue how to get into college... my school grades are looking nice. my ACT score... average. i got a 22 superstore. and i think i want to be a nurse. lots of kids at my school are looking to become one. but i don't know where to start. \n\nmy local community college has a nursing program. but id like to explore my options first. but i don't even know how to find colleges that could teach me become a nurse. i don't know what to major in, i don't think i've even fully grasped the idea of what a major is. i just feel so lost i'm sorry if i sound dumb",
