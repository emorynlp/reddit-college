  "text": "I'm living in a dorm. There are communal bathrooms. Like 20+ people per bathroom, but there are a select few who cause problems. They piss on the seat, leave shit unflushed, and constantly clog the toilets. They shave in the showers and don't wash it down and throw trash \"close enough\" to the garbage bins. The cleaning personnel have threatened to stop coming before, to which my roommate and I decided to clean up after other people. It happened again, and again, and again. How do I get people to stop being asses and actually care about their house? Yes, the entire wing is only guys. Not important, I just don't get how you can feel good leaving a facility like this.",

      "text": "I don't have experience with this at all, but I'd maybe try taping an official/professional looking notice up. Might get some sense in some of the ppl. Also mention what the cleaning ppl have said in it. If that doesn't work, maybe try faking it until you make it type of thing. Post a biweekly calendar with two ppl per time period and label them bathroom monitors or bathroom cleaners of the period. See if it works or does something somehow. And if someone gets baffled and brings it up to a higher up, it could help bring in someone with more authority to address the bathroom issue. Make sure to give those ppl time to stew in their stink though. It needs to get to their heads how terrible they are. Set you and your roommate a part (like you for one two-week period, then neither of you for the next, then your roommate). If some guys notice someone is actually following the thing, they might grow a conscious and follow/help. You and your roommate can still help each other too. Not like anyone would notice.\n\n^^ That's just random ideas from my head. There's probably a better route though, like reporting the bathroom conditions to some higher up or just straight reporting the terrible floormates. I've only commute and have never dormed though. Sorry you're dealing with these people. Lots of ppl have different standards of how much dirtiness they're willing to tolerate and I guess their's are high.",
