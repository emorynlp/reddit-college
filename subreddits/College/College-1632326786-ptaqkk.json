I understand if the really old buildings don't have them, but the building ya'll built 15 years ago has them! You knew how important they were back then!",

I didn't start attending the local JC until after I was accepted to uni (I wanted to get my Paramedic) and frankly, if I had known, I might have started at the JC. Probably not, because I'm kinda stuck up, but it's a solid School with a more vibrant student life (and less stuck up people) than the uni in the same town.",
