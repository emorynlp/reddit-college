      "text": "If you think taking Bio will help you decide your major, definitely do it! Better to find out now (even if its the hard way) than to have a \"what if\" feeling later in life.\n\nHalf the time, being interested in a subject makes challenging classes less challenging. You're more likely to put in the time and effort when the subject matter interests you.",

      "text": "I don't think you should let others' perceptions of a subject guide your decision of whether to major in it or not. I would say try out Biology and see if it's for you. You don't know unless you try, and who knows, you might be a natural at it! If it's difficult, then it's only one class and if you push through it then at least you can rule out biology as your major.",
