  "text": "I want to start off by saying yes I know news papers/journalists need to make money to. \n\nI absolutely hate when I have to do research for a paper or project and I go to click on an article and get blocked by a pay wall. Like come on I can\u2019t afford to pay to have access for every major reliable news outlet. I just want to be able to do my course work for crying out loud without paying more to learn then I already have. Even the student rates they have add up when you need 10 different sources for a paper.\n\nEDIT: I do use my schools database. But the one my school uses is difficult to navigate and takes three times as long to find what I need, if I do find what I need. Doing a general google search I find more relevant recent articles, majority of the sources on the data base are five to ten years old. Not what you want when doing a speech on why free community college would be beneficial to majority of Americans.",

              "text": "One trick I use on some sites is to click (to stop) the reload button before the website has finished loading everything, it works on NYT, for example. On the iPhone, I use the reader view on Safari whenever possible. Also try e-mailing the authors, I have heard that they can provide it to you for free (though I think this is only for study/research papers).\n\nThe most practical solution would be to use something like [outline.com](https://outline.com) (but this won't always work :/ ). It really is fucking annoying, I cant pay over 200 for 4 different websites. So  many articles I've had to miss out on. \n\nE: Maybe there is some kind of browser extension you could install (e.g. firefox has uBlock origin)? Check the Chrome web store or whatever you use. Just make sure it is safe and respects your privacy.",
