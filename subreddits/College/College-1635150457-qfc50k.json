  "text": "I\u2019m 19 and finishing the last year of a master\u2019s program in applied mathematics. \n\nThe problem is is that I just don\u2019t care about my classes anymore. I only show up to about 1:4 of my lectures. It\u2019s difficult to motivate myself to finish projects. My grades are suffering. I want to drop out, yet I\u2019ve already invested an enormous amount of time and parental trust into this program. \n\ni really found something that I want to do with my life. I just want a career job to earn capital to start a business. I want to open a marijuana dispensary in newly legal states. and this program is completely a means to an end. \n\nMy biggest concern is that I\u2019d disappoint my parents which sucks, but I\u2019m going to have to become my own person eventually. \n\nI have been stressing about this all week and all night. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\ndo you folks have any advice??",

      "text": "You\u2019re not always going to be motivated. Just remind yourself that you are almost done and just take it one assignment at a time. Thinking about how much you don\u2019t care and don\u2019t want to do this is not doing you any favors. Finishing your degree will be something you can be proud of yourself for. Also, it\u2019s better to get it done and over with now instead of having to debate years down the road if you should finish your degree. A few more months will fly by faster than you think and then you never have to worry about it again.",
