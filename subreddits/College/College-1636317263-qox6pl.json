  "text": "I always see people dissing college and saying it isn't worth it. That millennials and most likely Gen Z are going to end up even more in debt and without very great jobs, even though the generations before us built it up to be the greatest asset to your future. \nBut...are there any alternatives than freelance, trade school, the military, or getting a no-skill job and working your way up the chain? Are there any other real options?\nI appreciate any help, as honestly I'm not sure anymore.",

And without money, without a good job to get that money, how do you even start? Bank loans yeah...but if it fails?",
