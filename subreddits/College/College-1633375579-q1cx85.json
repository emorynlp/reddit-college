  "text": "I don\u2019t know if the rest of you feel this, but high-school of course is a sort of bubble and college is a transition out, and an unexpected part of that transition is death. I have heard of so many college students dying; this ranges from alcohol poisoning, car crashes, suicide, and recently for me, murder. Yesterday one of our seniors in our college lived off campus and got robbed and murdered not even half a mile away from me. Like it is such a terrifying experience to actually face the fact that death can take us at any time. Remember that college grades are just grades and that our lives are precious, stay safe everyone.",
