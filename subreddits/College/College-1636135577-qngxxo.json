      "text": "Me? LOL maybe 7 or 8. Everyone I know except a very percentage of people that changed their major at least once. I think the main reason is because people think they want to pursue one path, then take some classes and realized its either not what they thought, or they aren't as passionate about it as they thought they would, and would change their major. That is why college requires general ed classes so people can really get a taste of many different areas before making that ultimate decision/time commitment.",
