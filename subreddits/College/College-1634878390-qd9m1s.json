  "title:": "Undergraduate Research Position \ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd73",
  "text": "For Background Info: im a freshman undergrad and about a week ago i emailed my bio prof about a position in her lab. i received a sheet detailing the current research of every faculty in the department as part of bio major orientation and was already interested in her research so i worked hard to make sure i got an A in this class to try to impress her and make sure she knew i had a good grip on bio before i asked. after the email she said she would like to meet with me to talk more about her lab.\n\nFast Forward To Yesterday: i went to her office hours and actually ran out of time to go into her office because i got so anxious i spent 20 minutes pacing outside her door trying to figure out what to say. thankfully we were able to talk and walk when she left because i had her class next. during this she said i can\u2019t help her directly with her research right now but she has six grad students in her lab and that i can start working in her lab and helping them with their research next semester !! she also said that because i came so early that i may be able to do enough lab work to publish my own research paper in my senior year !!\n\nToday: i went to my academic advisor and she said that with some more meetings and a bit of a credit extension during my semesters that i should be able to work lab time into my schedule !! im so excited and im so happy that my hard work paid off !! im sharing this here because i needed to dump this on someone since i share all my big updates with my mom on friday evenings",
