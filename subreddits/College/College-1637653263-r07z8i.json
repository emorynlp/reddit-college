  "text": "I need some advice. My parents look like their health is dwindling and they have a lot to worry about. They are pulling out a huge mortgage, which means they can\u2019t pay for my college expenses. They used to rely on me when I was back home for most stuff since my mom can\u2019t drive and my dad does basically everything. Im in California, so I can transfer to a community college and transfer to a UC afterwards. I just keep thinking about it, should I stay behind and go to cc to help my parents ?",

What the other commenter said if certainly valid, at the same time with my parents,. If push comes to shove for something important that they can't handle on their own or have sorted in some other way such that it either falls on me or doesnt happen then I'ma be there for my parents 100% .",

      "text": "It's not your job to take care of your parents, especially in the case that they're making unsound financial decisions. Granted, I don't really know their situation. \n\nI've adopted the thought process that I don't owe my parents anything. It's true. I didn't choose to be here, they chose to bring me here. It was their idea to raise a child altogether. For me to owe them anything because my dad decided to keep it in is crazy. \n\nBe careful spending your life tending to others who can't help themselves. Your parents are adults. They need to figure out how to fix their situation and not drag you into it. That's completely unfair. Having a child to use their labor to satisfy your needs is... unsavory. \n\nYou need to focus on yourself. If they can't pay your college expenses, you should find a way. I don't think it's up to you to save your parents from their own doing. I really think it's a bad idea to change your life to cater to theirs, even if they do need help. These are things that grown adults should be prepared for. \n\nUnfortunately, they aren't going to stop aging. I'm 32, my parents are mid 60's and watching them get older has been interesting. I live 300 miles away and don't see them too often. When I do, I can always see the differences between the last time I saw them. They're getting older. It is what it is. They have their own struggles too but that's their life, not mine.",
