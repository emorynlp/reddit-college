  "title:": "I'm a very quiet student, so I don't have anyone to share this with outside my family, but I am graduating this week as a math major with a 3.93 GPA",
  "text": "Like I said, I'm pretty quiet in person, and I never bring up my grades in front of my peers, but I felt inspired to brag a little bit after seeing some other posts on this sub. Because I don't like to bring up my grades, I sometimes feel like my peers assume that I'm not too bright, since I can be a little bit socially awkward!\n\nBeing a math major, I am especially proud of this, because guys... Math is hard! I like math a lot, but it does not come easily to me, and these classes were a ton of work (My college is on a 4.0 scale). In some ways, I feel like I missed out on a lot of social opportunities by prioritizing the academic side of things, so it is a mixed bag. But, it's a huge relief to be done with these classes. I love math, but I am looking forward to never having to take another math class again!\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the comments and awards, this is very nice!",

Numerical Analysis was the one that did it for me, it was the final class I had to take for my math major, so I was pooped, and there was a huge coding component that I was not prepared for (I have very little coding experience). \n\nI had a really weird situation with my Real Analysis class where the professor had us teach ourselves outside of class even though it was already an online class. Not a fun experience at all, especially for a class as hard as Real Analysis. Most of these math classes traumatized me in some way or another, haha. Good luck to you!",

I had an overall 3.3 gpa but my math/major gpa was 4.0, I nearly got an A+ in all my classes including two real Analysis courses. I also passed two of the actuarial exams P and FM but I didn't do an internship and that really hurt me. I'm working at a factory now making just a little over $20 an hour and not in a role that's even somewhat related to math. I did some interviews to be an underwriter with hopes to transition to actuarial but those turned out no gos. I've put out numerous applications but have either been disconsidered or never heard back. I'm teaching my self predictive analytics right now and hope I can get in somewhere as like a data analyst or an actuarial trailer or something like that.",

          "text": "I think the most important thing is motivation. Most of us know what needs to be done in order to get a certain grade, it's more about setting aside the time/effort needed to achieve it. I believe the best way to motivate yourself is to find some aspect of the class that is of genuine interest to you. With a crazy subject like math, for example, it helps me to think of all the amazing things I love that have been accomplished with math. Math has helped us go to space, it's helped us animate movies, it's helped us create buildings and other structures, etc. Tapping into this motivation is really helpful for me.\n\nIf that's a little too vague, one piece of practical advice would be to switch back and forth between studying and relaxing. Literally set a timer for 20, 30, 60 minutes, however long you can handle. During that time, only let yourself work on a specific task. Don't let yourself check your phone or open a new tab on your computer until your timer goes off. Then you can take a 5-10 minute break and repeat the process. This is a very good practical way to study/do HW, I highly recommend it, but it only works if you really commit to it. Good luck with your studies!",

I'm not sure how many credits it amounts to, but I took 5 classes per semester. I also worked as a HW grader and a tutor.\n\nNot sure how I pulled this off! Philosophically, the best advice I can give is to actually learn the material. A lot of people want to skate by without really internalizing why the math works, but that is not a great approach for people who want to pursue math. So I would recommend really doing all the practice problems, asking a million questions to your professors, and finding good explanations for the material online. More practically for math, I would definitely recommend seeking out good explanations on Youtube and watching the explanations *before* class, since that makes the actual class period a lot less stressful. \"Professor Leonard\" is my absolute favorite, he is a college professor who posts his lectures online. Patrick JMT, Krista King, and 3 Blue 1 Brown are also people I would recommend. It gets harder to find good content online the higher up you go in math, but you can almost always find good explanations somewhere on Youtube.",

Many colleges also have a help room for different majors, I would highly recommend that as well.",

      "text": "What an incredible accomplishment. I was a math major for a time but just wasn\u2019t in the right head space to commit to it. That\u2019s great for you. I might wanna be a highschool teacher too, any stem classes sound good to me!\n\nYour high gpa and major reminded me of something really unfortunate I learned this past semester. I took sociology for fun basically lol. But we learned about this case study done where fake resumes were sent out and the percents of \u201ccall backs\u201d were recorded. The only thing that varied on the resumes was the name (either a typical female or male name), the major listed (math, x, or x) and the gpa. \n\nThis is especially soemthing important for you to be aware of as a graduated math major\u2014 if you are female. For men, the call backs (as expected) went up for higher gpa math majors. When asked why, the employers made sweeping assumptions \u2014 this man sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders, is sharp, could really contribute to our company etc. \n\nFor female math majors, the call back trend followed an upside down u shape. Yes, really. For the mid gpa (3-3.5ish) The employers who called back gave feedback like \u201cshe sounds like a hard worker\u201d rather than she is smart/bright etc. which is already pretty red flag-y. As the gpas got to your level, high, the call backs went down. The employers again made sweeping judgments\u2014 she just doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201cteam player\u201d, she\u2019s a hard worker but doesn\u2019t seem \u201clikable\u201d, I don\u2019t think she would be a good fit here, etc. \n\nThese biases weren\u2019t strong for any major except math, where they were significant. I don\u2019t know exactly where I\u2019m going with this, except that I wish you the best and if you\u2019re a woman (I am too) then I hope you don\u2019t face this kind of \u2018she doesn\u2019t seem likable\u2019 bias. Reagardless of your gender, I hope you and others in the next gen of math and teaching math can help correct others and fight those ridiculous sexist assumptions.",
