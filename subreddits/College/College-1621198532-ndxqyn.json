Because I don't like to bring up my grades, I sometimes feel like my peers assume that I'm not too bright, since I can be a little bit socially awkward!\n\nBeing a math major, I am especially proud of this, because guys... Math is hard! I like math a lot, but it does not come easily to me, and these classes were a ton of work (My college is on a 4.0 scale). In some ways, I feel like I missed out on a lot of social opportunities by prioritizing the academic side of things, so it is a mixed bag. But, it's a huge relief to be done with these classes. I love math, but I am looking forward to never having to take another math class again!\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for all the comments and awards, this is very nice!", "author": "idontevenknow548", "created": 1621198532, "retrieved": 1632801543, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4771, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h89uhtc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ndxqyn/im_a_very_quiet_student_so_i_dont_have_anyone_to/h89uhtc/", "text": "Congratz!

I was a math major for a time but just wasn\u2019t in the right head space to commit to it. That\u2019s great for you. I might wanna be a highschool teacher too, any stem classes sound good to me!\n\nYour high gpa and major reminded me of something really unfortunate I learned this past semester. I took sociology for fun basically lol. But we learned about this case study done where fake resumes were sent out and the percents of \u201ccall backs\u201d were recorded. The only thing that varied on the resumes was the name (either a typical female or male name), the major listed (math, x, or x) and the gpa. \n\nThis is especially soemthing important for you to be aware of as a graduated math major\u2014 if you are female. For men, the call backs (as expected) went up for higher gpa math majors. When asked why, the employers made sweeping assumptions \u2014 this man sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders, is sharp, could really contribute to our company etc. \n\nFor female math majors, the call back trend followed an upside down u shape. Yes, really. For the mid gpa (3-3.5ish) The employers who called back gave feedback like \u201cshe sounds like a hard worker\u201d rather than she is smart/bright etc. which is already pretty red flag-y. As the gpas got to your level, high, the call backs went down. The employers again made sweeping judgments\u2014 she just doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201cteam player\u201d, she\u2019s a hard worker but doesn\u2019t seem \u201clikable\u201d, I don\u2019t think she would be a good fit here, etc. \n\nThese biases weren\u2019t strong for any major except math, where they were significant. I don\u2019t know exactly where I\u2019m going with this, except that I wish you the best and if you\u2019re a woman (I am too) then I hope you don\u2019t face this kind of \u2018she doesn\u2019t seem likable\u2019 bias.
