With curves, that can directly affect you. \n\nIf they want to play the game, they should play fair. If they want to cheat, they should know that there is a price to pay for doing so. These same people grow up and hire illegal workers, to undercut the local market. They are the kings of victimless crimes.",

If the course material is really that difficult or poorly constructed, you should ask a classmate, tutor, or your professor for help. If there's an accessibility issue, talk to the accessibility office at your school. You have plenty of tools to succeed.

But he wasn't afraid to ask all the stupid questions I also had. He even asked a few questions I could answer haha. \nBut he had such a work ethic and studied and studied and that caught me too. Luckily we had a top A student who was also caught in his disciplined study. So whenever we had questions the top student helped. \nSo us three studied for 2-3 weeks from morning till evening. And we became really good. We could solve almost every question we couldn't a few weeks ago.\nUp to that point, it was the hardest I ever studied for one exam.\n\nThen the exam and the results came. \nThe top student got 100% .\nWe other two failed.  \n\n\nI don't really know what his problem was. But I know that he was reeeeallly nervous during the exam. And even did the simplest things wrong.\nI failed bc I did the 2 questions (out of 5) wrong which had the most points. Those were tricky ones.\n \nHe passed one semester later with 90%.\nI passed one semester after him with 100%.\n\nI didn't study in a way that I could solve tricky questions at the first try. If you're studying math you have to try and understand EVERYTHING lol.\n\nI was so depressed and beaten that I was convinced that I am stupid. But he didn't give up and continued with his disciplined work ethic. And he passed all his exams really good that semester. Eventhough he had failed all his exams along with math the semester before. \nSeeing him working hard made me not wanna give up too. \nSince then I always work hard. Because hard work never fails you.",

I\u2019d prefer everyone could do both but very few people are lucky enough to find something they both excel at and enjoy.\n\nIt\u2019s possible for you to become the next Kobe or Lebron but it\u2019s gonna be a hell of a lot harder and you\u2019ll need to adapt to the challenges you face.\n\nMost people prefer the more relaxed less stressful route, working your ass off is called working your ass off for a reason, it\u2019s very difficult to do and you\u2019ll probably want to quit more time than you can count.\n\nAt the end of the day we all die so it\u2019s up to us to find a way to do so without regrets, if you don\u2019t want to be the best that\u2019s fine I just simply disagree that everyone doesn\u2019t have the potential to become so.\n\nIt might take longer but if you want it, it\u2019s usually worthwhile right?",

Without me they wouldn't have even had a full assignment ready to turn it let alone get that goddam 75% I got them.
