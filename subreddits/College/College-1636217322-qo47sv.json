  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m currently in a predicament and just need some advice. So the start of my sophomore year of college (3rd semester) I had withdrawn from all my classes as I was at the time just not caring about it and was getting high all day and normal flunk out stuff. Long story short I really regret it , so in the spring of this year I had finally gone back and struggled with getting my financial aid set, I was on probation since I withdrew everything, I had to write a form and paper explaining my situation and why I think I\u2019ll succeed. Last semester went really well but this semester isn\u2019t going so well. I was diagnosed with a mild depression and it had caused me to be in a rut this fall semester, where I was absent and stuff , I have 2 d\u2019s , I want to withdraw them as they are low and I don\u2019t think I can get them up by the end after talking to my professors, but if I withdraw a single class I\u2019m back on probation and don\u2019t get financial aid. My question is what would be the smart thing to do in the long run? I\u2019ve finally started to work on myself and I am very focused on school again and motivated for that matter. Is it better to withdraw and lose financial aid or continue with 2 d\u2019s on my transcript, I believe also if I don\u2019t exceed a certain gpa I will also lose my financial aid on probation, I\u2019m not sure if I can request to get back on it or not especially since I was on probation before, any advice would be amazing so I can see others thoughts, thank you! Have a blessed day!",
