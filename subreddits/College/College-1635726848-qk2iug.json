  "text": "I'm currently a college student in the USA.\n\nI switched my major like 6 times. I was technically supposed to graduate last Spring because I came in with over a year's worth of credits and did summer classes as well. But whatever. I'm turning 21 next year. \n\nI currently an AMS (applied mathematics and statistics) major and don't know if I should graduate next semester or not. I can technically either graduate Spring 2022 or Fall 2022.\n\nI don't know what to do after college. I don't have any sort of job lined up. I do under-the-table work in the entertainment industry and I work a little over 20 hours a week minimum wage doing random stuff for an insurance company. \n\nI do that despite being disabled according to the SSA definition (so severely disabled that I'm completely unable to support myself, proven and approved by them). I am the main breadwinner for my seven person family, though my little sisters have started working and helping out too. We're still significantly below the FPL.\n\nI don\u2019t have any plans for after college. I see 3 major options for me right now. \n\n1.\tEuthanasia. My friends are super supportive about it and I\u2019ve already had everything planned out for it. I will become fully paralyzed and blind (if I don\u2019t die first) in a matter of a few years, so I\u2019d like to do this eventually regardless before that point, the only question is whether I should I do this right after graduating from college next semester or not. This will lower expenses for my family and they\u2019ll probably have an easier time \n2.\tKeep doing what I\u2019m doing right now and supporting my family. Not ideal, because they\u2019re super abusive and tell me that they want me to die and constantly hit me and have done all sorts of horrible things to me including sending me to a torture camp, but that\u2019s besides the point. They\u2019re tolerable, and I\u2019ll be able to have a backbone of support here with my family and friends. This way, I\u2019ll continue being able to support my family until my sisters, currently in high school, can get through college.\n3.\tTry and live on my own and get another job and move to another state that\u2019s cheaper where I can work part time and live off of SSI plus whatever income I have. I would have to start life over-ish but I\u2019d be separated from family and on my own, without a support structure but also without abuse. I\u2019ll be able to avoid being a burden on my friends and family and try to take care of myself.\n\nI don\u2019t know what do among these choices, or is there another choice?",

      "text": "I would get your degree in the Spring, use your degree to potentially get a part time job that pays well, and then go with option 3.  Option 1 is very extreme, and I\u2019m unsure what condition you have, but maybe some new treatment will come up in the next few years.  With Option 2, this would only allow yourself to be abused, which nobody should have to deal with.  Option 3 could be changed, maybe a friend of yours would want to move as well, and you could roommate in the state you\u2019re in.  You could potentially be more comfortable and still not lose the support you do have.",

      "text": "Option 1 is extreme and a last resort. I would absolutely not consider it at the current time. If there is potential that your quality of life and ability to communicate will drop rapidly in the future, though, I would absolutely consult your doctor and a lawyer about making a medical directive for certain scenarios. Pragmatically you are mature in planning for this but in my opinion you may not feel this way about doing it now if you move and give it a few months.\n\nI like 3 the most but perhaps you can find some sort of communal living program or cultural living community? They have these things in some cities and they provide the support and socialization you'd need.",
