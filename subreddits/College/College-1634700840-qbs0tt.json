  "text": "So I'm a Senior in what is supposed to be my final semester. I tried my hardest, but I will not graduate on time. My advisor said I will need atleast another year. \n\nMy degree has a lot of classes. I declared my major in my sophomore year and I wish I had declared it earlier to get the classes done. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm obviously not going to quit, but it makes me nervous knowing it's going to take me longer to graduate than others.",

      "text": "Something a therapist once told me may help. I was in my early twenties and had no idea what I wanted to do with school. I was feeling really overwhelmed about being behind. He first reminded me that we all take our journeys at our own pace. Don\u2019t stress yourself by comparing yourself to others. He also told me that even if I didn\u2019t finish my degree and start a career until I turned 30, I could still have a 35 year career if I retired at the \u201ctraditional\u201d retirement age. That\u2019s a pretty good career. \n\nMy point is don\u2019t worry about how long it takes. Yeah, we all wish we could finish our degrees sooner than later. Some of us just take a little longer. And that\u2019s ok! In the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s not a big deal. You can still have a great career and be very happy. It\u2019s not a set back at all. It\u2019s just your journey.",

In the end, the extra year will be a blur in your memory. So don\u2019t stress :) and don\u2019t compare yourself to others. We\u2019re all on our own journey.",
