Having a study buddy and gym buddy keeps me accountable, so I actually procrastinate less, and I actually have fun. It's a win-win!\n\nLet me preface this by saying I've been shy and socially anxious my entire life, but have been actively working on that for the last few years. \n\nNow, for the first 3 years of uni all I had were basic acquaintance friends in most classes. I knew my last 2 years would be classes with most of the same people, so in the 1st semester of my 4th year, I mustered up all my courage to approach 2 girls who seemed nice to ask them if they wanted to make a study group. \n\nThey turned me down. \n\nI, of course, felt like shit and was all \"this is why I never initiate contact/conversations!!!\" And then, 2 weeks later one of the girls asks me if I'd like to study together after all. Long story short, it's a year later and she has become one of my absolute best friends. We study a LOT together and go to the gym fairly regularly for study breaks. She also happens to be a lot more social and I've connected with other people through her, including the other girl who had turned me down, who is actually  now my roommate (and am also really close to). \n\nTLDR: step our of your comfort zone. Approach some people and ask if they'd like to start a study group. Maybe they'll say yes, maybe they won't. Usually the hardest part is breaching the \"just in class\" friends stage, and by studying together outside of it, you are way more likely to have an acquaintance turn into a legitimate friend.\n\n(Sorry if this doesn't make sense.
