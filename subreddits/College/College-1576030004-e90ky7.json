  "title:": "Are you lonely, too?",
  "text": "I'm just back from studying with a friend, and she confided to me that she feels so lonely the last few months. We're third years in the same major. She told me how her best friend has a boyfriend now and they don't talk anymore, and how while she knows she has friends she still feels so disconnected from everyone. I shared my similar experience, that since moving out of my friends' apartment and my best friend dropped out of college I could go a full day without having an in person conversation with anyone, and I find myself frequently in my own company.\n\nAs we got to sharing, we recanted how we each knew multiple people who were similarly lonely. We got to the point of realising that having friends does not prevent feeling alone, and that most people wish for more meaningful interaction in their daily lives but won't go about constructing it themselves. \n\nIs loneliness just a part of the college experience? What are your thoughts on this?",

I'm not gonna say it's easy I had multiple time where I sat in the shower and cried for maybe half an hour with hot water hitting my body. Since you know what's causing your pain, try to with that girl crate a meaningful connection. I think that is what she wants you to do but feels scared to ask for it. I found comfort in going to gym and improving myself. Taking cold showers helps me a lot. Though I have to admit that hot showers are more comfortable, they will make you feel depressed. \nYou two should spend more time together, you know what you don't like about college experience, so you'll be resourceful to one another. Find some activity that will wipe your mind, sports or cooking maybe even cleaning up shit for some people seems to work.\n\nCollege is hard asf, everything hurts double...

When I came to college I was in clubs, but I was not very active, and there were many people in my major so it was hard to find a core group of friends.  But I joined a club that I was heavily involved in and found a group of girls I consistently sat by in class.  Eventually the relationships I built in class and extracurriculars formed into friendships.  Having those communities have given me a sense of belonging and lessened the feeling of loneliness. Moral of the story find a club that interests you, dedicate yourself to it, and if you are surrounded by good people, the relationships will follow.",

When I take a step back and try to see from an outside perspective, I realize that I'm not really expressing that I want to spend time with people. So, I've opened up a lot more to others, not to just the people I felt were my main friends, but to other people I have classes with and even some teachers (we all know our professors at my school). Learning to be comfortable with myself really helps. When my friends start dating, it hurts because I never see them around anymore, and it feels that everyone's pushing me to be in a relationship like that's the only way I won't feel lonely, but that's not the case. Even people in relationships feel alone, because they miss their friends. We're all just at a weird point in our lives where we're learning the types of relationships we want to have with others.",

It gives us time to reflect on life, the past, and think about the future. Try to not feel bad about being alone.

Due to people transferring and studying abroad, it has since disintegrated but we maintained that group for two years. I think the best thing for us was since we lived so close to one another, it was easy to hang out at the end of the day and watch movies or play card games. I think what has prevented me from feeling lonely is low maintenance friendships. We organized days where we would have family dinners (every Monday) or we knew we could sit down in the library to study together. There were six of us, so it was easy enough to float in and out at convenience. If I could meet up for breakfast and had to go afterwards, someone else could pop in and hang out after I had left if their schedule let them. \n\nOne of my friends in my current friend group told me that she tried to befriend as many coworkers as possible because each person carries their own group of friends, which makes it easier to meet more people. Having friends doesn\u2019t solve loneliness, but being willing to develop friendships where you can spend free time just studying or writing papers or whatnot can help tremendously.",

That said I'm kind of happy I started school late because me at 20 did *not* know how to interact socially.  I was socially awkward, didn't take good care of myself, and was extremely underdeveloped socially. Needless to say I was alone all the time, and still am a lot to a certain degree (commuting student, older, SO works all day etc.) but the difference is now I'm usually okay with that. \n\nThat time I wasn't in school gave me a chance to figure out who I really was and what I really wanted to do with my time. I discovered that I loved to cook, loved volunteering (great way to meet people btw), loved hiking, loved exercising, all kinds of things. Working during that time made me develop those social skills I was lacking because you need those to be successful in pretty much any job. From there I started going to cooking classes, charity events, book clubs, hiking trips etc. not because I wanted to even really meet people but because I was interested in the activity itself. Having interests (and the confidence to talk about them) makes you interesting and being interesting makes people want to talk to and get to know you.\n\nThat all took me years though and I'm still far from done. It's a process like anything else that's worthwhile and we all handle it differently. The way that's correct is the one that works for you specifically.",

One job that is almost guaranteed to make you friends is a job as a Resident Assistant, or some kind of mentor, or tour guide. \n4. Try and talk to people in your classes, especially as an upper classmen it usually gets to a point where you start to recognize people in classes. Just try and strike up a conversation, complain about the class, ask a question, or something random.\n\nI know it can be hard, especially with anxiety, or other time commitments, but they're just ideas.",

      "text": "College is odd. You thought you're friends with someone and one day, they drift off once they already get what they want from you. It's like people make you feel like they are your friends but in reality, you don't have. It sort of creates an illusion. Some even ask me to go with them for a drink but unfortunately, I don't like the idea of getting drunk. \n\nI feel neutral most of the time, maybe I got used to the feeling. What I don't like is when I don't have anything to do and the loneliness suddenly sinks in while lying on my bed, realizing I don't have someone to tell how lonely I am.\n\nSome say they wish they don't cry or react much on things like me. I'm not depressed, I just don't have the energy to be lonely, to cry or react on things that most people pay attention to. I just chose to not let anything destroy my inner peace, I guess.\n\nTo answer your question, loneliness is indeed a part of college experience. Those are the moments that make you think who really cares for you when you're at your lowest. Being human and a college student kinda sucks but like I said, you'll get used to it. I don't have people I could call friends in college but I have friends back in my hometown. I don't have friends now but maybe I'll have one someday. A little bit of optimism won't hurt, don't you think?",

Even when I try to start a conversation they just do anything to end it as soon as possible. Those who are more friendly have already their own lifes, their friends (often they went to the same course, because of they high school friends) and show no interest in hanging out together or just talking outside of  the Uni. Sometimes they reach to me only to help them with their assignments, but this Is the kind of relationship I distaste. I don't want to be someone's private tutor just so I have a human being to talk to. \n\nI think that my language is a big problem (fluent but sometimes I struggle to understand people when they speak really fast) and also the fact that I'm just this \"quiet eastern european guy\" gives me some stigma.",

This particular university is HUGE on Greek life and I never joined because it was wayyyy too expensive. I had a really cool roommate my first year and built a really close friendship. After her first year she transferred back home and then I had no friends. Joined a major related sorority but still managed to have zero friends. They\u2019d never hit me up to hang out or anything. I always felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. I became friends with a couple of older people outside of college but a majority of the time I was stuck at home with no friends. I became really depressed and was home sick all the time. I lost a lot of motivation and took a 2 year gap. Now I am back and I have a baby so I will definitely not fit in now. Thank goodness I decided to transfer to a university that has my degree 100% online. I wasn\u2019t ready to go through being a nobody and not fitting in all over again.  \nAnyway, try to keep your head up because you\u2019re not the only one who feels this way!!

How DO people do it their first semester??) and my roommate made friends with our floor mates instantly, leaving me awkward and lonely lol. \n\nI made my first friends from class *this semester* and it wasn't me who made the first move. I was outside the exam room, waiting for them to let us in for the first midterm, and this girl I've never seen before comes up to me and starts talking to me like we're acquaintance, and sits near me in the exam. The next lecture, I see her and decided to go talk to her about how her exam went. We decided to have lunch together, and now, we've never missed a lunch since then! I later asked how she just came up to me and spoke with such ease and she told me its because she was a cashier in the dining hall and (somehow??) recognized me lol. If I hadn't decided to follow up with her the next day, it would've been a lot of lonely lunches. \n\nFrom experience, putting in a little effort helps and you *can and will* make friends! It's very hard and also requires a lot of time for relationships to foster but it's worth it! Think of every semester as a fresh start to make friends in classes! It'll work sometimes, and won't sometimes, but it's always worth trying.",

      "text": "You know that venn diagram meme where it's all \"pick 2\" (social life, fitness, studying, etc)? Well, it is actually beatable. Based on my personal experience, combine your social life with your obligations. Join/start a study group. Make a gym buddy. Having a study buddy and gym buddy keeps me accountable, so I actually procrastinate less, and I actually have fun. It's a win-win!\n\nLet me preface this by saying I've been shy and socially anxious my entire life, but have been actively working on that for the last few years. \n\nNow, for the first 3 years of uni all I had were basic acquaintance friends in most classes. I knew my last 2 years would be classes with most of the same people, so in the 1st semester of my 4th year, I mustered up all my courage to approach 2 girls who seemed nice to ask them if they wanted to make a study group. \n\nThey turned me down. \n\nI, of course, felt like shit and was all \"this is why I never initiate contact/conversations!!!\" And then, 2 weeks later one of the girls asks me if I'd like to study together after all. Long story short, it's a year later and she has become one of my absolute best friends. We study a LOT together and go to the gym fairly regularly for study breaks. She also happens to be a lot more social and I've connected with other people through her, including the other girl who had turned me down, who is actually  now my roommate (and am also really close to). \n\nTLDR: step our of your comfort zone. Approach some people and ask if they'd like to start a study group. Maybe they'll say yes, maybe they won't. Usually the hardest part is breaching the \"just in class\" friends stage, and by studying together outside of it, you are way more likely to have an acquaintance turn into a legitimate friend.\n\n(Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I just finished a paper due at midnight)",

Now, those opportunities still arise for me, but I constantly have to deny them because I have so much shit to do. Its literally gotten to the point where brothers in easier courses who dont understand the academic stresses and busy work put on computer science students begin to stop inviting you to do things, because they expect me to be busy. and when im not busy, they are off doing something cause they assumed I would be at the house studying.

I couldn\u2019t make time for him because I was drowning in studying and getting enough hours at work to pay my rent. He was the only person I had and I wasn\u2019t able to properly maintain that relationship either. My second year I went from taking 5 classes to 3 and still working 30+ hours a week but it\u2019s a lot more manageable. Transitioning to adulting and also trying to find people you can genuinely relate to or even just want to take time out of your day to hang out with is sooooo freaking difficult.",

Prove that you\u2019re willing to put the effort into a relationship and often times it will be reciprocated.\n\nEffort = interest :)\n\nAlso tip to making new friends from someone who is making all his friends in the final half of college. Just start going out of your comfort zone. There\u2019s only 2 things that will happen by introducing yourself to someone new:\n\n1) You never see them again.\n\n2) You stay in touch and possibly become good acquaintances.\n\nIt\u2019s like a math equation, meet more and more people and more people will fall into slot 2.",

I can proudly say that I have a few close-ish friends, but I don't think that I am comfortable talking about personal/private topics with them, and sometimes not talking about these things with people can build up within a person and make them feel lonely, among other emotions. Especially down the home stretch that is finals week, people start to not see each other as often, which takes away from time spending with real people. I, for example, still have these close friends, but have started to drift apart due to working/studying more, and at this point I do feel a little lonely and can't wait to go home and see my family again.\n\nBest of luck making it through finals, amigos",

He was one of those super goofy guys that wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, and for that I fell instantly and loved the attention. If it wasn\u2019t for that trip, he would have never known who I was, but I was lucky enough to be sitting in the seat in front of him that day. I would be in the exact position as you, trust me. I\u2019m so shy and also dealing with a lot of other trauma, so I\u2019d have a really hard time finding a guy since I literally would never be putting myself out there because that\u2019s just not my thing (and of course, not having friends makes the chance of finding someone harder, too). I really do understand your position, and I\u2019m sorry for that. I am not outgoing so I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if it weren\u2019t for my boyfriend, but I do hope someone comes along so you can finally experience those things. I felt like I was really missing out on sex before I had it, but I realized that it seemed to be really hyped up. Nonetheless, I know it sucks to feel that way. I really really hope you find someone and also make some great friends (if you don\u2019t have them yet). Pm me if you\u2019re ever lonely or just want to talk about some of this stuff.",

To what extent has loneliness played in this or seasonal winter depression? I don't know but it sucks so much. The other day someone came by and told me I've become a form troll, but the thing is why leave my room? Normally when people leave their room there is a destination in mind. But if I have no friends that care to ask me to do anything what reason so I have to leave my dorm other than class? Every day I loose a bit more of my mind, and I just want somebody to care enough about me to think to ask me to do things with them.",
