It\u2019ll probably help a little less once I transfer to a UC but it still gave me 2 years of free school plus a small salary at this point .",

The subsidized loans interest is just paid by the government when you\u2019re in school. Also, it\u2019s not a percentage that goes one or the other it\u2019s set amounts. Also if you\u2019re mostly paying out of pocket your school is too expensive",

Without the loans I'm happy to say that it basically paid my entire tuition (I'm an in-state student) on a 15 credit schedule.
