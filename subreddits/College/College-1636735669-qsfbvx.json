  "text": "I have a huge problem because I have accidentally deleted an assignment submission that I had made before the deadline, and I\u00b4ve had to upload it again. This happened because I was also working on another assignment that I had to upload today, and I wanted to resubmit it. What I did is that I accidentally removed the submission I had made for the other subject instead. \n\n The page I had to submit it in said that late submissions without important circumstances wouldn\u00b4t be considered. I know my circumstances probably aren\u00b4t important, as I could have paid more attention to what I was doing. What kind of circumstances can the page be referring to? I am very concerned, and I\u00b4d really appreciate some help.",
