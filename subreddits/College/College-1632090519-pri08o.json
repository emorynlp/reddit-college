I feel unsafe, with COVID going on and all, people are still having large groups and parties although it\u2019s supposed to be lessened. Financially this was not a good idea as we\u2019re going into a crap ton of debt even with FinAid. We are getting financial aid for the dorm via GI Bill, so this is making me feel imprisoned. Is there any way I can cancel the payment for the dorm and move to off campus housing? Has anyone else been in this situation? Thank you in advance. \n\n***note, I am posting on behalf of a relative that doesn\u2019t use Reddit.
