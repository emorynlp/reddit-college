  "title:": "Ever feel like you had a shitty college life?",
  "text": "A couple of months ago, I graduated from high school and took the Hong Kong *Diploma of Secondary Education* Examination (HKDSE), I studied really hard but fucked up at English. And a month later, I got a not-so-good grade and an admission letter from HKUSPACE.\n\nCollege life is fascinating at the beginning, everything is new. Of course, I'm extremely excited and wanna try everything, from making new friends to participating in after-school activities, you know that feeling when you're finally free from the pressure that everyone forces you to get into college, find a good job and have a perfect life? (Especially if you're Asian) That's how I felt for the first month I got into college: The freedom, the independence and everything.\n\nBut later I realized that college life isn't as great as I expected. I got a shitty irresponsible professor that doesn't even understand the main topic of the course, so he just downloads PowerPoint from the Internet and put his name at the end of the presentation. I got tons of assignments from 5 different courses each week and I had to stay up every night to finish the essay, report and other stuff. I got 2 bad groupmates that didn't do anything for the group project, never shows up at the group meeting, and turns out that all of them dropped out of college, so I had to do everything myself. My only friend in college also dropped out because he wanted to retake the HKDSE and go to a better college.\n\nAnd the thing is, the campus isn't that bad, the facility over here is great, clean environment, beyond my expectation actually. It's the people here are shit, nobody pays attention to the class, because the students are either too smart that they don't even need to listen to the class, or they are way too bad that they can't even understand a single word the professor says. So eventually fewer and fewer people come to class, can you imagine that there are only 6 students who came to class today? And there are about 30 students enrolled in this course!\n\nSeriously, I kinda hate my college life right now, but in the meantime, what else can I do?",
