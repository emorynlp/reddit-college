Here are some tips!  \n  \n1) Leave your door open. Signals people are welcome to pop in and say \"hi.\"  \n1b) Say \"hi\" to people with their door open. It might be super scary, but come up with an ice breaker like, \u201cOh, hey, my name is X. Cool poster! I was just wondering if you knew what time food service starts in the morning?\u201d Or\u2026 \u201cThe wifi is kind of wonky in my room, how has it been for you?\u201d  \n2) Introduce yourself to the neighbors as soon as possible. It will be way more awkward introducing yourself half way through the semester.  \n3) Similar to 1b, compliment people! Especially people you know live near by, but haven\u2019t talked to yet. \u201cCool pin!\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019d you get those shoes?\u201d \u201cI like your hair.\u201d Keep it simple, don\u2019t be creepy.  \n4) If you\u2019re at food service and don\u2019t have anyone to sit with, find another lonely soul and ask if you can sit down! They\u2019re probably in the same boat as you! Ask where they\u2019re from, their major, etc., etc. Ask questions!  \n  \nWho has more to add?  \n  \n*Bonus points if you get the Radiohead reference.", "author": "e4e5nf3", "created": 1629066266, "retrieved": 1632948339, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 562, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h97eyl6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p536i9/meeting_people_is_easy/h97eyl6/", "text": "i just moved in but there\u2019s no one on my floor besides one girl and idek what room she is in because i met her last night whir washing my face. i\u2019m so nervous and alone \ud83d\ude2d", "author": "Euphoric_Clock9394", "created": 1629147200, "upvotes": 2}, "h96r6u3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p536i9/meeting_people_is_easy/h96r6u3/", "text": "Ask people questions about campus even if you already know the answer", "author": "Andydovt", "created": 1629137788, "upvotes": 1}, "h96ogx0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p536i9/meeting_people_is_easy/h96ogx0/", "text": "I live off campus, work, and am 25.

I always keep my bedroom door open if I want to say hi to my siblings. Personally, I plan to keep a comfy chair free from stuff in my room so that people can wander in, sit, and chat if they'd like.\n\nSocializing in a new place can be downright terrifying, whether it is \"I'm new here\" nervousness or ongoing social anxiety. One thing I am doing is mentally preparing myself for this exhaustion/anxiety, by telling myself\n--\"yeah, uni is going to be kind of scary to adjust to. I will have to learn all these new daily patterns, new life and social habits, and I am going to have unfamiliar safe spaces. But! I will be in a beautiful place, exploring a new life, and get to meet a bunch of funky people! And when I get overwhelmed, I can take a nap, walk to the bathroom/water fountain, or sit in the garden/library!\"--\nBasically familiarize yourself with expected stressors, and think of ways to calm down or reduce the stress - remember: good things can also be stressful, and it is okay to recover from exciting things the same way you would recover from unpleasant things. Acknowledging the stress of meeting people (as it presents for you) can help you not get blindsided by those emotions and inner thoughts as much.\n\nPersonally, I am mentally practicing getting OUT of conversations so that when I need to recharge, I can. I LOVE talking with people, but often chat to the point where I am burnt out. So, I am preparing myself to say things like \"I am really glad I got to talk to you! I need to run, but I'll see you around!\" or \"I hate to interrupt our conversation but I am pretty exhausted and have to get going. Good luck on XYZ!\" (1: Compliment conversation/person, 2: say you have to leave, 3: give a cheery farewell)\n\nWell that meandered a lot... Basically, while socializing can be \"simple\" it can also be stressful.
