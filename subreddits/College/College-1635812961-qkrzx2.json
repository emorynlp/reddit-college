      "text": "I feel that 100%. Spent my first semester through the beginning process of a toxic divorce. My best advice to you would be to find somewhere safe and as far away from verbal conflict as possible. Find family or friends that are willing to let you come over and study/do work when things escalate. It is unfair to you to be exposed to their problems, and if they don't see that then find someone that does. If you can't leave, and it really gets to you, breath, take a break, do something that takes your mind off of the situation and/or school work. Your mental health overall is more important. Also, If they attempt to drag you in the middle, ignore them and don't let their opinions of each other affect your opinions of them. Best of luck and stay safe, it will pass at some point. :)",
