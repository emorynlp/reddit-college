  "text": "I posted last week how I just moved into a campus apartment and I was somehow under investigation for something my basketball player roommates did.  After I was cleared, I moved out.  That said, the only space left on campus was a dorm.  I stayed in a dorm all four years of undergrad which is super rare and I felt ashamed because of that.  Now, I'm staying in one as a grad student which is unheard of.  I turn 26 at the end of this week and I can tell that the people here are freshmen and maybe sophomores which I do not mind at all. It just makes me feel awkward since I am much older. If I was a 23-year-old grad student, I would feel a little better but I am four years older than the traditional graduation age.  Should I feel this way?",
