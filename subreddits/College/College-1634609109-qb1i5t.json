  "text": "I posted last week how I just moved into a campus apartment and I was somehow under investigation for something my basketball player roommates did.  After I was cleared, I moved out.  That said, the only space left on campus was a dorm.  I stayed in a dorm all four years of undergrad which is super rare and I felt ashamed because of that.  Now, I'm staying in one as a grad student which is unheard of.  I turn 26 at the end of this week and I can tell that the people here are freshmen and maybe sophomores which I do not mind at all. It just makes me feel awkward since I am much older. If I was a 23-year-old grad student, I would feel a little better but I am four years older than the traditional graduation age.  Should I feel this way?",

Community colleges are better at accommodating older students but I\u2019ve already transferred.\n\nI did have one 18 year old jerk tell me today that in his opinion it was worthless for older students to be in college and we older students were taking spots away from younger ones, so that wasn\u2019t very pleasant to hear from that douche, but other than that it\u2019s ok.",
