As this is only my second week into the college, I would have said that it was going to get hard to keep up with it if it whasnt for covid. Thankfully we will have online classes and that shit will be alot faster to deal with. It will also save me time for traveling as I need your and a half to get to college. Plus that with time I spend on returning, it is safe to say it is wasting my time.\n\nIt also helps that all of my hobbies are something I do at home so it saves me additional time. This would be impossible if I was doing some sort of sport as hobbie.",
