I have a midterm in a few days and I already finished 1 chapter out of the 2 that's going to be covered as well as starting on the 2nd today. I spent about 5-6 hours studying and working on my cheat sheet and decided to call it a day and save the rest for tomorrow.\n\nAs I'm typing this on my couch, my brain is telling me to go back to studying or do some hw and I'm feeling guilty about not doing it. I know that I did a lot and need to wind down to prevent burn out but for some stupid reason I just cant.\n\nI either spend my down time worrying about what I have left to study, how im going to do my other hw in the next few days, or worry about projects and midterms that are due in a few weeks. The only time where I can fully feel satisfied is when I actually have nothing to work on for the day and the next few days after finishing everything on my planner.", "author": "LordUrkelTheGreat", "created": 1632023843, "retrieved": 1632801456, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hdf8ci3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr0ukt/feeling_guilty_for_not_studying_when_im_relaxing/hdf8ci3/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632024188, "upvotes": 1}}}
