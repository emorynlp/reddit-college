They feel like such a terrible pain to do. So I immediately get distracted without any will to touch them. I've read that you have to learn to accept the pain now to be less stressed later on. However, this just doesn't go for me. Even fear, the biggest motivator, doesn't do it for me. The fear makes me stressed to the point of sweating, but it is hard to get myself to do work.   I know that such behavior during education often leads to struggling to survive working a minimum wage or even being homeless.

For things that I know I know how to do, I can do it easily (is this the case for you?). For long lab reports and papers, or classes I\u2019m confused in, I have the same feeling as you.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to do small bits at first. Figure out how to do one thing, and do it. Then do the next. That\u2019s what people talk about when they say you\u2019ll be able to do it once you start. You start to gain confidence that you can do it, and it becomes easier.

After that get down to it.\n\nWhen I get a task I really don't want to do, I kind of work around it instead of directly at it. For example I'll think of the easiest thing I can do to make the task easier. If I have a large homework assignment, I'll just go through and underline the important parts of each question without actually trying to do it.\n\nIf I have a project to start, I'll read the instructions and underline or mark the important requirements.\n\nThen I'll try to break up the project or assignment into easily done small chunks. \n\nThen when I actually need to sit down and do work I'll only work on that chunk for thirty minutes. I'll set a timer for thirty minutes and make sure to focus only on that thing for the thirty minutes and nothing else. I'll put my phone away and block my favorite websites.\n\nThe reward will be being able to use those items or some other reward I give myself. Have a reward for working thirty minutes straight without distraction.\n\nIf you fail, no worries. Just try again until you can do it.\n\nIf after thirty minutes I feel like I'm on a roll I'll keep going.\n\nTry this out.", "author": "peregrin5", "created": 1573495325, "upvotes": 2}, "f78lgc6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/durdp7/too_lazy_to_do_work_any_suggestions_please_help/f78lgc6/", "text": "you're definitely not the only one.

You essentially just explained my entire life and... it\u2019s hard but we can get through this. I\u2019ve really only learned through college that not everyone actually feels this way, or they do but not to a debilitating level like this.

You have already made a good decision contacting others. I also struggle with lack of discipline and motivation sometimes.  \n  \nMy advice: Physically separate the place where you leisure and where you work. Go to a library or some coffee place to work, and NEVER use distracting things there (you van leave them somewhere). Your brain will associate the place with productivity. Keep this habit and you can actually achieve everything. (Today I was suprised I could do many things in my class without being distracted much - because it was a boring lecture and everything is on the pdf/ppt).", "author": "TheSpookyMan", "created": 1573490107, "upvotes": 8}, "f78bow7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/durdp7/too_lazy_to_do_work_any_suggestions_please_help/f78bow7/", "text": "I've had this exact problem ever since early high school (I'm in grad school now).

This caused me to shy away from my work and do subpar in classes as I didn\u2019t turn in a portion of my papers. However, the papers I did do and nearly all tests I aced. Figured I was just selectively lazy as I aced my SAT with a high enough score for automatic acceptance into my school of choice even though my class rank was pretty shitty tbh. \n\nFast forward into freshman year in college I failed nearly all my classes because I didn\u2019t show up and couldn\u2019t force myself to go. Branded myself a failure as my parents withdrew any financial support and I was forced to stay home this year. I decided I really needed to do something about it and went to a behavioral health specialist. Took a shit ton of behavioral tests, genetic testing and a DNA swab. Turns out I\u2019ve been manically depressed all along and the avoidance of schoolwork was just a symptom of this issue. I never got tested before because I was terrified of being labeled as such. My personal physician chose to put me on a mild antidepressant to even out my moods and then phased me into vyvanse. Since the beginning of this treatment I\u2019ve become a remarkably different student and am able to work for periods of 8 hours on end with little to no concentration or confidence issues whatsoever. The world now feels like such a brighter place and I have so much hope for my future years.\n\nI hope you get the help you need op, even if it is just a study group or club; no one deserves to live out their college years like that.
