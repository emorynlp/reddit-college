I believe there is also many different types of confidence, and you're lacking the confidence that will help you come off as intelligent. If you never say what you're saying with any authority, or if you always second guess yourself with the things you already know are true and correct, you are going to give off the impression you dont know what you're talking about in which case others may come to the conclusion you aren't smart. Whether or not they say anything about it, ultimately it's what you think they are thinking. What you believe is what they believe. Social anxiety can exacerbate this. Try not to give a fuck. Sometimes caring less is exactly what you need. You can be calm enough to just be yourself instead of someone who is trying too hard and coming off as \"stupid\".

College **is not necessary**. Listen- even if you are pretty dull academically, it's probably not even your fault. For the most part, universities teach towards **one or two** learning methods out of many. It sort of pisses me off- I'm a very intelligent person but the way this is all structured just works against me. There is so much fluffy BS that is just completely beside the point. Don't be too hard on yourself.\n\nYou could make it through college. It would require a lot of effort, and a completely different approach. Even so, it might not be worth it. You might not be happy at a job that requires a degree.\n\nInstead of trying to make it work through this one single avenue, find your strengths. What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? How could you make money from that?\n\nWhile you think about all of that, just start with a job. Any job. Work your way up. When I was 16, I worked for min. wage (9.25) at a deli. The job sucked and so did the owners. After 6mo, I found a job at a pizza place for an extra 50 cents an hour. I really liked it, it was a great community of people. I got pretty good at the job, and the owners recognized that. After a year and a half or so I was making $11/hr. When the delivery driver quit, they offered me the position, and I took it. I took home around $20/hr after taxes. The job was awesome- for the most part it was just driving around, listening to music, and delivering pizza. My coworkers were great, the customers liked me, it was just a really wholesome experience all around, and it paid very well for me being 18. \n\nSee, I got lucky being offered that job. It was one of the nicer pizza places and in a wealthy-ish location. They paid $10.50 and I got to keep all the tips, most places only paid around $6/hr for drivers. But, I had to put myself in a position to **be** lucky. So you can't just wait around, you need to create opportunities for yourself. Some will pan out, some won't. If you stick with it, you'll just keep climbing the ladder. You'll eventually find yourself in a position that you genuinely want to be in, and you will cherish it.\n\nThis is kind of a hard question to answer, because I don't know what you mean by 'a good future'. For me, that just means enjoying life and living sustainably. Money isn't that important to me, and the education I've obtained from living life is so much more important to me than anything I've learned in school. I don't need to make 70k a year to be happy. I currently make like 10k a year while in school and I'm already living happily. I have a job I enjoy (I help developmentally disabled adults do life), it pays enough ($12.60/hr, min wage here is $9.75), and I have hobbies. Don't define your success by the scale of other people.

I can now tell you I did well at the community college and am now at arguably one of the best tech schools in Massachusetts. \n\nSince my senior year of highschool I have felt very similar feelings to you and although I still hold feelings of uncertainty and low confidence in my intelligence I can share with you one thing that got me through all of it. Sure, you may actually be dumb and what that means is in terms of raw intelligence you may not be able to problem solve as quickly, or have a good memory it be able to focus (I feel like all applied to me). However there is light at the end of this tunnel. That light is the light of knowledge. Now before you say \"oh boy we got another Tai Lopez here\", hear me out.

Basic concepts come easy to me. However, once I got to college it has been total hell, because I never learned how to work. Things came so easy I never had to learn how to learn. Smart is not the end-all-be-all measure of success. Also, I am ditzy, and have been for years. I've realized that brain fog for me is hormonal--getting hormonal birth control helped. For my aunt it turned out to be thyroid issues. You might want to get a health checkup, and see if you have medical issues contributing.\n\nNow, that aside. The things we are called growing up deeply affect us. It's great that you understand that, it means you can now work past it. That won't be easy, but it sounds like it's necessary for you to have a good life. I agree that therapy would be good, but you should also do some research on mental health. Here is an article on verbal abuse:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201611/the-enduring-pain-childhood-verbal-abuse](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/tech-support/201611/the-enduring-pain-childhood-verbal-abuse) I myself had to work through some issues like that--although the words were different.\n\nAlso, here is a personality test:  [https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)  While I don't 100% buy into these things, they are useful starting-points to a) see your strengths, and b) consider the careers they suggest. I know you are posting on r/college, and that probably means you *want* to go to college. I suggest starting with community college and going for an associate's degree. If you need to get away from home and those toxic put-downs, choose a school far from home--even if it is in the same state.  \n\n\nIn addition, if you don't think college is the right choice for you, there are vocational schools, and jobs that teach you as you go along. I don't know if there is a Workforce in your location, but when I was done with high school I took their job readiness course that helped me write a resume and apply for jobs.

So, after awhile I slowly sunk into the persona of someone who is dumb and eventually many other people began to believe that I was indeed dumb. Before I started to act and think dumb, I was a straight A's student who was at the top of my class. But acting dumb led me to suffering in my grades and other parts of my life. Eventually towards my junior year of high school I decided I cannot go down the route of being dumb, so through a process of being more open and extroverted about my education and everything else, I was able to raise my grades and start feeling a lot smarter. I'm still in the process of becoming my best smart self, but it's possible to get smarter. Everyone has their own strengths in intelligence, you just have to sharpen it rather than dull it.
