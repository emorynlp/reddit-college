That way you don\u2019t jump into some random field just because it\u2019s \u201cemployable\u201d only to discover a) all the jobs it qualifies you for are awful in your view or b) you didn\u2019t have to major in it to get the job you want. The way to do this is to look at job listings and see what qualifications they require or recommend. Except for very specialized stuff, usually multiple kinds of degrees are accepted (for example, many basic data analyst positions accept math, physics, and Econ majors, among others). \n\nIf you have no idea what you want to do, then I guess the next best thing is to think about what kind of skills you want to develop and then take the classes that map onto those skills. \n\nBut also keep in mind that in many cases your previous experience is far more valuable than what words are on your degree. If your school has good career resources and you are otherwise able to, internships are very good for getting your foot in the door and differentiating yourself somewhat. But it\u2019s also kind of a chicken and the egg thing since a lot of internships prefer other majors, so ymmv.\n\nAlso, this dichotomy between \u201cdoing something you like\u201d and \u201cdoing something that makes you money\u201d isn\u2019t entirely true. I\u2019m sure there are things that combine both, or at the very least there are things that make you money that won\u2019t make you completely miserable. So like don\u2019t just pick up a python coding book and tell yourself you have to be a programmer if that\u2019s not something you want to do.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019re going to minor, I would strongly pick Econ over business. It\u2019s valued just as much or at least nearly as much as business on your resume, and also it\u2019ll teach you much more useful things.

If you have no idea what you want to do, there\u2019s no shame in waiting. Asking an 18 year old who likely has had no responsibilities or obligations yet to take on the task of picking the direction for their life before they\u2019ve even experienced the world yet is crazy to me. Waiting can be a smarter choice sometimes. Get a job. Get another job. Get several, different jobs. Find out what your work ethic really is like, what work schedules you prefer, what your skills are, how social you like your jobs to be. That stuff can be way more valuable and tell you more than taking some gen ed classes you barely care about. Plus, waiting later can make college more affordable if you have middle class parents who don\u2019t qualify you for financial aid, since you\u2019re considered independent at 24. \n\nThat said, I got a degree in something I loved my whole\nlife (creative writing), and a second degree in something I thought I would like well enough (teaching), but that could pay bills until my passion became my \u201creal job.\u201d I wound up having my love of writing almost completely stamped out. Seriously, I didn\u2019t write anything for years after undergrad, not because I wasn\u2019t talented or well-regraded in my program, but because enjoying something for the craft and approaching it from an academic perspective are completely different. I also discovered I hated the rat race of academia, which is kind of necessary if you want to go into humanities. My backup career didn\u2019t work out either because most careers involving the humanities unfortunately come with demoralizingly low pay, and teaching is one of the more brutal examples. I lasted about two years before I decided to bartend, and now I\u2019m completing a professional certification for something unrelated in a field that pays well and does not require a college degree.\n\nAnyway, this is long but I\u2019ll try to wrap it up. My number one advice is that unless you have full financial aid and you know for sure what you want to do (as in, you\u2019ve already spent summers shadowing a professional in the field or interning, plus maybe have taken some low level coursework and know you\u2019re good at the subject), I wouldn\u2019t go to college right away and I would explore career-track associates degrees or technical training fields that pay decently. If you\u2019re set on four year school at 18, as someone who has been there and done that, don\u2019t major in humanities right now. We\u2019re very possibly going into a major recession, if not depression, and while you think that may not affect you right now, we have no idea how long this could last. I have friends who work in museums and are lawyers and they\u2019re getting laid off left and right. Study something practical and recession proof. If you absolutely must study humanities, get a minor or just take all the electives you can. \n\nAnd if you just think you\u2019ll be completely miserable doing a job outside humanities, look for a stable career that utilizes the liberal arts skills you have, but doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to dedicate your whole degree to it. I\u2019m learning voice writing to become a certified court reporter. I studied English for four years, so I have excellent grammar and writing skills, plus I became good at cranking out multiple research papers at a time, so hopefully that helps me get transcripts proofread quickly. Maybe you decide to major in computer science, but you have a passion for social studies and that helps you find a niche creating applications for education systems.\n\nAnyway. This may be an unpopular opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I hope anyone who reads this is happy with what they\u2019re doing, because at the end of the day, that\u2019s the only way to get through it.", "author": "smutwitch", "created": 1587960472, "upvotes": 2}, "fopfqll": {"link": "/r/college/comments/g8fah1/how_do_you_reconcile_studying_something_youre/fopfqll/", "text": "I would major in what you are passionate about and get a minor in something practical.

I recommend adding a complimentary field to whatever your major is. So for example, sociology can go hand in hand with business, computer science, statistics, economics, marketing, etc. This really rounded me out and gave me additional perspectives I didn't get from sociology alone.\n\nAfter I graduated, I found a position as a market research assistant. Then I worked my way up and got a job as an analyst mostly doing statistics. Then I was able to use that to launch myself into the dream job I have now! I love what I do and it's all thanks to having that clear path forward from my studies in college.\n\nFinal piece of advice: learn some programming! Knowing even a little bit of Python will help you SO much in your job search, no matter the position.\n\nThere are tons of jobs right now that involve data analytics in all sorts of fields.

I was in an arts management program for a while until I left an extremely unethical internship my school set up for me. I would have saved myself loads of anxiety if I had followed my heart much earlier and chose Art. I have several people I know irl who have asked me for advice about art school. My feelings are this: if it is something you love strongly and identify with there is no other choice. That said, be smart about where you go (this has nothing to do with cost or prestige btw). I switched majors (started out biomedical engineering) and got my self in a tough place grade wise for a bit and I couldn\u2019t transfer colleges. For this reason I chose the switch into Buisness rather than Art. My schools art program had no education for animation, illustration, digital art, graphic design etc. and had a complete lack of marketing education to aid in students success. They had a fantastic theatre and dance program and film(movies) was good too but those weren\u2019t for me and I knew their sculpture, figure drawing, printmaking and film photography programs weren\u2019t going to set me up for success in the modern art market. If I had gone elsewhere  where they were more up to date and interested in setting students up for a more profit centric success I think that would have been super fun and a smart financial choice. It\u2019s important to remember art or any other \u201crisky\u201d choice presents itself in many different ways. Sure there are obvious art jobs like teaching art or selling paintings but there are also people who work on book covers, design packaging, make costumes for plays, work on the movies and tv you binge watch. Art is everywhere and if you play it right with an art degree you will find something interesting that also pays you a livable income. I\u2019m happy with the path I chose. I can always go back to school for a masters in art or art history. I have the foundation and it helped to break up my semesters and I honestly think I owe it my life as I had a horrific college experience (I graduated last December). Whatever you choose to do will work out. Getting a college degree is proof that you are willing and able to learn. That you can think for yourself.
