The only friends i had at my cc were the ones that also went from my high school, & then the occasional friend i\u2019d only talk to in that one class. But after transferring to university ive already made friends, met so many cool people, & am just really happy with university life. Just grind out ur cc with immaculate grades, join a honors society at ur cc so that u have a good chance of transferring, & then when u get into a University, enjoy it man, enjoy the fruits of your hard work. But if you dont plan on transferring to a university then unfortunately you wont get much of that \u201ccollege experience\u201d at a CC, at least in my experience.",
