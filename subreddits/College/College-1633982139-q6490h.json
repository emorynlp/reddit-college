  "title:": "I hate my roommate. What should I do?",
  "text": "\nI hate being with my roommate for several reasons. For starters, there\u2019s literally nothing in common between us except school, and i hate to talk about school with him because l feel he always judges my mistakes, for example if i get a problem wrong in math he would say something like \u201cheey what\u2019s up with you? How can you get this wrong?\u201d or whenever he sees me studying he would come to investigate what I\u2019m studying then saying \u201cOh, this question is easy\u201d and then proceeds to explain the whole idea of the problem even though I didn\u2019t ask for it, and he constantly reminds me of my mistakes in math.\n\nRecently, i had a writing exam, I did good for the most part, but I forgot to add a concluding sentence out of nervousness. I wasn\u2019t mad about that mistake because I actually did good in the rest of the exam, but guess what, my roommate said \u201cHow can you forget the concluding sentence?! You always forget things! you have concentration problems! \u201c. I told him why is he mad if it\u2019s not even his grade, he replied \u201cbecause I consider you as my brother (note: this phrase is common between friends in my country for signaling friendship)\u201d. That happend before twe weeks, today he reminded me of this mistake again and told me not to do it next time. I actually fear to tell him my grades or to show him my mistakes because I hate the way he regards my mistakes.\n\nI stopped studying in my dorm to avoid him because of previous reasons and because he studies loudly, and interrupts me during studying by asking questions in physics (when he asks me he says \u201cI totally understand this problem but i just want to confirm my understanding\u201d and then he start explaining the whole problem for two minutes). There are a ton of other reasons but that would be too long.\n\nI\u2019m an introvert, and I have social anxiety, I don\u2019t know how to approach him about these problems, and I can\u2019t comprehend that I will stay with him for 4 years. Am I just sensitive or is this really irritating?",

      "text": "that is a tough situation. your problems are definitely valid.  unfortunately, the longer you let this go on, the worse it is going to get.  the longer you let him treat you like this, the harder it will be to make him stop.  i know it is easier said than done, but it would be best if you put your foot down and told him exactly what is bothering you.  if you live with him, i am certain you will have the time to eventually understand where each other is coming from.",

      "text": "I don't understand, do you chat with him and not drink enough water?\n\nOkay, I read it again, he studies loudly and ask a lot of questions. He forces you to talk to him subtlely (typo), is that correct.\n\nUm, you're a social science major and he's the STEM major, is that right?",
