  "text": "hey all - just a quick poll. \nit\u2019s currently 7:30 in the morning, i just picked up the morning shift for work since someone else quit. i hate mondays because i go to community college (30 min drive away) and while i used to love my schedule my advisor tacked on another class at night. so my monday schedule kind of goes like 2-4:30pm is one class, 6-9pm is my next. it\u2019s not even worth it to go home after my first class since i\u2019ll basically just be coming right back and today i actually don\u2019t have any homework to do during my time between the classes so i would just kind of be sitting there. i\u2019m exhausted today, and i don\u2019t think i\u2019ll be able to take staying there until 9 and then getting home at 9:30-10 depending on traffic. \n\nit\u2019s just a lecture so we don\u2019t really get any work. we didn\u2019t have any homework that i know of and the syllabus says there\u2019s no test/quiz today - should i just skip? im seriously considering it lol",

      "text": "This is a sign from god. I was literally just thinking the same thing abt one of my classes\u2026 7:30 in the morning. I think you should tbh, try to get notes from a classmate.\n\nMy situation is more my fault tbh. I waited to study for a test I have later today (2-3) til the last min. I\u2019ve also got a class 11-12 that I\u2019m thinking of skipping so I can study. The prof in the 11-12 class always calls on me and the class is being observed today, im scared of her tbh and last class I had a panic attack afterwards. I just don\u2019t think I can take a test when I am panicking and haven\u2019t studied enough?? Idfk",
