It may help you down the line as you apply for good paying jobs.  For profit colleges to some employers is a disqualifying factor.  However, the number one reason to stay away is the overwhelming debt that can be accumulated for a degree that is looked at as having little value.  You don't want to be owing hundreds of thousands for a degree that may not even get you an entry level job.

I know, nationally sounds better, right? It's not. Regional is the legit one.\n\nAccreditation is basically a list of standards and guidelines that a group of schools have agreed to hold themselves and each other to, in terms of what is required for the school to confer a degree of a given level. It's essentially an agreement that a degree from University A and a degree from University B both require more or less the same type and amount of work to receive, so it's possible to compare them in a meaningful way. It's also what allows you to transfer credits from one school to another, or enroll in a program at School B after completing a degree at School A and have your School A coursework count toward prerequisites at School B. A non-accredited school hasn't agreed to the same guidelines, so holding a degree from one of those schools doesn't \"mean\" the same thing as a degree from a regionally-accredited school. If you can't find anything about \"accreditation\" specifically on a school's website, that in itself is a red flag, but if they say \"credits may not transfer,\" that's an even redder flag. If you start your degree at ITT Tech/DeVry/University of Phoenix/Everest/one of these other for-profit scam schools advertised on daytime TV, you can't transfer to a real school partway through. Well, you can, but none of the credits you earned at Scam U will transfer and you basically wasted that time and money because you'll have to redo all that coursework at Legitimate College.", "author": "tehzephyrsong", "created": 1565624448, "upvotes": 97}, "ewoq21f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cpc6yd/stay_clear_of_for_profit_colleges/ewoq21f/", "text": "This cannot be stressed enough.
