  "text": "Okay so I live in California and go to a state school. \nMy first job pays 16/hr, but I literally only get 6 hours a week. My potential 2nd job pays 16.50/hr, and i\u2019m hoping to work at least 20-25 hours combined.\n\nNow my question boils down to: How much can I make before it affects my FASFA? I keep hearing mixed numbers, I want to see if anyone can clear it up :)",

      "text": "You should talk to your schools financial advisors about this. The number is likely specific to the exact city you live in. I also live in California although I don't get FAFSA. However I know how varied income rates are and what's considered low or average. I mean, San Francisco has low income listed around $80k for a single person last time I looked. It's stupid crazy.",

It's a little easier to use than trying to call them because I make an appointment and then wait at home for them to let me into the session.",
