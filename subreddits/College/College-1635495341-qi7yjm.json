Trust me. You\u2019ll get bored of it all soon enough. Invest some, be generous, if you really are itching to spend it, buy tickets to games and go to theme parks and stuff with friends. Buy experiences and live a bit.\n\nBut for the most part, chill out and enjoy not having to stress about where next month\u2019s rent comes from.",
