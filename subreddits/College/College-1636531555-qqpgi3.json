  "text": "In high school, I\u2019m so used to every homework being graded for completion. Now, in college, the problem sets are worth anywhere from 25-40% of our grades. How can I make sure that I score high on homeworks by checking my answers? It\u2019s not like I can ask a TA or my professor \u201cis this right\u201d for every question on weekly problem sets.",
