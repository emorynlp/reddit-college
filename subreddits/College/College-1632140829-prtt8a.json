I am a Computer Science major halfway through my associate's degree in community college \\[got out of the military and going back to school\\]. The best we have here in San Antonio is UTSA which I think is like a tier 2 college if I'm not mistaken. I want to aim to get accepted into UT Austin; although, it's extremely hard and while I currently have a 4.0, I have no idea if that will be the case by the end of graduation. As you can imagine this puts a lot of stress and pressure on me to do well because I have the fear of \"if I don't get into a good school, I'll have to settle with UTSA and then I won't get great job offers!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I ask y'all, what's the truth behind my worries here?

If you go to an excellent school, that is like the cherry on top that can help you get interviews at top tech companies, but there are tons of people from random schools or without degrees working at google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. because they're very smart or worked extremely hard. On the other end of the spectrum, there are people who went to great schools because they worked hard in high school but lost that drive and ended up getting mediocre jobs or not even being able to find one. One of my friends went an ivy for computer science, graduated 2020, but his experience at school was so bad that he rarely did any outside programming and put no effort into interviews, and he can't find a job.
