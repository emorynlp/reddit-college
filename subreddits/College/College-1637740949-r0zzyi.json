  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and I am doing terribly in French. I took Spanish in HighSchool but for some reason I got it in my head that it would be cool to learn French. Very big mistake. I\u2019ve already decided to just \u201crestart\u201d my language credit and am registered for Spanish next semester. I\u2019m so tired of French though and any motivation I had before is gone now that I know I don\u2019t need it to graduate. I\u2019ve skipped a week of class and I\u2019m so close to just not going anymore and failing the class. I\u2019m so worried about failing though because I\u2019ve never failed a class before.
