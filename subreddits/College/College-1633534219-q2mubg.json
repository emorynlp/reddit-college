  "text": "I have a statistics class in a large auditorium with about 20 some people. On the far left side of the room is a girl that I find attractive, but I don't know how to approach her since I sit on the completely opposit side of the auditorium. We exit through opposite doors also. I have never interacted with her and I don't even know her name. I also can't just go and sit next to her because this prefessor is super strict about social distancing so we have to sit in the same seat every class. Any advice yall could give would be super helpful. Thanks!",
