  "title:": "Charged Academic Misconduct? What to do?",
  "text": "I'm really terrified and need advice. During my class, we were doing a coding problems, a classmate asked me about a HW problems, I didn't think much of it and type in a few word of her laptop, the prof spotted us and sent us charges for Academic Misconduct and we will get 0 on that assignment. Does this mean I'm not getting a job ever, since employer don't choose student with academic misconduct? Should I go to the college hearing panel to explain to them the situation?",
