  "text": "I am a first time college student in my first quarter. I am taking a statistics class which is pretty difficult. I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how \u201cgracious\u201d he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won\u2019t be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless. I felt berated. Even if he is right, I felt it was very unprofessional to write such a long and intense post directed at his students. Am I wrong or overreacting to this? I feel as though many college students who are in this class have probably been in college longer than me yet if they still feel as though something is wrong then maybe they are right.",

In my eyes, class time should be going over ALL of the material that will be tested over. Otherwise, why come to class? Might as well just take the test just for shits and giggles. \n\nThat being said I don\u2019t think it was unprofessional to write the announcement. The way he worded it may be unprofessional, but if it\u2019s that great of a concern then the right thing to do would be to address the situation.",

      "text": "Seeing some of the responses on this shocks me. You are not wrong for thinking your professor went overboard. He made it very clear the email was a threat to any student who criticized the exam the second he mentioned deducting points for clarification. I took Stats and struggled a lot, even with the added on lab class for extra help. I ended up passing with an A, but that resulted from me putting in 110% and trying my best on my own to find the connections between everything. Were there times when I was angry? Times I bawled my eyes out because my professor did the bare minimum that was required and I had to teach myself sometimes? You bet. In my experience, college is filled to the brim with imperfections and inconsistencies. One professor could be amazing and teach students not just memorizing formulas but applicable concepts. Another could simply do the bare minimum and not be willing to take any constructive criticism/questions. And guess what? You pay the same amount in tuition for either professor. It truly sucks. I\u2019m very sorry you have to go through this. I truly wish our education system was more consistent when it comes to situations like this. Wishing you the best of luck. Also I do think it\u2019s worth it to possibly contact higher ups about the way he went about communicating with his students. It was not appropriate. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to leave him a professionally worded review on rate my professor either.",

      "text": "I side with the professor on this.\n\nAs you are a first term freshmen, you should be prepared to encounter several surprises at how different college is compared to the sheltered environment of high school. It's okay, we all had to. You'll learn and adapt quicker than you know.\n\nI'll try to explain my perspective, as maybe it's similar to your professor's.\n\nThe first thing to remember is that this isn't high school anymore. Only a few students should get the highest marks, even if all the others put in all the effort they can muster. The bar and the quality of your competition have both been raised. \n\nIn my evaluation of students, I'm not only evaluating students' command of the concepts but also trying to identify and highlight exceptional students. This fails if the evaluation methods are too easy and too many students achieve exceptional grades. \n\nPerhaps an example would be illuminating -\n\nMy institution has explicitly defined A+ (90s) as masterful, As (80s) as advanced, Bs (70s) as competent and Cs (60s) as adequate. Our guidance is that a student of ordinary (which isn't the same as average) skill and talent with ordinary effort should attain competent proficiency.\n\nAn informal guideline of mine is that if you get an A+ in the course, I would probably hire you as a teaching/instructional assistant for the course.\n\nAnd in a nutshell, that is the standard upon which I design assessments and how I grade.\n\nSo, in order to be able to test at each level of proficiency, my assessments need to be multi-level. In practice, this means having giving questions I know only some in the class have the ability to solve and questions I know only few in the class have the ability to solve.\n\nI need to make sure the ordinary student exerting ordinary effort doesn't get an 80 or a 90, so I can identify those advanced and masterful. If most students get 80s and 90s, if class average is in the 80s, that means the assessment scheme has been defeated.\n\nDoes that mean I expect and target a class average for the mid 70s? For upper level courses, yes. But I don't do so for lower level courses. The reason being that there is always a significant proportion of students in those classes who aren't ready for and sometimes aren't even interested in the course or college level work in general. These courses I expect and target a class average in the high 60s.\n\n**Now, about the exam itself...**\n\nYour situation is exactly what I expect to happen in a first year non-terminal stat course.\n\nIn my opinion, test/exam questions are supposed to be challenging and test the *limits* of a student's understanding of and ability to apply and extend the concept.\n\nThey are not to test just a student's mechanical ability to do standard-form practice problems. That's what quizzes are for and why I weight them low. I expect every student who does the minimum to get 80+ on my quizzes and every student who does the average to get 100. I consider them to be merely mandatory practice (also as an opportunity for students who put in the effort to bump up their mark).\n\nAs such, no, test and exam questions should not look like anything students have seen before. That would not be challenging and wouldn't test students' upper limits against the higher proficiency levels. The questions should confuse and not be straightforward. But students should have developed the skills, knowledge and intuition from the course and prerequisite study necessary to figure it out, with some thinking and creativity.\n\nI realize students expect rehashed practice questions with the numbers changed around for tests and exams. They best disabuse themselves of that notion quickly.\n\nFor the stress, I suggest you figure out some coping strategies and access your school's mental health services if you need to. It is important develop these strategies and become resilient. However it is not your statistics prof's responsibility to ensure you don't get stressed by bad grades.\n\n**Now, about your professor's r\u00e9ponse...**\n\nI empathize with him. Some students are remarkably entitled and it's especially annoying if there is several and if they are persistent. I can feel his frustration.\n\nIs it acceptable? I think it falls within the boundary of acceptability. Based on your commentary it seems that he is quite emotional and upset. Is sending emotional and upset emails professional, strictly speaking? No. But remember your professor is also a person. I would not be surprised if you or your classmates sent similar emails to him as well. \n\nIs it nurturing? No, but I don't believe it's the professor's responsibility to be nurturing - college is for adults not children. Thus, I believe profs shouldnt have to sugarcoat things and they can be as intense, candid and harsh if they so choose, provided they are not abusive. That said, I also think many students enter college too unprepared, immature and goddamn young for us to maintain a rigorous and competitive environment. Not to mention, too many students enter college, many of whom I don't believe should.\n\nSo yes, I think it's acceptable for him to be telling your class like he sees it and to berate you guys. You're not children.\n\nI see what he's doing with the challenge. He's trying to limit frivolous appeals of which I'm sure there will be many, so he introduces a penalty function. Clever, but I disagree with this action - shouldn't ever penalize a student for seeking help/clarification/rectification.\n\nWhat he should have done is asked his colleague or department chair to review the exam for fairness based on the class material.\n\nAnyway, I hope all this helps you understand one professor's perspective (mine) on your situation. Likely different than how your professor and other professors see it, of course.",

It's basically \"Can you write the entire assignment again, but in more and different words?\" No. I wrote back asking him to specify what parts he was confused about.

I am aware this is college but I feel as though this class is a little crazy for an introduction to statistics class. I noticed some students on the discussion boards saying it can take them 6 hours to do one assignment. It usually takes me anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half and we have classwork every day, including weekends. It\u2019s pretty intensive. I am also learning binomial distributions and all that stuff. Like I said, I am aware it\u2019s college and it\u2019s obviously going to be harder and more time consuming, but it sure feels like it is a lot to expect students to \u201cthink outside of the box\u201d and be able to apply the material in all different types of ways. I work really hard and want to be successful! I was really proud of my 98% in the class before the midterm. I am also the kind of person who you described like \u201ctake the formula, use it to solve the problem, very straight forward\u201d basically. I wish he would at least hold one live class weekly or have even marked down the things I got wrong on the midterm so I could study more and learn from it. Maybe I am in for a harsh reality? Hah, I am trying to stay positive for now! Anyways sorry for the rant and it probably wasn\u2019t too relevant to what you posted but I really appreciated your comment!",

You probably didn\u2019t learn the concepts and were not able to apply knowledge. College requires more than memorizing.  The prof was right to shut down the whining. It grows if ignored and hurts everyone\u2019s learning environment. Students then feel entitled to always complain when their grades are not what they desire. If not shut down, they will do it to another prof and the whole atmosphere at the college becomes negative and students think complaining and pressuring get results they want. It can cross over into outright bullying and harassment of profs very quickly. The prof should not need to put up with such pressure from students. It\u2019s fair and wise for the prof to expose the baselessness of the whining. You are not coddled in college. In stats, students need to be able to transfer concepts to new cases they have not seen and recognize what concepts to use to solve it. This tests if they actually learned anything.",

              "text": "That is not necessarily true - about a disparity in grades showing a problem with teaching. It depends on admission requirements. If the univ has admissions that brings students with varying abilities, there will be some who find it easy and others who are \u201ctrying\u201d college and maybe will find it is not for them. If admissions standards are rigorous, then it is true, most should be able to learn the material; however, they may not have an aptitude for that subject. Also, when colleges use grades more than test scores to admit, they get wide variance in abilities because HSs grade with differing levels of rigor. Statistics,l is very conceptual. If is more about knowing when to apply which concept than the math itself. Univs with more open admissions cannot teach to the bottom. They allow many to get into college but need standards in who passes classes. This is a big difference from HS where classes are usually taught to the bottom percentile. College is voluntary and profs are there to teach specialized knowledge, not to ensure everyone earns a trophy. Not everyone has ability to be a physicist, for instance. Should all physics profs make class easy enough so everyone who tries passes it or earns an A or B?  I chose physics because it is typically viewed as difficult. We all have different abilities. If colleges took the view everyone should be able to do week based on effort, the degrees would become useless.  If students struggle in stats, it is not helpful to blame the prof. It is quite possible some students do not have an aptitude for it and need to major in disciplines not requiring it. This view everyone is able to learn the same things and we all have equal abilities is nonsense.  It\u2019s not elitism to think this. It is common sense and evidence based. The problem is in k-12 frequently students are coddled.  College is a place where finally intellectual ability is rewarded and students have to find out what their limits are. The limits need to be tested and stretched. This means some classes will be very difficult for some students. Last note:  Most these comments sound as if students are not supposed to be using a textbook or materials they can find online to help them learn. The view seems to be, \u201csit in class and all will be revealed.\u201d  Students need to do the work outside of class. If they do not understand a lecture because the prof was not teaching it the bottom third of the class, or was assuming students had read the chapter before coming, try reading the textbook and looking online for additional video lectures. You may be amazed how much reading the text helps. If you cannot understand the text either, the issue is with the student\u2019s aptitude, not the prof.",

To say it didn't end well would be an understatement, the highest grade was something like below a 50%.\n\nThe second professor, who taught the same language but focused on a different principle/method of programming in that language, made sure we *understood* everything. Some of those ways were explaining what each method/library/whatever would do and why it would do it or by giving us broken code and having us fix it but not telling us what was broken in the code.\n\nNow, the things I learned in the first class were built upon in the second class, so I had little to no fucking clue of why anything did anything from the start. Thankfully, my professor (2nd professor) had open office hours and offered to schedule me for the same time every week an hour or so before class and made sure I understood everything. I went from having no clue of what in the actual fuck was going on to helping classmates understand why their code wasn't working and help them debug their code.\n\nIt was the professor's job to teach me enough to understand it. How to do those things and do them properly (or figure out why it wasn't working properly) was up to me.",

I think we're seeing a collision of two different trends that are setting students back a few years in their academic development so they're not getting the dot-connecting mindset another commenter mentioned.\n\nThe first thing is standardized testing, and this has to be seen in the context of students going through multiple phases of understanding questions and answers. First you learn what the answers are and that's the answer basically because a teacher or book said so. Later, you can start to understand how they got to that answer. Then you have to grapple with questions that have no clear right answer and you're thinking about what the best answer is, and so on. But, standardized testing keeps students locked in those first two boxes. Education becomes about memorizing as much of a finite amount of information as possible then repeating it on a test.\n\nWe end up with students who are significantly behind in both their ability to do analytical thinking, but also in their instinct that it's what needs to be done.\n\nThe second thing is helicopter parenting. Without going into a ton of detail here, a big effect of kids growing up with little or no unsupervised play is that they have less developed problem solving skills. Well, as it turns out, a ton of higher education is problem solving. You've got a toolbox, and a completely new problem and you have to figure out what tools to use in what way.",

They probably *did* help them develop academic grind skills though.\n\nBased on the number of students who I get asking questions that are clearly answered in the syllabus or assignment sheet, it seems a lot lack basic problem solving, not just interpersonal problem solving.\n\nI also get tons of students who lack a lot of basic technology skills, like how to insert a page break, or how to do hanging indents, or how to paste text without wrecking their essay formatting. These are all things that can be fixed without about 30 seconds on Google, so the prevalence of these problems (even after being told these are things to fix!) suggests either a lack of problem solving skills in general, or some sort of higher order problem where they're not recognizing that the person in charge of fixing the problem is them.",

Everything can be forgiven with the flimsiest of excuses. Schools are highly incentivized to increase graduation rates, increase college acceptance rates, and minimize calls from angry parents. There's no bonus awarded for failing students who ought to fail or for giving a C to a C student.\n\n>For the first semester freshmen, I don't think that this necessarily reflects a lack of thinking skills, because these quite literally are sometimes people who have never been forced to figure things out on their own.\n\nIf they haven't had to figure stuff out on their own, then yeah, I think it is a lack of thinking skills. I don't think it's a lack of thinking *potential*, but this is something brand new to them, instead of a muscle they've been building for a long time.\n\n>After then, though, I have a hunch that they know that they should be taking responsibility but they disagree with it, so they refuse to take responsibility and continue to play the helplessness game.\n\nOkay, that's something I want to hear more about. Disagreeing with taking responsibility? I don't quite follow.\n\n>That probably came out a bit harsh. \n\nMy caveat is that it's more the result of the choices of their parents and teachers, and less anything they've done.

Whereas the multiple choice and 4-5 free answer questions were similar to the review packet homework and notes that one problem would be an application question. Like real life application where one I remember was using planetary color shifts to describe if it was getting closer or not, another where the rear view mirror with an attached momento gave an angle and using that you could get the speed. \n\nThis may sound unfair it really wasn't as he gave 7/10 points for those problems with just setting it up. \n\nI think that one problem to him told the truth of where his class was. It's not a cut and paste question but required a bit more depth. \n\nHe was also extremely engaging with demos and after school sessions for review as well as special sessions for AP practice. He also kept his lessons written down and refined over time, from the jokes and the material used. Hands down one of the best teachers I had.",

          "text": "Great response. This is an issue in the field of Computer Science as well at introductory level. It explains why there are so many online tutorials yet still a lack of skilled CS workers. \n\nAs a faculty, I understand this problem this way. When students are taught the equations and theories and even real world examples in class, it is typically in the format of: Go from A to B. In more detailed classes, one might even learn that to get from A to B, you need to go through C. What is not often taught is that how did you know to get to C in order to go from A to B. In other words, we, faculty, often fall in to the trap on teaching students what we know, but not able to show students how did we come to know what we know. \n\nThis is why asking questions in class is important. Most faculty want you to learn, but we don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, we only think the most obvious: the technical contents are what you don\u2019t know. Only when you tell faculty what you don\u2019t know under the form of questioning, then faculty can go back and address these missing contents. \n\nThe upcoming area of Learning Education research is trying to address this issue. I recommend taking the free Learning how to learn course on Coursera to know more.",

I managed to get an A+ on my exams, but was still frustrated enough by the experience to file a complaint with the dean.\n\nMy brother is a stats professor and when I kvetched to him, he said exactly the same thing you did\u2014it\u2019s an easy trap, as a math teacher, to assume your kids are getting the big picture when you\u2019re only presenting them with small, extremely specific problems and formulas.\n\nThe teacher spent almost the entirety of each class on what I can only explain as the grammar of stats\u2014proper formatting, documenting, etc\u2014rather than the bigger picture of exactly what we were doing WITH the math and why we were using it in the first place and how it applied to different problems or situations. So kids focused hard on the grammar without learning how to answer a broader statistical question, as it were\u2014and even in other disciplines, focusing primarily on style over substance would result in a nonsense paper just as it resulted in nonsense stats exam answers.\n\nIt\u2019s been years and I\u2019m STILL stressed out when I think about that class and how none of us knew what was expected of us or what the professor wanted us to be learning. :)",
