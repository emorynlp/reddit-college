I am taking a statistics class which is pretty difficult. I understand the material decently well and manage to get 90-95 on my tests. For the midterm exam, I felt beyond stressed out because a lot of the questions were completely different from the material I had learned and I felt confused. I ended up getting a 65 on the exam. Apparently, many students felt the same because the professor keeps sending emails acting very defensive in response to students telling him the exam was different from what we covered. Yesterday, he posted on the website a very long announcement that had went farther than ever before. He tried to do this deal where if anyone sent him any exam questions that were not similar to the coursework, he would give them double points if he could not prove them wrong. However, if someone sent him an example that he could prove was in the course work, he would deduct even more points. I found that odd, but then he went on to talk about how \u201cgracious\u201d he has been to make the exam match up so closely with the coursework (lol) and that college is just like this in general. He basically was saying we were lucky he was being so kind and that if we were having a hard time now then we won\u2019t be doing well in college. He called all of our complaints baseless. I felt berated. Even if he is right, I felt it was very unprofessional to write such a long and intense post directed at his students. Am I wrong or overreacting to this? I feel as though many college students who are in this class have probably been in college longer than me yet if they still feel as though something is wrong then maybe they are right.", "author": "parfaitclub", "created": 1589911902, "retrieved": 1632802414, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 879, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fra44ob": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gmtwfx/am_i_wrong_in_thinking_my_professor_went_a_little/fra44ob/", "text": "Regardless of whether or not the test matched the course, that was a very dickish move by the professor.

You are not wrong for thinking your professor went overboard. He made it very clear the email was a threat to any student who criticized the exam the second he mentioned deducting points for clarification. I took Stats and struggled a lot, even with the added on lab class for extra help. I ended up passing with an A, but that resulted from me putting in 110% and trying my best on my own to find the connections between everything. Were there times when I was angry? Times I bawled my eyes out because my professor did the bare minimum that was required and I had to teach myself sometimes? You bet. In my experience, college is filled to the brim with imperfections and inconsistencies. One professor could be amazing and teach students not just memorizing formulas but applicable concepts. Another could simply do the bare minimum and not be willing to take any constructive criticism/questions. And guess what? You pay the same amount in tuition for either professor. It truly sucks. I\u2019m very sorry you have to go through this. I truly wish our education system was more consistent when it comes to situations like this. Wishing you the best of luck. Also I do think it\u2019s worth it to possibly contact higher ups about the way he went about communicating with his students. It was not appropriate.

It's okay, we all had to. You'll learn and adapt quicker than you know.\n\nI'll try to explain my perspective, as maybe it's similar to your professor's.\n\nThe first thing to remember is that this isn't high school anymore. Only a few students should get the highest marks, even if all the others put in all the effort they can muster. The bar and the quality of your competition have both been raised. \n\nIn my evaluation of students, I'm not only evaluating students' command of the concepts but also trying to identify and highlight exceptional students. This fails if the evaluation methods are too easy and too many students achieve exceptional grades. \n\nPerhaps an example would be illuminating -\n\nMy institution has explicitly defined A+ (90s) as masterful, As (80s) as advanced, Bs (70s) as competent and Cs (60s) as adequate. Our guidance is that a student of ordinary (which isn't the same as average) skill and talent with ordinary effort should attain competent proficiency.\n\nAn informal guideline of mine is that if you get an A+ in the course, I would probably hire you as a teaching/instructional assistant for the course.\n\nAnd in a nutshell, that is the standard upon which I design assessments and how I grade.\n\nSo, in order to be able to test at each level of proficiency, my assessments need to be multi-level. In practice, this means having giving questions I know only some in the class have the ability to solve and questions I know only few in the class have the ability to solve.\n\nI need to make sure the ordinary student exerting ordinary effort doesn't get an 80 or a 90, so I can identify those advanced and masterful. If most students get 80s and 90s, if class average is in the 80s, that means the assessment scheme has been defeated.\n\nDoes that mean I expect and target a class average for the mid 70s? For upper level courses, yes. But I don't do so for lower level courses. The reason being that there is always a significant proportion of students in those classes who aren't ready for and sometimes aren't even interested in the course or college level work in general. These courses I expect and target a class average in the high 60s.\n\n**Now, about the exam itself...**\n\nYour situation is exactly what I expect to happen in a first year non-terminal stat course.\n\nIn my opinion, test/exam questions are supposed to be challenging and test the *limits* of a student's understanding of and ability to apply and extend the concept.\n\nThey are not to test just a student's mechanical ability to do standard-form practice problems. That's what quizzes are for and why I weight them low. I expect every student who does the minimum to get 80+ on my quizzes and every student who does the average to get 100. I consider them to be merely mandatory practice (also as an opportunity for students who put in the effort to bump up their mark).\n\nAs such, no, test and exam questions should not look like anything students have seen before. That would not be challenging and wouldn't test students' upper limits against the higher proficiency levels. The questions should confuse and not be straightforward. But students should have developed the skills, knowledge and intuition from the course and prerequisite study necessary to figure it out, with some thinking and creativity.\n\nI realize students expect rehashed practice questions with the numbers changed around for tests and exams. They best disabuse themselves of that notion quickly.\n\nFor the stress, I suggest you figure out some coping strategies and access your school's mental health services if you need to. It is important develop these strategies and become resilient. However it is not your statistics prof's responsibility to ensure you don't get stressed by bad grades.\n\n**Now, about your professor's r\u00e9ponse...**\n\nI empathize with him. Some students are remarkably entitled and it's especially annoying if there is several and if they are persistent. I can feel his frustration.\n\nIs it acceptable? I think it falls within the boundary of acceptability. Based on your commentary it seems that he is quite emotional and upset. Is sending emotional and upset emails professional, strictly speaking? No. But remember your professor is also a person. I would not be surprised if you or your classmates sent similar emails to him as well. \n\nIs it nurturing? No, but I don't believe it's the professor's responsibility to be nurturing - college is for adults not children. Thus, I believe profs shouldnt have to sugarcoat things and they can be as intense, candid and harsh if they so choose, provided they are not abusive. That said, I also think many students enter college too unprepared, immature and goddamn young for us to maintain a rigorous and competitive environment. Not to mention, too many students enter college, many of whom I don't believe should.\n\nSo yes, I think it's acceptable for him to be telling your class like he sees it and to berate you guys. You're not children.\n\nI see what he's doing with the challenge. He's trying to limit frivolous appeals of which I'm sure there will be many, so he introduces a penalty function. Clever, but I disagree with this action - shouldn't ever penalize a student for seeking help/clarification/rectification.\n\nWhat he should have done is asked his colleague or department chair to review the exam for fairness based on the class material.\n\nAnyway, I hope all this helps you understand one professor's perspective (mine) on your situation.

It grows if ignored and hurts everyone\u2019s learning environment. Students then feel entitled to always complain when their grades are not what they desire. If not shut down, they will do it to another prof and the whole atmosphere at the college becomes negative and students think complaining and pressuring get results they want.

It\u2019s fair and wise for the prof to expose the baselessness of the whining. You are not coddled in college.
