  "text": "Tuesday I asked the group chat who my partners are (our french teacher gave us french names for in-class use, and the group chat is only our real names). Most of the class is in the group chat and I believe that the only 2 not in it are my partners. But I do not know fully. \n\ntoday, I finally emailed the entire class. One girl in my group did respond to my email hours ago saying she has to do it on zoom (we could do it on zoom or in-person). I replied \"ok now we just need the other guy. Do you happen to have Groupme? it would me more efficient to speak on the app about this project than emailing back and fourth. She hasn't replied. The dude also hasn't replied either.\n\nIt is not even hard. We just have to speak french for 45 min. also here is the kicker, WE ALREADY HAD TO DO THIS ONCE BEFORE. The professor wants us to do it again for \"repetition\". So we already have the questions and answers for it. We just have to get on zoom, record it, and send it in. \n\nWhat should I do? its 9 PM now and I just want to go to bed...",

Since the project is only speaking french and answering questions that have already been answered, just talk as the 2 other people and write to the professor that the other 2 never responded to you. That way you will still get credit (hopefully) from the assignment and the two others can suffer the consequences.",
