  "text": "I am a senior at a University in Iowa and I\u2019m finding that most teachers really just don\u2019t care anymore and are making things easier than what they should be. I have one teacher that has yet to give us homework and it\u2019s week 7, another teacher that makes us watch \u201ceducational\u201d YouTube videos, and another who goes off topic every other second. It\u2019s nice not having a lot due but man, is my drive to do work going right out the window and anticipation for May is going up with 8 long months ahead. \nI have no clue what I want to do in May and I honestly feel like a failure to some degree. My tuition money is going into conversations that don\u2019t pertain to class, or either making me more stressed than what I think I should be. Anyone else feeling this in any way?",

              "text": "Yeah man, I went teaching due to necessity after a couple years of graduating college, so I'm basically there with the students. My peers are almost all in their 40s minimum and it's been rough on most of them. \n\nIt sucks too, because a lot of humanities and sciences (anything that you don't need a lab, basically) can be done pretty well from a distance; most of them used either Power Point or handouts for classes anyway, and all of them were lecturers. Objectively speaking there's nothing inherently lost by not being able to share a room with the students.\n\nBut there *is* a resistance by the professors to this new style of teaching, and there's definitely a generational barrier of not *wanting* to do it. A lot of teachers just flat out don't care for computers, and having to interact with one in a classroom is bad enough. Couple that with them not knowing how Google Meets or Zoom works, or even email accounts... shit sucks. \n\nBut, even in an ideal situation, once the professor has successfully gone the extra mile and adapted the curriculum to its new reality, a lot of the onus *is* on the student to figure out a way to study on their own. A student who never did homework isn't going to start now just because they can't see the teacher. \n\nThis situation has basically put a lot of courses to the test, and if a course was structured poorly, the pandemic pretty much hit it full-force. But if the course was structured alright, it... should be mostly fine, as long as the students are willing to meet lecturers halfway. \n\nFuck all courses that required labs and experiments though, that's done. I'm super glad I did all my lab work before the pandemic was ever a thing. Can't imagine.",

              "text": "I'm a teacher by trade and a psychologist by training, so I can actually offer some perspective on this.\n\nMost examinations are bullshit.\n\nWhile having tests in *general* is good, as in, pitstops to make sure everyone knows what we're talking about, most examinations are made in the same way they did back in the 1950s. That is, the professor reads the book, grabs a few sentences, and then puts those sentences on either a question format or a yes/no binary. \n\nMore often than not examinations are exercises in memorization only -- shit that doesn't get committed to long-term memory. People usually remember the mnemonic devices they use to memorize words, like OCEAN for the 5 personality types, and *thus* they remember what they should. But more often than not all those names, dates and information are going away in a week or so.\n\nThat being said, tests that either recontextualize the information *or* ask the student to recontextualize it themselves are usually pretty good as form of studying itself -- that is, the act of asking the student \"How would *you* describe what I'm asking for?\" with their own words is a really good way of actually making someone take the first step into real learning. Getting the information into the boxes it needs to get to, pretty much.\n\nThe thing is, you can just do that mid-lecture. This should already be a part of your education. This should be your homework, your after-lecture discussions, your study sessions. There's no real reason to have this be a test more than just as a checkmark. \n\nSo the fact that you've ostensibly done all the required mental labor that you should have done and it still didn't make much of a difference may just mean the education system itself just didn't prepare you for the test. Because the test, at least statistically speaking, isn't necessarily concerned on whether you learned or not -- it's concerned with whether you memorized specific data or not. \n\nYou might have learned it all and just not remembered the specific information the test considers vital, and that's a failure of the study material *and* of the test. \n\nAll this to tl;dr: I think it's usually better to have tests be about \"themes\" rather than full chapters -- like, a Psychology test about drugs should probably have a thing about neurotransmitters, something else about the social institutions of drug abuse, something historical about big pharma, etc. No real need to have an entire section about every date relevant to America's War on Drugs, though. Unless your teacher is an asshole.",

As I found out to my great chagrin, the masters-level classes in CS have rock-bottom standards because they're also teaching a lot of people who didn't take CS courses in undergrad and are doing some post-bacc work in CS. Some of the material is nice, but the grading has been really, really lenient.\n\nI am currently out of CS courses to take, so I signed up for a graduate-level abstract algebra course with the math department. I liked the linear algebra and group theory classes that I took in undergrad, so it sounded fun!\n\nWRONG. The professor is fantastic, but I have to *work*, and work hard because he has high expectations and I don't have nearly as much background in the subject as all of the math majors. So, I'm having a rough time. I'll get through it, but it's the exact opposite of a joke.",

We needed to talk. Apparently, one of my students had called my dean and said I was giving an unreasonable amount of work. \n\nThe admin MADE me make the following changes.\n\n*  assignments must be accepted, even if they were due the first week of class\n* eliminate the final exam\n\nSo sometimes admin is forcing us to cut back.

And I work at a Community College -- my students don't have the benefits of the high-powered networking opportunities that many 4-year schools provide.  We don't have \"the old school ties.\"\n\nMy students only benefit if they actually learn the work.  And I failed them in that.   I didn't prepare them as much as I could have.   And it made me sad and it made me angry, and it was unfair to the students who had busted their ass all semester.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is... you're absolutely right.    And I'm so sorry.",

THREE out of five of my classes got rid of the Final Exam because they want to either make it easier for us or have decided to have several smaller collective exams to get back into \"before pandemic learning.\"  I am all about learning and maybe shouldn't be complaining about there being a lot less work but I think that it is at a low when teachers are skipping class because they think we need our Friday off or giving us extra credit for just showing up to class three times a week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, your \"I'm so sorry\" hit me hard. Just one of those times were we have to just keep moving forward no matter the circumstances. Best of luck to you in the rest of your year Prof.",

Currently am overload with homework, so I wouldn't say its a joke lol, but certainly I would design educational programs differently. \n\nI know some classes have more credits than others and those are seen as core classes. But I would map them so that its clear to every teacher how their class should relate to every semester's core class, and I would make them work in teams with the other professors so that they keep up with what the core class professors are doing. Everyone should go at the same pace.",

Then in mechatronics my teacher is cool and funny but I haven't learned anything and I have a test due tomorrow, it was due last week but he kept forgetting to bring his answers and stuff in. He said we can use our notes and I even asked if we could use his and he said yes, but the problem is that he even admitted that he probably hasn't taught us any of the stuff on the test and that he's crazy lenient with test and will pass a student even if they got the answer wrong.\n\nSome people may think it's cool to have a relaxed teacher that jokes around and can relate to students but it isn't. I'm paying for my education and I haven't learned anything in these 7 weeks and am kinda tired of hearing about my teachers \"funny\" life. I want an education not friends. If it keeps up I'll be putting in for apprenticeships in other trades instead of racking up student debt for nothing.\n\nEdit: Got off track a little but yes, currently college is a joke for me right now.",

Because, it turns being around crime and showing up high on drugs hurts students's ability to learn. Those students didn't learn much either.\n\nThis doesn't sound like your situation.

Glorification really.\n\nIt is honestly better to enroll into a college that is driven to teach real-world current skills. To do that, is to look into each major and make your judgement.",

It's the same case here - everything is online so i have no real reason to go to in person class except for participation grades which isnt above 12% of my grade in any of my classes. It's hard to make friends because clubs aren't meeting in person, so it's like what am i doing here? It's given me a lot of time to party, but mostly solo. To say I'm lost would be an understatement.\n\nI've seen people talking about how this year's freshmen have gotten here by cheating on online classes, and you're right. I did cheat the entirety of pre-calculus because I would be stupid not to. I would have failed that class if i didn't cheat. I don't see how cheating in high school somehow equates to me performing poorly in classes because I'm depressed from lack of social interaction and structure in my life. The last year has consisted of me trying to get myself to give a fuck about anything, and i think most people my age are in the same boat. We are hyped up for  a great experience and then given this? What do you expect us to do?",

      "text": "As a freshman, I dropped out of college about a month ago after realizing that school wasn't even for me, not only because of how \"poorly\" I perform academically, but because of how the skills in college wouldn't necessarily help me in the future. Given that I struggled a lot in high school, with the extreme amounts of \"senioritis\" combined with the fatigue from remote learning due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I could only predict that if I were to keep going to school for the next four years or so, then I would end up in tremendous amounts of debt that would take forever to pay off, especially with the extreme competition for \"entry-level\" jobs (that typically require three-to-five years of experience) since I'd be competing with thousands of other applicants who went to better schools (Harvard, MIT, Cornell, etc.) with a better GPA than I would've got.\n\nThe federal government has done nothing but to rig the educational system to their advantage, especially by providing loans whenever you fill out the FAFSA. Think of how inaccurately US and world history has been taught, think of how most high schools have misled us into going into college, which led to the $1.6 trillion debt crisis that's owed by 42.9 million Americans, and even think of how schools only taught us math, science, etc. without teaching something incredibly useful like how to manage our finances wisely. It's all a fucking joke.\n\nAfter dropping out of college, I honestly feel much better because by making this insanely difficult decision, I have alleviated myself the money that I wouldn't have otherwise as well as the time and energy to invest in myself the way I want to. Fuck a 9-to-5 job, because if college was all about that big money, then those whom have pursued their education in gender studies wouldn't be broke as hell. Invest in yourself, choose your path to success, not what others' tell you to do.",
