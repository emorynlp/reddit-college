  "text": "I\u2019ve been at my school for a year and a half and the truth is I have not made a single friend that I\u2019ve hung out with, or really even enjoyed as much as some friends I used to have in high school, because everything always remains extremely surface level. I don\u2019t even know where to begin to start. my classes are huge, and I\u2019ve been in many classes where i didn\u2019t know the name of a single person. I\u2019ve done intramural sports but I never build anything that remotely lasts outside of that environment, and I don\u2019t how to reach out to anyone to maybe do something outside because I feel no confidence in my ability to mantain anyone\u2019s interest 1 on 1, and has often been the case in my life. I feel pretty lonely sometimes and don\u2019t really have a lot of confidence, and I don\u2019t understand how people meet people and actually create something that lasts. I have an amazing girlfriend who I hang out with every day, and she has great friends who are also my friends, but I\u2019m pretty sure if it weren\u2019t for her, I probably wouldn\u2019t really ever find ways to hang out with them since I never reach out to them on my own, and they are all girls, which makes me feel like a bit of an oddball and makes me wonder if I\u2019m annoying being the only guy there. Idk, I just wonder how people meet friends, and also how they actually make a lasting one too because so far it\u2019s been a lot harder than I could\u2019ve imagined",

Turns out, they wanted to hang out too but was too shy to do it. I'm in no way extroverted, but if I sit next to someone and chat every now and then, ask them if they want to exchange numbers for class purposes. Start texting them a bit. Send them things that you find funny.\n\nIt's always easier to talk about making friends than actually doing it, which sucks. Join some clubs that really interest you. A lot of people are lonely in college, so you're not alone. Good luck :)",

I\u2019m working on my third year of college and I have a few good friends. I\u2019m 27, so almost 10 years older than a majority of students I go to school with. \n\nOne friend I made at the smoking section. I smoked a lot first year because I was stressed tf out. I listened a lot, laughed when I thought something was funny, asked questions every once in a while and ended up becoming good friends with two of the girls. Some of the guys ended up sharing a blunt with me too. \n\nAnother semester I was in a biology class and was grouped with a girl who also seemed very shy. She opened up to me quickly and we got along great. Hung out every day we saw each other that semester. \n\nBut just look for someone else who is looks lonely. They may be having the same issue as you and you guys could become friends. \n\n\n\n\nTLDR; be more open, don\u2019t be shy, look for lonely people.",

My school had an event called Humans vs. Zombies it was a game of tag with nerf blasters. It was weird and people called us names and said we should grow up and all the usual things. I can honestly say that most of us have kept in touch. I met my soon to be wife in it and we are the second or third couple to come out of it. It was a bonding experience because of how weird it was for every one involved. A little bit of stress and having to work together makes friend so camping trips, are also a great thing to try. You\u2019ll learn a couple skills and have some good pictures. Worst case you get to camp in some pretty awesome places for bargain prices.",

I find that people are usually pretty excited/ready to talk about themselves. Ask questions about people, about what they did over the weekend, about their family (obviously let the conversation reach here naturally so it doesn\u2019t sound obtrusive), and *remember what they say*, then follow up with it next time you see them so that can see you remembered. People will be flattered you did. Get to know people this way, and find ways to spend more time with the ones you resonate with.\n\nI\u2019ve built a number of lasting relationships this way, just by showing interest in others. And often it doesn\u2019t require you to overshare on your side\u2014at least not before you\u2019re ready.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sure that you are more interesting than you feel that you are. Everyone has a story worth listening to. Give people a chance to hear your story and you\u2019ll start to make those friendships.",

You worry enough about what people may think about you to the point where it prevents you from engaging in social situations. Your anxiety is hamstringing you and you\u2019re accepting failure without even making an attempt. That\u2019s a terrible feeling, but a very fixable one. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be just the ticket you need to reframe your thinking and get out of your own head. Talk to a professional trained in CBT (psychologist or licensed mental health counselor or licensed social worker). \n\nI spent years of my own life not being myself because I was terrified of what other people though about me. Missed out on friendships. Missed out on girlfriends. Missed out on parties and fun and all kinds of things I probably don\u2019t know I missed out on. My point is, don\u2019t let your anxiety continue to control your life. I spent years not realizing I had anxiety or that the thoughts I was having weren\u2019t things that everyone else thought. I missed so many opportunities. Take back control and start living your best life.",

If I went through our larger list of friends it would be made up primarily of people from our dorms (we lived in two different ones at various times) or that we knew from our majors. The ones that came in later were usually roommates of friends once we'd all moved off campus-- we had a lot of casual movie or dinner parties to which 8-10 people would come. \n\nOur eldest is in college now and her core group of friends are all people she met on a pre-college wilderness trip or who were in her freshman seminar her first semester. Unlike us, her friends are scattered all over campus in many different dorms.  Just like we did 30+ years ago they spend time together at meals, go to arts/cultural events  or movies together, study together, road trip together, and just hang out talking late at night. I'm sure there are parties in the mix too.",

We all take similar courses, one of them taking the same 5 of 6 classes with me one semester. We didnt start off as close, but with that kind of proximity, bonds are sure to happen.\nSo my advice is to hang on to hope, and as you take more classes in your major just push yourself a little more. When you get to class, turn to the person next to you and just ask how their weekend was. Yes it is super uncomfortable the first few times, but when you show you're willing to reach out, usually others will also reach out.",

The consistency of meeting up plus all of the in game adventures your characters will get into together leads to lasting friendships in my experience. \n\nPost in your colleges subreddit mentioning that you are looking for a group. Also stop by local gaming stores where people may have posted that they are looking for players. Finally check online for local Facebook groups/clubs/discord groups of people who play D&D. That's how I found my group. \n\nIf you want access to the books but can't afford it there are PDF's online that you can find. \"The Trove\" is one specific website. \n\nBest of luck!",

Blaming yourself and losing confidence in social situations can be a hard thing to overcome, but I can assure you it goes away. You'll find that having alot of friends is nice, but having one or two good friends that you really connect with is just as fulfilling. The first real friendship I made in college was a result of being open with people in social situations and making an effort to go out with them outside of class. What worked for me was the Gym, at first i invited myself to train with someone and now every night I go work out with my best friend. Good luck to you and dont worry, this feeling is felt by nearly everyone and is a normal thing.",

I guess I\u2019m used to how natural it was in HS. Ik the solution is to just ask people to do stuff and not care if it goes good or bad, but like it feels weird  how difficult it is for me to really not feel awkward talking to anyone and looking around it seems from the outside that\u2019s not the case for most people, but I guess you never know.

I was super isolated and depressed before, but I kept using the phrase \"fake it until you make it\" at my new school, and it has helped a ton. \n\nIt helped to change my mindset that I might always feel awkward sometimes, but they feel awkward too. Everyone feels awkward. But I kept telling myself that university is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am spending so much money, that I should take advantage of all the new connections and friends I could miss out on. \n\nIt really is a hit or miss if you connect with people. But you won't know until you start talking to others. And you never know if a conversation in class, in the dining halls, or around campus could lead to an acquaintance, someone who can tell or teach you something, or even a friend or romantic partner. So I try and find some value out of making new friends, and if I'm too nervous and shy that day, I tell myself to \"fake it until I make it,\" and pretty soon I was just having standard/happy days with a good amount of social interaction with people I saw every day and friends that reached out *to me*.",
