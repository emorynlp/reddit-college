I don\u2019t even know where to begin to start. my classes are huge, and I\u2019ve been in many classes where i didn\u2019t know the name of a single person. I\u2019ve done intramural sports but I never build anything that remotely lasts outside of that environment, and I don\u2019t how to reach out to anyone to maybe do something outside because I feel no confidence in my ability to mantain anyone\u2019s interest 1 on 1, and has often been the case in my life. I feel pretty lonely sometimes and don\u2019t really have a lot of confidence, and I don\u2019t understand how people meet people and actually create something that lasts. I have an amazing girlfriend who I hang out with every day, and she has great friends who are also my friends, but I\u2019m pretty sure if it weren\u2019t for her, I probably wouldn\u2019t really ever find ways to hang out with them since I never reach out to them on my own, and they are all girls, which makes me feel like a bit of an oddball and makes me wonder if I\u2019m annoying being the only guy there. Idk, I just wonder how people meet friends, and also how they actually make a lasting one too because so far it\u2019s been a lot harder than I could\u2019ve imagined", "author": "MONOLISOreturns", "created": 1579715220, "retrieved": 1632802639, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 750, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ffcz75m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/esffqp/how_do_people_make_lasting_friendships_in_college/ffcz75m/", "text": "Greek life, there\u2019s something for everyone", "author": "cameron_cs", "created": 1579810286, "upvotes": 1}, "ffcd4hx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/esffqp/how_do_people_make_lasting_friendships_in_college/ffcd4hx/", "text": "Take time to know each other out of the classroom", "author": "n__j", "created": 1579796875, "upvotes": 1}, "ffc25i9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/esffqp/how_do_people_make_lasting_friendships_in_college/ffc25i9/", "text": "I made my college friends working on campus in the dining halls.

Your anxiety is hamstringing you and you\u2019re accepting failure without even making an attempt. That\u2019s a terrible feeling, but a very fixable one. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be just the ticket you need to reframe your thinking and get out of your own head.
