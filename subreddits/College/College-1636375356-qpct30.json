  "text": "In my university, professors openly say that they are required to make exams with about 20% fail rate. With just the right amount of difficulty.\n\nHowever, different professors create this effect in different ways. Some make the questions entangled and confusing, arguing that if you truly understand the topic, you will be able to figure out the answer no matter how twisted it is. This is my favorite, because I believe it is true.\n\nBut others create artificial difficulty, either by using matereal that is hard to navigate or even find, making borderline obscure questions about barely relevant facts, making the questions subjective / very open ended, so that way they can nitpick whatever they want, and so on.\n\nWhat styles of questions have you noticed and how do you think they do the job of testing what is most important?",

Made a rounding error in the first part, and that caused me to be slightly off (by $1) on each of the subsequent parts. Zero points awarded on those five questions. Ended up with an 80% on the exam.",

While I have a 3.9 gpa atm, it took me a while to adjust to the testing style. The solution is to just study more because they're gunna put curve ball questions not taught in class or in the notes and there's no way in knowing what they'll be. Usually they're challenge problems in the textbooks",

      "text": "For me the worst questions are those that are harder to interpret than the concepts actually being asked/tested. \n\nWhen I took o-chem 1, my professor would use the A. 1 B. 2....etc. method but every single choice would be in a different format. The diagram for one option could be a Fischer projection, then the next choice was a Haworth projection and so on. So there were about 5-7 options usually, with a chance of more than one option being correct. \n\nOh and the question itself had little to nothing to do with the format. It was all intended for you to just waste your time converting from one form to another which was really unnecessary. \n\n\nThis professor was a nut-case, had way too many issues and there were complaints to the Dean/Dept. Chair which were not even related to this. \n\n\nI think there might be more examples of this from others, where you spend more time deciphering the question than actually arriving to the solution.",
