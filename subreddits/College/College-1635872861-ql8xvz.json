  "text": "I'm an undergraduate student studying Industrial Engineering and currently a sophomore. Before sophomore year, I had grades I was happy with, around 3.4-3.6, but now that this semester is nearing its end I think I'll be getting a full semester of Cs and (hopefully not) Ds. I'm worried that my odds at a good graduate school and job are now decreasing because this semester will ruin my gpa. There are a few exams left, but I doubt I will do well on them. Are there any tips on what I can do? I already feel like giving up the semester.",
