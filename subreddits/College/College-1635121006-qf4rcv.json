  "text": "Hi, I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for a university in a city with low COL. I'm considering moving out of state for my bachelors (I'm currently in community college) and want an area with low COL. I have a large dog and two cats, so I can't just live in a dorm or studio, and it's putting a damper on my college search because the public universities in my state are in high COL areas.\n\nAny recs would really help me as I start to look at colleges. thanks!",

Are you in some sort of position where you won't pay that full cost? Are you going to live there for a year prior to establish residency (you'd have to be considered FAFSA independent too)? Because you seem concerned about living expenses but are pursuing a solution that could cost more.",
