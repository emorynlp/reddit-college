  "text": "So today in the mail I got a student refund check for 700$. I don\u2019t know why I got it and after a quick google search it appears to be leftover fasfa money. I never signed up for fasfa nor took out a loan for college as I go to community college. (I also never dropped any classes) Anybody know why I got this or what I should do? Thanks",
