  "text": "I still need to submit my FAFSA before my school can determine my financial aid eligibility. Earlier this year my dad quit his job to start a resale business. He was making $300K + at his old job as the sole provider for the family. \n\nWe've been in business for less than 6 months and don't have tax returns to reflect his change in income. How to I estimate yearly family income / how will this impact my financial aid eligibility? \n\nJust wondering if anyone here has been in a similar spot. Thank you :)",
