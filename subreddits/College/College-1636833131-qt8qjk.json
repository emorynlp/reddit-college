  "text": "I\u2019m a 24F. I graduated with an early childhood education degree in May 2020 and I\u2019m currently in my second year of teaching PreK. I don\u2019t hate teaching, but I definitely don\u2019t love it as much as I feel like I should. I suffer from social anxiety and sometimes the constant questions from students, the interactions with parents and dealing with coworkers are all so DRAINING. I\u2019m thinking about going back to college for something else that has more structure.\n\nI have taken so many of those quizzes that match you with majors/careers and I always end up getting the same results:\n-Information Science and Technology.\n-Information Studies\n-Management Information Systems\n-Computer Science\n-Accounting\n\nAnyone currently in these majors? Pros & Cons? Things to think about? I know little to nothing about these options\u2026 Anything helps!! Thanks in advance!",

No. I know this is a short reply, but I don't really see any downsides to a CS major unless you don't like challenges. What would you consider a downside to a major?",

So needless to say I\u2019m pretty rusty. I never had to take trig or calculus so I\u2019m pretty nervous about all the math courses.",

              "text": "Yes, a lot of Math. I started with remedial math since I'm an older student, so I've taken Remedial, Algebra, College Algebra, Pre-Calc, Trig, Calc 1, Calc 2, Calc 3, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Math. Of course, this would be the downside of most STEM degrees, but they are doable, just takes work. I never graduated high school and managed to pass them. I'm sure you would do fine, especially considering all of the resources available today. I can't imagine doing all of this in the 90's.",
