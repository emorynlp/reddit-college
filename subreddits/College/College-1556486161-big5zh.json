      "text": "The way that one of my professors explained it to the class my freshman year of college is essentially that our brains typically act like a filing cabinet and sometimes it gets full and when it gets too full too fast it throws away other stuff that it deems unnecessary. For example, last big project I had all that was on my mind was the project and normal things like not pouring my tea into the sink instead of my cup or putting the car in park before turning it off went away completely. I can't remember is it was my psychology professor or my biology professor that told us this but it's helped me get through studying for finals because it helps me organize what's most important to focus on. I hope this helps",

It\u2019s amazing how much better I felt after a weekend of hardly even thinking about school. I\u2019d recommend doing something like this that will just get your brain off school.

                  "text": "For us (Im at a university in South Africa), there is an exam session at the end of each semester where we write exams for each module(class). During the semester we have tests for each module. Our final mark for the module consists of the class mark and the exam mark. The weighting differs from module to module (as mentioned in previous comment). Pass mark is final mark of 50%. To be able to write the exam you need a class mark of at least 40%, otherwise you fail that module (without even being able to  write the exam)",
