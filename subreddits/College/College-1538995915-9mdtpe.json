  "text": "A student in my lin alg class could not attend a mandatory seminar session because of her menstrual pains. The problem is that she's a trans-woman/girl and although she doesn't actually menstruate she still believes that it is her right to feel like she does. The professor rejected her excuse and not that surprisingly a lot of students feel like he should have been more sympathetic and hav organized a protest.  I'm kinda torn here. Who is in the wrong? ",

If you were born a biological male you did not experience the onset of Menses and subsequent menstruation, despite any psychological disposition you have towards another gender. This isn't bigoted to say, its established mental health orthodoxy. \n\nNo drs note, no excused absence imo.  But honestly things like this are why I don't take attendance in college. I just design my courses so that if students don't regularly attend they are very unlikely to do well.",

I looked it up and seems like some trans women that take hormones can start having a \u201cperiod\u201d where they feel a lot of the symptoms: cramps, nausua, headaches, etc. A cis-woman who had her overies removed was taking hormones and experienced the same. If this is the case and she has a period so bad she needs to miss class then I would guess she needs a doctors note but I understand some doctors may not believe her. I guess I understand the situation but as someone who has had debilitating cramps, I can\u2019t let it effect my day I just have to take some pamprin and move on, I got shit to do. If she is really suffering she might want to try and find a doctor that can help her. ",

Most cis women, even when cramping, show up to class. \n\nUnless you have special medical conditions that leave you in debilitating pain, you typically show up to class. For instance, my sister would throw up on the first day of her period from the pain.\n\nHell, without NSAIDs I feel like I\u2019m dying. I still show up to class. I really don\u2019t think it is possible if you don\u2019t own a uterus to actually have the level of pain that women with the severe medical condition that has pain levels so intolerable that you pass out have. \n\nI can stretch my mind enough to believe that estrogen might cause cramping, but FFS I have lived with this since I was 12 and have dragged myself to class, even given myself ulcers from the amount of NSAIDs I\u2019ve had to take at times. She was bullshitting. ",

I have serious menstrual pains that feel like I'm being stabbed and TMI cause diarrhea which causes more issues. But I still manage to go to classes and even work. Some women have it worse so they physically can't go anywhere or do anything. It's important for these women to see a doctor to help manage their symptoms.\n\nShe should see a doctor about how to manage the pain and how to live up to her responsibilities while experiencing them. I'm not her so I can't really judge what her body is feeling. But dealing with this via a doctor or just sucking it up is part if being a woman. Our lives can't just be paused because it's that time of the month, every month.\n\nSorry for rambling.\n\n**If she has a doctor's note the professor is wrong. If she doesn't then she is being unreasonable\n\nEdit: can't respond to comments but I wanted to say yes the woman in question is trans and doesn't menstrate. But it is still possible for her to experience menstrual pain. You don't need to be bleeding or to have a uterus, it's hormone related. ",
