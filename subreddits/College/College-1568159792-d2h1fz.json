We were all assigned a vitamin and had to make a presentation about this vitamin.\n\nThis project was assigned to us on the first day of the semester and I knew this was going to be a quick, easy A, so like every student ever, I said \"meh, I'll do it later.\" WELL, later never came but you know what did come? The day of the presentations. So I stroll into this class, 9:30 am, iced coffee in hand, laid back, no concern over anything. The kid (S) next to me (B), leans over and goes\n\nS: How's your presentation look?\n\nB: Ha, what presentation?\n\nS: ...\n\nB: ...\n\nS: ...\n\nS: The presentation that's due today.\n\nLet me just say that my heart has never dropped so low, out my ass, and into the center of the Earth so fast in my life.\n\nB: ...oh shit.\n\nSo, my last name starts with A... and the professor (P) goes:\n\nP: Alright, we're gonna start the presentations soon and I'm just gonna go in alphabetical order.\n\nThank fuck that there were a few people before me that also had last names that started with A. So I I M M E D I A T E L Y open a fresh powerpoint, make a title card, and start Googling like I've never Googled in my life. I pulled up the project rubric in a small window on my laptop and I literally just started copying and pasting every question that was required to be in the presentation.\n\nI literally made a decent looking in 10 minutes and long story short, I got an A somehow. I somehow got an A on the most rushed piece of a shit thing I have ever produced in my academic career. It was so hard for me not to laugh while I was presenting and S was sitting there giggling his ass off cause he knew what I had done and that he had saved my ass.\n\nBut yeah, don't procrastinate, set reminders, keep a planner, use a calendar, something.\n\nIf anyone wants to see the powerpoint, I can post it in the comments.\n\nThis is the powerpoint:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11_cSS0KX-ppUgD3pN-bKWRoDR_RZq27pME9CD2R_tVE/edit?usp=sharing", "author": "_Jubilating", "created": 1568159792, "retrieved": 1632946854, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1933, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f1jdwmo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/d2h1fz/doing_a_project_minutes_before_my_presentation/f1jdwmo/", "text": "Knowing myself, I woulda just walked out.", "author": "shitheadboot1122", "created": 1569522014, "upvotes": 1}, "f08j3p8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/d2h1fz/doing_a_project_minutes_before_my_presentation/f08j3p8/", "text": "I wrote a speech for com class once in the half hour before.
