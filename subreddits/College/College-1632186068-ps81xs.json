Everyone here is pretty cliquey and grouped up, but I find myself feeling pretty lonely.\n\nI\u2019ve found campus resources to be no help when I have actual issues with on campus housing, and I\u2019m having serious problems with some of the people I\u2019m living with.\n\nOverall, I just feel very unimpressed by school so far. I feel like I\u2019m not getting a stimulating social experience, it\u2019s hard to make friends at a school with just over 2,000 students. \n\nOn weekends, campus dies down completely. Most people go home or spend all day out of town, so it\u2019s literally like a ghost town here from Friday night to Sunday evening. \n\nThe problem is, I really like the program i\u2019m in right now. It\u2019s music therapy, and it\u2019s a really rare program in the southeast. I love the area I live in and the program i\u2019m on is going to set me up on a great path.\n\nBut should I stay at a school that I feel depressed and alone at, so I get everything I can out of this program, or should I transfer schools and try to find a way to get a similar academic experience?", "author": "sarcasticinterest", "created": 1632186068, "retrieved": 1632801349, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
