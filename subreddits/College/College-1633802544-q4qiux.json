  "title:": "Should I take medical terminology in the online 3-week class or full semester?",
  "text": "I'm kind of familiar with Medical Terminology. I took a Human Bio class in high school 8 years ago and I'm still pretty familiar with it. I originally was going to take Medical Terminology during the fall but I had to push it back to spring. I bought the textbook for the class and everything already. I was thinking that maybe I could take the class during the three week session (before the actual spring semester starts) if I study hard enough before the beginning of January. However maybe it would be a bad idea and I should take the class during the traditional full semester instead. What do you think?",
