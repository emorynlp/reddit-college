      "text": "Hey I know this is not what you asked for but transferring like this in your freshman year can be very very very costly. NYU is 56k/yr for tuition alone and then over 15k for the room and board, and that is just for one year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yes you can transfer, meet with your advisor, and they'll walk you through the application. Also, if NYU doesn't accept your credits at your current college, you might have to retake those courses, which is another expense.",
