  "text": "I\u2019ve been at a community college for over 2 years now trying to get a degree in IT support. I began falling behind and realized IT wasn\u2019t for me. So I thought switching majors to liberal arts to pursue an English degree would help. Only thing is I still have no drive to do anything. I\u2019ve already been dropped from my classes for not attending (online classes and I didn\u2019t submit an assignment fast enough). I can appeal to be added back to my classes but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what I want. I work full time from home so balancing school and work will be a lot but I\u2019m also worried about paying bills and my student loans off. I\u2019m not sure what I should do right now. Any advice?",

      "text": "College is not for everyone, obviously, but I don't think you should drop out yet without talking to some people or campus advisors that might be able to give you some input on a path you could take. I think the most important thing would be to take some time and really figure out what you're passionate about and how you can unfold that into a career. That could be taking some time off from school. There are plenty of online, \"go at your own pace\" certificate and degree programs you can do from your home while working too. (see edx, Coursera, or udemy websites) I had an interesting conversation with my dad about this where basically he asked me what I would be doing in my down time if \"something\" wasn't a factor or wasn't there for me to do. As an example, we were talking specifically about video games and he asked what I'd do during those hours if I didn't have my PS5. I would say something like watch movies or do some art or whatever the case, and he continued to ask what I'd do without those and so on... It was a pretty miniscule conversation, but it really made me think about the things I love to do and how I would want to integrate that in my everyday life, particularly in a career. I am a business major and I am not too passionate about it, even tho I've appreciated the things I've learned from my university's business school. That conversation made me decide to pursue something that incorporates my creative side and I feel way better off because of it. Hope that helps :)",

These people can help you think things out, they may know about certain programs or services that the school provides that are not advertised well, and sometimes they may even contact teachers/department chairs on your behalf.",
