  "text": "Hi everyone I recently found out the social work program I\u2019ve been set on isn\u2019t accredited by CASWE-ACFTS and have wasted 3 years of school. I know 100% I would like to be a social worker but my plan now is to get my Bachelors in Sociology through an online distance learning program then my Masters in Social Work at UBC. Do you think this is a bad idea? I just would like to do something quickly rather than having to take more courses to get accepted into another BSW program. Please let me know what you would do thanks",
