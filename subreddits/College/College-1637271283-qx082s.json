  "text": "I posted a while back about how this professor kept bothering me about not doing something else while on bathroom and I KID YOU NOT\n\nShe mentioned how another classmate was on the phone with her & told her about his situation. He was in the hospital & she directed the attention to him, **TOLD US HOW HIS BABY WAS HAVING COMPLICATIONS, & the guy had to explain the whole thing while everyone was lookin at him.**\n\n**this is a anger management class & she asked us to pray, then she got into a hand motion idr I blacked out, and closed her eyes and opened her catholic mouth. She said she went to catholic school so that explains it**\n\n**I wanted to go off on her for wasting valuable CLASS TIME THAT SHE HAS THE NERVE TO CRITICIZE ME BUT HAS THE GALL to: ask about a girls 12month pregnant, ask about other classmates kids, their age, etc and overall noisey**\n\nI\u2019m just sticking it out bc I wanna see what else she\u2019s gunna do but do you have any advice? My friend said if the guy didn\u2019t mind then let it go it\u2019s a cultural thing that some folks like talking about their personal life\n\n**any advice is appreciate bc I plan to report her. Like ok the guys kid was born safe but you serious expect me to waste 10 minutes listening to a crazy nut **",
