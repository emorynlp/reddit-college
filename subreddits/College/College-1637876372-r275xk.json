  "text": "I just got my first ever C+ in a class. It hurts so much, as I promised myself I would always get A's and B's. I have to do a lot of calculations and analysis after finishing a class in order to predict my grade, and I predicted a B for this particular class. It is a 5-hour credit class, which makes my pain so much worse. I truly tried my hardest in this class. I did not go out that much, and I canceled all of my outings with my friends and my family, only to get a C+.\n\nI know that I procrastinated a lot throughout the class, but I tried my hardest to cover this and manage my time. My classes are only getting harder and harder. I am a third-year college student, and instead of getting better, I am getting worse. I just feel like throwing up. I can not help but compare myself to all the students who aced this class and got As. Why am I like this?",

      "text": "College is different than high school. I\u2019m in my second year and I can tell you it does get better. Once you get used to the way college works and how much time you have to study, it\u2019ll get better. I struggled my first semester and it has gotten better. It\u2019ll also be better when you get out of generals and into your degree, it will get better. Maybe talking to a school therapist and maybe getting a tutor can help as well.",

      "text": "Hey, I was there once too. It sucked and it sucked even more having to tell my parents that I got a C. It hurt my pride to see my GPA dip like that, especially as most of my friends got all A\u2019s in the same classes. \n\nBut I still graduated even after collecting a couple more C\u2019s along the way. I was a straight A\u2019s high school student, so getting C\u2019s my sophomore and junior year of college was really hard on me. I have a job in my field that I liked and quite honestly my GPA doesn\u2019t matter anymore. \n\nBe disappointed about it in the moment but don\u2019t let it define you or your academic abilities. This is just one grade at one time in your life. It does not and will not set the course for what you\u2019ll do in life. \n\nGood luck friend, it\u2019ll all be okay!",

      "text": "At least you passed and get to move on to the next year.\n\nOver the course of my degree I had 3 C's of 15cr courses.\n\nI typically averaged C+ with a mixture of B and A grades. My gpa did not get hurt too badly by it. Just try your best. \n\nI remember once I did a course and got a E I worked my ass off and completely flunked.\nPicked myself up. Tried again the next year. Pushed myself after dedicating my life to the paper I got a C and was able to move on. Was some of the hardest stuff I have ever done for a C. It was a second year statistics paper. I passed the paper while I had my leg in a cast in alot of pain. So that was interesting.\n\nAt the end of the day a pass should be celebrated. You passed. You did what was expected. Son you can move on to the next paper while reflecting on what you could have done better in this one.",
