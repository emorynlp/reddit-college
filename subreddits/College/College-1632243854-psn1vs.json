  "text": "I started my semester 2 weeks ago and I\u2019m already skipping classes. I haven\u2019t had in-person school since before Covid and I really struggled during Covid with depression and loneliness, but at least my family was there for me. But now I\u2019m in a city 3 hours away alone for school and I can\u2019t make myself get out of my bed in the morning. I want to do well this semester after all the trouble I had with virtual schooling, but I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to sink into isolating myself and doing poorly in my classes.",
