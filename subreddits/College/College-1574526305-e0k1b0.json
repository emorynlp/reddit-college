Pretty much everyone in my building has left and I'm feeling kind of lonely.  I haven't made many friends yet, so that adds to the struggle.  I have a project to do and a few little homework assignments, but I will have a lot of free time.  I know that I could use my break to get stuff done, but I struggle with time management and fear that I will end up doing everything on Sunday night.  I would appreciate any advice that you have for time management or loneliness during break.

Then each morning/afternoon, you get up, make a To-Do list for that day (break down the steps/parts of your project/assignment, sprinkle in a few rewards/fun things to do after you get a goal completed) and then get chugging. \n\nAnother thing you can do in is volunteer. Animal shelters can plug your boredom and loneliness in one go (this was recommended to me by some family members who volunteer after I told them in the fall about my summer) and they're almost always looking for volunteers. Or local soup kitchens can allow you to give back to the community, potentially make some friends, and give you something to do.", "author": "hedgemk", "created": 1574532744, "upvotes": 29}, "f8eqb2x": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e0k1b0/advice_for_students_staying_on_campus_for/f8eqb2x/", "text": "Second the other comment. Since you have a ton of free time, make one dedicated start time of doing the project each day. Say, from 10 am onwards you will make some progress on it. No matter how small. Once you start just go with the flow and take breaks or stop until you get hungry. Try to do that sooner in the day rather than later in the afternoon. That makes it harder for you to say \"I'll start tomorrow.\"\n\nI would also go out to a walk everyday and explore the campus in its totality. Observing an empty college campus has a hidden pleasure. When break is over you'll know every corner and the best spots to study, take a walk, the best restrooms, comfiest couches, etc. Besides who knows, you might meet others who are doing the same thing, and it can be easy to start a conversation in that context.", "author": "shimmy2468", "created": 1574531999, "upvotes": 41}, "f8ep740": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e0k1b0/advice_for_students_staying_on_campus_for/f8ep740/", "text": "See what events your uni is holding.
