  "text": "I\u2019m currently a junior and have suddenly just lost all momentum to keep trying. I find myself asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d daily and crying and not focusing in classes. With the job market and housing prices right now, I\u2019m terrified of graduating. I don\u2019t even want to wake up knowing how fucking hard this is. I reached out to the campus counseling center a week ago and got on the waitlist for a callback to set up an appointment. Still haven\u2019t heard from them and it\u2019s just adding fuel to the fire. I haven\u2019t felt more lost and I don\u2019t know if I can handle this any longer.",

While I say my work is pointless, I always find a way to get motivated after long bouts of procrastination because of my fear of failure. Good on you for contacting your counseling center because I have not had the guts to do so yet. \n\nIn the end, there is no point, really. The only thing that keeps me going and motivated, like I said earlier, is the fact I should do well since I\u2019m here and because failure is a worse option. \n\nWhat has caused you to feel like this now?\n\nEdit: typo",

I\u2019m a senior and after my fianc\u00e9 committed suicide two years ago then Covid, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even the same person with the same motivations. I worry about what comes after graduation all the time too. My biggest motivation is that I want to see something all the way through. I have a tendency of giving up on things when they get hard or uncomfortable and this is my chance to prove I can finish something I started, no matter how hard it got.",

I'm sure the assholes of reddit will crawl out of the greasy woodwork to tell me I'm wrong to suggest buying a fucking house anyways. You don't know when it'll crash or even if it will. Waiting won't do you any good. If you want a house, go buy one. \n\nI think there's a certain level of misunderstanding about it with the younger generations too. It's not that expensive unless you're trying to live like your parents. You have to buy what you can afford. Generally, it's a lot easier with 2 peoples incomes. \n\nI seriously think the young generations are completely convinced that it's IMPOSSIBLE to buy a house. Reddit seems to keep that idea flowing real hard through here. It's just not true. Yeah, you're not going to buy a house in fucking California. But uh... there's a shit ton of other states out there. \n\nI bought a house for 150k and the monthly payment, which includes escrow, is only 20 bucks more than what I was paying to rent a much smaller house. We moved to a tiny ass little town about 45 minutes from the city. You're telling me that college graduates can't afford 900 dollars in a house payment a month? That's fucking bull shit. \n\nI've always felt kind of confused about the view on housing around here. All the headlines make it seem impossible when it isn't. The news is all bullshit anyways. Get out there and figure it out yourself. Definitely don't rely on reddit for good advice. It's still just another shitty social media platform with it's on set of VERY LEFT LEANING flaws. \n\nIf you don't realize how far left Reddit leans... you need to do research!",
