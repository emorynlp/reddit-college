It can\u2019t just be reviewing a few days before a test, it has to be through practicing by doing problems throughout the duration of the entire course to do well on exams.

      "text": "It's not exactly great to fail exams. Like others have said, a 76 is passing. A 76 being a B is fucking wild as it's generally 70-80 is a B. \n\nFor what it's worth, if you didn't go through ALL the material provided that's always and excellent step. Although, some professors don't give great material. You can always find practice problems, especially for math courses, in the back of text books. Usually they'll have a section of just practice problems. I highly suggest doing these until you're comfortable with the material. Don't be a fucking tard and look at the answer first as that's not doing you any favors. \n\nIf you don't know how to solve the problems, that's a huge issue. Your time at college is to understand these things. There are tutors and office hours available on campus. If you're not understanding these concepts, you absolutely must use these benefits. Putting the time in to really understand the concepts will reduce your stress immensely. \n\nI don't know what year you are or anything so I'm assuming some facts. I really think that young people are unprepared for college because of all the things they've got to do that are uncomfortable. Going to office hours or tutors are uncomfortable for young people. This is something that'll only get worse as you get older. It's just a skill to learn. It's almost as if being uncomfortable in life is a sign that you're improving. Learn to get what you need from your professors. \n\nI'm 32 and sending emails almost daily to professors if I don't understand. Granted, I live off campus so office hours are tough. It's helped me a TON to get to know what they want. I could care less to do it, I don't care what they think of me. I just know that I'm paying a ton of money to them and it's part of their job to teach me. I like being the shit stirrer who makes them do it. I'm paying man, I'm getting my education.",

All too many times I've gotten a problem wrong because I've left out x=4 and just put 4, or I put -4,4 instead of \u00b14. It's the small things for me, especiallyin online class. Also don't forget alot of the time in algebra you can plug your answer into the original problem to see if it gives you the correct output!\n\nHope that helps at least on some level, best of luck!",
