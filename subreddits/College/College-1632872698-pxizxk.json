Try to keep good grades to get a scholarship from a university or a credible outside source.\n2. Get a full ride scholarship to a university\n3. Get a scholarship to a university\n\n4. Please speak to your counselor about getting scholarships from a university and other stuff you would want to know for college and what is best for you.\n\nA lot of this applies to those currently enrolled in college but this still useful for those seeking higher education.\n\n1. Try going to a local community college for the first 2 years then transfer to a university. \n\n2. Also try to continuously apply for scholarships and grants from the college or university you are attending and from credible outside sources (the coca cola scholarship is an obscure one). Keeping your grades high will greatly help with trying to get scholarships and grants. \n\n3. If you live in the usa I heard about this thing where you fill out this form for the government and they can refund the amount you payed for college. Though please research this further and speak to the proper, trusted and credible official for more info.\n\n4. Try and save money where you can, like renting your textbooks or finding them for free safely online, whatever fits your needs.\n\n5. Also apply for financial aid. Try to avoid taking out loans when you can, unfortunately for some they have to.\n\nYou can talk to your college counselor for more info about about this.", "author": "Hinewmemberhere", "created": 1632872698, "retrieved": 1632945434, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
