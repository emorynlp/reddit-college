  "text": "I know an 86 to some people isn't even that good, but when I tell you I WORKED for this grade, I mean it \ud83d\ude2d. A lot of late nights up, just to try and get over an 80. Like this is the one class I actually worked for throughout zoom university. I had to drop chem last semester because I was failing and dealing with a bunch of shitty personal things so didn't come this far in the curriculum, so this feels very rewarding. Hope everyone else is doing good, and managing their mental health well.",
