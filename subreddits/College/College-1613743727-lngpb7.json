  "text": "I am a junior in college. I go to a University in Wisconsin. It was the first week into the semester and our class of about 25 people are taking notes for Anatomy and about an hour in a decided I needed to use the restroom. I stand up start walking to the door and as I get to it he stops talking. He asks, \"where are you going?\" I look around and am thinking is he talking to me? Sure enough he was staring directly at me. Me starting to panic because I hate attention and start to panic and say the bathroom. He's had the audacity to tell me I can't just leave in the middle of class and that I have to ask. Remind you, I am 21 years old. \n\nHave you guys had any different or weird professors?",

Someone getting up to leave would be a rarity, like maybe once a semester in each class.\n\nBut, once I started teaching, it became a regular thing. Almost every single class, someone would have to get up and leave. And these are small classes (<20 students).\n\nWhat the hell changed?\n\nMy guess is the shift to a consumer model for education. I doubt it's a biological change.",

She made a rule that you had to keep your camera on the whole of class and if you didn\u2019t, it counted as an absence. \n\nOn top of that, if you had to leave, you had to tell her. \n\nThat included home stuff, if you had to use the bathroom, etc. \n\nIt was so embarrassing. I haven\u2019t had to ask to use the bathroom since I graduated high school and I honestly felt like a five year old. \n\nI was so glad she changed the rule two weeks later.",

          "text": "Oof, sounds like a student DEF went straight to the dean to enlighten them about her bullshit. I wish I realized the power we have as technically *their customers* sooner than later. \n\nI reluctantly signed up for a professor I took last semester so I could replace my failing grade. I have never before failed a class in my entire life, and I am already a senior in college. I ended up looking over my transcript and dropping the class, because as long as I do well in my other classes, I will still maintain the GPA I want. \n\nFor context, he held a live lecture to kind of touch base for the beginning of this semester and what to expect... Well, he expressed his fault in how he handled last semester and wanted to \"learn from his mistakes,\" after receiving a great amount of \"surprising\" SPOT (Student Perception of Teaching) reviews about the amount of anxiety his course structure caused students and hated that he did not realize this until it was too late and  that he was \"disappointed students did not reach out to him directly\". \n\nI was SUPER peeved about him claiming it was \"surprising,\" because I clearly remember one of my classmates last semester essentially speaking up for the rest of the class and letting him know that a majority of us in our class group chat had expressed concern and anxiety over his expectations, feeling they were overwhelming and unreasonable when considering that we have multiple classes, on top of jobs, families, and the overall stress of adjusting to situations presented by the ongoing pandemic.  \n\nTo this he responded with something to the tune of \"I have been teaching for blah blah blah # of years and this is the way I have found to work for teaching a course like this.\" If other students did not venture to \"reach out to him directly\" , I imagine that, like me, this first impression made him feel incredibly unapproachable, and frankly, arrogant. He literally had a policy that even ASKING about a late assignment would result in dropping your ENTIRE grade by 1 percentage point, but I digress...\n\nSo it immediately became obvious to me that he was so full of bs, because it should not have been \"surprising;\" our class had literally tried to bring up our concerns at the beginning of the semester and got shot down because he \"knows what he's doing.\" \n\nIt was also obvious that he probably only decided to change after his department heads actually saw so much negative student feedback, and probably having a number of students not do well, department heads see that, he only put his tail between his legs because someone probably came down on him for it. I realized that going to the dean/ or department is essentially the equivalent of \"asking for the manager,\" but in a justified non-Karen-y way.",

I'm here to help them with those choices if they want it, but they don't need babysitters.\n\nI suspect that this professor probably has some little control issues like that throughout their job and life. I'm sure they do things that other professors have to commiserate about too. My phd advisor was like that. Very challenging person to work with. You just had to accept all that about him and realize it wasn't about you, and then you could benefit from the things he was good at.",

I don't know if that student has diarrhea, or just got their period or what, and it is 100% NOT my duty as a professor to police them and embarrass the shit out of them. I assume they are adults and if they are walking out of the room, they have a need to do so. I would assume the exact same if someone in a meeting had to step out. If you are actively in a conversation with someone, they would probably say, \"Excuse me, I need to step out for a minute,\" and you as a boss aren't going to say, \"WHAT, BOB, can't you hold it for 10 minutes? Do you really need to take a shit that badly?\" No. You're going to assume they have a reason or a need to leave, because all of you are PROFESSIONALS. The same is true of college students.\n\nNow.... If a student is proving problematic and doing this repeatedly, am I going to call them out? STILL NO. I would send that student an email or ask to talk to them after class, because it is fucking unprofessional to embarrass your students in front of the entire class unless they are being blatantly rude and disruptive. Again, as a professor I have no idea if that student has a medical issue. Maybe they are diabetic and having low blood sugar, or need to inject insulin. Maybe they received an emergency text from their childcare provider and need to go into the hall to call them. Not my business, and *definitely* not my place to make their private business the business of my entire class. There are FERPA and HIIPA issues here, if nothing else.\n\nTake the idiotic professor who just got put on probation for yelling at a hard of hearing student on zoom last week. That could have been 100% prevented if the professor spoke to the student privately instead of grandstanding like an idiot to purposefully try to embarrass that student. It's definitely better to err on the side of treating a student respectfully and addressing outside of class rather than being an asshole to your students.",

It was recorded and could be watched later. I atteneded live in case i had a question. The first class he asked that those of us who attended have our cameras on. Annoying, but i put clothes on anyways and turned it on. I work full-time and am taking classes part-time. When i get home i wwnt to relax and do my school work. So for this particular class i was half laying on my couch jotting down notes from his lecture. 20 minutes in he says me name and tells me to sit up straight during his class. Told me i would better be able to pay attention and take notes that way. I'm 30 years old and I'm paying for this class. If i wanna lay on my couch in my apartment while you talk about the difference between WAN and LAN, I should be able to. So i never attended another zoom class of his after that one.",

This professor also was known to criticize people\u2019s appearances ie. Tell them they are fat, skinny, tired, \u201cdepressed looking\u201d, pimples, etc. in class for instance once he said to me that \u201cshe has a bunch of pimples on her face she needs to do something about that or the men will chase after her because she is fertile.\u201d As if acne has anything to do with fertility. Another thing that made me feel very uncomfortable with this professor was how when I went to his office to ask about a paper I wrote  he made the comment \u201cyou are a very beautiful woman\u201d and then closed the door. As a woman I have dealt with sexual harassment my whole life but by far this was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I\u2019ve had. One of my other professors the office over could obviously tell when I walked out of there that I was uncomfortable and invited me in her office. Anytime I would be in his office after that incident I would open the door even if he closed it and my other professor walked past often while I was there which made me feel safer. It stills bothers me to this day that other students and my other professors have to probably face the same harassment if not worse from this man almost every day.",

He told me the only way to diagnose is through surgery. At first, I was stalling and avoiding it, but after a breakthrough bleed of 52 days and excruciating pain, I called them up and got my surgery scheduled within 3 days. Came out diagnosed with Stage II, and  taking other forms of therapy and pills which have helped me stay pain free coming up on 1.5 years now. \n\nSorry for shoving my life story in your face - I know no one asked, but it breaks my heart to think of other people having to suffer through what I did. Your suffering is not normal, and you have every right to seek treatment and have a good quality of life! Good luck on your journey :)",

Like, you\u2019re an adult, why would you need permission to handle basic bodily functions. \n\nSo infantalizing when profs require \u201cpermission\u201d. If you don\u2019t want students missing lecture, well that\u2019s their loss if they don\u2019t do well on tests. If you don\u2019t want them missing discussion, put points in participation or assess what was discussed on tests. If there\u2019s issues about safety during lab, teach them how to safely leave and enter lab during an experiment, as they\u2019ll need to know that in their future careers. The only place I can see banning bathroom use is during tests when it\u2019s about cheating, but even then a dedicated cheater will always find a way, and you\u2019re only punishing students who legit need to pee! Not to mention students with disabilities who might need to pee more often, or do medical things (e.g., inject insulin, eat something sugary, change a bag).",
