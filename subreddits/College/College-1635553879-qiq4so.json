  "text": "This may sound dumb or trivial which is why I\u2019m posting from my throwaway account. \nI\u2019m a senior in college and I\u2019ve never really participated in stuff on campus before. I also don\u2019t have a lot of friends.\nI wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything for Halloween since I don\u2019t know anyone so I didn\u2019t plan any costumes. However, someone super sweet who I know invited me out and I have no idea what to wear. Any last minute costume ideas would be appreciated. Something not super unoriginal and I\u2019d like it if it went with my hair. It\u2019s really curly so I thought maybe a gogo dancer or Phoebe from the earlier seasons of Friends.",
