Is there even any possibility?", "text": "To put it simply, my college career is completely screwed up. Over the last four years, I\u2019ve taken four semesters of college (2 semesters in physical classes and a 2 semesters of online classes). Somehow, for no good reason other than lack of interest/drive to do the work, I\u2019ve managed to fail nearly every single class I have attempted. At it\u2019s lowest, my gpa was a 0.39. I took 3 classes online last summer in which I managed to achieve 2 Bs and an F. That brought my GPA up to 0.80 and I haven\u2019t given it another run since. \n\nThis is a very different picture than my academic profile in high school: 3.8 GPA, highest SAT score, National Merit Scholar, etc. Needless to say, I lost any and all scholarships I had.\n\nI wish I had a better reason for why I\u2019ve done so horribly in college. My father died shortly after I graduated high school, so I used that as an excuse in the mandatory meetings I had to have with advisors due to being on academic probation. But while that was definitely a very sad experience, I can\u2019t honestly say I felt any depression or sadness that was impacting my desire to do school work.\n\nThe only real reason is that I have been spending my time working on other things, but I know this isn\u2019t a solid justification as I know plenty of people who have excelled in college while working on other business and/or creative ventures on the side.\n\nNow, as I watch all the people from my high school class graduating and getting their degrees, I can\u2019t help but wonder if I should give another pass at this or throw in the towel. I haven\u2019t officially thought of myself as a \u201ccollege dropout\u201d yet, but I also don\u2019t have any concrete plans of returning.\n\nCurrently, I\u2019m running a small video production company, learning a few instruments and DAW software in hopes of finding success (and skill lol) as a musician, and studying/practicing screenwriting with aspirations to write for (and one day create/executive produce) television shows. \n\nWhile I like to think I\u2019m confident that I can realize my dreams without college, there are times where I can\u2019t help but wonder if I need to give it another shot, just in case. I also feel like I\u2019ve been socially cut off from people in my age group these last few years and worry that it\u2019s negatively impacting my ability to make social connections that could be beneficial in my fields of interest. I\u2019m an introvert so it can be difficult for me to actively place myself in social situations at times. College seems like a bit of an easier way to accomplish this. \n\nBut then I think about how much of a waste of money and potentially time it could be and go back to square one.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the point of this post is, I guess I just felt like ranting but also would be interested to hear other people\u2019s perspective on if it is even worth trying to go back with my GPA where it is. If you actually read all of this I appreciate you!!\n\nTL;DR: College GPA after 4 semesters is a 0.8. Is it even worth trying anymore?\n\n\nEdit: WOW, this in-my-feelings rant got way more attention than I expected! I appreciate all of the responses, advice, words of inspiration, and reality checks. \n\nTo everyone who suggested I pick up a trade - luckily I\u2019ve managed to make a decently lucrative gig out of the video production thing so far. Had a full time job as video production specialist (ironically for a school district) for a couple of years that I recently quit in favor of doing my production company full time, so I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to at least have that for the time being as an income source while I work on my other passions. \n\nIf I went back to college now, it would likely be the same story. I will focus these next few years on trying on putting my time, money, and energy into the things I\u2019m truly committed to and reassess college a few years down the line.

That's not some bullshit pep-talk. I was in a very similar situation to you. 4.0+ weighted GPA at a nationally ranked public high school, 33 ACT, 1400 SAT, National Merit Finalist, lots of extra-curriculars, etc. I went to the #3 engineering school in the country, and melted down. My lowest GPA there was a 0.2. My highest was a 1.665. I dropped out.\n\nFifteen years later, I'm completing my first bachelor's degree in eight weeks from the same university. My second bachelor's degree will be done in December. \n\nBut you have to decide if you really want it. My first time around, I didn't want it. I was there because I was *supposed* to be there. But I was more focused on having fun and dicking around than I was on actually doing work. I didn't go to class, or do homework. I blew off at least one final exam. In my classes since returning, I've had a 3.8. I'm going to wind up graduating with a decent-ish GPA.\n\nMy advice to you is this: \n\n1) If you go back to school, make sure you're doing it for you, and not for anybody else. If you don't have the internal motivation to do it, it's going to be a LOT harder. \n\n2) Realize problems early, and reach out for help when it's necessary. One of the things that shocked me when I went back is that professors and administrators generally want to see students succeed. Take advantage of the help they offer. If you're having a really tough time with a class, talk to the professor or your advisor. Nobody fails the class in the last week--you almost always know early on if you're at risk of failing. If it gets to that point, take steps to mitigate it, even if that means dropping the class and trying again. \n\n3) It sounds cliche, but go to every single class. Do all the homework. It really does matter. \n\n4) Try doing part-time classes at a community college. Check out Transferology if your school participates, and take classes that will transfer. You can knock a lot of the gen-eds out, and you can take some of the lower-level weed-out classes in a somewhat easier environment. From where you're standing right now, taking a class or two at a time makes your college career look awfully long.

I thought I was fucked- I left that school, took a few years off and eventually transferred to a new school. My new school just gave me credit for the classes I passed at the old one. My GPA completely reset. I got a fresh start. I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about the GPA in terms of it \u201ckilling your college career\u201d or your prospects. After you graduate your GPA does not matter at all. No job will ever ask for it. And remember, you\u2019re paying the college money. There are plenty of colleges that would be happy to take your money if you want to transfer. I take the GPA more as a wake up call, as in \u201cwhat are you doing with your life right now?\u201d You\u2019re paying for these classes. Are you here because you want to be here or because you feel like college is what you\u2019re supposed to do? \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a break from school and it sounds like you really need to recalculate. Technical school is a great option...actually atm it a technical certification can probably do more for you than a 4 year degree. But I wouldn\u2019t just hop on that path if you\u2019re not ready to take it seriously. Taking some time off & just working and living for a few years was really good for me. A lot of college grads get really anxious about what to do after school. But, personally, I\u2019ve lived & worked in the \u201creal world\u201d...I went back to school because I don\u2019t want to work in restaurants and stuff forever. I\u2019m actually motivated & have a sense of purpose this time around. And I\u2019m taking it part time, because that\u2019s what works better for me, and I don\u2019t feel the pressure I once felt to \u201chave the college experience\u201d and follow the path every high school guidance counselor pushes you toward. I really wish that at that time I\u2019d been equipped with more knowledge about alternatives to college too. College isn\u2019t for everyone and, honestly, there are plenty of opportunities that don\u2019t require it. I feel like I had this idea that I\u2019d never be able to live comfortably or get anywhere in life without a degree & that\u2019s flat out untrue. I know people who left college who, in the meantime while everyone was going to classes, built  up savings and started their own businesses and stuff. I\u2019ve got a friend who was hustling for a few years, working 2 jobs, doing vintage clothing resale, and doing hand-poke tattoos and now she\u2019s just bought an apartment- which she\u2019s gonna rent out soon because she\u2019s moving , has her own tattoo studio, and is flying all over the country to do trades w/ other artists. I think it\u2019d be good to take some time & rethink things. \n\nWhen you\u2019re envisioning the life you want for the future, the further out something is, the more variables & unpredictable elements come into play. I think it\u2019s pretty naive to try & decide today where you want to be career wise in 10 years. It\u2019s impossible to know. I\u2019ve found it a lot more helpful to envision in the mid-term & think more about the lifestyle you want to live & how you want to feel than what specifically you will be doing for money. Like, in the next couple of years, I want to establish multiple streams of income, be consistently putting money into retirement savings, and be in job/career that I feel like I can do everyday without getting burnt out- one where I have time & energy leftover to start building my own business perhaps or where I can work on my passions in my own time. I\u2019m allowing for and watching for any number of opportunities that could get me to that place. Basically, I\u2019ve just started thinking about it like this \u201cI don\u2019t need to decide what I\u2019m going to do for the rest of my life, I just need to decide what I\u2019m doing next.\u201d It\u2019s been really empowering- it helps me focus on goals that I can take action on today instead of focusing on distant dreams. The same applies to you: you don\u2019t need to know what you\u2019re going to do forever, you just need to know what you\u2019re going to do next. And I think you\u2019re heart is telling you that it\u2019s not \u201cenroll for another semester.\u201d And that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll never go back to school. \u201cFiguring our what I want to do next\u201d is a perfectly fine answer to \u201cwhat are you going to do next\u201d too.", "author": "verytinytim", "created": 1591485550, "upvotes": 1}, "ft7fyn2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gxp2fs/is_there_any_point_for_me_to_try_to_continue/ft7fyn2/", "text": "What's GPA?\n\nI'm from Portugal, Europe.....", "author": "MPRF12345", "created": 1591484409, "upvotes": 1}, "ft7bx70": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gxp2fs/is_there_any_point_for_me_to_try_to_continue/ft7bx70/", "text": "Sounds like you miss the lost opportunity of the \u201ccollege experience\u201d the parties and socializing.

My mom was PISSED at me because she thought it meant I wasn't sad and hadn't cared about her.
