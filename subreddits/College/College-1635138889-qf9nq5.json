  "title:": "How to stop failing exams because of panic?",
  "text": "So many exams that I studied so hard on, ruined just because I panic on the exam. These are exams I could have easily gotten an A in, but end up getting a C or D just because of panic. On Friday I had a thermo exam that I failed it because I couldn\u2019t think straight and solve simple problems. Right after the exam when my mind cleared up I was able to figure out every single question in my head correctly. Because of this I can\u2019t stop thinking about how fucking dumb I am and it\u2019s been ruining my weekend.\n\nDo I have to resort to medication at this point or is there hope?",
