  "text": "I\u2019m currently a mech. engineering major who\u2019s in his sophomore year of college. I\u2019m going to graduate in 2 years and I was wondering would it make sense for me to go to college and major in something else such as computer science or computer engineering? Also I remember taking a coding class during my junior year of high school and I liked it. So after I graduate college should I go back and do computer engineering since I am also interested in coding and computers as well? What do you guys think?",

This is to cover your bases, as having a degree already may affect your financial aid eligibility. If it does, you will want to complete the second degree at the same time, which will may require an extra year or two in school. If it doesn't impact your financial aid or its otherwise not a concern (ex: you have lots of savings available) then doing it like that should be ok.",

      "text": "Many students do this. Ultimately, it's up to the university whether they'll let you double major.\n\nBut usually, you don't go BACK to school to do this; you declare an additional major.\n\nBy the way, computer engineering might not be the major you're looking for. CompE deals with designing computers. If you're primarily interested in *programming* computers, you may wish to pursue computer science or software engineering instead.",

It just comes down to how well you can manage your time honestly, but computer science and engineering could definitely be done but with quite a bit of effort.",
