  "text": "We got to talking - first in office hours, then over email - about a special interest of mine (I'm autistic and have ADHD), and I sort of info-dumped because I got super excited. He asked, but I think I went on too long when I look back. Now I feel really guilty and bad for talking this man's ear off about this super-specific research interest of mine, and I ended the email by saying I'd give his inbox a break because I was probably talking a bit excessively. But now I actually have a question about a quiz, and I feel too scared to ask it because of how much I rambled on before. I don't want to bother him anymore. \n\nHe never actually said he was annoyed, but you know how professors are. They'll be polite about everything, even if they actually want you to go away and shut up (which is really hard to read if you're neurodivergent, lol). So, basically, now I'm having a lot of anxiety about the class because I think I messed up by rambling. He knows I'm neurodivergent, so maybe he won't be irritated, but how should I proceed? Do I save the question for a later time, or do I ask and risk pissing him off?",
