  "text": "i genuinely spend most of my time doing schoolwork or thinking about it. i have expectations for my future that i know requires good grades. and i WANT to do well and be successful. yet i\u2019ve found i often don\u2019t really feel much when i get bad grades. like of course i\u2019m a little disappointed, but i can ignore it pretty easily and go one with my life. i just try and convince myself it\u2019ll be okay, so i don\u2019t care. \n\ni\u2019m wondering if anyone else feels this way or has felt this way? idk it seems wrong, especially considering ik how much i care.",

When I played sports growing up a common phrase was to think about a win or a loss for a day and then get on to the next task. Beating yourself up over it would only make it harder to do well on the next one and that took me too long to realize academically.",

On the other hand I've had so many classes whith like 50% averages on tests where the professor just curves the shit out of the grades at the end and I get an A or something. That's probably numbed me to bad grades a bit.",

During my first masters I would get said at anything not 4.0 then I started to realize I did my best and I\u2019m not going to hate myself for being flawed. I still graduated with a 3.88 and I got the degree. Now with my second masters I put all my best effort in and so far half way through I still have a 4.0. Knock on wood. So I guess if we just do our best whatever happens is meant to be and not to be down on ourselves for being ourselves.",

It definitely sucks doing poorly, especially when you feel confident and try the best you thought you could do. Honestly, as much as grades like these hurt, I try to just use them as lessons that nobody, not even myself, is perfect and shouldn't expect to do incredible at everything all the time. We're all humans just trying to make it in the world, and when we let our grades fully define who we are, or beat ourselves down for struggling occasionally, we'll never truly learn anything or grow as a person. Just try to keep your head up and remain diligent when you can! We all got this! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a",
