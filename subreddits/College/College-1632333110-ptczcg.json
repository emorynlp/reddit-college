I really want to hear it from y\u2019all because I am for sure getting out and I feel that working on my college education will set me up for success because after I leave the army I plan to transfer to a 4 year university. At the same time i feel the pressure of working towards my next promotion in the army but since I am getting out it wouldn\u2019t do a lot for me. So should I keep focusing on my educational goals as I have been and prepare for my transition out of the army? What\u2019s your guys take on this?", "author": "IceMan420_", "created": 1632333110, "retrieved": 1632946549, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdvfpkl": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptczcg/i_have_questions_about_my_college_transition/hdvfpkl/", "text": "Stop working on that promotion, you're out in 16 months.

The less time you spend at a university, the more months you can save on your GI Bill for a masters. You get 36 VERY valuable months of GI Bill - **MAKE THEM COUNT**\n\nHere's a hint on their eeputation: find a school that plays schools you've heard of in basketball.\n\nMake sure you get everything documented on your way out.\n\nSource: 25N2S '09-'15, OEF '12-'13", "author": "SamSeebourne", "created": 1632334148, "upvotes": 1}}}
