  "text": "First year of college here. I swear to god I am surrounded by a couple of these types of people in all of my classes. One of them is a mutual friend of mine. \n\nBy these types of people, I mean the people that look like they never study, takes notes, nor even bring a pencil to class. And yet, they easily pass, always raise there hands with the correct answers and so on. And here I am taking all of the notes, working hard, barely passing. Am I the only one in this situation and how can I/we overcome this. It\u2019s very dis encouraging\n\nEdit: FYI, I\u2019d say I am a fairly average or slightly above in terms of intelligence. So I am not deeply struggling and looking at everybody else pass. Im just average.",

      "text": "Remember, perception is not reality. I guarentee you, some of the people you are comparing yourself to feel that way as well - maybe not in the fields you mentioned, but certainly in other areas. People tend to put on a confident, collected facade because that's emotionally easier than admitting that something is wrong. It's not fair to compare yourself to others because you do not know their full situation - we never truly can - and you are also your own person with strengths and weaknesses like the rest of us.",

          "text": "There needs to be a name for this phenomenon because it's so abundantly common for new college students. \n\nThis goes into adulthood as well. I have conversations with my girlfriend over how the neighbors own a pool, one of those RAZR atv things, new cars and essentially just a ton of shit. The man is a construction contractor and the woman is a secretary at a termite business in a town of 3k people. \n\nIt's debt motherfuckers. They don't have money for it. It's all financed. On the surface it looks like they are doing exceptionally well though!",

      "text": "I know it\u2019s cliche, but the \u201cnever judge a book by its cover\u201d idiom is VERY applicable to college. I\u2019ve met so many people who look like douchey frat bros or stereotypical sorority girls, but are actually some of the smartest and hardest working students on campus. \n\nThese people you\u2019re talking about probably work very hard to achieve their success. Innate intelligence can only get you so far in college. Just because they show up to class in saggy sweatpants and a backwards baseball cap doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not working their ass off outside of the classroom.",

          "text": "Yes! The transition to college is hard. A lot of us were among the top students in our high school. Then we go to college where everyone is that smart or smarter and we no longer stand out. It is super hard to stop comparing ourselves (especially in pre-med tracks), but it's so liberating",

However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the latter half has to be the same size. Imagine a pizza. Your mind is going to be half thin crust, but nothing is stopping you from making the other half deep dish.",
