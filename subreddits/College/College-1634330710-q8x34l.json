(A rally for anti bullying, get more involved in your community, join the chess club etc).  \n\nIf you know, start Thinking of topics or talking points. bullying=bad, who you can talk to like teachers or parents, you\u2019re not Alone, see something say something etc.  like general ideas or points.\n\nJust some thoughts off the top of my head. Hope this helps. Anyone else please chime in and correct me or add ideas.",
