  "text": "How is this fair? I never got the link to a test, emailed my teacher before it was over, and never got help. She is now giving me a zero meaning i\u2019m failing. Ive done great in everything ive gotten the chance to do but now because of a technical error and some lazy teacher who makes no effort to help her students i\u2019m failing. make this make sense.",

      "text": "So just to be clear, was the link to the test in your school LMS (e.g. Canvas, Moodle, etc) for the course? \n\nBecause normally you wouldn't need to be \"sent\" the link to the test if it's being done online. It's posted there, alongside all the other course content. Perhaps in a separate section for tests/quizzes, or grouped with the material the test was on.",

If an exam is hosted through the LMS, it\u2019s been linked there, and the availability was made known ahead of time.\n\nWhat was the technical error you mentioned? Did you contact the help desk as soon as it happened? How many days was the exam open?",
