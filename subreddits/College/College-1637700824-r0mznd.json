  "text": "I\u2019m 21, and on track to finish my Gen Ed\u2019s by December and I know I\u2019m starting late; however, better late than never. I want to get into cyber security or a job that has opportunities to grow and develop. I have no idea how I should go about going into my first year. Weather I should take out a loan and pay for it after I look for grants and other helpful financial avenues; or just save up first and pay for it little by little while working a mediocre future less factory job.",
