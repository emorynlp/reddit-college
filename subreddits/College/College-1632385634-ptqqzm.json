I realize I'm generalizing that all international students are feeling the same but I can just say for myself It's been REALLY boring so far. In 2020 i got stuck on campus for the last 2 and a half months of the spring semester where I was alone and just living the most boring life ever. Now after a year of going back home and doing school online I'm forced to come back to in-person. Before COVID I used to be able to rent a car and go to kickboxing and the gym, now that service has been shut down, 90% percent of the friends I had here are gone and there is nothing else to do. The \"let's get back to normal\" has become a trend like everything else nowadays and nobody really cares if you're actually ready to come back. I know most people that wanted in-person classes just missed the parties and all the\"fun\" stuff that happens in college, cause when we were hybrid and there was social distancing and stuff most people enrrolled for online. Hybrid in my opinion should have continued so people have the choice of deciding on what works best for them.", "author": "Ana1_Flute", "created": 1632415737, "upvotes": 2}, "hdyhvp1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptqqzm/wtf_am_i_doing_with_my_life/hdyhvp1/", "text": "I feel this.
