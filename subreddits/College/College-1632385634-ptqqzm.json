  "text": "covid has seriously changed my perspective on school so much and going from online to in person has been such a struggle for me and made me realize how much i hate living on a college campus and going to my in person classes. online gave me the freedom to do what i wanted throughout the day while still getting my homework done/learning. i am a sophomore and i want to leave my school most likely next semester but i don\u2019t know what to do. i want to still get an education but i don\u2019t want in person classes and i also don\u2019t want to stay at home for the next 2-3 years. i would love to find a school that offers all online courses and then just move wherever tf i want but i don\u2019t want to be alone \nanyone wanna move to da mountains and get a cute apartment w me and be my roommate while doing online hheheheeh pls",

      "text": "It's even more unfair for international students who have been disconnected from the friends they made while on campus (in US) for the past year since we've been home. I realize I'm generalizing that all international students are feeling the same but I can just say for myself It's been REALLY boring so far. In 2020 i got stuck on campus for the last 2 and a half months of the spring semester where I was alone and just living the most boring life ever. Now after a year of going back home and doing school online I'm forced to come back to in-person. Before COVID I used to be able to rent a car and go to kickboxing and the gym, now that service has been shut down, 90% percent of the friends I had here are gone and there is nothing else to do. The \"let's get back to normal\" has become a trend like everything else nowadays and nobody really cares if you're actually ready to come back. I know most people that wanted in-person classes just missed the parties and all the\"fun\" stuff that happens in college, cause when we were hybrid and there was social distancing and stuff most people enrrolled for online. Hybrid in my opinion should have continued so people have the choice of deciding on what works best for them.",
