  "text": "Hello Colleagues of Reddit,\n\nI was fortunate enough to receive an invitation from a good family friend of mine who works in the film industry that the director he introduced me to earlier this year would like me to star in a movie in Hollywood as a minor role, but with lots of famous celebrities (I wouldn\u2019t list their names because it could be a spoiler? maybe?) I guess I left him on some good impressions.\n\nThe only downside is that I go to college on the opposite side of the country in the East Coast, when the movie will shoot next semester. I am not a film major nor am I part of any acting majors or anything like that. I major biology and minor in language studies, which seems far off from this opportunity. I am also a senior who is working on a senior project and has lots of lab work for the courses next semester. However, I would really like to take on this opportunity not because I want to become an actor or anything, but I think this is the coolest thing I can do in my early 20s and something I can always tell others about down the road. I really thin that this is an opportunity of a lifetime and I know that someone out there would die to have this opportunity. I would also regret it a lot if I have to leave this opportunity behind. Thus, I am debating whether I should talk to the professors about possibly missing a big chunck of their lectures next semester (possibly a whole month or two) and hopefully I can makeup for exams and assignments, if they can somehow make it work for me. Would this be too much to ask to the professors? Do schools usually allow students to work around these special circumstances? Or would I sound like a complete immature idiot asking for something too much? I generally have a good relationship with them and my school has only 5,000 students and most classes are 30 students max, if that can somehow be the deciding factor.\n\nAnother option is if I take the entire semester off and delay my graduation a year, but this is something I would not like to do at all because those upper level classes will hit hard once I\u2019m off the books for a year and I don\u2019t want to delay my academic journey to med school with a gap year.\n\nWhat do you guys think I should do? Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!",
