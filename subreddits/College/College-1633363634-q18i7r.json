      "text": "You didn't mention what country youre from, so I'll just assume the USA. In that case, USC has the World Bachelor's of Business. First year is in USC, then in a Hong Kong university, then Milan university, then the 4th year is your choice (from any of those 3). You end up getting 3 degrees (each one from each university) and study in 3 different continents",

      "text": "This would be quite unusual, because most universities want you to receive a specific percentage of your education from their professors before they hand you a diploma with their name on it.  \n\n\nIt is not a good image for the university to hand you a diploma if you took all low-quality courses from the foreign universities.  \n\nNo offense intended to study abroad programs or foreign universities - it's just a straightforward comment on the degree-issuing university not having control over the quality of education at the other schools you may have attended.  \n\n-----  \n\nWould you write a detailed, professional letter of recommendation for someone you met one time for just a few minutes?",
