  "text": "So I\u2019m stuck in a group work assignment with individuals who are either working and/or busy with their family life. Is it wrong for me to offer to do most of the work? I don\u2019t want to come off as a control freak but I am worried that we won\u2019t get the assignment done on time based on how passive everyone has been in taking action.",
