      "text": "I personally enjoy reading, painting, and various other arts and crafts. I think it helps stimulate the mind I don\u2019t think it gets boring because I\u2019m always thinking of ideas for my next project. I also sell a lot of things I make on Facebook groups so they aren\u2019t taking up space, and I can make back what I spent on supplies and have a little extra cash too. \n\nI usually paint small canvases with my school colors or themes for the various sororities on campus (sorority girls are ALWAYS looking to buy crafts so they don\u2019t have to make them) and I also take requests. I make resin jewelry, vinyl stickers and iron on decals with my Cricut machine, beaded jewelry, and very small and simple sewing crafts like scrunchies and masks. The only things that take up space in my room are the Cricut machine and my tiny battery powered sewing machine. Everything else is pretty easy to store and doesn\u2019t take up a ton of space. \n\nAs a bonus, none of these really require any artistic talent, just a couple YouTube tutorials. The paintings I do aren\u2019t complex, they are simple shapes and lettering most of the time.",
