  "text": "I'm arranging an online Zoom event for my school.  We'll have a transfer admissions officer from a California University speak to our community college students about transferring and need-based aid. What day and time would you say the event should be so that students are free to and able to join? I don't want to schedule it when too many students are in class or when too many are finished for the day and don't want to do school stuff anymore.\n\nThe Zoom recording will later be turned into a podcast.\n\nThank you!",
