Employers don\u2019t usually care about that at all as long as you show experience on your resume and sell yourself well. There\u2019s tons and tons of people who got \u201cgood\u201d degrees like marketing or commerce that struggle to find a job after graduation because they didn\u2019t do anything during college except get the degree that made them look good to employers. \n\nThe reason people associate certain degrees with lack of job opportunities in my opinion is because if your only goal was to make a lot of money, something random like sociology or English probably didn\u2019t stick out to you when you declared a major. People who really want a good job over anything else are more likely to do commerce, marketing, math, Econ, etc. But by no means does that mean that you can\u2019t get the kind of jobs those people get with a different degree as long as you\u2019re able to stick out to an employer and show them why they should hire you. \n\nAlso if you get a PhD in any field I think that\u2019s an extremely cool degree. I\u2019ve always been envious of those working in research and getting to learn for a living. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s shortsighted when people automatically think soci majors are going to struggle, like what if they wanted to go into research? You can make decent money and earn a lot of prestige and respect in your field if you\u2019re good enough. \n\nThe people who point to certain majors and make fun of them for not being able to get jobs later are completely speaking out of their asses. They have no clue what they\u2019re talking about and assume a business degree means a big firm is going to hand them a 6 figure salary. Experience is everything, the degree is just a signal that you\u2019re smart enough to make it through years of stressful school, it doesn\u2019t matter what the major is. This is different if you want to do something very specialized, but that should be obvious. \n\nI know this because I went to an academic advisor saying that I was considering switching out of economics for psychology but was worried about job prospects if I did so. He told me what I wrote above. This advice was corroborated by another advisor, my councillor, and my dad, who works at a big firm. \n\nI would just ignore those people because they\u2019re a lot less smart and gifted than they think. \n\nTLDR: get a degree in whatever you want, get real-life job experience to show employers you\u2019re capable. The degree doesn\u2019t matter, it just matters that you have one.

Capitalism has evolved to the point that knowledge production is increasingly constrained by practicality, utilitarianism, \"innovation\", and so on. Disciplines that result in aerospace manufacture or sophisticated machinery match this description. Sociology and anthropology do not. But they offer us other things. Today I taught a group of second years key critical sociological concepts by having them do an activity and then reflecting on them, and they said really smart things that made me proud that *I* was the one to got them to put those pieces together. They did all the work, I just guided them. And once they're done the course there are 60 people who can use that sociological vocabulary to help shape the world around them, re-shape connections, do important things, and so on. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, critical thinking about society and the structures that produce inequality is just as important as the machines that engineers and whoever else produce, because (and this is hard for people to believe), capitalism isn't always going to be around.

Yet, majority, if not all, of the systems that govern society is based of math?  Computer science, engineering, physics, and all the other sciences is based off of math.
