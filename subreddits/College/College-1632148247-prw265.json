My Depression is getting bad again. I have a very hard time getting to my classes. i have a hard time Getting up in the morning, showering, brushing my teeth, eating anything. I go days without eating. I can barely get out the door without tears in my eyes. and on the days when I do get to a class, i go back to my dorm before my next one because i\u2019m so anxious. Then the cycle repeats, I can\u2019t leave again to go to my next class. Regardless, I\u2019m trying my best. I have no problem getting the work in on time, i have no problem learning the material. I don\u2019t need due date extensions i just need lenient attendance. I don\u2019t understand how i can fail an entire class due to the soul fact that i missed 5 classes. It\u2019s only September and I\u2019m falling down the hole of grief and sleepless nights again. I want to get ahead now, Make a plan and figure out how I can be successful with this illness. What can I do? Online classes, disability accommodations?

First and foremost, your health and wellbeing comes before school, whether that means taking a semester off, a leave of absence, attending an outpatient clinic, and so on. Make sure that if you do have to take time away from school, that you're utilizing it to the best of your ability. This doesn't mean having to be productive when you really need rest and relaxation, it just means have a plan for what you're going to do in that time. Trying out and titrating medications without school stress in the mix might be one circumstance where taking time off might be beneficial.\n\nStart thinking of what you can do to get out of your current circumstances. What do you need, who do you need to see, how do you go about doing that, etc. Once you're in a better place, start thinking about what you can do to maintain that trajectory. What are some signs that things are getting worse? How will you address them if they come up? What will you do if things get worse? We all fall down, sometimes through no fault of our own, but knowing what to do if you fall can make all the difference in the world.\n\nRoutines, setting goals, etc. are going to be really important. But remember, routines aren't formed overnight, they take practice and time. You don't have to like, flip a switch and be the most productive person ever, you have to work your way up from where you're at to where you want to be. A daily routine, a school routine, a before-sleep routine, etc. On a good day, what's your routine? On a bad day, what are your priorities? When setting goals, don't set them with your ideal level of functioning in mind, set them with your actual level of functioning in mind, and adjust as necessary. \n\nDefinitely get in touch with your school's disability resource center ASAP. Through my disability resource center, I have flexibility with deadlines and attendance. You can also get priority registration for next semester to give you more options with your scheduling and to avoid having to take early morning classes. They can also help you with getting an exemption from the minimum credit requirement if you decide to take an easier courseload to focus on your health. I'm not sure about online classes for an in-person class, but I know you can at least get recorded lectures and transcripts. You'll be paired with an access consultant, who will work with you to determine the accommodations you need, and also work with your instructors to implement these accommodations, as well as advocating for you when necessary. In the event you have an extended absence due to your depression, they can help you contact your instructors and work with them to figure out how to get you back on track.\n\nAnother thing I'd consider is looking at your school's mental health resources. Through my school's clinic, everyone is entitled to a certain number of free therapy and counseling sessions each year if you've paid your student services fee. Maybe your school has something similar? There's some limitations usually--the demand is pretty high, especially in COVID times, and you usually can't get weekly sessions unless you have a more urgent situation. Academic counseling may also be a good idea.\n\nIf you have the means, weekly therapy and seeing a doctor on a regular basis to get your medications managed, is really good to have going on. It's always important to have a strong support system in place for when you need it.", "author": "FamishedHippopotamus", "created": 1632163012, "upvotes": 7}, "hdlj56f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prw265/depression_affecting_my_attendance/hdlj56f/", "text": "Focus on just the bare minimum of meeting your bodily needs. Routine routine routine. Setting a daily routine that you stick to every day makes things easier. Use your support system. Even if you may not feel like you have people that care about you, you do. Consider counseling. Counseling is good for everybody no matter what their mental state is. If you have an aversion to counseling I promise it won't be as bad as you think it will be.", "author": "Zefphyrz", "created": 1632149999, "upvotes": 7}}}
