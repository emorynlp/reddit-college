  "text": "I am a junior and can potentially graduate next semester. I plan to graduate with 2 bachelor\u2019s, having fulfilled pre-medicine classes as well. My goal is to go to medical school, but I plan to take gap year(s).\n\nThe \u201cproblem\u201d is that I have a full tuition and fees scholarship that is good for 4 years. So, by graduating early I basically give up tens of thousands of dollars. \n\nMy options are:\n- graduate early and find a gap year job (I am interested in being a lab tech and in teaching English abroad)\n- graduate early and look into master\u2019s programs abroad (dual citizenship, can get free master\u2019s education) \n- don\u2019t graduate and study abroad for a semester or the whole year (I\u2019m interested in study abroad, but at the same time don\u2019t want to risk hurting my GPA if classes in a foreign language are more difficult than expected)\n- don\u2019t graduate and continue with school here, potentially adding another major or minor (I would add a foreign language major and/or a math minor) \n\nI have to make a decision soon and I just have no idea. On one hand I kinda wanna chill and just have a job, but on the other hand I want to explore and live/study abroad.",

      "text": "Free money is free money and more education never hurts, particularly if you are going into medicine. Fluency in a foreign language will make you a better doctor for any patients you get who have that language as their native tongue. I will say-- and this is a completely biased take as someone on track to become a biostatistician-- but if you could use a math minor to help you actually understand the basics of statistics (because most doctors don't and it's frustrating) then that will also help you become a better physician.",

          "text": "The reason I am considering a math minor is actually because I love statistics lol (my school doesn\u2019t offer a stats minor). I am an economics major so I have a good statistics background, and I\u2019m taking a biostatistics course this semester just out of interest. An MD/PhD in Biostatistics sounds awesome, so I think it would definitely be helpful to have a math minor at least.\n\nThanks for the response!",
