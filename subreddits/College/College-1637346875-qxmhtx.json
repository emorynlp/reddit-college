  "title:": "Letting myself fail a class",
  "text": "Not that anyone cares, but I\u2019m letting myself fail a class because it\u2019s too late to withdraw from it. It\u2019s too hard, and every single thing you could think of to help me succeed has already been done but nothing has worked, every single thing. I want to kill my self but I won\u2019t, because I\u2019ve been going through so much mentally and this class is a very big reason for it. I just give up, I have nothing left to give. Im so disappointed in myself but what else am I supposed to do? Im stupid at this subject and nothing will ever change that. \n\nIm doing fine in my other classes, but I\u2019m still barely getting by. I had to leave my dorm so I could try to improve my mental health and be closer to my support system, but even that hasn\u2019t worked. Im even taking a break from school after this semester is over, but the only thing that can really help me right now is to prioritize myself over school. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I know someone will suggest therapy, but it\u2019s so expensive and every person I\u2019ve contacted for therapy has said they\u2019re not taking new clients. I just feel so lost and hopeless, this semester and this class broke me because I\u2019m not used to losing. Anyways thanks for reading, I know I\u2019m not the only one going through this, so feel free to share your story.",

      "text": "Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. The first time I failed a class I didn\u2019t react the way I thought I would. I was too busy studying for my other courses that when I checked my final grade and saw an F, I just accepted it and moved on because I didn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with it at the time. \n\nIf you think prioritizing your other classes over the one that\u2019s too difficult is your best course of action trust your judgement. In reality, failing a class is not the end of the world I originally thought it would be, and I was still able to graduate on time. You\u2019ll be ok, college is rough, you still got this. Good luck with all your other courses!",

      "text": "Hey, do you know for sure you can't do some kind of alternative work just to get a passing grade? You never know til you ask, some instructors are really flexible that way. \n\nAlso if have suicidal thoughts please reach out- schools have free counseling for that.\n\n And even if you do fail, it is not the end of the world! I flunked out of undergrad, my negative attitude was a warning sign to myself I was ignoring. I got help, worked for a while, then went back and now am working on a masters.  You might just need to give school, and yourself, a break! Be well \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

          "text": "With how the course is set up, if I fail one test I fail the class, but the tests can technically be taken over and over til you pass. Just can\u2019t pass even with tutoring and I can feel my brain deteriorating. And I can\u2019t really go to school counseling because I retreated to my dads house 2 hours away. And while it\u2019s going to be quite hard to get past this, it\u2019s good to know it\u2019s not over, so thanks for your kind words",
