      "text": "Had similar experiences and its totally normal. Had days where i was just exhausted and can sleep the day away and other times my mind would race and worry about what i would do the next day and if i can do everything on time and whatnot.\n\nThe worst answer i can give is to just do your work earlier and not procrastinate so much(im not assuming here but this helped me) and this makes sleeping so much easier. Also study more for your exams if you usually never feel comfortable the day or coming days before. If you dont feel confident then usually it means that you havent studied enough.",
