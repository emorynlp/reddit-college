  "text": "I am a junior illustration major with only a few quarters left. I'm not sure whether or not I should move back to my college. It's 16 hours from where I grew up in 8 hours from where I'm at now. The pandemic let me do classes online (which I very much enjoyed) and move in with my fiance I'm finally after a year and a half in a place where I enjoy and feel safe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to my advisor and the head of my major in they both said that it's not an online school so I can't graduate online. Which I do understand fully but the pandemic's not over and that doesn't leave me very many options. They also announced this a week before registration. So no I couldn't have planned to head too much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoving back would mean living on my own in a city I don't feel comfortable. I also have a dog and he's a whole different story, but he will be moving with me. I'm just not sure I can balance all of it at once. The school takes over the entire city so living there I have to be very independent since it's not a normal college campus. The quarters are pretty short, very condensed, and very hard to complete but I've been doing such a good job with these past quarters and especially online. I have problems with being in front of people and in with a group of people so online has allowed me to focus just on the school work and not on everything else that comes with on-ground classes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a reason I'm an illustrator looking to do freelance for the rest of my life. I can work well with people one-on-one or in small groups or teams but get me in a classroom setting with a whole bunch of people and I do not thrive. Plus the recordings and how every assignment is written down makes things super easy for me to grasp. No more miscommunications because I miss something the professor said. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy mental health has been declining rapidly as of late. Recently having a large event give me (undiagnosed) PTSD. That's been making it very hard to go out in public or be around people who I don't know or trust. I've also explicitly been having nightmares every night which is making it very hard to get proper sleep. That is all on top of other conditions I do have and I don't feel the need to explain here. They all make it very hard for me to be independent, much less fully independent living on my own and being a full-time student. Moving would mean I'm leaving all of my support systems behind. Even with my current supports I've tried, or come way too close to trying, to un alive myself a few times over the pandemic. Living on my own only gives me more room to do so. And fewer reasons to hold back. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also just don't know if I need a degree in illustration. Many of the artists I look up to never got a formal degree in art and in the end, they don't hire you based on your degree. It's all about your portfolio. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does that mean I should drop out? Do I just work on all of the freelance accounts, websites, and apps that I already have been for the past years and hope that one day it'll work? Maybe illustration just isn't for me, it's more of a hobby. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then what do I tell my family? Specifically, my grandparents who are helping me through college financially. None of them care much for mental health in the slightest. And don't find it realistic for my to be struggling at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI kept my grades really good this whole time, no matter my struggles. I'm not considering dropping out because I'm lazy or don't care. I just don't know if I can do all of this for much longer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen was all this time and money a waste? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried transferring to an online school but the way that my college sets up its courses makes it so that you cannot transfer anywhere else. Effectively trapping anybody who's put in too much time and money to start all over again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly not entirely sure what I'm asking here but any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
