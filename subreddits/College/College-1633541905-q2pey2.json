  "title:": "GPA on resume question",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm currently applying to jobs and thing is, my GPA kinda sucks. I had a poor junior year (with a bunch of failed classes) that brought my GPA down to a 3.38. I'm retaking those classes this semester and I recalculated my GPA (as if I hadn't failed them) which would've lead me to have a 3.6 GPA.\n\nNow, I've already submitted a copy of my resume with a 3.6 GPA on it to the recruiter at the job fair, and now I'm worried that I'll be found out since they have followed up asking for an interview. 3.6 is pretty different from 3.38.\n\nShould I just change my resume GPA to the actual value? Do interviewers typically ask for transcripts? Any advice? Tyia",
