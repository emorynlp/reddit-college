To my knowledge we will also be alternating every week who actual goes on campus and who doesnt. Of course, it can also be up to the professor's discretion what aspects stay online and what has to be in person.\n\nFor the Online Classes it will be the same deal that we went through last semester and currently in the summer sessions/semester. Some will be at the same time as what the regular class would have been while others will just be lectures recorded and posted and just do assignments and watch the lectures on our own time before all deadlines.\n\nFace coverings will be mandatory and I believe they are also setting up a thing where all students, professors, employees, and admins will have to get tested for covid within a certain number of days before the semester starts on September 1st. They are also setting up a system where pretty much everything is getting cleaned every 1-2 hours. Everything will also be operating at 50% capacity at most and this figure will be increased as it gradually gets lifted for the state of NJ.

My university is also moving classes online without properly notifying students which leads to some students with totally online schedules which leads into housing. My university is not expanding options to opt out of housing for next year because where I go, we sign a legally binding contract back in October and November when we sign up for the next year and it is super hard to get out of along with paying 60 percent of room and board as a fee. This kind of situation has put me into a predicament where I am unable to get out of housing as easily and if I don\u2019t then I\u2019ll be forced to go in blind because my other roommates have already gotten out of housing (for other reasons).", "author": "metalstorm65", "created": 1593233478, "upvotes": 3}, "fw4zp0h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hghori/schools_being_very_vague_about_fall_2020/fw4zp0h/", "text": "My school just said we are doing hands on classes but they are taking precautions, whatever that means", "author": "Naked-Communist", "created": 1593233285, "upvotes": 2}, "fw4znvu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hghori/schools_being_very_vague_about_fall_2020/fw4znvu/", "text": "Mine are gonna put a ton of students in a hotel.

The most important decision will probably be around housing/food and such.
