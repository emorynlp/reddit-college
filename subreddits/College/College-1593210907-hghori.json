  "text": "Is anyone else\u2019s school being super vague about their plans for fall semester? \n\nMy school has basically said it will be a combination of in-person and online, but nothing beyond that or how that will be implemented. At this point, I just want to know so I can make my plans sooner rather than later. I know we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and everything is really up in the air right now, but it\u2019s getting pretty close to when we need to start making decisions about the fall. \n\nPart of me thinks that they\u2019re going to wait until most of tuition and housing are paid and then say it\u2019s predominantly online, no student events, etc. My major is very hands on, so if classes are mostly online, that will probably be a dealbreaker for me. I just don\u2019t want to get stuck paying full tuition for half the experience...",

I'm not good at managing my time enough at home or staying away from distractions and online would be significantly harder for me.",

      "text": "mine is doing \"converged learning\" for Freshman and Sophomore Level classes (100 and 200 level courses) and online only for Junior, Senior, and all Graduate Courses (300+ Level Courses with the exception of Labs)\n\nConverged Learning as it pertains to my college is that all classes that are under this classification will be Face-To-Face, but they will be giving assignments as for who actually goes on campus for the class at a time to limit capacity while the other students will be tuning into the lecture somehow through the same means that we did last semester in online learning. To my knowledge we will also be alternating every week who actual goes on campus and who doesnt. Of course, it can also be up to the professor's discretion what aspects stay online and what has to be in person.\n\nFor the Online Classes it will be the same deal that we went through last semester and currently in the summer sessions/semester. Some will be at the same time as what the regular class would have been while others will just be lectures recorded and posted and just do assignments and watch the lectures on our own time before all deadlines.\n\nFace coverings will be mandatory and I believe they are also setting up a thing where all students, professors, employees, and admins will have to get tested for covid within a certain number of days before the semester starts on September 1st. They are also setting up a system where pretty much everything is getting cleaned every 1-2 hours. Everything will also be operating at 50% capacity at most and this figure will be increased as it gradually gets lifted for the state of NJ. Right now for NJ i think a very limited number of nonessential businesses can have 25% capacity as we are still gradually opening just to be safe.\n\nOf course, this is all tentative. I both live and go to college in New Jersey so as things change, then this all changes.",

The flowery University language is that they\u2019re closely monitoring the situation and at this current point, things have been changing too rapidly to truly make a decision. \n\nIn actuality? No one wants to blink first and lose money, because colleges are ultimately for-profit businesses. Even if the COVID cases in your area look like things can\u2019t open back up, the school wants to drag everything out so people won\u2019t pull out of housing contracts, drop out of classes, etc. \n\nMy school has ridiculous rules about everything like the library will not be open for studying BUT the football stadium will be fully open and operational and the only thing they\u2019re doing is requiring masks. You want to make your plans sooner rather than later but the college makes more money off of pushing your decision back, unfortunately.",

So if you\u2019re wondering why they are being vague it\u2019s all about the bottom line, and I\u2019d say that there are definitely schools that are more concerned about their bottom line than their students, so be wary. \n\nMost classes are going to effected on some level by this, so I\u2019d say based on your major you have to decide how much you can tolerate online courses or courses with staggered attendance days. Some majors might be fine but I know if I was still in school (fine arts major) I\u2019d probably be taking a break year since no one wants to learn art over zoom.\n\nFor people getting funded through scholarships or student loan programs this might be a harder choice since renewal for a lot these programs Is automatic with enrolment, buy if you cancel it for a year you\u2019ll likely have to start the process again, add there is no guarantee you\u2019ll qualify again.",

There are a lot of reasons why this is taking so long, and there are much stronger incentives for waiting than collecting tuition deposits. One thing I'll mention is that the exact discussions happening here are happening at the K-12 level, where tuition isn't a consideration (for public schools), and they're at the same level of detail/ambiguity.",

So they are looking at the situation and giving vague instructions to be elaborated later. Covid will loom over all of us for at least another year looking at the complete and utter chaos that originated from a lagging, insufficient, staggered response and. Just personally it will be safer to do online classes. \n\nOn the bright side as long as you are actively seeking out info from your school you should be in good shape. The most important decision will probably be around housing/food and such. I do not think colleges will lower their tuition because some are in financially tricky situations( loss of significant income from international students, maybe loss income from research being suspended) and others just because college degree is still in high demand.\n\nIf you are looking to lower tuition perhaps consider enrolling in a \"safe-list\" credited local college and make sure units transfer. Once things resumes to normalcy(minimum 1 year) you can transfer. Good luck, may the force be with all of us!",

We\u2019re starting to see second wave numbers and a lot of states have to regress in phases and shut down again.

I know that\u2019s impacted planning on our campus.\n\nAnd finally, if your college has said they\u2019re going to do a hybrid, that probably means they left it up to the instructors to decide so that they can be mindful of the various needs of their professors. Most faculty are probably high risk, and a lot of students are still scared to return to campuses. I know I will be teaching in person because I\u2019m not high risk, but two of my co-workers are choosing to offer online only courses. My advice is don\u2019t \u201cwonder what to do\u201d, and go ahead register for courses, knowing things will probably be up in the air for the first semester as we see how this all progresses. Things are much more likely to be normal for second semesters or Winter quarters. If you can, I really ask you to not consider sitting the semester out, because many of our department budgets are entirely contingent upon the number of students we have coming back, and many staff members will be laid off if we don\u2019t have enough students.",

Also, at my school, a majority of buildings have their main entrance as the accessible door so it's a non issue.\n\nThese are common statements but rarely true. Recent investigations at my uni found that buildings were far less accessible than claimed. The accessible routes were often locked, blocked by cars/objects/people, the doors too heavy, the route too long and out of the way, often outside without any cover from rain. Sometimes people would lock one side of a double door, making it no longer accessible by wheelchair.\n\n>If you have any other issues you think we might need to cover... Feel free to dm me. It's always nice to see people point out the difficulties students with disabilities have...\n\nGlad that your uni is doing so much, but let's not pretend it's the norm. The vast, **vast** majority of universities aren't even going to provide enough masks for all staff and students, let alone plan ahead and get clear ones. Many people with accommodations were already completely screwed over by the switch to online because their accommodations *didn't* work online and they needed extra help for online courses that wasn't included in their in-person document. Students with accommodations will have to be prepared to fight their admin tooth and nail for a fair go.\n\n>Honestly, we are way more worried about students registered with us who are immunocompromised this semester.... There is only so much we can do to help if they come back for in person classes.\n\nI think the greater concern should be immunocompromised **staff**. Students can opt to go online as there are definitely going to be some who have to do that and there will have to be systems to support it. But if staff are forced to teach sections hybrid or in-person then they're at risk. And a lot of places are making it very difficult for their professors to opt into fully online teaching.",

What I'm seeing at places that plan to open are generally policies that *require* faculty to be on campus unless they have a letter from their doctor approved by HR. That's certainly the case at my school and at the large majority of those where I have friends teaching (many dozens).",

When they say that the plan will be contingent on government advice and will follow the latest health and safety advice, what they're saying is that they don't yet have the guidance needed to make concrete plans because the guidance hasn't been written yet by the government officials. \n\nIf you want the university to act faster then you need to place pressure on the government who'd be issuing guidelines and requirements for things like required spacing, airflow, risk mitigation for vulnerable staff and students, and the application of disability accommodations in such a restricted physical and online environment. Plus there are the issues beyond undergraduate students. Research staff and graduates have their own challenges that demand just as much, if not more, attention. It's a logistical nightmare. Most places don't even really have someone \"in command\" of the situation, whose job it is to relate 100% of information to the right groups. There are definitely conversations happening but it's no one's job to tell you. It's just a real mess.",

And even back during 2008 when there is the big house bubble collapse colleges were still increasing their tuition. They're not doing it because they're more valuable they're not doing it because you need them more. They're doing it just to get more and more cash. No one's trying to make sure these colleges are tightening their budgets or spending their money more wisely. And I'm not talking cutting budgets for research. Some teenagers can make apps that work like zoom and are more localized so they're less of a Target. And no Zoom literally got attacked last week by a Chinese party and at least millions of information details locations etcetera. And then about getting reported on. Whenever you have a high conglomeration of people all using one thing and it can mind data and information that may otherwise be on your phone computer Etc it gets a lot of attacks. And I personally go to therapy every week. I now have to see my therapist through Zoom. But she also works with a lot of other people who are poor in impoverished and who get free phones from the government. During this time it's been a godsend for them that way they can do Telehealth and all of that. However these people literally use their phones as their computer. There's tons of data mining that people don't realize even if they're getting information on the poor people around you and that's not you.
