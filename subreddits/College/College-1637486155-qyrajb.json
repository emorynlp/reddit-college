  "text": "I moved out of home for the first time a couple months ago to go to college at the other side of the country. I realized within the first 1 and a half months that I'd made quite a terrible decision. I can't stand not seeing my loved ones for 3 or 4 months at a time. It's destroying me. I've made some friends but I feel so alone all the time. I try to fill up my days with things to do so I keep these thoughts away, but at the end of the day, I come home and cry myself to sleep. Then there are days where I can't bring myself to do anything; I just sit in bed crying. \n\nI feel alienated from everyone and like I'm losing them; my parents, my old friends, my partner. I'm seriously considering transferring to a college closer to my hometown. That way I'll be able to visit home almost every weekend. I don't know what to do, how will my parents and everyone else reacts. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR: Going to college at the other side of the country is destroying my mental health. Thinking of transferring to college closer to home.",

      "text": "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t recommend going to a school that close to home. I would recommend utilizing your school\u2019s counseling services tho. \n\nI understand that it\u2019s hard to be away from home and college is a huge adjustment, but I don\u2019t think going to a college so close to home that you can go back literally every single weekend is going to help you. I feel like it will just continue to stifle your independence. At some point in your life you\u2019re going to have to be okay with not going back home to see your parents every five days. It\u2019s just a part of growing up. It\u2019s a difficult and shitty part, but it\u2019s important to get to a point where u don\u2019t fall apart just bc you haven\u2019t hugged your mom in two weeks.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s just my opinion. I have a slightly more detached relationship with my father (my mom passed away), so maybe that\u2019s why I feel the way I do. I wish you the best of luck and, again, talk to your schools counseling services. They deal with stuff like this literally all the time. They expect people to struggle with homesickness like this.",
