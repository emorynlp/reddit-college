  "text": "# \n\nI screwed up.\n\nOur uni asked us to submit the assignment to a plagiarism detection system, we will then receive a receipt containing a declaration of honesty statement. Sign it and submit the assignment and the receipt to the online submission system for professors to score the submission. I did submit the assignment and the receipt, but I forgot to sign the receipt. Faculty sent an email saying my assignment will not be scored and I will receive a mark of zero.\n\nI made an explanation to the faculty, but I still need to wait a month to get their reply. It is a very important exam for me. If I got an F, I would think seriously about quitting my programme.\n\nWhat can I do now? Is it possible my faculty will go easy on me?",
