  "text": "So I\u2019m working and studying at the same time like many of you. Right now I have to choose between working and skipping lectures but can study by myself the material(No video lectures in my country, sucks) or working and attending lectures but skipping studying. \n\nJust to be more clear:\n\nOption 1: Working and attending lectures but skipping studying by myself.\n\nOption 2: working and studying by myself but skipping lectures.\n\nIt doesn't have to be always like this. My job schedule is flexible. So I can skip lectures now and study until 3 weeks before the exams. Or attend lectures now until 3 weeks before the exams to stop attending lectures and study by myself.\n\nWhich one is the best strategy to follow?",
