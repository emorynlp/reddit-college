  "title:": "Advice for a Senior going into college.",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m a senior in high school and will be attending some college, I don\u2019t know for sure yet. \n\nAs I\u2019m applying to colleges there are a lot of things that I wish I knew when I was a freshman. Things that I should do, look out for, etc.\n\nI was wondering what advice you guys have for people going into college. Financial advice, social advice, advice on how to succeed in college and maintain a job. Whatever you wish you knew going into college I would love to hear, big or small. I\u2019ll be trying to write down most things. Thank you!",

      "text": "Talk to your professors, and not just before an exam when you don\u2019t know the material or after to get more points back on your grade. Talk to them throughout the semester, ask them questions about not just the coursework, but also their research, how to do well overall in university, etc. you may need letters of recommendation one day in the future, and it\u2019ll be much easier to ask professors with whom you\u2019ve had actual conversations with than asking professors who don\u2019t know you by name. For reference, I studied physics and astronomy during my undergrad, so if you have any questions with regards to either subject (or math/cs in general) feel free to pm me!",

      "text": "Advisors are practically useless. Download the course schedule for your major and follow it. It lists every course needed to earn the degree. If you are unsure what major you want to focus on, compare the schedules between the majors and focus on common courses. You can always add an introductory course of the major(s) to see how you enjoy them.\n\nYou will be in the very last group of students allowed to register for courses, so everything will be full except for general education courses. When it is time to register for courses, be online the minute registration opens. The longer you wait, the more you will be kicking yourself.\n\nThe rest of college is similar to high school. The big differences are the professors don't give a shit if you pass their course. The professors will not constantly remind you of assignments and tests.  Instead of having frequent exams, you will often only have two... don't fuck them up.",

      "text": "Echoing previous points, talk to professors. Contribute in class and ask questions. Don't be afraid to argue against the professor or another student (respectfully though). Professors, in my experience, love to be challenged provided you can accept being challenged as much as they can. Sometimes advisors are awful, so always know what you need to take before you graduate. But sometimes advisors are great, so don't be afraid to ask them.\n\nSocially? You may find it impossible to make friends for a bit in college, or you may make a ton of friends on your first day. For me, I slogged through 2 years before I really had any friends. Go to clubs you might enjoy during your first weeks there, if you dislike them you can always not show up any more. It is very different from high school socially. Cliques barely exist. Passion and ambition are not something to be ashamed of. Acting too cool for school is decidedly uncool. College is where everyone is free to release their inner nerd. Love nuclear weapons? I once spent hours talking to a fellow student about nuclear weapon policy and left with a new friend. Esoteric interests abound.\n\nSchool-wise? In many ways college can seem easier than high school. In others it can seem harder. Professors don't care if you fail or don't show up, but they are generally decent human beings. Professors all work on their own schedules though. Tests and papers may take months to get graded. You might have a class with only a midterm and a final, or a class with all your grade in one large paper due the end of the semester. Participation, even if not officially listed as graded in the syllabus, is at least informally graded. When taking classes, don't be afraid to take something fascinatingly bizarre. It might be the only chance in your life you will ever get to discuss the construction of the European understanding of the New World between 1492-1550, let alone learn from an expert professor on the subject.",

      "text": "Social advice...talk to people if you want friends. People aren't gonna just magically appear 99% of the time, it takes effort. Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone for stuff in this sense too. Finding friends in your major can be a huge benefit as you progress through it and move on to job applications...I can personally attest to this.",
