I've been working with this professor for over 2 months. Around 2 weeks ago, she stopped responding to my emails. I have already tried contacting the master's student that I'm partnered with, but he too has not responded to my email to date. What should I do? Should I continue doing the assignment she has given me?", "author": "UnhappyPart6539", "created": 1632629534, "retrieved": 1632945962, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hec3cjs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvmjpn/professor_not_responding_to_emails/hec3cjs/", "text": "At the start of a semester everyone gets very busy, it\u2019s often hard to keep up with email for profs in the first few weeks.

People are busy yk and they might have just missed the email. I\u2019ve had to email a professor 5 times before I got a response. I usually give a day or two time then follow up and keep going. Maybe he was ignoring me idk but he responded, and he made sure to never miss an email from me again lol. Make yourself impossible to ignore, but make sure the emails aren\u2019t aggressive or rude or you may never get a response. But if you don\u2019t have any immediate questions, idk the context but just keep doing the assignment is it\u2019s mandatory research.", "author": "Kenkxb", "created": 1632631022, "upvotes": 2}}}
