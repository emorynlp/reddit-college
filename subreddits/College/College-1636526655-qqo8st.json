  "text": "I'm a student at a university in the US. I live by myself and am looking to get a cell phone plan. I'm still on my families right now, but I want to take some weight off their shoulders and get my own plan. Just need one line. Mine. Haha. I do travel a lot because of school and personal things so I don't want a super crapy provider, but one that I can depend on. So the most affordable for my situation with dependable service. Thank you!",

You only pay for the cellar data you use, so if you use 0.5 GB out of the 1.0 GB ... you are only charged $5 instead of $10.\n\nCalling plan uses T-Mobile and Sprint network. They encourage you to use WiFi whenever possible to help reduce your bill. Their voice calls and text work over WiFi networks, so you do not even need to rely on the cell towers.",
