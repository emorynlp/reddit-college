  "text": "I have a BFA in graphic design and am now working towards an MBA in marketing. As you may guess, these are very different experiences. Especially since I wasn't working when I was getting my undergrad. Working full time and even going to school part time is just so overwhelming.\n\nIt's really been taking a toll on my mental health, always having something due and something I should be working on. I can never relax. I'm halfway done with my program but it's going to take another two years at this rate. I'm exhausted.\n\nI had an anxiety attack last week because I was struggling to even sit down and look at the paper I was trying to write. I feel like I'm killing myself just to watch the lectures.\n\nI just feel like such a failure. I mean, this is mostly about mental health. Wondering if anyone else has experienced similar? I struggle to do anything productive. I can't clean, organize, run errands, I'm depressed. I've been in therapy nearing a decade and am trying to find meds that work for me but it's all so draining. \n\nI just don't know why I thought I could do this if I can't even do the bare minimum.",
