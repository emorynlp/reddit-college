  "text": "Hi, I am wondering what kind of things I should do(on top of building a portfolio of work) for an art job. I'm 27 and in the military, but will probably get out when I'm 30. My current job is quite good, but I don't see myself doing it for a long time and I feel like I would rather do something art related, even if it means I'll make less money. \n\nI wanted to do this when I was younger but decided against it to pursue other things, and a big part of me wishes that i had pursued art instead. Now I'm not really sure what to do. 18-20 was the last time I really created a lot of art, since then it's been sporadic digital art, but no consistent work, so I feel I need to get back to it consistently before anything else. \n\nMy main question is, what kind of degrees should I look at? I am not sure what specific field I would like to work in, but I think fashion or graphic design might be interesting. I also like the idea of creating art work for video game or movie productions, not sure if that's even a thing. Any ideas are helpful, thanks.",
