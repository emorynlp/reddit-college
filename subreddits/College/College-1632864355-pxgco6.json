So I don't really know if this is a good combo or if I am just stressing over nothing!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spelling and realized I was freaking out a bit ", "author": "SmellyTaterTot8", "created": 1632864355, "retrieved": 1632945401, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heodgqz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxgco6/nervous_about_the_job_market_when_i_graduate/heodgqz/", "text": "You first need to consider what your career goals are.
