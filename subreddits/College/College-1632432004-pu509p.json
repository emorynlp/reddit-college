  "text": "If you take digital notes then I guess it\u2019s not that much of a problem, but if you take notes physically are they out of order?\n\nSay there\u2019s a quiz coming up on chapter 3, but you\u2019re on chapter 2. When cramming for chapter 3 and taking notes, are you taking them out of order or taking them somewhere separately?",

              "text": "Highly recommend! Would definitely encourage you to get the one you wipe clean with a cloth, not the microwavable one. It takes longer but if you leave the microwavable in a hot car your notes will disappear and if you leave it in the cold all your old notes will reappear. It comes with a couple black pens but you can use any erasable frixion pen or highlighter on it. The only issue is the pen takes a couple seconds to dry or it smudges like crazy, so if you're lefthanded it may not be the choice for you. It's been a gamechanger for my note taking",
