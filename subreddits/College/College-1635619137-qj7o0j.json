It\u2019s not necessarily advice for folks who know how they handle alcohol and know what their limits are and can self-regulate how much they\u2019re consuming well and responsibly. I think it\u2019s more for folks, like I said before, who don\u2019t have any previous experiences with alcohol (like OP said, they haven\u2019t been drunk before so I figured that was likely the case), or for folks who can sometimes have trouble figuring out when having more might be too much and aren\u2019t in a situation where it\u2019s necessarily totally safe or desirable to find out they went too far. \n\nAs far as amounts, I would find it irresponsible to tell someone, who I know nothing about nor how their tolerance is, that drinking 3 or 4 drinks in an hour will be fine for them. I\u2019d rather give a conservative estimate, and it\u2019s their choice to have more if they want to.",
