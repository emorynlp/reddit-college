  "title:": "Should I report students in my class for not using lockdown browser when myself and other students did?",
  "text": "I just took an exam that is worth 30% of my grade for the semester on lockdown browser with the monitor. I did ok. Not the best, but not horrible for not studying as much as I should've. A peer of mine texted me after asking how I did and I said I did ok. She then told me that she didn't take the exam on lockdown browser even though it was required (my professor made it very clear that it was required). My peer did not say it directly but I assume she cheated. Why else would she decide not to take it on the lockdown application? It is also likely other students did not take it on the lockdown browser since there are over 100 kids in my class. I am frustrated that students likely performed much better than me on the exam by cheating their way through while myself and others followed the rules and did it fairly. I would not mind if this was a little quiz but this exam was worth 30 fucking percent of my grade. Not sure whether to make my professor aware of this 'loophole' or to let it slide and not be a snitch. \n\nAny thoughts?",

The professor likely doesn\u2019t know how lockdown works and won\u2019t use it for future exams. Telling the professor in this situation would be the same thing as reminding the teacher to assign homework in high school. Don\u2019t get your friends in trouble and make everyone\u2019s lives harder in the future.",
