Please no rude comments either, I just want your genuine opinion/advice. So, currently I am a 24 year old graduate student studying engineering. I live at home, and my father pays for all of my things- tuition, car, trips, food, bills, and everything else. I worked a little bit in my undergrad but then quit my job to focus on school instead. I\u2019ve never payed a bill, and according to him, I shouldn\u2019t worry about it because school is number one. He claims that he will fund me until I am on my feet working as an engineer. However, after talking to some people, I\u2019m starting to have some doubts. I have had people/friends legit get mad, telling me I am not independent, I will struggle in life, I need to be a real adult and work while doing school like everyone else, ect. My friend told me I should take out loans like her instead of my dad paying for my tuition, because that\u2019s what a real adult does. Personally, I like living at home and not working while doing school but I\u2019m starting to feel really bad and judged over it.\n\nTl;dr some of my peers disapprove that my dad fully funds me while I\u2019m in school, saying that I am too old to be doing this\n\nDo you guys think I am letting people\u2019s comments get to me too much and that I am doing the right thing? Or do you think me and my dad\u2019s mindset is bad?

In American culture or some parts of the US(?) it seems once you\u2019re 18, it\u2019s expected for you to move out and support yourself.\nIn mine, you\u2019re still a teen at 18 who is figuring out life so you have to get your crap together - but while you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019ll get food and a roof over your head. The logic is that, if you don\u2019t have to worry about these, then your full focus can be on completing school. Of course a lot of my people make below American minimum wage so they qualify for financial aid. The kids get their classes fully paid while getting free room and board at home and food. For those with money and don\u2019t qualify, their parents pay for their tuition until the young adult  is able to work. \nYou just work hard and do your best for you and your dad. When you feel like quitting or not giving your best, just think of your dad\u2019s sacrifice for you and keep tugging along. As some have already said here, keep that info to yourself since some folks can be jerks about it and for those who pry then judge you after, ignore their opinions.

My brothers ex girlfriend is in almost the exact same situation and once she moved out on her own and was forced to start paying for things her life started to crumble around her because she had 1) no coping skills because she was handed everything her whole life and 2) no understanding of how expensive life is. She is now under extreme mental duress because of these things. \n\nMost people would kill to be in the situation you are in so talking about it comes off somewhat condescending and a little bit inappropriate in context to most college students situation. Knowing that you don't pay for anything can bring up feelings of jealousy because why should one person have to deal with loans well into their adult life when you don't ever have to deal with that. It is very much a privilege not to deal with student loans and acting like it's a casual thing is kind of insensitive.\n\nLastly if I was in your shoes I would feel massive pressure from myself to put my degree to use especially if that degree came from someone else's pocket.

It is learning how to live on your own.\n\nI worked since I was 16 and before I graduated high school I had 3 jobs. Dropped everything and joined the military.

By 17, I was driving and paying rent. As a kid, I was given chores and was paid for it. (a bag of leaves was $1 and in the fall I hustled.

The simplest road a person can take would be that. That's not at all what I would want especially if I were to have kids.
