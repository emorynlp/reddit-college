  "title:": "I\u2019m suspecting my roommate stole my debit card information",
  "text": "I looked at my bank account today and it was roughly $200 short and saw two transactions of about $100 each from a company I\u2019ve never heard of. I looked it up and they\u2019re a clothing brand. The charges just appeared today and I\u2019m very suspect of my roommate. We\u2019re both pretty antisocial people who never have anybody in our dorm room. My card isn\u2019t missing so I know somebody around here had to have gotten ahold of my information somehow. My roommate is my #1 suspect, I don\u2019t think anybody else in our dorm hall would have the chance to swipe my info. \n\nIf I see a box from that company in our room in the next week or two I\u2019m contacting the campus police, I\u2019m not living with a thief. The more I think about it the more I\u2019m convinced it was my roommate and the more pissed off I get. \n\nAm I being reasonable or is there another plausible explanation?\n\nUPDATE 1: Cancelled my card yesterday and got a text today that somebody tried to use my card at the same company for another $106.03. Still don\u2019t know exactly who it is yet. I contacted the company directly via email and am waiting for them to respond back.",

I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re instantly jumping to your roommate being the culprit, is there something else that you didn\u2019t mention about your roommate that makes him sus?\n\nEdit: took a look at your post history and saw the post about taking your food without asking. Yeah, that\u2019s a point against the roommate. Id invest in a lock so you don\u2019t have to worry about roommate taking your stuff",
