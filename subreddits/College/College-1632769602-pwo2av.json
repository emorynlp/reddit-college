I looked it up and they\u2019re a clothing brand. The charges just appeared today and I\u2019m very suspect of my roommate. We\u2019re both pretty antisocial people who never have anybody in our dorm room. My card isn\u2019t missing so I know somebody around here had to have gotten ahold of my information somehow. My roommate is my #1 suspect, I don\u2019t think anybody else in our dorm hall would have the chance to swipe my info. \n\nIf I see a box from that company in our room in the next week or two I\u2019m contacting the campus police, I\u2019m not living with a thief. The more I think about it the more I\u2019m convinced it was my roommate and the more pissed off I get. \n\nAm I being reasonable or is there another plausible explanation?", "author": "bottleoftrash", "created": 1632769602, "retrieved": 1632799848, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hejy4k4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwo2av/im_suspecting_my_roommate_stole_my_debit_card/hejy4k4/", "text": "U ever consider it couldve been written down at the store checkout or by a restaurant waitress or fast food worker?,", "author": "Aringhet", "created": 1632799838, "upvotes": 1}, "hejogun": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwo2av/im_suspecting_my_roommate_stole_my_debit_card/hejogun/", "text": "Have you ever kept your debit card info on the internet to buy something?
