  "text": "Serious question, I'm just wondering how people met their significant other/started the relationship. I've tried online dating, but the connection always feels forced. I would love to just organically start spending more time with a guy I like and then have that morph into a relationship, but that doesn't seem likely to happen :/ . Anyone have advice?",

Just focus on getting to know yourself and what you want out of life / other people. Respect everyone including yourself, and respectable people will match that energy towards you. It\u2019s cliche but loving yourself first really opens up the dating world for you, I wish I caught onto that sooner",
