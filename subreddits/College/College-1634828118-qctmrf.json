Get what you can out of your college experience, but don't expect it to be like the movies/TV. (As goes for anything in life, such as specific careers)",

Learning a lot of stuff I am enthusiastisch about. So I really enjoy college. Enjoying the freedom that mit having kids and No f\u00fcll time Job gives me.\n\nHowever I am Just as excited for 5 years down the Line when I'll hopefully will have been working a few years and start my own Family. Cant wait to be able to come home after work and not have to worry because I still technically habe to finish so many assignments or study for a class\n\nThen I am excited for when I and my Potential Kids are older and I get some of that freedom back (that I am happy to give away for a few years). \n\nI love College life but I am just as excited to see where life takes me, who I will become, who my loved ones will become. Getting older doesnt have to be a scary thing If what you do in life makes you happy. \n\nI am literally even excited for when I am old and retired and will sit on a park bench with my s.o getting upset at 'the youth of today' and whatnot.",

          "text": "College is where most people will likely experience tremendous growth which can make people feel it was the best time because they overcame their previous challenges. Maybe you had problems in high school, but college is where you decided to overcome them. I've seen it a lot in people with social anxiety to grades to feeling like their life wasn't going anywhere. Over the 4 years people will grow and figure themselves out.\n\nI'm taking a course that is going over the stages of life right now most will be in stage 5 of the Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development. This is the adolescence stage with characteristics of Identity vs Identity confusion.\n\n>**Identity vs. identity confusion** characterizes the fifth stage of development, which corresponds with the period of adolescence, or roughly ages twelve to eighteen. It is during this stage that individuals begin to work on the question of who they will be as an individual for the rest of their lives. If this search for the self is successful, individuals will develop an understanding of the roles they will play as an adult, and their identity. Doubt, rebellion, or confusion about future roles will lead to a sense of identity confusion.  \n>  \n>**Virtue**: Successfully developing a sense of identity involve beginning to understand personal values regarding the larger world, and one\u2019s role in it. Individuals who engage in this exploration, and successfully emerge with a degree of clarity regarding who they are, and will be, are able to become more independent in their relationships, education, work, etc., and to contribute to society.  \n>  \n>**Maldevelopment**: When an individual is unable to reconcile their role in society or to come to an understanding regarding their personal values, they may develop identity confusion. Identity confusion is characterized by personal insecurity, and a lack of clarity regarding where the individual fits in their relationships, and in society as a whole.\n\nThis is for ages 12-18 so you move past that some don't. Sometimes people are still trying to find themselves in it. Then you go to emerging adulthood\n\n>**Age of identity exploration** \\- Young people are deciding who they are and what they want out of work, school, and love.  \n>  \n>**Age of instability** \\- The post-high school years are marked by repeated residence changes, as young people either go to college or live with friends or a romantic partner. For most, frequent moves end as families and careers are established in the 30s.  \n>  \n>**Age of self-focus** \\- Freed of the parent- and society-directed routine of school, young people try to decide what they want to do, where they want to go, and who they want to be with--before those choices get limited by the constraints of marriage, children and a career.  \n>  \n>**Age of feeling in between** \\- Many emerging adults say they are taking responsibility for themselves, but still do not completely feel like an adult.  \n>  \n>**Age of possibilities -** Optimism reigns. Most emerging adults believe they have good chances of living better than their parents did, and even if their parents divorced, they believe they'll find a lifelong soul mate.",

          "text": "I\u2019ve seen a couple more scenarios that fit the same theme. Prepare for a healthy dose of cynicism xD:\n\n1. \u201cStudy\u201d abroad programs where you get all expenses paid by your parents for a semester while you wander around with your friends in Italy/France/some expensive European country with nice beaches while taking \u201cclasses.\u201d You then spam your Instagram with about 27930283839 posts and stories about this life changing ~~vacation~~ studying! \n\nOr if you\u2019re more crunchy granola you work in a park/wildlife preserve/poorer country for the summer/semester (again, why worry about losing a summer\u2019s earnings?!) and then use said experiences in every single cover letter/application/interview for the next 10 years. Nothing like showcasing your privilege to illustrate how woke to poverty you are! \n\n\n2. You have one goal so overriding that your life/mental health/others in your life don\u2019t matter. Dated a girl like this. She was absolutely obsessed with becoming a veterinarian (nothing wrong with that) but to the detriment of her sanity. Totally addicted to the stress and working \u201chard\u201d which really meant unnecessarily overloading two classes every term and then complaining about stress or getting *GASP* an A-. But hey, it made her feel like she was getting somewhere to strive for a romanticized goal and brag about her credit load. I think that made college more of a hurdle to get done with quickly and made every A feel way more impactful compared to an A-. That\u2019s not how I want to live, a slave to my own stress with a destination more important than the journey, but I guess if you think you have your life\u2019s purpose figured out at 18, maybe it\u2019s worth it. Jury is still out on that. \n\n\n3. Everyone chasing the ideal college experience which pop culture romanticized doesn\u2019t want to feel like they failed to attain it. Admitting that it isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to he would essentially shatter the illusion for them. So you keep on the bandwagon of living the high life and posting pictures of it simply to confirm to yourself that it is indeed the high life and that everyone else thinks so too. College, indeed life in general, is often an echo chamber in that way \u2014 especially with the prevalence of social media. \n\n\nRant/long stories over, but really, I agree with OP. It\u2019s pretty average. In fact, I\u2019ve had some of the WORST experiences of my life thus far in college. Failed a class, had barely $500 to my name at one point (between every account I have), dated two pretty ruthless girls (one of whom threatened to kill herself multiple times), lost my sport to health issues\u2026it\u2019s been a ride. But looking back on it with some introspection and self awareness, it\u2019s amazing how far I\u2019ve come and what I have learned in the process. So keep your chin up \u2014 college is a time for learning, but some of the most valuable lessons will come from outside the classroom. Keep your eyes and soul open for those.",

Many people I know like that. Also the people who enjoy the thrill of pleasing their family, and use that to justify stress\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the happy people praising college are the ones having an easier time academically combined with thriving socially. And I agree most of the soulful parts happen outside the classroom. Whether it\u2019s their major, or they\u2019re smart with choosing classes, or just slacking, whatever reason, it boils down to that. Self improvement, motivation, learn to love work all that jazz I have not seen that lead to a happy lifestyle for most, it comes from a place of doubt or false confidence \n\nOther tip I have for anyone is get a more hands on part time job. Mines theater stage work. Great break from classes ngl",

Had a few experiences for sure, transferred schools twice \u2014 on my third now and graduating soon! \n\nGood point about pleasing the family. That too was a big motivator for the girl I mentioned. Since the whole family was sold on her being a vet, school was pretty much topic number one for everyone she talked to. The most tragic thing was, at least to me, that she had originally wanted to study fashion but her mom had shot it down because she might not have succeeded. Never liked her mom, kind of an insensitive arse in many ways. But that really pissed me off. \n\n+1 on the hands-on job. I worked in IT for a big-ass company for a year, and work manual labor refinishing wood on boats in the summer. Nothing like real problem solving and work to get you some healthy gratification. Stage work sounds rad! I always though the lighting/set aspect of performances was super interesting. So complicated!",

The bar is set even higher to just get the highest grade you can possibly hope to achieve, and run like hell when you get your diploma. \n\nHell, I don't even come from an Asian family, and yet I have set extremely high standards for myself when it comes to grades and what grades I should expect to get. I was supposed to graduate from community college back in 2019, but thanks to me screwing around for three years and not doing what I needed to be doing, I was dismissed for about one semester before being invited back. \n\nI've been doing well as of late, though at the cost of some things. My mental health has been declining, and I rarely if ever go out with the friends that I do have, and I also rarely spend time with my family, unless if it's dinnertime or if the weekend has just arrived. I would rather just spend all my time studying, and not really doing anything else other than that. So I've pretty much turned into a recluse, and right now I'm getting out of the midway point with two B's, and two online classes that are set to begin next week. I don't even set aside any time for myself anymore. Because last time I did so, I was forced out for what should have been two semesters but instead I took one semester off. \n\nI'm set to graduate next spring. Maybe, if I get my shit together and turn those B's into A's.",

It was kind of like high school 2.0. I had to work 2 jobs, one of them at night, and had to go to classes after my shift ended, then hope to maybe get 6 or so hours of sleep. I didn't have time or money for frats, I was busy trying to get out of there with minimal debt, and start a career.\n\n\nThat was my experience, personally I think that unless you have the bill getting footed in some way, it's a lot of hard work and stress, but through all of that it was 100% worth it. I'm not on easy street, but my life immediately improved thanks to having a degree.",

Humans are essentially hardwired to identify what is wrong with life at the moment rather than what is good (which is a survival skill; it's a good thing that we identify problems so we can fix them) which leads to us looking at mostly the bad parts of our current situation and comparing it to future possibilities or past experiences. High schoolers see college and see a lot of the stuff we wish for at that age- independence, more social opportunities, pirsuing our interests rather than the requirements of a general education, etc. while failing to see the benefits of living at home with parents such as free food and rent. Then people who are beyond collge think back to the things they wish they still had like parties, easy opportunities to make friends and time to pursue hobbies, while failing to recognize the benefits of a stable job and lifestyle. This is all to say, human nature is to look for life to improve rather than being content with the life we're currently living",

That\u2019s 40 for work itself, 5 for lunch and 5 more for commuting and not including more for any overtime or if your commute takes longer than 30min each way.  \n\nThen you have to consider \u201cwork nights\u201d.  Sure you\u2019ll sometimes go out for a happy hour or watch a sporting event every once in awhile but it\u2019s likely to be far more low key, because well\u2026 you have work in the morning.  Real work that you can\u2019t be hung over to all the time.  So for most people they get the weekends of actual fun and maybe 1 or 2 nights a week of some minor fun.\n\nThen you have to remember responsibilities.  You don\u2019t have others to rely on anymore, you have to run all your errands that somehow got to be way more than when you were in college, and contend that you have to be responsible with your money.\n\nCompare that to the average full time college student.\n\nThey spend 12 hours in class, 17 hours studying and since most students live on or near campus drop their commuting time down a few hours.  Your 17 hours of studying is flexible, you don\u2019t have to them on certain days or times, but where you can fit them in.  Instead of having to be up at 630 to be at work at 800 and be there until 500, you get to wake up much later for your one or two classes and then do whatever.\n\nFor most students, and especially the 60% who don\u2019t work a part time job, there isn\u2019t a heavy difference between a \u201cschool night\u201d and a \u201cweekend night\u201d.  You also tend to party harder in your youth.  So you\u2019ll have not only the weekends to have real fun but likely real fun during the week as well and at least minor fun nearly every day.",

      "text": "College is truly about just getting to know yourself more. Whatever you place your efforts into is where you will go towards. Think about college about a place with accessibility to things (parties & girls to research & career fairs) at a very close proximity. Now, it\u2019s up to the person to determine what they want to access from that experience. \n\nI consider it a balance of self discovery while also a fresh sense of adulthood and all the responsibilities it entails. I can only speak from my experience, but through college I identified my desiring for hustling for my future, a little bit more than people, so I started to reach out to research professors, lead school projects, and get internships over the summer. My entire experience showed me college offers the \u201cbest\u201d moments in life. These moments are pivotal moments to who you are as a person and where you see yourself.",

It makes me really think and all I do is overthink so it puts my brain to work. \ud83d\ude02 So I don't understand why people would say college is going to be the best years.
