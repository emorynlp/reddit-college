          "text": "I\u2019ve seen a couple more scenarios that fit the same theme. Prepare for a healthy dose of cynicism xD:\n\n1. \u201cStudy\u201d abroad programs where you get all expenses paid by your parents for a semester while you wander around with your friends in Italy/France/some expensive European country with nice beaches while taking \u201cclasses.\u201d You then spam your Instagram with about 27930283839 posts and stories about this life changing ~~vacation~~ studying! \n\nOr if you\u2019re more crunchy granola you work in a park/wildlife preserve/poorer country for the summer/semester (again, why worry about losing a summer\u2019s earnings?!) and then use said experiences in every single cover letter/application/interview for the next 10 years. Nothing like showcasing your privilege to illustrate how woke to poverty you are! \n\n\n2. You have one goal so overriding that your life/mental health/others in your life don\u2019t matter. Dated a girl like this. She was absolutely obsessed with becoming a veterinarian (nothing wrong with that) but to the detriment of her sanity. Totally addicted to the stress and working \u201chard\u201d which really meant unnecessarily overloading two classes every term and then complaining about stress or getting *GASP* an A-. But hey, it made her feel like she was getting somewhere to strive for a romanticized goal and brag about her credit load. I think that made college more of a hurdle to get done with quickly and made every A feel way more impactful compared to an A-. That\u2019s not how I want to live, a slave to my own stress with a destination more important than the journey, but I guess if you think you have your life\u2019s purpose figured out at 18, maybe it\u2019s worth it. Jury is still out on that. \n\n\n3. Everyone chasing the ideal college experience which pop culture romanticized doesn\u2019t want to feel like they failed to attain it. Admitting that it isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to he would essentially shatter the illusion for them. So you keep on the bandwagon of living the high life and posting pictures of it simply to confirm to yourself that it is indeed the high life and that everyone else thinks so too. College, indeed life in general, is often an echo chamber in that way \u2014 especially with the prevalence of social media. \n\n\nRant/long stories over, but really, I agree with OP. It\u2019s pretty average. In fact, I\u2019ve had some of the WORST experiences of my life thus far in college. Failed a class, had barely $500 to my name at one point (between every account I have), dated two pretty ruthless girls (one of whom threatened to kill herself multiple times), lost my sport to health issues\u2026it\u2019s been a ride. But looking back on it with some introspection and self awareness, it\u2019s amazing how far I\u2019ve come and what I have learned in the process. So keep your chin up \u2014 college is a time for learning, but some of the most valuable lessons will come from outside the classroom. Keep your eyes and soul open for those.",

Also the people who enjoy the thrill of pleasing their family, and use that to justify stress\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the happy people praising college are the ones having an easier time academically combined with thriving socially. And I agree most of the soulful parts happen outside the classroom. Whether it\u2019s their major, or they\u2019re smart with choosing classes, or just slacking, whatever reason, it boils down to that. Self improvement, motivation, learn to love work all that jazz I have not seen that lead to a happy lifestyle for most, it comes from a place of doubt or false confidence \n\nOther tip I have for anyone is get a more hands on part time job. Mines theater stage work. Great break from classes ngl",

Had a few experiences for sure, transferred schools twice \u2014 on my third now and graduating soon! \n\nGood point about pleasing the family. That too was a big motivator for the girl I mentioned. Since the whole family was sold on her being a vet, school was pretty much topic number one for everyone she talked to. The most tragic thing was, at least to me, that she had originally wanted to study fashion but her mom had shot it down because she might not have succeeded. Never liked her mom, kind of an insensitive arse in many ways. But that really pissed me off. \n\n+1 on the hands-on job. I worked in IT for a big-ass company for a year, and work manual labor refinishing wood on boats in the summer. Nothing like real problem solving and work to get you some healthy gratification. Stage work sounds rad! I always though the lighting/set aspect of performances was super interesting. So complicated!",

The bar is set even higher to just get the highest grade you can possibly hope to achieve, and run like hell when you get your diploma. \n\nHell, I don't even come from an Asian family, and yet I have set extremely high standards for myself when it comes to grades and what grades I should expect to get. I was supposed to graduate from community college back in 2019, but thanks to me screwing around for three years and not doing what I needed to be doing, I was dismissed for about one semester before being invited back. \n\nI've been doing well as of late, though at the cost of some things. My mental health has been declining, and I rarely if ever go out with the friends that I do have, and I also rarely spend time with my family, unless if it's dinnertime or if the weekend has just arrived. I would rather just spend all my time studying, and not really doing anything else other than that. So I've pretty much turned into a recluse, and right now I'm getting out of the midway point with two B's, and two online classes that are set to begin next week. I don't even set aside any time for myself anymore. Because last time I did so, I was forced out for what should have been two semesters but instead I took one semester off. \n\nI'm set to graduate next spring. Maybe, if I get my shit together and turn those B's into A's.",
