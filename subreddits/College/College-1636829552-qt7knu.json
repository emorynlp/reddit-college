  "text": "Hi, next year I will be graduating with my Bachelors degree. For a bit of context, I am the first person in my entire family, extended and all, to get a bachelors degree, so this is a huge accomplishment . But do a lot of people do senior pictures for their senior year of college? I\u2019m definitely going to get some studio cap and gown photos so I more am referring to like the outdoor type sessions. Any thoughts would be helpful!\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the feedback! I appreciate it!",

That's a huge fucking deal, who cares what others think? Go get your photos, get them framed and display them proudly. Getting through college is a big deal, and you deserve to celebrate.",

Honestly, take as many pictures of yourself over your life as you can, they're so important. My mother in law passed away a few months ago, and hated pictures. It was hard to not have many of her from the past few decades. Pictures are important, and it's especially nice as a signifier of change or accomplishment. Congratulations!",
