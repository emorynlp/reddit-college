  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m looking for advice from anyone who\u2019s in a management information systems or business information systems major. To double major I\u2019d have a pretty full schedule with difficult classes, but I\u2019m really passionate about MIS. Currently I\u2019m a junior marketing major with a minor in professional writing and a minor in business analytics. Do you think an MIS double major will help my job prospects? I\u2019m not sure how well MIS goes with marketing and was just looking for some advice! :)",
