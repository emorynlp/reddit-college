  "title:": "Should I Double Major in MIS and Marketing?",
  "text": "Hi guys! I\u2019m looking for advice from anyone who\u2019s in a management information systems or business information systems major. To double major I\u2019d have a pretty full schedule with difficult classes, but I\u2019m really passionate about MIS. Currently I\u2019m a junior marketing major with a minor in professional writing and a minor in business analytics. Do you think an MIS double major will help my job prospects? I\u2019m not sure how well MIS goes with marketing and was just looking for some advice! :)",

      "text": "I would check with your academic adviser and career coordinator to get their professional advice. Will adding the second major this late cause you to spend more time in school? Will you drop your minors if you add the MIS major? I think that it will help your job prospects some, but maybe not a whole lot. The Business Analytics minor seems like a solid minor to have.",
