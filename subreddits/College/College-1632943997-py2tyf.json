  "text": "So in my post history I talk about how I think campus life isn\u2019t for me blah blah blah\u2026 and that I might consider commuting to my college which is a 30-45 minute drive during my junior year and nursing school. I\u2019m already in clubs, have a good amount of friends, etc\u2026 so If I commute I don\u2019t think my social life will be affected (as least that\u2019s what I hope).  I heard many advantages of commuting to college such as saving money and having time to work and do other everyday activities. People who commute to campus , what are some more pros and cons?",
