  "text": "This is my second semester, my first semester I did really well with all A\u2019s. This one I started out very poorly and it was too late when I decided I want to take it seriously. I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m gonna change my major because I\u2019m not even interested anymore. I honestly feel I\u2019ll do so much better next semester. None of my current classes are needed for my new major but my gpa is in jeopardy and also my financial aid. I can\u2019t do college with out it. I had to withdraw from one class and my other 3 classes I have D\u2019s. I can possibly bring them up to c\u2019s if I give these last few weeks my best but they can also go down if I fail my exams. I really need advice and I\u2019m ashamed of myself. It had no reason to get this bad. Should withdraw from 2 classes since I don\u2019t even need any of them?",
