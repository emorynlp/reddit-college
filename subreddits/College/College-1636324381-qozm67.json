  "text": " Greeting all, I was looking for some opinions on my schedule. Currently I have 12 credits and was wondering if I should make the sacrifice of taking up a 8am class for the 15 credits. I took 13 last semester and I brought in 45 credits from DC so I won\u2019t be technically behind (This will be my 2nd Semester in college). So far my schedule is from 9:30 to to 4:45 spanning 4 classes with a break from 12:30-2. I can\u2019t find a class to fit the 12:30-2 so an 8 am is all I can do. My classes are only on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well and I drive an hour up there so I would be waking up at 6am and I am a big night owl. \n\nSo for those that have had 8am classes, is it worth it?",

Maybe if online or you lived close, but you'll be leaving a 7 which means your awake at 6 am or earlier. \n\nMuch better trying to argue for a MWF online class due to drive and experience then fucking over your sleep.",
