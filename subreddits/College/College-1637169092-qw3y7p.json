  "text": "I am a \u201cfirst-year\u201d college student who came in with a lot of credits. So next semester, I\u2019ll be a sophomore and fall 22 I\u2019ll be a junior.. by credits. I had 3 exams today, back to back, in which I did horrible on and worried I will tank my gpa at the end of the semester. My parents and therapist told me that I\u2019m dramatic about my performance in college rn where I am exceeding in but I will finish the semester with a 3.06 and I need atleast a 3.0 for my selected major with declaring. Many of y\u2019all are probably like wtf is the issue but my issue is, I feel like I\u2019ve failed/am failing personally. I try to do my best and it is not working in college like it was in high school. I was top of the class, honor grad, etc and did great in my dual enrollment courses. I try to have a positive attitude and know that a class is not permanent on the transcript, you can always retake, etc but I still can\u2019t shake the feeling of being a failure. Any and all help would be appreciated as I am trying not to have a meltdown and relapse.",

      "text": "Hey I found this from your r/Clemson post. I\u2019m in sorta the same boat but a little worse off tbh by GPA. The workload shocked me and I tanked my GPA first semester and failed one class. This semester has been even worse because I got to some of the \u201cweed out\u201d classes in my major that I\u2019m probably going to have to retake next semester unless I do very well on the final. My parents think that I need a tutor but honestly I\u2019m just not spending enough time on stuff. In high school I was one of the people that didn\u2019t really have to \u201ctry\u201d on anything and everything always went well and I graduated top 10 in the class. College is hella stressful and even as a 21 year old guy I\u2019ve had my fair share of mental breakdowns laying on my apartment floor. One way that I do try to handle it however is planning. Every week I try to plan everything that I have to do for the entire week and the schedule evolves as the week goes on. Plan when you\u2019re going to study, plan your free time, social time, homework, exercise etc. As you do this more and more you get better at estimating how long you need to do stuff. A good YouTube channel I recommend is college info geek, their older videos are really good and I\u2019ve learned a lot from them. I\u2019ve had to also learn how to let go of the perfect mentality that I had in high school. You\u2019re gonna fuck up in college but you just gotta move past it and improve for the next time. I\u2019m still currently struggling but I\u2019m learning how to handle it and thought I\u2019d share how I\u2019m trying to deal. Hope I helped at least a little bit! :)",
