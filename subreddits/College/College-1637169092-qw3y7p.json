  "text": "I am a \u201cfirst-year\u201d college student who came in with a lot of credits. So next semester, I\u2019ll be a sophomore and fall 22 I\u2019ll be a junior.. by credits. I had 3 exams today, back to back, in which I did horrible on and worried I will tank my gpa at the end of the semester. My parents and therapist told me that I\u2019m dramatic about my performance in college rn where I am exceeding in but I will finish the semester with a 3.06 and I need atleast a 3.0 for my selected major with declaring. Many of y\u2019all are probably like wtf is the issue but my issue is, I feel like I\u2019ve failed/am failing personally. I try to do my best and it is not working in college like it was in high school. I was top of the class, honor grad, etc and did great in my dual enrollment courses. I try to have a positive attitude and know that a class is not permanent on the transcript, you can always retake, etc but I still can\u2019t shake the feeling of being a failure. Any and all help would be appreciated as I am trying not to have a meltdown and relapse.",
