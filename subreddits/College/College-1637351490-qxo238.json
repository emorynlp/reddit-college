  "text": "Hi everyone. I need help wording an email to my school's president. Now, I admittedly fucked up and thought the late registration deadline was today, rather than last Friday. I'm trying to get into a class that doesn't have any instruction, just requires that I do 10 hours of community service by the end of the trimester. I tried going to the dean yesterday to hand in the form that said I found an organization to volunteer for, and she told me I just missed it and that there's nothing she could do. So, I went to the registrar's office this morning. She told me I'd have to go see the executive vice president, who's the head of academic affairs, and that he'd have to approve it but could be done. Well, I went to his office, and his assistant saw me since he was in a meeting with the president. So she tells me it's all good and that she just has to call the dean (that I spoke to first) to make sure she's okay with it. After speaking on the phone with the dean, the assistant's demeanor completely changed and informed me that I wouldn't be able to do it because it was too late, even though she seemed pretty cool with having that exception made 30 seconds before. So, my last resort is to contact the president and hope that maybe he'll do something. I know it was my blunder, but I need to take this to graduate in May. Although I can take it next trimester, there won't be as many volunteer opportunities (I already signed up for service with an organization now, because Christmas). I'd understand if it was a class with work and missing instruction, but this is literally something that I could do at any point in the trimester. I highly doubt I'll get approved, but I at least want to take this one last chance before having to wait months later to get this done.",
