Right now I have both a MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro. I have my iPad decked out with a magic keyboard and Apple Pencil.

Check and make sure most of your school apps/portals etc have either an iPad app or works on a mobile Safari. Especially check for uploading and submission of assignments (That includes uploading presentation videos, reports/essay/online assignments etc) Do note that almost all schools don't support iPad. You're most likely on your own or will be advised to use a laptop if you haven issues if you do seek your school technical support.\n2. Depends on the coding lessons you're doing. For standard type of coding you'll see most coding on iPad are accessing a MacOS device remotely via FTP etc to have a proper IDE for common languages like python, C++, or assembly language 28k. You can do Swift on apple dedicated app I guess, but not something you will be using on the sort of general CS first year courses. YOU WILL NEED A LAPTOP/DESKTOP. \n3.  You struggle to get some extra cash? I would suggest getting a tutoring gig/ and considering finding a part-time job for the extra cash rather than selling your stuff (Barista/Store assistant or job posting on your campus are great options). Google for them.\n4. iPad is not a need. More of a want. Sell your iPad if you have to and just revert to typing notes on laptop and paper/pen/printouts. \n5. If you can, sell the magic keyboard and even your pencil. Opt for cheaper combo of a generic cover stand case w/ maybe tpu bumper(?) and a cheap bluetooth keyboard+mouse combo --> I got logitech K380 bundle but there are even cheaper less reputable but equally serviceable brands out there like Alcatrotz etc. There are Apple pencil replica/cheaper alternatives out there that may not work as well (connectivity start-up lag/no wireless charging) but still works with iPad.", "author": "Erica_483", "created": 1626629019, "upvotes": 1}, "h5kyyre": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ob3hrz/can_i_get_by_college_with_only_an_ipad_pro_as_a/h5kyyre/", "text": "A resounding no.

If push comes to shove there are ways to make a MacBook work with the various programs you will use as a CS major. Tho, personally, I would recommend against that, many of my classmates have forced their way through a semester or two with a Macbook but they always had some problem or another with it, from running the program the first time to navigating to their file and submitting their work. And plus most if not all of your professors will just expect that you'll be using a windows computer as well and will teach how to install and go about the program as such. And typically the professors I've had also didn't knew what to do when a student had troubles with their MacBook.\n\n\nWhen you get a chance make sure to talk with your STEM counselor (a general counselor also works but typically a STEM counselor would know a bit more) about what programs your college has that can help you. For example, I've been through two colleges so far, the first one gives out refurbished laptops to students in need, completely free and it's really yours (they can only really do the minimum of what you need it to do). The second loans laptops for a semester and you just need to renew your loan with them.\n\n\nIn summary, if you really have to, yes, a MacBook (idk about an IPad) can be used for the programs you will be introduced to as a CS major, it'll just either be an extra step or two. But for what I recommend, all those programs that you'll be using as CS major is better off being installed and used in a windows computer especially since your just starting off your comp. sci. journey.\n\n\nWishing you all the best luck!!!", "author": "Masahiro3889", "created": 1625122557, "upvotes": 1}, "h3nmq3t": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ob3hrz/can_i_get_by_college_with_only_an_ipad_pro_as_a/h3nmq3t/", "text": "Not only will you NEED a laptop, more than likely you\u2019re going to be needing a good laptop.
