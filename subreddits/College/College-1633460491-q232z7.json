  "text": "Im on my 3rd year in college (Sweden) and I still haven't grasped this. We have 1, maybe two lectures each week, so we do most of the learnin' by ourselves from home. I'm great at making schedules but I can't seem to stick to them! What does, or should, a day of school work look like for you guys? Do you treat it like a full time job, and put everything away at 5PM or something? Or do you do everything without a schedule?",

      "text": "Whan I was unemployed and going to college full time, yes, I checked into my classes at 8AM and put everything away at 5PM. I also had a dedicated space for homework that was just my space, that I could leave as- is all the time. That was really important.\n\nBut now, I am enrolled full time *and* working full time. I find now I have to be even more organized- otherwise I'll miss something important. I add all due dates to my planner and  summarize the work I need to do every week, so I can use spare time wisely when I have it.",
