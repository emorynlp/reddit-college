I'd love to hear your thoughts on alternate assignments.\n\nFirst: I assign discussion board posts because it is one of the few ways to ensure students do the readings. The few semesters I did not, no one read. Really. I'd ask what author X's main point was, and it would be silent. Did discussion boards the next semester, and students at least had to skim enough to pick up the main point. The other alternative is reading quizzes. But I hate writing those and you all hate taking them.\n\nSo: the dilemma is how to get students to read and participate in discussion without having discussion posts. History has shown we can't just trust you to do the readings -- EVEN when there is a large component of the grade coming from participation. It was 15% for my course this term, and even then many students still chose not to read and not to participate (because they had no clue what we were talking about). \n\nI would love to hear ideas from students about how to keep you engaged outside of the classroom. Since we only meet two or three days a week, we as professors need to ensure that you actually do the readings (and trust me, it is a battle every single class). If you have suggestions or solutions, I'm all ears, but \"trust us, we'll read,\" or \"increase participation\" don't work.", "author": "Galactica13x", "created": 1622675241, "upvotes": 281}}}
