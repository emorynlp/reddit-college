I can generally handle roommates from hell. I'm a sophomore, I went to boarding school for 3 years and had roommates lock me out of the room for tinder hookups, hide drugs in my fridge, and was once roomed with someone who hated my guts, but I can't handle this. As it stands, I'm living in an 8x12 room with someone who hardly leaves. All of our classes are at the same times, so I can't even rely on time to myself while she's in class. She always eats in the room, either microwaving her food in her microwave, or only leaving for roughly 15 minutes to go pick it up and come back. I know the typical response is to just tune her out, but I also have ptsd and am hypervigilant and literally can't do that.\n\nHonestly, if it was just her not leaving, I'd likely be fine, but she's also very controlling of the environment in the room. She always wants the lights off and the heat on. If I even turn on the small light she gets up and turns it off within 5 minutes. It kills my head to be on my computer or phone with the lights off. The heat makes it so I can't sleep because I'm way too warm and literally wake up drenched in sweat. I can't work on my computer after she lays down to sleep because apparently she can't sleep with me typing, which isn't loud in the slightest, but I'm constantly hearing her music through her headphones and she won't turn it down.\n\nI'm incredibly wound up right now because I have no privacy and am not allowed to take up space in my own room. Even if I leave the room (as I did today, I've been out for 6 hours), its not the same as alone time and I still have no personal space.\n\nRight now, I need some advice on just getting through this semester, since I can't get a room change until after winter break.", "author": "HailstheLion", "created": 1571526145, "retrieved": 1632947347, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1035, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"f7z0a15": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dkb73c/my_roommate_rarely_leaves_the_room/f7z0a15/", "text": "You probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but she sounds depressed.

Step one is always to talk to your roomate, we are adults now, we can make efforts to resolve problems we have, on our own first. If nothing changes then obviously go to an RA to mediate. But for the most part, you live in a  double, not a single, you aren't really entitled to private space, so your roomate not leaving isn't wrong by any means, they're just being in the space they payed for.", "author": "Ausear", "created": 1571535130, "upvotes": 17}, "f4cvlti": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dkb73c/my_roommate_rarely_leaves_the_room/f4cvlti/", "text": "You have to tell her this", "author": "cev4", "created": 1571534474, "upvotes": 2}, "f4cv670": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dkb73c/my_roommate_rarely_leaves_the_room/f4cv670/", "text": "Fuck her.

I felt like my space wasn\u2019t my own. I think the best thing is just trying to talk to your roommate. Those conversations can be difficult but I also think they\u2019re important to have no to help you on later in life. If those don\u2019t help, try getting your RA to help mediate a conversation. Even if they don\u2019t offer help in terms of fixing the situation, letting them know will help get the situation documented and might help your case if you feel like you need to move out later down the road.
