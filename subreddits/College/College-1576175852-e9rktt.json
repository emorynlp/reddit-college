Eventually moved out so we don\u2019t talk. I\u2019ve told my mom about it and she feels bad I haven\u2019t made any more friends. I\u2019ve always had a rough time making friends. Not trying to be like \u201cI\u2019m not like other girl\u2019s\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m so quirky\u201d but I have always found it really difficult to fit in with people. All of my friends back home were the ones that approached me. When I do approach people I always feel really awkward and nervous but when I think I did well with carrying a conversation and I think me and the other person hit it off, they never feel the same and we don\u2019t talk anymore. It does make me kinda discouraged with making friends. Being in college, I am always around people in their big groups of friends and it\u2019s like how the hell did y\u2019all become friends? Even since day one, people had their groups already. That being said, I don\u2019t mind being alone. I\u2019ve experienced all semester sitting alone and eating alone and I actually really like it. I don\u2019t have to have a conversation and I can just eat and watch YouTube. It does get kinda boring though and it reminds me of grade school of when I could go a whole school day of not talking. That\u2019s how it sometimes is since I\u2019m not really close to my other roommates. They\u2019re nice though so that\u2019s good. Are any of you guys alone or having trouble with making friends?", "author": "BaiChun956", "created": 1576175852, "retrieved": 1632947895, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 705, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fapmjt8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e9rktt/thoughts_on_being_alone_in_college/fapmjt8/", "text": "I had a similar problem during my first semester of college.

In elementary, middle, and high school it\u2019s easy to make \u201cfriends\u201d because you see them everyday, are the same age and will have the same interests but when you\u2019re in college you don\u2019t really have that. That\u2019s why there\u2019s clubs at school and ways to get together online ( I use an app called meetup) so that you can try to find people with your interests and hopefully make 1 or 2 really good friends. If I\u2019m being completely honest you\u2019ll need to find ways to be social and find ways to meet people. I\u2019m the same way where I was very introverted and didn\u2019t have any friends until my mom told me that if I wanted friends I needed to find ways to socialize with others.

I think it\u2019s fine if it doesn\u2019t really effect you, but at the same time building social skills really helps in life when it comes to things like interviews, networking, etc.. which really kick off in college (my impression anyway, I\u2019m a first semester freshman too). I think there\u2019s a difference between being lonely by choice because you prefer that vs being lonely because you might lack social skills and/or have anxiety. For me it is the latter I think, which makes it really hard for me to \u201cjust put myself out there\u201d and join clubs and all that, among other reasons, and it\u2019s bothering me and making me really depressed, personally, and am considering transferring, but I don\u2019t know yet.", "author": "privateginger", "created": 1576178709, "upvotes": 7}, "fal4dvs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e9rktt/thoughts_on_being_alone_in_college/fal4dvs/", "text": "I\u2019m haven\u2019t really made any friends my first semester. This was not to different from high school but I think it\u2019s been affecting me more. I been getting really lonely and bored in my free time and it has been having effects on my me health.  I know people tell me to join clubs but it\u2019s not that simple. It really difficult for me to step out my comfort zone because of even a little mistake give me soo much anxiety.  I commute so there\u2019s that. For me overall it\u2019s pretty much the same as highscholl which sucks since I wanted to at lest be a bit more confident", "author": "unwanted906", "created": 1576178201, "upvotes": 185}}}
