I got a 46/100 on a biology exam. I didn't study as much as I needed to and I definitely need to change that because I don't want to feel this way again, but what else can I do to pull the grade up before the end of the semester?\n\nEdit: this is blowing up WAY more than I thought it would, so thankyou. And just to be clear I didn't come here looking for any sort of sympathy, I was just curious as to what advice others could give who knows what it's like to be in this position. I know that the only person that can pull the grade up is me and that I'll have to work for it which I am more than capable and more than ready to do. Im a strong believer in failure being the greatest teacher. Failing is just another opportunity to learn from an experience to ensure that it doesn't happen again and I fully intend on applying that to my current situation.

But in a controlled manner that lets you grow from here. From a scale of \"this is fine\" to \"I am calling the police\" you should be at \"who are you and how did you get into my house?\" \n\nWeird panic scales aside, you should be *concerned*. Biology is not an easy course and is often the weed out course. Failing the first exam means you don't have a comprehensive understanding of the basics, which impacts your ability to learn the next concepts which are built upon the basics. You have to invest a lot of time not only studying for the next exam but catching up and understanding what you didn't learn for the first exam. \n\nMy advice is to actualize change. Not thinking about change but making real changes. Something as small as \"I will study in a different room\" may lead to great change. As for tried and true study habits, you want to engage in as much active learning as you can. Don't read and reread. Read and rewrite in your own words from your memory. Don't read definitions in the textbook, write them out on flashcards/Quizlet and study them. Don't read through the practice questions, try preparing for and then taking them as if they were an exam.", "author": "gazeintotheiris", "created": 1572061366, "upvotes": 2}, "f3gklo2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dbbxxi/got_a_46100_on_my_first_exam_thats_related_to_my/f3gklo2/", "text": "I made a 50 on my first test and a 91 on my second.

Its an entirely different subject than what you've experienced before, and I'm sorry to say any 'culture shock' you felt here doesn't really let up as you progress. That being said, you definitely get used to it. These are the fundamentels you need to become things like doctors and advanced biologists, the more you're exposed to the easier it is to take it in. Make sure you're looking at the material your teacher gives out, whether its HW questions, in the end of your chapter/powerpoints, or through online assignments. Being exposed to the terminology and rules are the best ways to learn it for a written format like a test. \n\nDon't obsess the night before a test, you really need to be looking at this stuff maybe 10-20 mins a night after you learn it and to help review. That's how the brain cements info, not by rushing through a month of material you haven't looked at in weeks and are trying to relearn the night before. \n\nFind things to ask the professor about, if you're curious about more detail ask for it. I would come to office hours all the time and ask about specific scenarios I knew about, or to critique questions I felt weren't phrased well.
