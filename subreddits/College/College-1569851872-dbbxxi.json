  "title:": "Got a 46/100 on my first exam that's related to my major..is it time to panic a little?",
  "text": "Title pretty much says it all. I got a 46/100 on a biology exam. I didn't study as much as I needed to and I definitely need to change that because I don't want to feel this way again, but what else can I do to pull the grade up before the end of the semester?\n\nEdit: this is blowing up WAY more than I thought it would, so thankyou. And just to be clear I didn't come here looking for any sort of sympathy, I was just curious as to what advice others could give who knows what it's like to be in this position. I know that the only person that can pull the grade up is me and that I'll have to work for it which I am more than capable and more than ready to do. Im a strong believer in failure being the greatest teacher. Failing is just another opportunity to learn from an experience to ensure that it doesn't happen again and I fully intend on applying that to my current situation. Thankyou to everyone that's seen this post and has commented.",

      "text": "I'm gonna go against the grain and say - yes, you should be panicking. But in a controlled manner that lets you grow from here. From a scale of \"this is fine\" to \"I am calling the police\" you should be at \"who are you and how did you get into my house?\" \n\nWeird panic scales aside, you should be *concerned*. Biology is not an easy course and is often the weed out course. Failing the first exam means you don't have a comprehensive understanding of the basics, which impacts your ability to learn the next concepts which are built upon the basics. You have to invest a lot of time not only studying for the next exam but catching up and understanding what you didn't learn for the first exam. \n\nMy advice is to actualize change. Not thinking about change but making real changes. Something as small as \"I will study in a different room\" may lead to great change. As for tried and true study habits, you want to engage in as much active learning as you can. Don't read and reread. Read and rewrite in your own words from your memory. Don't read definitions in the textbook, write them out on flashcards/Quizlet and study them. Don't read through the practice questions, try preparing for and then taking them as if they were an exam.",

Seeing so many people say \"its fine, you have plenty of time to turn it around\" just scares me because it was the same mentality I had and it didn't get me anywhere. \n\nAgain panic isn't the right word but you do need to hunker down and get serious and learn how to actually study. The most important, life changing thing you can do right now is learning to study effectively which will shape your college career. \n\nI highly recommend you invest some time to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukLnPbIffxE) if you want to learn how to re-evalute your study effectiveness.",

Its an entirely different subject than what you've experienced before, and I'm sorry to say any 'culture shock' you felt here doesn't really let up as you progress. That being said, you definitely get used to it. These are the fundamentels you need to become things like doctors and advanced biologists, the more you're exposed to the easier it is to take it in. Make sure you're looking at the material your teacher gives out, whether its HW questions, in the end of your chapter/powerpoints, or through online assignments. Being exposed to the terminology and rules are the best ways to learn it for a written format like a test. \n\nDon't obsess the night before a test, you really need to be looking at this stuff maybe 10-20 mins a night after you learn it and to help review. That's how the brain cements info, not by rushing through a month of material you haven't looked at in weeks and are trying to relearn the night before. \n\nFind things to ask the professor about, if you're curious about more detail ask for it. I would come to office hours all the time and ask about specific scenarios I knew about, or to critique questions I felt weren't phrased well. This lets you get close to the teacher in your major, and helps reinforce specifics for you to call back on during assessments. When my teacher talked about parthenogenisis I asked about a crayfish species that does it, or if we talked about the immune system I would ask how it was different between things like reptiles and birds. I don't know where your interests are, but I assume you're a Bio major for a reason, so find the things that let you internalize the material and keep it relevant for you.",

A few weeks in since that and I now know what an exam will look like from that teacher. Took my second one and got an 85. You\u2019ll be fine, just study harder. Only thing to worry about is if there\u2019s only four exams for example. Then you have to make sure you do better on the next ones. Try using Quizlet if you have to study terms. That\u2019s really worked for me in other classes besides math. It also helps to ask the teacher for study tips and if there\u2019s extra credit opportunities. You\u2019d be surprised how many teachers offer extra credit. Plus the final exam may outweigh a bad test score. My math teacher has a policy where if you did poor on an exam but do better on the final exam, the poor grade will be left out. Definitely worth asking about this.",

Its a very passive way to engage with it. The second worst way is to simply read over the material. Again very passive way unless you take additional steps like highlighting passages or taking notes as you read. An *ok* method of studying is to take notes and read them over. At least you are actively engaging with the material at one point in time. If you want to engage more deeply then *rewrite* your lecture notes and integrate them with notes from your textbook. Another good way to learn at this stage is to make and learn flashcards. The act of making the cards is often more valuable than learning them later.\n\nBut the *absolute best way* to study is to learn the material and then teach it to someone else. If you don't have friends in the class, study groups, or tutorial hours then go see your teaching assistant or professor during their office hours and ask to run by your thoughts on the material to see if you really understand it. They can help fill in gaps and correct your thinking.",

      "text": "I'm assuming you're a freshman? The way we are educated in public and private primary and secondary schools is horrible. Research tells us that we're basically told we're smart the moment we defy expectations and that label ends up trapping us in this circle of fuckdom where we attempt to retain the smart label by taking the easier or familiar until when we are confronted with failure again we get this dawning sense inadequacy brought on by our unfamiliarity with struggle. So in short, not it's not time to panic. Take this is an opportunity to struggle and grow. Mistakes are how we actually learn. Study harder next time. Reach out and use the resources available to you. And push yourself past how you're comfortable learning.\nEdit: Also, in my personal experience my colleges professors are uninvested in the teaching process or extremely blinded by poor advice from biased peers which leads to their instruction being about 25% of learning you actually need to succeed on exams and homework. I highly recommend reading through whatever text you have and while attending instruction, not relying on it as your only learning resource. For most professors, especially in lower division classes, teaching is their side gig they're asked to do by the university as part of their contract. In the future use RateMyProffessor before picking courses.",

It is ok to not to do great on a test but realistically if op makes  a 100 on every test after this they are at an 89.2 which is a B. if you are pre health careers it might behoove you to drop and take a w if your other courses are also giving you a tough time as well. That being said if OP is doing well in other courses and the B wont hurt them then hey, keep trucking and I wish for a safe comeback OP. Best of luck!",
