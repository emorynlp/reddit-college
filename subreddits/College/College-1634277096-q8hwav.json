  "text": "I'm a second year business student, have taken a bunch of accounting classes, am quite proficient in Excel, but I always feel like I barely know anything to be able to actually work in a company. I've got pretty much nothing to show on my resume except my 4.0 gpa. The only job I've had so far is tutoring python, and this lack of work experience is making me hesitate applying for internships. It also doesn't help that I'm an international student in the US. And then I see these people who are being offered internships right after their first year which is making me super anxious. \n\nHonestly I have no idea if I'm gonna be able to get a summer internship at this rate. Any advice would be appreciated.",
