  "title:": "Hard to talk to people bc of this pandemic",
  "text": "Anyone experience this? It\u2019s been hard meeting new people in college since I usually like striking up convos with people, but now I feel like people give off the vibe of \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me\u201d and generally keep to themselves. This happened recently where I (F) ended up chatting with someone (also F) that worked at my university\u2019s bookstore and they ended up asking me for my IG, but I didn\u2019t have one. I asked them if they had snap, but was told no, so they gave me their number. I tried texting them to see if they wanted to hang out, but found out they gave me a fake number. I guess they thought I was weird or creepy, but I genuinely wanted to just meet new people. \ud83d\ude2d",

      "text": "I don't know but it seems you're making some assumptions here. \n\nWhat if the number they gave was just accidentally wrong or typed in incorrectly? I feel like if they asked for your insta first, that shows they were willing to chat with you. I can't see why they would give you a fake number after asking for your insta. Maybe try to ask them again when you see them in person? Don't give up yet.",
