Because I don\u2019t believe in coping with drugs and alcohol but also when you have a hard day it\u2019s nice to pretend you\u2019re downing a bottle of wine like the pretty girls on TV when in reality you\u2019re just speeding up the train to diabetes land with a big, cold glass full of orange soda\n\nPro tip champagne flutes work even better because you feel like you\u2019re celebrating your rich husband dying and leaving you everything with Kathy and the girls at the country club at 10am on a Tuesday\n\nEdit: sunny d works well to mimic mimosas if you want that champagne flute full experience\n\nEdit edit: also acceptable beverages are Welch\u2019s sparkling grape juice (white or red, your choice) and apple juice. Apple juice just hits different out of a wine glass. Mountain Dew mimics the look of a margarita. You\u2019re welcome.",

They are fun but it gets tiring. \n\nParking in big towns like Hollywood, downtown L ect...beaches will cost for parking. \n\nI\u2019d recommend visiting: Mammoth, Yosemite, Big Sur, kings canyon and sequoia national parks, any of our beaches (skip Venice, and Santa Monica is okay) but my top ones are Manhattan, Newport, Malibu, laguna.\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t pay a premium out here if it didn\u2019t have beautiful places :)",
