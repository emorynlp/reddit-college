  "text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone here has experienced this before, but here is the story.\n\nSo I am expected to graduate in December but I just took a mid term exam that was worth a lot and I kinda bombed it. It was worth 50% of the class grade. Thanks to many events in the recent days I wasn\u2019t able to prepare as I usually do. For now I am failing the class and the Professor said \u201csorry, I can\u2019t help you\u201d, of course you can\u2019t but oh well, I am scheduled to start my master classes on January but I will be missing that single credit for the course. Has anyone here had the experience of missing one credit but has had the opportunity to start their master courses? It\u2019s just one credit. What should I do?",
