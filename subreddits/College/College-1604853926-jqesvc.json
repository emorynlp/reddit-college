Anyone who sticks to the strict, and quite frankly limiting, expectations of society is probably going to college for the wrong reasons. Don't do it because its what people are telling you its what you should do, do it because you're genuinely interested in learning. Otherwise the entire experience will be hell, and when you graduate and get a job you're not truly passionate about, you'll be right back in hell but this time it will be much harder to escape.\n\nSociety expects too much of our youth. At 18 years old you haven't even got the slightest clue about life or who you are or what you really want, and yet, you're expected to make a decision as if you already had life experience and could accurately choose an appropriate direction for yourself. Its truly mad. As are allot of societies expectations and standards. The craziest thing about it all is that the majority of people are completely invested in the insanity so that it makes it seem like a logical decision. After all everyone is doing it.\n\nHere's a few quotes from one of the greatest Physicists of our time, Richard Feynman\n\n\"Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible\"\n\n\u201cFall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.\u201d\n\n\"you have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. i have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. it's their mistake, not my failing.\"\n\nGet out there and learn what it means to be alive! Stop letting other peoples projected unrealistic expectations of themselves make you feel guilty. Go to college if you want, but there are an innumerable amount of things in this world that can be as equally, and even more fulfilling than college.
