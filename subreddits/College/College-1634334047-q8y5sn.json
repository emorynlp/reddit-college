  "text": "I am looking on the course site and see no reference to the details of the first draft. My research paper proposal was approved late due to having to re-do it, so it seems to be a little much to write an entire draft the same length as the final paper. I just got it approved last week, thats a lot of research to complete in a weeks time. \n\nI emailed her to get some clarification on this, but would anyone know the specifics on what an outline/draft needs to entail? All I really know is how she wants the hypothesis structured.",
