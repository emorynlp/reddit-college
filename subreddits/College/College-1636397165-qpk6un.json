Obviously because that skewed view would not be accurate and the test itself would not be a marker for my actual level of knowledge. It would mean I'd go into \"school\" with a false idea or worst I'd choose an area of the field that would not be in my best interest as it would require studying and commitment. I don't like studying or commitment lol...",
