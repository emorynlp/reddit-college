  "text": "OneNote is ugly and unpolished. \n\nI have been using Microsoft Word for notetaking and it has been alright. \n\nIs there a con to using Microsoft Word as a notetaking application? \n\nThe only con I feel is that I can't access my notes as fast as I can on a notetaking application like OneNote.",

              "text": "Yea I\u2019d say most people would say word is better just because of the traditional look with the page rather than the one large document that you can just keep adding to with not much organization. \n\nThe biggest thing for me is sometimes I like to print out my notes either for myself or others and I found it really difficult with OneNote to print out what I wanted as it\u2019s all one big sheet but with word already as pages I found it much easier so I could just pick the relevant or all pages to print. \n\nAnd with the ability to write and type write still maintaining a uniform size (page width wise) it was much better for me. I now use an iPad and I use good notes so it\u2019s  been a while since I\u2019ve personally used a Microsoft application for notes but just for me I know I\u2019d use word over OneNote any day for notes and organization purposes especially within a document even.",
