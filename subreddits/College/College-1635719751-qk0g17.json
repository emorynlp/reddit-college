  "title:": "Will I be behind in college because my highschool doesn't offer math beyond 11th grade?",
  "text": "Hello. The highschool I go to is pretty small and doesn't have a large selection of classes. I took 11th grade math in 10th grade and that was the most advanced class they offered. I'm currently a senior and I'm taking economics because it's the only \"math\" class the school offers that I haven't done, however, it's not really math-- it's economics. My question is: will I be significantly behind everyone else math-wise, especially if I want to go into a math-heavy major such as computer science? I was always quick to learn in math however I have no experience with calculus, statistics, etc. \n\nI'm currently working through the Khan Academy highschool math courses, and planning on finishing all of them up to AP Calculus so that I can 1) refresh my memory since I haven't taken math for a while and 2) get a basic understanding of calculus and any other topics I didn't learn in school. Will that be enough?",

I do think familiarity with calculus is important if you want to go into a STEM field in college, because a lot of your peers will have taken calculus, and it's not an easy subject and you could feel overwhelmed otherwise. Computer science also doesn't rely a lot on calculus knowledge. The math you'll mainly use (unless you study a math intensive sub domain of computer science like machine learning or computer vision) is discrete math and algorithmic analysis, which most other students won't have a lot of experience with, and which they will teach you rigorously during college. So I wouldn't worry about it that much.",

It really helps in the first few weeks of class.",
