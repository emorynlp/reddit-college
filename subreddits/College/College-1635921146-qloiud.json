  "text": "after nearing the end of a 3-week long recovery from a viral infection (most likely the flu) that my roommate gave me, she goes and gets sick again, not even a month after getting me sick the first time. I feel like she just doesn\u2019t have very good hygiene but it sucks that I have to suffer with her due to something that\u2019s completely out of my control. y\u2019all, it was so hard to study for midterms when I was sick last time, I physically and mentally can\u2019t do this again. we live in a small dorm room\u2026 is it just inevitable that I\u2019ll get sick again?\n\nis this good enough reason for the university to waive my housing contract for next spring? what can I do, I\u2019m so desperate :(",

The nature and frequency of contact with contaminated surfaces vary for each person depending on age, personal habits, type of activities, personal mobility, and the level of cleanliness in the surroundings (66). Viral transfer and disease transmission is further complicated by variations in virus survival on surfaces and the release of viruses from fomites upon casual contact (24, 66).\n\nRhinovirus infections cause the common cold.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1828811/",

If viruses were as picky with infecting people as you claim, we wouldn\u2019t be in a pandemic. No matter what method of contact, a high viral load is still a high viral load.

RSV for example.

You are changing what you initially mentioned after realizing that it can indeed occur. The flu can spread if the food handler is infected due to the food coming into contact with droplets. These droplets can be anywhere, which is what makes it so contagious. \n\nThe nose and the eyes are areas that people will commonly touch throughout the day. You could easily transfer droplets from your hand or arm to those regions of your face. For other viruses, which is what I was initially discussing before you decided to focus in on COVID as an attempt to represent other viral infections that are nowhere near as specific.\n\nMost people won't go visit a doctor for a small cold or flu, but it's so so important that we all take small precautions, such as washing our hands, in order to prevent spread to people who may become severely ill. \n\nRegardless of the logistics, at the end of the day, everything said here just furthers my point that it's very difficult to avoid contracting a viral illness from a roommate in such close quarters. I have no doubt that you are well-versed in many aspects of biological sciences, and because there are so many different conclusions out there from different studies, it's hard to decide what can be considered \"more accurate\" in regards to the other. This just results in circular, never-ending debates about science, which theoretically, should be an objective subject.\n\nMy point is that while it's not my roommate's fault that she keeps getting sick, it's frustrating for me, someone who makes a conscious effort to practice good hygiene and lifestyle choices in an attempt to avoid the anxiety and inconveniences that come with becoming ill. I think that as someone who lives in the same room as her, I can justifiably make the claim that overall she just lacks basic hygiene. Of course, anyone, even those who do everything right, can get sick. All I'm saying is that it's no coincidence that she's the one who has gotten sick twice within less than a month and doesn't seem very serious about it either. On the other hand, I'm the person who gets COVID tested regularly and every time she gets sick. I'm the person who wears a mask to class and cleans the surfaces of the room where germs are most likely to collect. It's hard to go home to visit my family and boyfriend when I constantly have to worry about potentially bringing home whatever new strain she contracted, and I really hope you can understand where I am coming from.",
