I was just too busy doing what I was told to do: finish HW on time, do well on the exam, and get a good job. I was able to achieve most of these, but I soon lost direction since I've never lived a self-driven life. A life that's driven by my intrinsic motivation.\n\nSo I quit my full-time job as a software engineer and founded a startup to help students unlock their potential, find their genuine interests, and live a self-motivated life. It's been a fulfilling, stressful, challenging, and rewarding journey! This is something that I would've done if I had enough money to retire and do something for free, so I am glad that I started this journey earlier than later.\n\nHope this helps and please take some time to think back about yourself. What's your intrinsic motivation? What would be your reason to get up in the morning and start studying?", "author": "echoi33", "created": 1632273939, "retrieved": 1632800903, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {}}
