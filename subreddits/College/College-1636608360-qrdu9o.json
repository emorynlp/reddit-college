  "text": "My home is a terrible environment for working on schoolwork. It used to not be that way but I can't do anything about. No one in my family cares if I want a good study environment. Either the TV is on so I can't work in the morning room. My brother is constantly facetiming and I can't do anything about so my room won't work. I'm not respected in the house. What do I do?",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend commuting to the library if you can. I\u2019d spend all day here. If you have the means financially I\u2019d recommend purchasing a meal plan to save you from having to go home early\u2026.\n\nNote I understand you\u2019re online so maybe that wouldn\u2019t be feasible.\n\nTry studying in a local cafe or library. Might help as well. \n\nIf locations can\u2019t be met I would consider reaching out to classmates for supplemental help on the weekends. Seeking help on assignments and or studying.",
