  "text": "So right now I am taking 8 credits, in 3 classes. This is a very light load due to the depression I was facing at the beginning of the semester. Note - this depression is now managed with medication, door is no longer as big of a concern. Because I took so few credits last semester, and because I want to audition for the Musical Dance theater major at my uni, I will need to take 9 classes next semester. This amounts to 17-18 credits (most of them are 1.0 credit dance/performance skills classes). I have no experience with dance and very little with music, I plan to be working around 10-15 hours a week. I'm not asking if it's doable(I know it will be hard, not impossible) but I'm wondering if 9 classes with 17 credits will be harder than 6 classes worth 17 credits. I know there will be different assignments but will this be much different than 5-6 classes worth 17 credits??",

      "text": "I highly suggest not doing this. 9 classes is too many classes for 99% of the population. Seriously 6 is usually the max a full time student will take that isn't working. In my experience those 1 credit classes usually have a lot more work than they are suppose to have. Have you thought about how you will organize all this? When you will study for  each class? How you will not get due dates mixed up? And you want to work? Have you thought about the mess midterms and finals week will be? I don't know what dance classes are like and such, I don't know if you are counting labs as a separate class, but I would talk to an advisor about this.",

It sounds like someone is writing from a non-music perspective, and music school is verrrry different from more academically-focused majors. 9 classes wouldn\u2019t be doable for a STEM major, it\u2019s normal for music. It\u2019ll be tough working 15 hours a week, but the actual course load is quite doable. I\u2019m currently taking 24 credits (double major added late) across 11 courses (4 ensembles, studio, and 6 more academic courses like music history and theory courses). I\u2019m not working, but if I didn\u2019t have some of the ensembles and one or two of my other courses, it\u2019d be doable. I know a few people that are music majors and still working - it\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s absolutely possible! \n\nYou\u2019ll do great :)",

      "text": "I\u2019m going to say don\u2019t do it. As someone that struggles with depression and is in college. Taking that many classes will affect you mentally even if you take medication. It will take a toll on you physically (you\u2019ll be super tired all the time and when people are tired you may find it harder to stabilize emotions), emotionally (maybe sadness, frustration etc) and mentally.\n\nIt will be hard to keep a great gpa unless you over exert yourself. If you get a bad gpa you may not get into the program. Also cramming yourself won\u2019t help you truly learn and grasp concepts You need in the long run for dance. On top of working it will become overwhelming too quickly.  \n\nIf you seriously must do this i suggest 5-6 classes of 17 -18 credits each combined with lots of therapy and pencil in time to relax \n\nIf you have wiggle room then maybe do 12-13 credits next semester which can be 4 classes and take the other 5-6 credits during the summer. \n\nPace yourself \nTake care of yourself",
