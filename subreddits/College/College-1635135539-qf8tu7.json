      "text": "It depends on your schedule. If you\u2019re on a quarterly system, you could possibly take 3-5 classes (although 3 may be the target). For semester, maybe 4-5 where 4 is usually normal. Some classes may meet 2-3x a week. You may have lab once a week (3-4 hours long, tho). Time of class may vary but you could have class 10-11am and 2-3pm on Monday and maybe all 4 classes on Tuesday, etc. You could have 2-3 hours between classes or 15 minutes. Some people may go grab a study hall to study while others may walk back to the dorm.",

      "text": "You pretty much make your own schedule. Fall freshman you may/may not have some flexibility because they want you all to choose similar classes with people in your major. There\u2019s nobody telling you what to do. My best advice is to concise your classes into 4 days so at least your Fridays will be open. I had to commute so I would try to only come in 2-3 days or try to take online classes.",

      "text": "Most classes are either 1 hr 3 days a week (MWF) or 1.5 hr twice a week (MW or TTh). Labs are usually a 3 hr block. If you want to graduate in 4 years, you usually need to shoot for 15 credits a semester, or about 5 classes.\n\nAs for scheduling, that really depends on you as a freshman. Once you're an upperclassman in your major, a lot of classes are only offered in one time slot. General advice, I'd avoid an 8 AM class your first semester, everybody thinks they're a morning person or aspires to be one but once you're really living on your own that motivation can disappear.\n\nThere's a couple different schools of thought for spacing. Clump them all together in the morning or afternoon so you can spend more time at home or have time for work shifts. If you're the kind of person who likes to work on homework in a long session that's great. If you need to switch things up a lot, then maybe better to space your classes an hour or two apart. It keeps you on campus, but let's you change scenery and subject frequently. Some people also like to have all their classes on the same days and have other days with no classes to study or have time for long work shifts. Other people can't process that much information at once, or don't have the discipline to plan out an off day and need them consistently throughout the week.\n\nSorry there's no single answer but hopefully this helped you figure out the right questions to ask when setting up your schedule.",

      "text": "So you take credits, and each credit corresponds to about 1 hour a week in the classroom, labs sometimes 2-3 hours a week. Most students take 12-18 credits, so only 12-20 hours a week actually spent in class. And yeah, you can just do what ever you want when you are not in class. For example, I have a lab on Monday from 10 am to noon, and then class again from 2-3 then 3-4 pm. So from 12-2, I just chill. I live off campus, and I can go home if I want, but most days I stay on campus and just do homework or study in the library. On Thursday I only have on class all day from 11am-12:30, so I work in the afternoons. There is a lot of free time outside of class, but between homework jobs and activities, you don't actually have alot of free time",
