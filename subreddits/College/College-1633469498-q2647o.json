  "text": "Hello,   \nSo I am writing an email to my TA to ask him about my lab report corrections. We can resend the corrected lab report to get a better grade.   \nIn that email I want to also compliment him (It's sincere, he really did a good job correcting my lab report and pointing out all the flaws)   \n\n\nIs that okay? I don't want it to seem like it's empty flattery. It's really a sincere compliment",
