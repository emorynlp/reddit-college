  "text": "As the title says, I'm an accounting major and am unsure if I should minor in finance or if I should also major in it making it a double major. But, I am also wondering how these 2 options would affect me if I decide to get a masters in accounting. Should I wait a bit before deciding as I'm a freshman? Are there any other minors/majors I should consider over finance?",

      "text": "I think in this case it depends on what you wanna do in the future and how you plan on using both majors, so think about that. Depending on what you wanna do, perhaps another major could benefit you more than Finance? But overall, other things remaning the same, Accounting + Finance is a really good combination and can be really useful!",

          "text": "Sorry for the late reply, I had exams over the weekend I had to study for, but I wanted to get into stocks, real estate, and investments. In short anything to do with passive income, and I would eventually start my own business in the future. I chose accounting as my major because of how secure it is as a job, so I was going to use that as my main source of income by taking the (CPA exam and getting a masters in accounting) before expanding onto more ways of passive income such as the ones I mentioned above, along with one day starting my own business. Do you think theres anything I should take instead of finance for a minor or a secondary major?",

              "text": "No worries, hope you did well on your exam. Since you're interested in investment, real estate and stocks, it makes total sense to study Finance as well. With the Accounting major, I'm sure it'll help you have a well rounded understanding of all these things, it's also a safety option in case the business idea may not end up working, these two majors will give you lots of opportunities to work in industry. Good luck!",
