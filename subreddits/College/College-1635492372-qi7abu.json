  "text": "As the title says, I'm an accounting major and am unsure if I should minor in finance or if I should also major in it making it a double major. But, I am also wondering how these 2 options would affect me if I decide to get a masters in accounting. Should I wait a bit before deciding as I'm a freshman? Are there any other minors/majors I should consider over finance?",

      "text": "I think in this case it depends on what you wanna do in the future and how you plan on using both majors, so think about that. Depending on what you wanna do, perhaps another major could benefit you more than Finance? But overall, other things remaning the same, Accounting + Finance is a really good combination and can be really useful!",
