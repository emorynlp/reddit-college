Liked my classes, my professors, and did well with it. For various reasons, I ended up transferring schools, and I ended up questioning whether I was on the right degree path. Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a cop. I took a bunch of law related classes in high school and really liked them, so I majored in criminal justice. The plan was for me to go into law enforcement when I graduated and hopefully end up working with a state or federal agency. I had it all planned out, but I knew I was missing a key piece of the puzzle: I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license. I\u2019ve tried since I turned 16 (I\u2019m now almost 22) and I do fine in a lot of situations, but most of the time I get flustered while driving and end up giving up. I\u2019ve always had issues with confidence and it has impacted many areas of my life. Anyways, I ended up deciding to switch to English with a concentration in Creative Writing, which is a subject that I love, but the English degree at my school requires you to take a bunch of boring prerequisites that I really don\u2019t want to do, plus it has a foreign language requirement (foreign languages and I don\u2019t mix well lmao) and the CJ major does not. 2020 especially threw a wrench in things, and I struggled with online classes, they really just don\u2019t work for me at all. When things went online, I tried it for a semester, but my grades took a hit, so I took some time off and now I haven\u2019t been back since January, and I\u2019ve lost motivation to go back. I have a job right now making $15/hour but it\u2019s not enough to move out, and I can\u2019t drive. I know I need to get my license, I just don\u2019t know how to get out of my own head. I also really don\u2019t know what path I should pursue. I have a few paths in front of me, and no clue which one to go down. I\u2019ve been stressing about all of this for the last couple of years and it has been a major source of depression and anxiety. As the title says, I just feel stuck.", "author": "maxroberts99", "created": 1632894913, "retrieved": 1632945384, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
