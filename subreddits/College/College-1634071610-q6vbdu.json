  "text": "My counselor is encouraging me to apply to transfer to UC Berkeley. I am hoping to major in Finance, but my school does not offer it, so I'm getting my associates in business management. I've taken 8 APs and 12 units of summer classes, as well as 18 units this fall. I just need about 3 more courses to satisfy the transfer requirement for a business major, so my counselor is pushing me to transfer. I feel unready to transfer, like I haven't done enough at my school. I'm in a few clubs, but haven't had any notable positions. I also haven't made the time for extracurriculars, because I feel I am still getting used to the workload of my college. Additionally, a lot of UCs are not great for a Finance major, because success in that major is largely based on connections and where you go to school (mainly the east coast). I also feel like I am already behind in the transfer process, and that my application would be sloppily done as a result. I feel like I'd get rejected at this point in my academic career, but my counselor really wants me to apply. Should I, or just wait for next year?",
