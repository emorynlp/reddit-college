I\u2019ve decided to drop my double major, and also figured out that there were quite a bit of issues within my graduation report.\n\nNow as of today, I will graduating in exactly 1 year with a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in statistics and a minor in economics!\n\nWith the plan we\u2019ve set up, I will still be able to go full speed at my startup and finish college in half the time initially thought. I won\u2019t lie. I\u2019m still quite miserable in college with everything else I am doing, and honestly, it\u2019s near the bottom of my priorities nowadays. However with only a year remaining, I can\u2019t just quit. \n\n**I will be powering through this to the finish line!!**\n\n*edit: Thank you to everyone commenting for the kind words!*", "author": "Throwaway247891", "created": 1599938867, "retrieved": 1632802163, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 987, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g55dkzr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/irj008/an_update_for_everyone_i_am_not_dropping_out/g55dkzr/", "text": "Congrats!
