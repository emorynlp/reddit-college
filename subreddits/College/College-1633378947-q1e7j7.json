  "text": "So I currently go to school for business admin at a cc and will be transferring to a 4 year to finish the last 2 years in my concentration ( still deciding whether MIS, HR, or Finance) though my brother by being a state worker is able to give me a program that offers a Associate degree for free, but I\u2019m not sure what to pick. The lists includes many business management certifications such as HR management cert, data analytic cert and so on. Though I was thinking about pairing my pre-existing degree with the healthcare field since that is a field that always will have opportunities. The degrees for the medical field they have are Health information management, healthcare administration and health services. They also have medical coding specialist. The CC that is offering this from my brother to me is Eastern community college. What would you guys pick?",
