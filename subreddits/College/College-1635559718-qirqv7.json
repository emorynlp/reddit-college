  "text": "What\u2019s up guys, I need some advice. Some background info, I am a 19yo male in pretty good shape, and I am pretty smart. I go to the gym a lot and study a lot. I go to a small liberal arts college where around 50% of the student population is in a fraternity. Last year when the Covid pandemic was far more serious, I was always going to small dorm parties. These parties were cool because I could actually actually socialize with others and it was an inclusive environment( you didn\u2019t have to be a frat brother to get in, there was no ratio, etc.). Because of last year\u2019s laidback social setting I made a lot of good friends and met a lot of girls who I talked to/ slept with. \n\nThis Year:\n\nBecause the Covid pandemic had started back up, frats and other exclusive social organizations are now throwing a majority of the parties on and off campus because they provide free alcohol for women and good music for party goers. I haven\u2019t slept with a single girl yet this year. I had the opportunity to rush a fraternity but I decided against it since I will only be spending another semester at my current university before I attend my German sister school for the rest of my college career.\n\nBig Picture:\n\nWhat can I do to be in a situation where I can go to small parties where I can actually meet people? Should I just put my head down and work hard for the rest of the year, or should I enjoy? \n\nWhat personally frustrates me:\n\nGirls always choose to hang out with/ hook up with guys who are dumber, weaker, and less driven than me. I\u2019m 6\u201d0 I am in good physical condition and I am interested and intelligent, I speak multiple languages. What am I doing wrong?",
