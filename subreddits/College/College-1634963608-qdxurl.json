Tonight, no more than an hour ago, some literally pissed outside my door. I had to leave and go to an on campus safe room.\n\nHas anyone had to deal with harassment of this variety? I\u2019m scared that things will continue to escalate.",

If they are freshman, they may still have that high school mentality where it\u2019s like I don\u2019t like being told what to do. I would reach out to the housing service and tell them it\u2019s ruining ur mental health and sleep to do well academically then you may be able to get transferred to a different housing accommodation. Right now it seems that it may be going that way since you\u2019re in a safe room right now. But I would tell them look, I\u2019m afraid that it could escalate even worse so you would like to be placed in new housing permanently.",
