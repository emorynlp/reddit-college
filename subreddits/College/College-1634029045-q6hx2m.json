  "text": "So i\u2019m currently living on the first floor in the residence halls. it\u2019s 5am on a tuesday and my upstairs neighbor has been blasting music and slamming on his floor since 9pm. this is an every night thing and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. i don\u2019t want to call the RA on call because i get that they\u2019re students too. should i reach out to the housing department and let them know this is an issue? or is it just something that i\u2019m paying $30,000 to just deal with",
