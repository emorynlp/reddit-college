  "text": "Ok so this is my third semester at a community college. This semester I changed my college plan from Business to computer science and have to take Precal. I\u2019m going to end up failing the class this semester due to just a lot of stuff going on and me not setting aside enough time to study and do my work. I know it\u2019s something I should\u2019ve planned for and realized where I messed up but just want to know how bad the repercussions are. \n*Me not graduating on time is not a huge concern for me*",
