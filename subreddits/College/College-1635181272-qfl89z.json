  "text": "I had a meeting with my advisor about my classes (he\u2019s also a professor that I\u2019ve had all throughout college) and I had asked for his opinion on one of the internships I was considering (I really wanted to intern at Disney World). This professor runs a well known business that is partnered with the school and interning at this place is one of our options. He had talked previously about how he knew people that had worked at Disney and that he could put us in touch with them if we were interested. So during our meeting, I asked him if he knew of anyone I could talk to about interning there. I thought maybe that they would be able to tell me if it was a good place to intern at or not. When I had asked him this, he said \u201cPeople in my position usually don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not a good look for me to help students get jobs.\u201d He sounded upset saying this. This threw me off and I\u2019m a little worried he thought I was looking for a handout. I tried explaining to him that I just wanted to know if it was a good place to intern or not. Not for a job. He basically told me that only \u201clazy people\u201d go to work for Disney since there are so many people that work in the position that I was considering. That I wouldn\u2019t be learning anything. \n\nThis was literally my dream job, but now I\u2019m more worried that I\u2019ve upset this guy. I have a lot of respect for him, but this was completely out of no where as we\u2019ve had really good conversations before. I even told him several times before (literally the first day of the first class I had with him) that I intended to work there. I don\u2019t get it.",

      "text": "Seems a little odd to me. Could just be something that varies from person to person or field to field. Do you know him very well and does he know about your work ethic/skills/etc? \n\nIn my experience, I've had at least two professors speak to people they know about employing me and more than that have pointed me towards job openings that they knew of in my field. Every professor I've ever spoken to about this sort of thing has been more than happy to help me out because they know me well and know that I'm reliable. I'm in a really small department though and have had a lot of time to spend with these people",
