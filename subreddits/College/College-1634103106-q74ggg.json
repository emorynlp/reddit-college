  "text": "I'll start, showing up to class should be totally optional and profs shouldn't take attendance\n\nedit: my reasoning for this is it's possible to do well in class and not show up to every single meeting. Like if I know for my class the only thing we're gonna do is to go over homework or review old material or something, but I have other stuff to do like homework, or studying for another class then I shouldn't have to show up for class. If I'm paying for my education, I should get the ability to choose which classes I want to focus and spend the most effort/time on",

Like wtf, how am i supposed to know i can handle or manage a class with my schedule when the rigorous content hasnt even started yet? Besides organic chemistry and physics (just my experience), other classes have the soft introduction on week 1 and then the content is light on week 2 compared to maybe week 4 or 5 when before you have the 1st exam.\n\nWeek 1 you dont even get a feel for the class, week 2 is when you start to get a feel for it but even then youre still undecided if you can or will be able to handle it or if you are interested in the class. Just 1 or 2 more weeks, thats all im asking.",

The tests were also going to be honorlock and at a mandatory 8pm where I would have had to take it in my bathroom because it\u2019s the evening and my whole family is home from work and my cats are going wild. \n\nI had to petition for a drop without a w because of how uncomfortable it was and how unlikely I was to even get a D.

I transferred to a commuter school after the first year. \n\nMine was a quad (4 beds, one room) and some of the things I dealt with included waking up from a nap to find out that one of my roommates had left some random guy alone in the dorm with me while I was asleep, putting and leaving their stuff on other people\u2019s beds, clearly using my makeup without permission and then lying about it, coming in at 2 am and turning on lights and being loud, other people\u2019s guests eating at and then leaving their garbage on my desk, trying to have their boyfriend stay in the dorm with us for over a week, etc. It was just a lot of ridiculous behavior that lead to unnecessary arguments between the roommates, I even had to completely cuss one of my roommates out. \n\nA good roommate is rare and it\u2019s not worth the huge cost difference and all the extra headaches at all.",

Let's say I devote an entire 8 hour day to giving these presentations (I think that's the best I can expect the registrar to grant me for time during the final exam period).\n\nEven assuming no breaks whatsoever and that everything goes perfectly smoothly with transitions between presenters, that's about 9 minutes of time for the student to present. \n\nThe student, as students do, will ignore any material that they're not being evaluated directly on, and will instead focus entirely on the topic of their little 9 minute presentation. \n\nGiven that the course material took *substantially longer* than 9 minutes to cover in the first place, I would expect that relying upon a 9 minute presentation instead of exams for an evaluation will leave me with absolutely no idea about the student's mastery of the 99%+ of the material in the course that wouldn't be covered in the 9 minute presentation. \n\nDesigning a syllabus doesn't prove you know the material. All it proves is that you can figure out which material is important.",

I was just tossing out ideas. \n\nAs far as the syllabus assignment, I\u2019ve seen people, especially in social sciences, humanities, or arts, pick a topic as they would for an essay for the course, and design an entire class based on it.

With that, also comes unnecessary stress, debt, wasted time, etc. My high school German teacher told me that in Germany, there will just be independent club organizations to represent towns or cities, and this alternative makes sense to me.",

I assume these independent club organizations aren't free, (again I'm not familiar with sports, so maybe sports teams in schools have fees as well) so I feel like this could deter students from giving sports a try at all. I think there should be separate independent club organizations for extracurricular activities such as art, music, sports, etc. so that they aren't tied to the extra work and costs associated with higher education, but I don't think that they have no place in schools at all. I think students should be encouraged to immerse themselves in a variety of different extracurricular activities and the opportunity should be included alongside their general education as they decide what kinds of things they are interested in. I don't think anyone should feel pressured to pursue higher education just to play sports, but I am also unsure how many countries would encourage students to make sports a priority as opposed to further education. Having sports as an extracurricular in schools ensures that students still have practical skills to fall back on should they choose to enter the workforce. I think improving the quality of education provided by publicly funded schools, so that higher education is entirely optional, would be a better solution for athletes who don't want to deal with stress and debt.",

I\u2019ve definitely had peers who wrote like shit and I would rewrite their portions of a lab or assignment because it wasn\u2019t accurate or descriptive. It made me look like an asshole and also made me do a ton more work.\n\nThe main problem, I think, is that it\u2019s very hard to teach good writing skills by the time you get to college and  most fundamental writing skills are not going to be developed in college with the kinds of courses and offerings provided (and certainly not with the relatively little time most professors and instructors actually have with their students). So much of the writing students are taught in K12 and for testing is extremely formulaic (often because that is what is tested on) and I think a lot of people don\u2019t know how to break out of that. But even most courses that are forced to add papers and writing components don\u2019t really work on the actual mechanics of writing (style, grammar, usage, division of thoughts, etc.) \n\nI also agree that so much of \u201cstudents can\u2019t write\u201d comes from the humanities, so that\u2019s also where attempts to improve writing come from, when it may not be the kind of writing that students would most benefit from. I think it\u2019s possible to write well across different fields, but it\u2019s more uncommon than common and takes practice, more practice than you may get in a course. That being said, bad writing in one area tends to correlate with bad writing in another. But continuing to add writing courses and requirements in general ed and the humanities does not seem to be helping that much and still fails to teach students about good writing in their field.\n\nThe last thing is that I don\u2019t think that writing is the only form of communication that matters, but that\u2019s how a lot of people tend to act. For example, I think many engineers in particular could do with more practice creating meaningful images, charts, and graphs that not only shorten the number of words needed, but that also fit into the flow of arguments that they are making. One of the ways I judge technical resources is by how many diagrams they have. Oftentimes, long wordy descriptions that are unaccompanied by any kind of meaningful imagery fail to explain a concept or necessary information. And at worst, these add ambiguities and uncertainty about the actual state or behavior of something, which is bad if you need that information to make a decision or design assumption on. Some may kind of go \u201clol engineers and their picture books,\u201d but trust me when I say that pictures can convey messages better than words many times and do you want the person designing your car, plane, etc., uncertain of what a report is telling them to design for? No. No you don\u2019t.\n\nAnyway, we need to rethink some of the writing requirements in college and how they are executed.",

Even after I took English in college I did not feel that it really benefited my scientific writing. Especially since we write a bit differently than you do in an English class.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you still struggle with grammar, but I would recommend to you or anyone else who struggles with this to take foreign language for this purpose. Taking French and German have both definitely increased my understanding of English grammar, because it suddenly becomes necessary to understand what kinds of words and structures translate over to another language and vice versa. Certainly it was the case in high school that I became much more familiar with grammar as a whole when it suddenly became necessary.\n\nThe only other thing I would add here too is that often times you are penalized for style not grammar. However, a lot of times professors don\u2019t necessarily know how to explain the difference between the tail and very often treats style as grammar. And I don\u2019t necessarily think that means that style shouldn\u2019t matter or that you can\u2019t be penalized for inappropriate style usage, but many times professors treat style like grammar, Which I think can lead to and over reliance on aesthetic to indicate good writing (Ie looking for certain indicators of style and grammar to be \u201cgood writing\u201d), instead of having good substance at all. The thing that\u2019s probably the worst about a lot of writing assignments is that a lot of students don\u2019t feel like they have anything to say. And I do think that many of us on Reddit, myself included, probably are the opposite of that and have too much to say, but some people don\u2019t really want to have to say anything at all.\n\n> Science writing in my opinion can be difficult to get used to as each field has their preferences of what and how to say certain things, and it can take a while to get used to.\n\nFrankly, I do actually find a lot of STEM literature to be incomprehensible and uninformative. I definitely think it\u2019s its own kind of thing, but I also do think that some  reforms are needed.\n\n> I agree figures are absolutely crucial even in chemistry.

That is also another difference between science writing and English class writing, as you have to incorporate the figure into your arguments which can be awkward sometimes.\n\nOne good graphic can often be much more helpful in understanding a concept than thousands of words combined. At least in the context of engineering, having a good drawing of a system or of a process really makes a huge difference in terms of being able to  understand what is even going on. I don\u2019t want to say that this is always the solution, but I definitely feel like having good graphics is severely underappreciated. \n\nI also think that many students are not really asked enough to practice explaining a concept at different levels of expertise. And I think this is often true, especially when thinking about Public speaking and communication. Most people probably take one public speaking class, and it\u2019s probably pretty generalized. Engineers also certainly have basically no media training. All of these forms of communication would definitely be useful, but they are not even touched.",

As for myself, for example, I took some classes such as drama, music theory, child development and archeology. If you ask me what I learned from them, my answer would be I don't know. I didn't care for any of them and did just the bare minimum in order to pass and be done with it.\nSince I have to pay for classes, I wish my money would be better used by charging me for classes that really interest me and going to be useful to my career.

So at best you'd have to double everything up, with the same subjects being taught in 2 places, but then what happens if you study vocationally and later change your mind and decide you want to go into the research track for that field? Are you locked out because you did your degree at the vocational college? \n\nPlus people usually don't go into the field they studied, regardless of what they studied, and the average person changes career multiple times throughout their life so they certainly won't *stay* in the field they studied. The subject on your degree doesn't functionally matter for most people, they just need *a* degree. And that's the fault of employers, not the universities. Even if you separated them, maybe employers would still request you have a liberal arts degree first or would more highly value the academic version of the subject over the vocational. \n\nDegrees aren't job training in any useful sense, never have been and still aren't. The only change is that employers now request them to help weed out applicants. There's no other reason for it, and it certainly isn't something universities have control of.",

While a student can learn from a textbook on their own, profs have years of experience with the subject and have perspectives and ideas that have been molded by their experience, and class time is meant to impart that onto students.\n\nAnd of course the quality of profs can vary but generally, going to class AND learning from a textbook/self teaching is the best way to learn. Just decrying going to class because the prof isn't perfect is unproductive and ultimately bad for the student in the long run.\n\nAttendance and participation is an important measure for the professors so they can tailor their lessons and materials to the people who actively show up and actively want to learn about a topic. Because from their perspective, if a student isn't showing up to class without a valid excuse, they're right to assume that the student isn't wholly invested in the class, and resources spent on them are better spent on students who are more active.",

My point is that attendance is not a metric for whether or not a student is learning anything. And grading, should be on the students understanding of the coursework.\n\nFor example, it's important to go to philosophy classes; because, hearing other arguments is kind of the point. On the other hand, that's not same dynamic in all classes. \n\nIn my personal college career in STEM, I've seen students show up every day, do their work, and fail. And, I've seen some students get top grades, but they showed up just to turn in homework and tests. \n\nI've had a couple classes, where showing up to class just made things confusing. The professor wasn't lecturing in a way that reached me. I self taught. As a result, I, also, got better grades and understood the subject better. He wasn't a bad professor. Others liked his lectures, but it was my education at the end of the day. I was responsible for doing what I needed to learn, and that's what I did.\n\n\n\nAnd, why a particular professor includes attendance is, also, variable. A lot colleges simply require attendance for certain gen Ed classes; because, freshman tend to not show up and fail. It looks bad for the school to have low graduation rates.",
