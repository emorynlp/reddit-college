  "title:": "Struggling badly, how do I get through?",
  "text": "This is my last semester as an undergrad, finally graduating. My GPA is a 3.8, I\u2019ve done really well. In honors societies and everything. Published author of some essays. \n\nHowever, my mental health has been awful. I got out of an abusive relationship this year, and there\u2019s been horrible things that have happened within the last month that have made it even worse. \n\nThis has led to me struggling to pass two classes, which has never happened before and would mean I can\u2019t graduate. Needing to take two classes in the spring also messes up financial aid and scholarships because I\u2019d be a part time student. \n\nSo, I need to do what I can to get a C. Do I tell teachers and rely on sympathy? Or how do I do this?",

      "text": "I would not count on sympathy at all.  I would speak to the professors of the courses you are failing.  Mention that you haven't been doing as well as usual due to some personal problems, and ask for academic advice.  With your GPA, of course, you know what it takes to pass courses.  If you are not already mathematically prevented from getting Cs in these courses, you can still get those grades up to that level.",

          "text": "I told my professors of the recent things that have happened, but not my mental health struggles. One of them didn\u2019t even respond, which given the gravity of what\u2019s happening and what I told him (about a death to someone close to me and some other stuff) was kinda rude I thought. The other one did respond, and was so incredibly kind and amazing. So I guess I should reach out to both again and really try to explain things more and see if there\u2019s any extra credit",
