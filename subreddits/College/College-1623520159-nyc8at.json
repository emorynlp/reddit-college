And high school wasnt bad for me, it was just boring. \n\nIn high school i was on the swim team, had art friends, and hung out with friends when i wasnt at practice or a meet. I read a lot more. School was easy enough, did APs got good grades. Outside of school,  I had fun doing stupid shit like grabbing drinks at sonic, sleep overs, just general chilling. But college was soooooo much more fun.\n\nI tried crew and joined the rock climbing team, getting in the best shape of my life. I playedhuman chess, went to poetry slams, met boyfriends, went to museums, libraries, theaters, bars,  i tried archery, joined engineering groups, got to shadow a heart doctor, learned how to backpack, and learned a little bit about how to learn. I met people from tons of backgrounds, different ages, cultures, everything! I got to explore so many new places and really cool cities (transfer student here). You can go and do whatever you want (within reason haha) on a beautiful campus filled with other people who are trying to learn and better themselves. I had sleepless nights studying. I got sexiled by my roommate, i had to write out by hand code. I felt like i was failing all the time. But the struggle was awesome! You have so many people around you struggling with the same thing! It wasn\u2019t easy but man was it worth it. Thinking about who would come to my wedding (if i ever have one) almost everyone is from college and maybe a few people from before.

For 10-11, when I finally got there it was incredibly bad! There were gangs everywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWithout exposing myself, there were constant race fights at our school. All the hispanic people would sit with only hispanic people, blacks with blacks, and the 1 or 2 white kids that were unfortunate to attend that highschool would all sit at their own little area near the cafeteria with the lunch ladies. This all started one day when supposedly a black kid burned a flag that one of the hispanic students brought to school. The hispanic kids responded by taking guns to school and they actually shot some black kids. No one was killed, but it actually made headlines at our local news stations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe tension just became worse after that. Black kids would jump hispanic kids and even the 1 or 2 white kids. The hispanic kids did the same and both sides targeted anyone, regardless if they were affiliated with gangs or not. My group of friends was mixed and we got jumped a couple times by both sides. Kinda funny because in highschool I was in the football team and always working out. I was pretty buff back then, benching 240lbs, curling 120lbs, and doing 300lbs on the legs. I got jumped one day and knocked out two Mexican kids, picked up a 3rd from his shirt and threw him over some bus benches. That was the last time the Mexican kids fucked with my group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor 12th grade I decided to fuck off from that school. In the 11th grade I had gotten my car stolen, and too many idiots would interrupt classes on a daily. I told myself that I wanted to graduate highschool. I couldn't fucking do it at this school, like every day there would be 1 or 2 students running into one or more of my classes looking for some kid to beat up or fight. One of my friends, who was white, told me about this school he had moved to, told me it was much smaller and there were no gangs there, so I switched with him. EDIT: I know I am going to trigger some foos with this, but legit one of my homies is white. His dad is from Spain and his mom is from here. Our high school didn't have many white kids, they were pretty rare. I am still BFs with this kid, we've actually been friends since middle school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor college I told myself that I would never relive the shit I had to go through in highschool. I had to work right out of highschool, but after a few years of working and getting my shit together, I went to a school that was 30 miles from me. God, it was such a more pleasant experience. Kids of all races, no one trying to fight you just because you are brown, black, or white, everyone getting along. Now 7 years later, I am a college graduate with a bachelors in mechanical engineering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of my cousins who attended schools in the same area dropped out of highschool. Most of them had kids early on (some while in highschool). Same went with other people I knew from my classes (in highschool). Most of my peers dropped out, a few ended up getting killed, including one of my cousins and a friend I used to kick it with, all due to gang violence and living in the hood. I always tell myself that it could have been me in one of those scenarios. Like I remember a time when I was kicking it with one of my cousins and his homies when the house we were in was shot at in a drive-by shooting. I could have lost my life there! Thankfully no one I remember was hit, but it was scary! Like I had no idea what the fuck was going on, my cousin who was much older than me had to tackle me to the floor. I thought it was firecrackers. One of the windows where I was near was shattered by a bullet. Shit was crazy!\n\nWhen I was in the 10th grade, I remember walking up to my house and right in front of my face, my next door neighbor was gunned down and shot, right in front of my mom's house (mom still lives there). The area where he bled turned dark and for years there was always this black stain on our drive way (or the curb from drive way to main street). I am so fucking glad I decided to move the fuck out of the hood. Going to school 30 miles from me was a real cultural change. Sure it took me 7 years, but that was because I had to bust my ass off and work full-time to pay for rent, bills, and shit. Now, I have friends from all walks of life, that I am constantly in touch with from that college/uni experience. I was always the ghetto talking mf in classes and that's how they remember me LOL. I always called my friends \"homie\" or \"foo\". Even one of my close friends in uni started using foo at me LOL, like \"Hey foo\". Hey yo, but that's just from my upbringing, don't think I can ever fix my vocabulary.", "author": "SpectreInTheShadows", "created": 1623551952, "upvotes": 1}, "h1kv343": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nyc8at/did_you_guys_like_college_more_or_high_school/h1kv343/", "text": "Highschool.

I live in a third world country where the education system is fairly corrupt. It's like every college here is like a police precinct that's dirtier than the other. Teachers basically have more rights than students and can do whatever, except for sexual harassment, the fuck they want without little to no consequences. There have been multiple incidents of teachers failing students just because they went and complained to administration about them not being able to teach properly. A teacher even straight up threatened to fail a student to his face and did just that. There are even voice chat recordings of the head of the administration department yelling over the phone at the class representatives of each major to tell their classmates to pay their tuition fees during the start of the corona pandemic. The staff has everything to gain while the students have everything to lose. Now, you're probably asking \"why the fuck are you in this uni lol?\". Well, it's because I didn't have much of a choice. Because of uni, I've become so bitter that people don't like being around me anymore. Like I'm always stressed out, extremely worn out and tired, and have little to no time for side projects that are important to my major. It's just constant bullshit and assignments. It genuinely feels like we're not learning to be engineers, but rather politicians because of the amount of politics that comes with this uni. You have to play your cards right in order to get stuff done. Teachers are also getting away with stuff like not telling students which course book is being used for their course. We even had a teacher that was teaching us stuff outside of the course book's content and would get really aggressive if we asked him what course to read in order to understand the content of the course.  I've seen the administrative staff talk down to parents. Like who in the right fucking mind would talk to down to a student's parents? They're literally giving your college money. Honestly, I can't do it anymore. I have to, but I can't. It's starting to get too much for me. Maybe I'm extremely weak, maybe I'm pretty strong for putting up with shit like this for years.
