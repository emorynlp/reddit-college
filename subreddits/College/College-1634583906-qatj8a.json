  "title:": "emailing professors for the 3rd time about missing class/ assignments being late",
  "text": "TLDR: due to medical problems and a car accident, ive emailed my professors  3 times in the last month about missing class/ work. i have proof of appointments and the accident. is this too ridiculous to keep asking if i can make things up? should i just drop the classes instead?\n\n\n\nokay so hear me out- i\u2019ve been sick the past month with numerous doctors appointments and procedures. at the beginning, i wrote a general email to all of my professors, explaining i had numerous dr. appointments and was sick so i might have missed class (all online) or i might have turned in an assignment late or not been able to because it was past due. everyone was understanding and gave me an extension. i email a second time before i have to get an ultrasound and endoscopy done that i had more past appointments and these future appointments. again about the class/ late work thing. i told them i could have everything in by 10/13. on 10/16 i was in a bad car accident and again missed a couple of assignments. i emailed them again, but im getting worried about how they perceive me and regret sending it. i feel like i should just have dropped the classes at this point. i don\u2019t like to email professors at all so usually my work is done and i am in class, and i don\u2019t want to seem like i am taking advantage of their leeway. i feel like i just need to drop out of my classes because my professors have done a lot for me and i still need more. ive provided proof of everything, but i can\u2019t help the feeling that i am irritating them and need too much. i know there is only so much they can do before i am unable to pass the course. i have okay grades in 3 classes and a really bad grade in the other one. \n\nanyone ever have anything similar or have any advice?",

No breaks for them ?\n\nHowever, I am limited as to what I can actually do to help , regardless of how much sympathy I feel for you if you dont go through proper channels.",
