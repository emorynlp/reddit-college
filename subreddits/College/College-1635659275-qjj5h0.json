  "text": "I've been an online student at this Christian college for years now (I've been having issues with my mental health, bipolar disorder) I'm not necessarily religious, but I do believe in God, etc but I cared more about the education rather than the Christian aspect \n\nNow apparently on campus women are coming forward about sexual harassment and since this is a Christian school they aren't taking any action.\n\nI'm a woman and I feel terrible about this considering I've been in similar situations. I feel strongly about this issue. I'm doubting continuing my education there. I really want to finish though but it makes me feel guilty. \n\nPlus, what will potential employees think of this? \n\nAm I making a big deal out of this?",

It just shows how little they care about their students. \n\nYou\u2019re fine in terms of future employment because generally, most employers don\u2019t give a damn where you went to college. Hell, some don\u2019t even care what type of Bachelor\u2019s you have, just that you have one.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear about this! Based on recent news, I'm guessing Liberty? If so, you should be okay; they're a large university, and accredited, so it's a degree employers should recognize.\n\n\nIf it's still eating at you and you don't want to start over, you could always check around with other programs and try to see if your credits would transfer somewhere. It may drag things out more depending on how different requirements are, but checking shouldn't do any harm.",
