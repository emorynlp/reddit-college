  "text": "I\u2019ve been doing online school for a year and half now and planning to take mostly online next semester as well, I always feel weird around other people especially if it\u2019s an attractive guy because I feel like they\u2019re judging me and how ugly I am. \n\nI\u2019m not that attractive and I don\u2019t really know how to communicate well, it just comes out awkwardly and I feel stupid. You can say I\u2019m a little slow and hard to understand\n\nCompared to my classmates and other people I feel like I\u2019m slow at understanding things and also just slow at processing instructions. I had several times where I was in a lab and a professor told me not to do something and I did it anyways cause I didn\u2019t understand what she meant. I was always the last one in the lab to understand what\u2019s going on, despite this I did make good grades but it just took me a lot more effort than the smart person. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I feel this way but I always think that people are judging me and making fun of me. I go to online tutoring and I don\u2019t even turn on my mic because I know I\u2019ll stutter or I\u2019ll say something stupid, compared to how other people describe things, I feel illiterate sometimes.  \n\nCan someone suggest me how to stop this feeling that people hate me because it\u2019s causing me to miss out on improving  my communication skills and being antisocial which is not a good thing for my future or mental being.",

      "text": "hi there! i understand how you feel. i've been there too at one point in my life where i suffered from body dysmorphia and never felt like i was good enough for anyone especially when it came to communicating with others and all. i always felt like i was being judged for how i looked and spoke because i had a slight accent and i felt chubby even when i was thin back then (currently i gained weight so i'm not that thin anymore lmao). but for the past years i've been trying to practice self love, watched self love videos, and gained input from friends and family over the years just reassuring and reaffirming with me that i'm not as ugly as i thought i was. i also dressed myself up sometimes and wore makeup at home just to feel good about my appearance while i pose and take pictures in front of the mirror if i feel cute. i think those things made me realize that i wasn't as unattractive as i thought and helped me gained confidence. \n\nfor communication, i honestly just practiced on my own in the mirror and i force myself in situations where i have to talk to people (at the grocery stores, cashiers, phone calls, small talk with teachers, relatives). it was really bad at first because i used to shake so much thinking about talking to people but as time went on, and i pushed myself to go outside of my comfort zone and now i feel very confident about how i talk and communicate with others since i got over my anxiety and awkwardness. \n\npractice makes perfect and just solidifying those things helped a lot with my mental health and self image. just remember: confidence makes someone really attractive! gain confidence in your own abilities and your own self and you'll do great. do what makes you feel confident :) i'm sure you're amazing, talented, and gorgeous!",
