  "text": "so I have a final coming up in a few weeks so I attempted to start studying for it tonight, however, I started a new job last week where I worked 20 hours and which I am still sore from (8 hour shifts on tuesday, thursday and saturday of last week), I had an 8am course this morning which I had to get up at 6 for and had to get a filling (dentist) this afternoon, so my concentration is basically nonexistant right now, I've done barely half an hour of work and my eyes are already glazing over, while I'm not failing I'm also not doing well in the course and I really want to do well on the final (especially since I have to start thinking about grad school starting this year) but with everything else going on today my work ethic is completely failing, how do you you manage to study when you're basically falling asleep in your chair?",

      "text": "At that point you\u2019re not going to be able to effectively study. Prioritize sleep so that you can better retain the material you go over.  Or you can try working really hard on school work/studying for 25-30 minutes, and then taking a 5-10 minute break away from what you\u2019re doing.  Energy drinks once in a while helped me stay up late to crank out study notes",
