      "text": "Not many schools offer full-credit courses during the time between the fall and the spring semester.  Some do, but in my experience that is by far the exception rather than the rule.  So I guess you could look at finding a school that offers it online and trying that route, but I don't think you should get your hopes up.\n\nAnother possibility is that you ask your college for permission to take this one course at the same time as senior capstone (i.e., as a co-requisite instead of a pre-requisite). It's not unheard of that people get permission to do that from time to time, but it often depends on how good your record is.  If you have a weak academic record, they might worry that you won't be able to keep up with all the material in a class *and* one if its prerequisites at the same time.  Still, there's no harm in asking.\n\nGood luck.",
