  "title:": "Failing hard in my junior year of HS because of constant migraines, advice needed.",
  "text": "About halfway through my sophomore year I started getting migraines that forced me from doing in person school go online school that allowed me to get more sleep and less stress that resulted in no more headaches. \n\nFast forward to my junior year, i was doing great up until the end of the first semester. The headaches came back, and at this point I get them 4-5 times a week. On my \u2018off days\u2019, all I want to do is recover and sleep. I\u2019ve seen a few doctors, gotten brain scans done and I\u2019m on meds that can take some time to work. \n\nI\u2019ve always been a really good student too. A\u2019s and B\u2019s across the board sophomore year and straight A\u2019s freshman year, and even before high school I always had straight A\u2019s. As of September 23rd, I have a 4.25 weighted GPA and a 29 on my ACT, but now because of headaches and depression I haven\u2019t done anything for school in almost 4 weeks. I\u2019m trying to get accepted into a homebound program that would let me do school from home, but it\u2019s a process that can take some time.\n\nI\u2019m failing every class now and the headaches are showing no signs of stopping. My goal is to get into Texas A&M, but if this causes me to fail most of my important junior year classes how slim are my chances of getting into engineering at A&M? There is a good chance I could graduate late and I\u2019m not sure how that will work out and look.",

      "text": "Research medication overuse headache also known as rebound headache and make sure that\u2019s not happening to you. \n\nSee a neurologist, preferably a headache specialist. \n\nTry migraine specific medications: triptans, anti CGRP injections, gepants, Botox for migraine, there\u2019s lots and it\u2019s likely that one of them will work for you, but you need to see a neurologist who is experienced with migraine to help you. \n\nGood luck. I went through this last semester except I was in college. I finally got on Nurtec for an abortive and it changed my life. There\u2019s hope, don\u2019t worry. You can bring your grades up, and if you can\u2019t, you can explain in your essay that you were having a medical problem and you got it under control. And worst case scenario you can get help and then go to community college and transfer, and then your high school grades won\u2019t matter.",
