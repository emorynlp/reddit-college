  "text": "I'm a college freshman that visits home every 2 weeks. Whenever I do, I don't know how to explain it, but home doesn't feel like home( I've only moved away a month ago). It's even awkward being around my siblings, kind of almost like we're strangers. Kind of hate it since I used to be really close with my little sister but now it feels like I'm on the outside looking in.  Does this always happen?",
