I started off at Ithaca College in NY and got around 36 credits while there. I ended up transferring to Rowan University in NJ and got around 60 credits. I finally went to NY Chiropractic College and got 28 credits but they were graduate courses. \n\nI'm currently in Rowan and they won't accept my Graduate Courses for the undergrad program I'm currently in. Do you guys know of any colleges that would? It'd frustrating that I have enough credits to graduate but I can't because they won't accept 28 of my credits.", "author": "1ron_pandaa", "created": 1632324914, "retrieved": 1632800888, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
