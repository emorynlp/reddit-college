College was never supposed to become four years of wild parties, hookups that you regret a week later, and spending Friday nights holding up your best friend's ombre rose gold hair after she's had way too much to drink.  \n\nIt's supposed to be a serious place of learning for those that truly want to be there and know what they want.  \n\nif 35-year-old millennials still don't know what they want to do, then how are 18-year-olds (18 is the new 13) going to know where they belong or what they are going to want to do for the next 82+ years?\n\nThere is enormous potential for the young people of today - \n\n**Millennials and Gen Z (iGen) are brilliant, they're more accepting of differences, they're very advanced**, they want to make a difference in this world, not just be in a job they hate waiting to get off of work and then wasting their nights on Reddit (no offense, reddit).\n\nHistorically, you've got it pretty good.  Coal miners, steel workers, and factory girls of the early 20th century were not stopping every 5 minutes to post selfies to their Instas and then tweeting about how adorbs Evelyn Nesbit looks in her YouTube videos (Google her, she was basically the Hottest Girl in the World before the Titanic sank).\n\nCollege was out of bounds and out of the realm of possibility for so many that can now go.  Marginalized groups are now welcomed.  Women can go to law school, something that was still considered very new for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Professors (hopefully) are not asking their female law students for cookie recipes, assuming that they are only there to meet a husband and then move to Darien, Connecticut and have three boys to follow in Daddy's footsteps at the firm in Manhattan.\n\nAnyway, here's one thing you can do to make yourself less unhappy at college:\n\nGo for a nice walk to clear your head... Maybe you'll see something that'll make your day better.  Or meet someone that will change your life somehow.  Don't look for just hot people.  That old guy that looks like a werewolf and lives behind the dumpsters?  He served in the Vietnam War... Learn something from him.  When he was 18, he didn't have the privilege to do anything but die for his country.  That he made it out alive of the jungles of hell was a miracle.  His buddies were all dead now, and when he got back home, he wasn't given a patriotic welcome home parade like his dad was in World War II.  He was spit on, thrown into a mental asylum, and could not get hired anywhere.  And now, after giving his youth (and his left leg) to his country, he's thanked for it by sleeping next to the campus dump which smells like used condoms (and I'll let your imagination run wild with how awful that stinks).  \n\nI'd reckon to say that at 18, you might not really know what life is all about... 18 year old guys are really horny - and so I imagine that unless you don't have a high sex drive, you're probably spending most of your time in the campus library wondering what the girl in the table across from you looks like without any clothes on.  It's okay.  You're young, you're at your sexual peak... it's okay to basically just want to spend the next four years banging every girl you see.... and no, you don't need to know what you want to do.\n\nJust enjoy being young, dude... it doesn't last forever.  Before you know it, you'll look back on those years (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23....) and wish you could have them all back... so live it up.  Be free.  Be happy.  Do wild things.  Get naked, run through the rain, and just dance... and say Thank God, I'm young.

You shouldn't feel guilty, I truly think mental health is demonized in a way that it makes it seem so uncommon or that a person is wrong for their feelings. You're justified in how you feel, especially in this situation. Don't put yourself down over it. I would try to talk to someone if you have a good friend you trust or maybe even your parents if you feel that they would be understanding. Your partner is never a bad option, either. In addition to that, if you don't want to talk to people in your personal life, you can also reach out to professors, your advisors, TAs, etc. Just know you're not alone, there's so many people around you and friend/relationships to be made if you're open to the idea of it.

You don't always have to be living with passion, having fun, feeling happy, etc. It's okay to just be. Sometimes that means being bored or content or even dissatisfied.
