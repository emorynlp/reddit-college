      "text": "Because it's not really for everyone, sweetie.  College was never supposed to become four years of wild parties, hookups that you regret a week later, and spending Friday nights holding up your best friend's ombre rose gold hair after she's had way too much to drink.  \n\nIt's supposed to be a serious place of learning for those that truly want to be there and know what they want.  \n\nif 35-year-old millennials still don't know what they want to do, then how are 18-year-olds (18 is the new 13) going to know where they belong or what they are going to want to do for the next 82+ years?\n\nThere is enormous potential for the young people of today - \n\n**Millennials and Gen Z (iGen) are brilliant, they're more accepting of differences, they're very advanced**, they want to make a difference in this world, not just be in a job they hate waiting to get off of work and then wasting their nights on Reddit (no offense, reddit).\n\nHistorically, you've got it pretty good.  Coal miners, steel workers, and factory girls of the early 20th century were not stopping every 5 minutes to post selfies to their Instas and then tweeting about how adorbs Evelyn Nesbit looks in her YouTube videos (Google her, she was basically the Hottest Girl in the World before the Titanic sank).\n\nCollege was out of bounds and out of the realm of possibility for so many that can now go.  Marginalized groups are now welcomed.  Women can go to law school, something that was still considered very new for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Professors (hopefully) are not asking their female law students for cookie recipes, assuming that they are only there to meet a husband and then move to Darien, Connecticut and have three boys to follow in Daddy's footsteps at the firm in Manhattan.\n\nAnyway, here's one thing you can do to make yourself less unhappy at college:\n\nGo for a nice walk to clear your head... Maybe you'll see something that'll make your day better.  Or meet someone that will change your life somehow.  Don't look for just hot people.  That old guy that looks like a werewolf and lives behind the dumpsters?  He served in the Vietnam War... Learn something from him.  When he was 18, he didn't have the privilege to do anything but die for his country.  That he made it out alive of the jungles of hell was a miracle.  His buddies were all dead now, and when he got back home, he wasn't given a patriotic welcome home parade like his dad was in World War II.  He was spit on, thrown into a mental asylum, and could not get hired anywhere.  And now, after giving his youth (and his left leg) to his country, he's thanked for it by sleeping next to the campus dump which smells like used condoms (and I'll let your imagination run wild with how awful that stinks).  \n\nI'd reckon to say that at 18, you might not really know what life is all about... 18 year old guys are really horny - and so I imagine that unless you don't have a high sex drive, you're probably spending most of your time in the campus library wondering what the girl in the table across from you looks like without any clothes on.  It's okay.  You're young, you're at your sexual peak... it's okay to basically just want to spend the next four years banging every girl you see.... and no, you don't need to know what you want to do.\n\nJust enjoy being young, dude... it doesn't last forever.  Before you know it, you'll look back on those years (18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23....) and wish you could have them all back... so live it up.  Be free.  Be happy.  Do wild things.  Get naked, run through the rain, and just dance... and say Thank God, I'm young.  I have my whole life ahead of me... and I feel so ***alive***.",

I think counseling may help and many universities offer a certain amount of sessions for free through their mental health services. You shouldn't feel guilty, I truly think mental health is demonized in a way that it makes it seem so uncommon or that a person is wrong for their feelings. You're justified in how you feel, especially in this situation. Don't put yourself down over it. I would try to talk to someone if you have a good friend you trust or maybe even your parents if you feel that they would be understanding. Your partner is never a bad option, either. In addition to that, if you don't want to talk to people in your personal life, you can also reach out to professors, your advisors, TAs, etc. Just know you're not alone, there's so many people around you and friend/relationships to be made if you're open to the idea of it. If you ever want to talk, my DMs are open. I hope you find what you need to feel better. (:",

You don't always have to be living with passion, having fun, feeling happy, etc. It's okay to just be. Sometimes that means being bored or content or even dissatisfied. You don't need to feel guilty for not enjoying it. You have plenty of time to figure out what is missing from your life and take care of it.",

Equally, having a partner that you are keeping out of convenience or just to have a partner can be draining as well. It\u2019s okay to be with someone even when you know it will end (if its mutual) because it makes you happy, but you aren\u2019t happy. Taking classes because they are required does kind of suck but try to think about how to apply the skills you learn in class in a practical manner (this helped me). Lastly, learn a new recipe every week. It doesn\u2019t have to be hard but one new healthy snack can go a long way. That\u2019s 52 recipes in a year thus 52 more options to choose from.\n\nThere\u2019s no formula for being happy but if you\u2019re unhappy, you won\u2019t get anywhere by having everything stay the same. You have to make changes, even if they\u2019re scary, to find something better.",

My plans are to move out of the country and go to graduate school in Europe if things work out. If they don't, I personally know people who have studied history and make great money with just an undergrad degree. Is it probable that everyone who studies history and only has a bachelor's will get such a great job? Not at all. But that's most majors nowadays, anyways. Also, people *really* tend to ignore the fact that degrees in humanities give you *so* many skills. My writing skills are above those of my friends who are in STEM fields, I have great critical-thinking skills, and I can communicate fairly well. Do I know what the hell a derivative is or how the hell to use a graphing calculator? Nope. But most STEM majors can't give you an extensive history into the conversion of Greek temples into Christian churches and then finally into mosques during the height of the Muslim Empires. Your skills set and knowlege comes from what you study, and you might as well do something you enjoy because it's likely you'll be working on that for the rest of your life.",

Personally, my brain is just more aligned with humanities. Today I have studied probably anywhere from 4-5 hours for a test I'm taking tomorrow and it really wasn't all that bad because I genuinely like the subject. That feeling of not knowing where you're going or what you're doing is terrifying and depressing, but I really think following your passion is worth it, and the money will follow anyways. I'm not sad thinking about my future in history even though it's likely I'll make less money than most other people or that I may not have an easy time finding a job.

If not, then that's cool, too. It's all about perspective and the goals people have planned for their own life. But I do agree that people should be upfront about their intentions from the beginning.

      "text": "That is such a crazy confusing time. I just want you to know you're not alone and feeling that way especially in that age range. You've just spent years of high school, middle school, elementary school, and any extra curricular activities with routines and structured days. Now that you have free time outside of school and you're structuring your own time it's very different. A lot of people also think going to college is then going to magically help you figure out what you want. That's not always the case, you can be indecisive on college majors without realizing it, or subconsciously anxious about career paths, etc.... I remember feeling so similar in college and my depression going through the roof. All I can really suggest is counseling if you have the opportunity to do so, scheduling in at least one fun class, making sure you are forming semi healthy habits (realistic sleep schedules, realistic exercise plans, realistic food/meal plans, realistic party/recreation limits, and healthy Social circles) for your health, and using your free time to actually relax and decompress instead of just sitting still and disassociating. When you take time off to relax, try a bullet journal, a mood tracking app, or just thinking about how your week has gone well or sideways, or anything else that helps you reflect on your educational/professional/personal life so that you get it out of the way before you start trying to relax and settle in.",
