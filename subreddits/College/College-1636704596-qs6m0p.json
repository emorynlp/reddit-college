      "text": "I do t think you should go to school for something g unless your sure you know what you want. It\u2019s a huge commitment and just picking some random thing for $150,000 isnt the best move. You should talk about your options with a school councillor and attend  the open house for the college/uni your looking into and ask about the major you have interest in. \n\nI think taking a year or two off after highschool should be more normalized then it is. Most kids don\u2019t know who they are or what they want yet. They go from needing to ask to go to the bathroom in highschool to jumping into a $40,000 loan into a university studying something they don\u2019t know what to do with.",

      "text": "Too many choices leaves us paralyzed. Pick something you\u2019re interested in, that you can tolerate, and has good marketability, and just go with it. No major will check all of your boxes so decide what\u2019s really important to you. Good critical thinking, writing, communication skills are marketable and those can be developed in the humanities. So marketability is more than just business and stem degrees",

      "text": "Economics probably wont open a ton of doors imo. Its not like a business major, its more of an academic and theoretical discipline. Sure its more generalizable than a bio degree, but its also hard in its own right (calculus). Speaking as a prehealth person who tried doing econ \u201cas a backup\u201d, I ended up just majoring in bio because it made my life a lot easier. Plus upper level econ is fucking hard.",
