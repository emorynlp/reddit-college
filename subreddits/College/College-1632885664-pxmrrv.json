I go to a public university and pay about 15K for tuition and 18K for dorm and meal plan a year. My classes are all very boring and the amount of work is a joke. I have an insane amount of free time and have yet to make any friends. I just feel like this is a huge waste of money. I have taken a math course from Harvard Extension in the past that cost $900 and was far more interesting and challenging than my current courses. I am just wondering why I should be paying almost 2K a course and spend 18k on dorm and food when I could have that for much cheaper at home and live more comfortably. I realize this post is a bit pessimistic but as someone with social anxiety that will probably never enjoy the college experience I don't really see the point, especially as a CS major.  \n\nDo you guys think I should drop out and do a program through an online university or just self study from home until I get enough money to move out?", "author": "No-Arrival-7380", "created": 1632885664, "retrieved": 1632945403, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
