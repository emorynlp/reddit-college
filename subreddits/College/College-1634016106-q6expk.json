  "text": "I used to live in Europe and completed majority of high school there. I missed a lot of information for 3 years because I never knew the language well and I barley got by. Now I'm thinking to go to college or university after waiting 2 years after graduating high school to experience it while working on my programming career. I'm worried I'll be behind and it will be hard. I'm thinking of going into economics, business or possibly engineering as I really like creating things. Will I learn as I go along? Will I just get confused the day I start?",
