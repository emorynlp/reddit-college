Biology I took in high school but chemistry I did not, and I heard it's super hard. It's not that I expect college to be easy but I genuinely don't know if I'd even be able to pass it. I'm considering it in general because I'm worried that the major I'm studying for right now (Journalism + Poli Sci both of which I'm good at, I'm a freshman but this is my plan) will leave me without a job or something because it's not STEM.

There are plenty of jobs out there that have nothing to do with STEM.  So, if you don't truly think you're interested in a STEM major and career, then I advise you to choose a different path.  It's true that STEM classes and degrees are challenging, but they will be even more challenging if you truly have little or not interest in the subject matter.\n\nWith regard to college chemistry, it's true that plenty of students do find it to be a difficult class, and in my experience a major cause of that is because their high school chemistry classes were not as rigorous as they should have been (for example, because of staffing shortages, their chemistry teacher was the basketball coach who had no degree in chemistry or science at all, etc).  So, if you've literally never had any chemistry class, then you'll probably find college chemistry challenging.  The material itself takes some getting used to, but another major factor is the fact that college chemistry classes move at a greater speed compared to high school classes.\n\nSummary: if you've never had chemistry before, you could very well find college chemistry to be difficult.  But you're certainly not the first student in the history of the human race who is considering taking college chemistry without ever having had the subject before.  Thousands of students all over the world pass college chemistry every semester, and you can too; you'll simply have to focus and work harder and be more diligent about keeping up with the material than some of your classmates who have already had a lot of the material to one degree or another in high school.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632425675, "upvotes": 5}}}
