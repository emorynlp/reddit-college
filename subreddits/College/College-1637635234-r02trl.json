  "text": "I\u2019m a first year college student straight out of high school. I moved away from my home town to go to college. My home town is small and I\u2019ve lived there my whole life. I went to school with the same people from elementary to high school. \n\nI live on my own not in dorms or anything and I\u2019m finding it really difficult and lonely. I\u2019ve struggled with anxiety and depression all my life but it\u2019s at and all time high now that I\u2019m by myself. I struggle with procrastinating and it\u2019s causing me a large amount of stress and anxiety to the point I have panic attacks. I can\u2019t seem to stop doing it even though it hurts me so much.\n\nI guess my question is do you have any tips to help with anxiety, stress, depression, loneliness,and procrastination?",
