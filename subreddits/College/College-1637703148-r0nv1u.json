  "text": "Hi there, I\u2019m a soon to be college student and have been having some trouble deciding what to major in.\n\nI know that i can\u2019t go wrong with any of these majors but i\u2019m sort of leaning towards whichever is easier to attain a high gpa in for. \n\nMy goal is to possibly try to for med school while having a good backup degree incase I realize i don\u2019t want to do med anymore or if it doesn\u2019t work out for me.\n\nI\u2019m also wondering which degree is more entrepreneurial as well? Like i know with CS i can possibly create my own software or website or something, but what about with mech eng? Could i start my own eng firm or something? \n\nI\u2019m also aware that a Mech eng can always learn code but a cs major can\u2019t be a mech eng\n\nAnyways any info is appreciated",

      "text": "It kinda seems like you are considering majors that you know lead into high paying jobs and not picking a major based on what you're passionate about. Don't make that mistake. Think about what you actually enjoy and base your decision off of that.\n\nI'm currently a mech major and we do a little bit of coding but no where near what I assume CS majors are doing. If you enjoy the design and build process and are fine with doing a little math, mech is a great major, but if not you definitely want to look elsewhere.",

If you have to go talk to people in industry for a better idea go and do that.",
