  "text": "How much fluctuation have you observed in \"time spent studying\" vs result?\n\nI've been very confused, because I often spend a lot of time, but I don't still perform ultimately best based on this. It's easy but naive view that time spent would lead to best result then.\n\nThus suggesting (as others may have also observed) that performance is not attained linearly by increasing time.",

      "text": "I definitely agree with the idea that more time \u2260 better performance. Of course you need to spend time studying in order to do well on assignments, but you may need to consider that your studying methods are not effective. For example, a lot of students come into freshman year thinking that they will be able to study by reading and memorizing their textbook/ notes. This is ineffective and honestly tedious. It is so much more worth your time to do application problems related to the content or trying to explain the content to another person as if you are teaching them the same thing you learned in lecture. When you do these things without directly looking at your notes, you are going to be much more honest with yourself and it\u2019ll allow you to take a hard look at what you know versus what you really don\u2019t have a solid understanding on and need to practice more. Furthermore, studies have shown that studying for continuously long periods of time is difficult and not realistic when it comes to retaining information. It is better to study \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d. In other words, study for a half hour or so, then take a break to do something that stimulates your mind in another way, like cooking, drawing, or taking your dog for a walk. If you want to learn more about effective learning, I would suggest looking up the ideas of metacognition. Finally, you may find that having a study group helps you to be more motivated and focused towards studying (this may not be for everyone).  DO NOT CRAM. It won\u2019t work in a high level class. \n\nSource: I am a pre-med student who has taken rigorous courses including O Chem and these studying tips helped me perform well in those classes. I hope this helps!!",
