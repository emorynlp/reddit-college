  "text": "I don\u2019t mean this to sound pretentious or arrogant and I\u2019m sorry if it comes off that way. I\u2019m in community college right now and am planning on transferring to a four year soon. I\u2019m a filmmaker but don\u2019t want to major in film. I want to transfer to a four year to have flexibility if I ever consider a master\u2019s degree, but at the same time don\u2019t want a super rigorous course load. I\u2019m also interested in stimulating and deep discussions, both socially and academically. How can I find a school that fits my needs? I\u2019m worried that I can\u2019t find a campus culture with students who are intellectually driven but without the rigor of a prestigious school.  Basically, how can I determine if an \u201caverage school\u201d so to speak has like minded people?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "How do you define \"rigor?\" Most of the time, \"rigor\" equates to \"makes students think\" and so students who are intellectually driven tend to self select into rigorous schools/majors. \n\nHowever, maybe you're looking for a more \"alternative\" type school? Like Hampshire College maybe? From Wikipedia:\n\n> The college is known for its alternative curriculum, self-directed academic concentrations, progressive politics, focus on portfolios rather than distribution requirements, and its reliance on narrative evaluations instead of grades and GPAs. Sixty-five percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and a quarter have founded their own business or organization.[4] Alumni include recipients of the Pulitzer Prize; the National Humanities Medal; Emmy, Academy, Peabody, Tony and Grammy Awards; and MacArthur and Guggenheim Fellowships. The college is also among the top producers of Fulbright Students and of alumni who go on to earn a doctorate degree.[5][6]",

Just because a school is \u201caverage\u201d does not mean there are no students that are dedicated and able to hold a \u201cstimulating and deep discussion.\u201d It all just depends on who you choose to surround yourself with.",
