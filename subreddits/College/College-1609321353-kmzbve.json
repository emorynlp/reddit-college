  "text": "So I don\u2019t know why this came to mind but even if classes were to come back in fall, it\u2019d feel just so bittersweet bc nothing would really feel the same. It\u2019s crazy to think I\u2019m going to be a senior by then when really I feel like a sophomore still. And something to analogize this is when people that go to jail for awhile are released, they often times still act the age that they were when they first entered.\n\nMy best guess is that classes will be hybrid if anything, and with different strains coming out and what not there really is just too much uncertainty. All I know it\u2019s just gonna be hard to adjust and even though I hate online classes with a passion, I\u2019m just dreading creating a new routine and getting used to new things again. \n\nAnd I actually caught covid recently and am experiencing the what the virus has to offer lol, so I\u2019m not even necessarily scared of catching it again or whatever. At least with going to classes I\u2019ll get to maybe meet and talk to new people again, but really I\u2019m just anxious about how things will be and the change that\u2019s going to take place again.",

I have three in-person classes this upcoming semester and I\u2019m excited to not be holed up in my dorm room or in the library during online classes.",

They never experienced it in person and the expectations (I'm assuming) would be a bit higher compared to the first year. There will be alot going on, getting use to the environment, the way of teaching I'd assume is different and TIME MANAGEMENT. We are getting use to not waking up early to get ready and commute to and from college/university. Not saying that its going to be an easier for the rest of the students. \n\nI honestly have mixed emotions about all of this. Both ways of teaching have the pros and cons.\n\nWish all of you the best, stay strong and hang in there!!",

Normally, I say that phrase with affection because I [generally] love the south. I love the landscape, I love the wide variety of opportunities in the outdoors, [most] of the people here are decent enough... However, the vast majority of people within my state don't take this seriously. At all. Many people are saying they won't take the vaccine, they throw a bitch fit about masks, etc, etc. Someone in my college subreddit was even asking when we were gonna start *loosening* COVID restrictions since we now have the vaccine. Which is, all in all, not a reasonable question because all current estimates say it will take *at least* a year to get everyone all vaccinated and for things to *start* to go back to normal.\n\nI'm pretty worried about my classmates being dumbasses and me getting sick as a result. I'm hoping my professors let us Zoom/Teams in for all lectures and then I'll only need to attend my labs in the flesh.",

I'm only a freshman, so I don't know what normal in person classes are like, but it was still pretty cool. \n\nMy only hybrid class was Calc 1 last quarter.
