      "text": "I'd probably just try you luck by emailing any of your proffesors and see if any of them can give you an extension or something. The worst they can say is no and I assume you have a doctors note. \n\nOther than that there is really nothing else to say except just grind everything out. Maybe prioritize which assignments you feel you can get done in time or are worth more of your grade. It may help if you know anybody in the class to help fill you in.",
