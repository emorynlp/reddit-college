For that reason, I don\u2019t want to go to college, but I don\u2019t know what I would do without it. Any tips/help?",

Community college, trade schools, etc. are great options to get a stable, well-paying career without the unhealthy level of stress.\n\nEdit: And you can always go back later to get the college degree if you want it once you figure out your goals and plans more. It's never too late.",

      "text": "When I graduated from high school I took a semester off and just worked for a bit. I then went to the community college in my town because I didn\u2019t feel ready to go to a four year school. I honestly recommend community college to everyone because it\u2019s the best way to go if you don\u2019t know what you want to do or study. Also the courses prepare you for when you go off to college and they are challenging but not too overwhelming. I also struggle a lot with anxiety and I started off going to community college part time to ease into it and now I\u2019m full time and it\u2019s going okay. Just take it slow and do what you are most comfortable with. It\u2019s easy to feel anxious when all of your friends are going away to school, but it\u2019s not for everyone and there are so many paths one can take even without a college degree.",

      "text": "ok. i was in the exact same boat, especially after quarantine. but I\u2019m genuinely saying that college isn\u2019t that bad. i HIGHLY recommend going to a JC, it eases you into the sort of curriculum nicely (personally it did for me). Honestly college stress is pretty intense but if you just do the work it dies down- and if you take easy professors ur golden. If u end up not going, there r also many jobs that don\u2019t need a college degree. But JC was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made\u2026 highly recommend!!!",

      "text": "I would recommend to take a year off for before going to college so you can see where you are in another year. I\u2019m a new college student and I wish I could\u2019ve taken another year off. I don\u2019t handle stress well and I recently had a breakdown and now I feel like I can\u2019t do anything and now I\u2019m struggling with schoolwork. It\u2019s completely fine if you don\u2019t immediately go to college. College will always be there and your health and your mental state matters more.",
