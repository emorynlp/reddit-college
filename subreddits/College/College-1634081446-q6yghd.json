  "text": "\n\n\nI recently started a semester at a local community college and overall my professors are great, except for one. \n\n\nHe\u2019s my intro to IT profesor and I deemed it my most important course prior to starting it. \n\n\nThe profesor is an old man who is retired and has Parkinson\u2019s disease. There are times in class where he will stop talking and shake for a while, though he warns us about this and told us not to get alarmed, everyone still gets on edge from it. \n\n\nHe also starts all the zoom meetings late, I\u2019m currently waiting for him to start a meeting and it\u2019s been 20 minutes since the start time. He then takes 10 minutes to do attendance by role call instead of a poll or automatic. \n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t teach throughout the class, he just reminisces how technology used to be and how it has changed so much and that he needs his granddaughter to help him with his computer (not the best thing to hear from your IT professor) \n\n\nLast class and the one before he didn\u2019t teach a single thing. He only went through his emails and told us which of the students homework\u2019s he has received or didn\u2019t. The rest of the time was one of the students going on about how her computer doesn\u2019t work and a ton of students were just talking back and forth about that. \n\n\nIt\u2019s intensely frustrating. My girlfriend says I should be happy I have an easy class that doesn\u2019t assign much homework or require a ton of attention, but I really wanted to learn something in this class and it\u2019s difficult with a professor who doesn\u2019t teach. Is there anything I could do?",
