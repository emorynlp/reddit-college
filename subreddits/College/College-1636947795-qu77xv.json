  "text": "So I'm a 18(M) coming close to finishing my first semester and I thought college would be a lot more crazy then it was. I go to a state school and have had a fair amount of alcohol instances however they were more of small hangouts, rather than parties. I went to one party on Halloween but there was no alc in there. I also haven't HU with anyone since it never felt like the right place. Is this normal? \n\nBtw: Double major in finance and Business Information Systems, but classes aren't really TOO hard.",

And don\u2019t HU (or just keep it on the low) Bc it\u2019ll be the word on the street for quite a bit if some people find out. Shoot, people will prob still remember even after you graduated from what I\u2019ve heard.",

      "text": "hi! so im 19 (F) your first semester sounds a lot like mine was last year lol. honestly it just depends one the people you\u2019re friends with. like this year ive only been to one frat party and barely done anything but ive got some of the best friends ive had in my life. there\u2019s not a set way college is supposed to be so honestly just go with the flow (ik thats hard) but its more important to have people you actually enjoy being around because you will get burnt out so fast if you\u2019re hanging around people just to get drunk or hook up. i ended up having to go home multiple times bc my mental health was so shitty. moral of this is, yes, what your experiencing is 100% normal and actually probably a lot more than people around you are experiencing.",

      "text": "Meh, the best times I've had getting fucked up were with only a few people, in my late 20's and early 30's. \n\n18 is very much still young. As I attend college at 32 with 18 year olds, being 18 is not an adult. I don't mean this to be an asshole, it's just the truth. 18 year olds are very much still childish in ways. Not all of them. I've met some pretty well rounded 18 year olds. \n\nI've also met quite a few that still have 'teething' habits. There's a kid in my phys lab that was chewing on the top of his mask then later had the end of a fucking hard stick pushing on his lips with it. That shit is so dirty. \n\nI'd say hang in there. Don't expect everything right away. And for the love of whatever god you do or don't believe in, be careful around alcohol. You can fucking die from that shit man.",
