  "text": "Currently I\u2019m a freshman in computer engineering. However I just don\u2019t really feel it, I guess what I thought computer engineering was wasn\u2019t what I thought it\u2019d be. I really like design 3D models, drawing and business stuff. So other people stated go and maybe switch to a business course but some people also state that it\u2019s better to just start a business and learn from there. So I\u2019m kinda lost. Not to mention I\u2019m not really good in math however I did have fun in accounting classes back in high school compared to our math class and our chem classes for computer engineering sucks since I took up biology in high school. So any advice?",

      "text": ">  I did have fun in accounting classes\n\nI very rarely hear people describe accounting classes as \"fun\" so maybe that's a sign you should switch. Accounting doesn't really require math skills beyond the basics whereas the engineering fields do, which might also be a sign you should go that route if you don't consider yourself a \"math person.\"",
