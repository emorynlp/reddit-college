  "title:": "2 students died due to stress in online class.",
  "text": "Hi, during last 48 hours prior to this post 2 students from the same institute as mine died due to overloaded stress,and from what i can gather ,the only responds towards this issue from our university is \"contact counsellor\" as if our counsellor can help us do the task, or answering our exams and test, we were also not subjected to study week and were expected to submit our assignment during finals,the management didn't even bet an eye to the students who died which btw from different course but same cause of death.I had similar symptoms of insomnia due to finishing assignment and anxiety caused by this online classes,my mental health starts to deteriorate and i constantly having severe headache from time to time now. I am considering to drop out of school since my university won't allow major change nor dropping of subjects. I just want justice to be served and for someone to stand up for these students as the lecturers and management kept saying \"do not let this goes viral\"\n\nCause of death: \nThe post mortems said exploded arteries in part of the brain causes bleeding(hemorrhaging),this happen to both of them,the students were said to be lacking in sleep and rest  and were in state of hypertension\n\nFor additional reading and reference:\nhttps://twitter.com/bernamadotcom/status/1414196851968921603?s=19\n\nhttps://twitter.com/saysdotcom/status/1414500140308520960?s=19\nUpdate:\nUpper management respond:\n(Shortly,they dont even address the death,they only say they care abt student's mental health but proceed to say \"go to therapy session w our counsellor or take medication from our medical facilities\" knowing full well we don't even have time for ourselves let alone sessions w counselors and most student's are at home far from their medical facilities!!! I commented on the video saying they dont even address the issue,and the comments were turned off!)\nhttps://youtu.be/A5WQv3nQy38",

Maybe kids wont be so soft,when their ancestors literally killing the planets, taking all the wealth for themselves,and hoping the future generations to deal w their problems,maybe youngsters wont have such complicated problems on their day to day life and a better environment to live in if the \"old people\" dont fucking ruin everything,just maybe. Its weird how people died and you said things like this,maybe if u have nothing good to say,then stay silent.\n\nFor example, had to take on courses of how to reduce pollution,such as haze,oil dumping in the middle of ocean,green house gasses, ozone corrosion,acid rain, all because of excessive old people bidding,learn this difficult topic when i was still 12 and you think a 12 year olds now should have learn this in science subjects if old people didn't fuck us all up?",

      "text": "A perfectly healthy student at a young age should not be experiencing these problems even if they are undergoing a lot of stress. Are there any mentions of comorbidities or genetic diseases that may have predisposed them to 'rupturing an artery'? I am not taking any side, but I want to clarify that correlation do not equal causation. If you argue with your father and he dies of a heart attack, the argument did not cause the heart attack. But, it is the years of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that he had that eventually led up to that incident. I suspect those students may already have an aneurysm in their brain which is like a ticking time bomb if it is not treated",

      "text": "Condolences from the United States. Online has been extremely difficult and hard to adapt to. I remember being dean's list before online and getting C average in the first online semester and getting a D in physics. Online also overwhelmed me especially since I relied heavily on the help offered on campus and the opportunity to work with minimal distractions in the library or testing center. I'm going to try my hardest to never do online again as it's hurting our ability to learn and making things too stressful. I remember being in a ceaseless panic during the year... sometimes I thought I'd die of exhaustion. I think the universities need to start addressing the needs of their students and start making useful resources more accessible especially in online environments.",

Just because the father testified saying that his son stayed awake at night working on his schoolwork does not actually mean that it killed him. Correlation is not equal to causation.\n\n3. Logically think about how ridiculous it sounds to suggest that online classes killed him (\u201conline classes\u201d [which are not even mentioned in the article], caused stress which caused hemorrhaging. Therefore by transitive property, \u201conline classes killed him\u201d). Think about how many students from 2020 to now have been doing online school and think of how many have died from it. It\u2019s statistically insignificant. \n\n4. The article conveniently doesn\u2019t explore nor take into account the possibility of pre existing health conditions. For example, Asians have genetically smaller blood vessels. Leading to an increased likelihood of hypertension.",

          "text": "When I was in school I experienced burnout so bad that I thought I was going to have some sort of psychotic break. It ended with me almost fainting during class and being taken to the ER in an ambulance. All the teachers just brushed it off and said \u201cit\u2019s just anxiety, we see this a couple times every semester\u201d. \n\nI wasn\u2019t having a panic attack, I was 100% in control of my emotions when this happened. I just reached a point of exhaustion. With anxiety so normalized now I feel like people think they just call it that and be done with it. But anxiety or not, that kind of stuff has lasting damage. No one should be expected to just deal with it.",

The US colleges started historically as liberal arts institutions aiming to give students a broad knowledge. Later on the government began funding technical and agriculture focused schools as well as engineering programs. This forced a lot of US colleges to add those as well, but the general philosophy of giving a  breadth of education still remains. In most other countries the \u201cbroad Education\u201d part is seen as being done in highschool, and college is viewed as being for specialization and they don\u2019t have things like Gen Ed  requirements. You just take the classes related to your major. Because of this the Intro major classes are a lot harder since they assume more prior knowledge in your subject gained in highschool compared to the US. Whereas US curriculums are designed such that you could have never studied your major before freshman year and still succeed in it.",
