I am considering to drop out of school since my university won't allow major change nor dropping of subjects. I just want justice to be served and for someone to stand up for these students as the lecturers and management kept saying \"do not let this goes viral\"\n\nCause of death: \nThe post mortems said exploded arteries in part of the brain causes bleeding(hemorrhaging),this happen to both of them,the students were said to be lacking in sleep and rest  and were in state of hypertension\n\nFor additional reading and reference:\nhttps://twitter.com/bernamadotcom/status/1414196851968921603?s=19\n\nhttps://twitter.com/saysdotcom/status/1414500140308520960?s=19\nUpdate:\nUpper management respond:\n(Shortly,they dont even address the death,they only say they care abt student's mental health but proceed to say \"go to therapy session w our counsellor or take medication from our medical facilities\" knowing full well we don't even have time for ourselves let alone sessions w counselors and most student's are at home far from their medical facilities!!! I commented on the video saying they dont even address the issue,and the comments were turned off!)\nhttps://youtu.be/A5WQv3nQy38", "author": "Educational_Area_750", "created": 1625978906, "retrieved": 1632802034, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1300, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"h5i1qu6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ohy1qn/2_students_died_due_to_stress_in_online_class/h5i1qu6/", "text": "Kids are so soft nowadays", "author": "Lost_Character_5840", "created": 1626515836, "upvotes": 1}, "h4wa95v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ohy1qn/2_students_died_due_to_stress_in_online_class/h4wa95v/", "text": "A perfectly healthy student at a young age should not be experiencing these problems even if they are undergoing a lot of stress. Are there any mentions of comorbidities or genetic diseases that may have predisposed them to 'rupturing an artery'?

But, it is the years of hypertension and hyperlipidemia that he had that eventually led up to that incident.

Online has been extremely difficult and hard to adapt to. I remember being dean's list before online and getting C average in the first online semester and getting a D in physics.

I'm going to try my hardest to never do online again as it's hurting our ability to learn and making things too stressful. I remember being in a ceaseless panic during the year... sometimes I thought I'd die of exhaustion.
