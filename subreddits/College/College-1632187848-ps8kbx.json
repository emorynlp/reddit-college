  "title:": "Getting through seminar classes in university?",
  "text": " Those seminars where we are expected to talk on the spot that lasts almost 3 hours. I am a university student in a seminar class in third year and it is already hell. There are 20 students in the class, and the whole class just involves us talking and arguing/criticizing ideas. Basically, it is the extroverts dominating the conversation. Every time I try and talk, I feel the thoughts slowly disappearing from my brain once I'm put on the spot. And I feel like I always talk very fast and don't have anything really intelligible to add. I feel like I talk jargon. Others in the class speak for 1-2 minutes straight very fluently and they express their ideas clearly. I don't even know how it is possible. Today I forced myself to speak twice, and I only said a few sentences. And that is still major progress for me (which my prof isn't even aware of). So I will still get a bad grade because I only talked twice which is a lot better than not talking at all. Anyone else feel like words completely slip them and they don't know how to talk? This happens despite knowing my stuff and completing all of the readings before class.",

Maybe a solution could be emailing the professor later with your ideas on the matter. I have friends who do that for similar reasons.",
