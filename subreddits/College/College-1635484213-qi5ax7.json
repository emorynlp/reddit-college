  "text": "Every day feels the same. I wake up, go to class, eat, go to the gym, and do homework/study, then sleep. Then wake up and do it again. I\u2019m so slammed by work that I have very little time to do the things I enjoy. Now that the novelty of college has worn off I feel absolutely miserable most of the time. It feels like I\u2019m reliving the same day over and over again most of the time and I have very little if anything to look forward to. Is there anything I can do to reduce this feeling? Not feeling very good so far.",

Social life is abysmal at CC.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found working so far is keeping my weekends free of anything school-related. I usually take myself to random places to fill the boredom.",

Arrange a movie night or something like that since that would take like 2 hours and be a nice time to chill. Knowing you have a break planned at the same time every week, you can try to get everything done a slight bit earlier so you can have that fun time.",
