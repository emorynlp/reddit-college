  "title:": "Why would you flirt with a professor/has anyone noticed sexual harassment of a professor?",
  "text": "I'm in a freshman level class where the ages range from 18-20. Our professor is fresh out of his doctorate (28-29) and many of the girls in my class have a crush on him. I can never get into office hours because the same three girls are always there asking him weird questions, a bunch of girls pooled money to buy him a stuffed animal, and anytime I have to meet with someone outside of class, they just go on about how much they love his accent, and about how he's such an awesome professor, and some flat out gush about how cute he is. Some of them have started flirting with him in class, and you can tell it makes him uncomfortable, because sometimes it borders on sexual harassment. This makes me wonder why anyone would even flirt with professor. It's not illegal, but there's an obvious power imbalance. Additionally, the professor may not have any way to address this. It puts him in an unfair position, and it's pretty awkward for everyone involved. Has anyone noticed a situation like this before, and how was it handled?",

      "text": "As a prof, I've had young/attractive male colleagues who've faced exactly the same thing, and yes, it made them incredibly uncomfortable. There's a difficult double standard here; it's perceived by many to be a compliment if a man receives that kind of attention, while really, if it's unwelcome it IS sexual harassment every bit as much as it would be with a woman. \n\nThe problem is that there's not much you as a student can do, unless you feel comfortable speaking to the girls in question. As a prof I've called out students I've heard talking like that about male professors and pointed out the double standard, but I can do that a little more easily.",

Just say that you have noticed some inappropriate behavior among some of the other students in your class toward the professor, and that it\u2019s negatively impacting your learning experience and making the professor uncomfortable. I\u2019d be worried the professor could receive backlash since it puts him in an awkward position. However, if they are taking up all his office hours and he isn\u2019t doing anything about it, then maybe he should receive some kind of admonishment.",

Since a student would be the one bringing it up to them now, he could possibly get in trouble for not addressing it. If OP decides to tell them \u201cThis professor feels uncomfortable\u201d they might ask why he didn\u2019t say anything sooner. Do you get what I\u2019m saying? I don\u2019t want him to get in trouble, but it might happen either way. I\u2019ve seen stuff like this happen before. No matter what the teacher did, when those rumors started\u2026it didn\u2019t end well for them. It\u2019s better that the professor is the one to say \u201cHey I feel like I\u2019m being harassed. What steps should I take?\u201d rather than a student bring up anything that could be misconstrued.",

Most men, especially ones with a power dynamic like student-professor, would not want to even say anything for fear that they are misconstrued themselves. Just to be clear, I'm not denying that there are plenty of men that will abuse that power dynamic, but if you're not you don't want to even be associated with the idea of it.",

If he doesn\u2019t, then he may be fine, but that doesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t start to talk about how weird this is. \n\nIt\u2019s up to OP whether they want to get involved or not. I\u2019m of the opinion that the professor should\u2019ve taken care of this by putting up some barriers between him and his students. Whether that\u2019s telling them \u201cHey, please only use office hours for serious questions\u201d or going to higher ups to figure out this situation. It doesn\u2019t matter to me what they do.

I've come across very similar situations during high school as well as junior college and even thinking about these incidents makes me feel so uncomfortable.\n\nIn my highschool, a 24 y/o M teacher had joined in and the way girls flocked round him was outright indecent. The worst part is he seemed to enjoy all the attention he received. Things escalated to such an extent that he was caught taking some of his female students to bars for *benefits, which ultimately resulted in his expulsion from the school. These girls were merely 15 y/o. Pathetic. Most of us avoided this person and we were lucky enough that he didn't take any classes in our batch.\n\nWe had a Prof in my college who was always surrounded by girls who wanted to clear their *academic doubts*. The girls found it a pleasure it seems but the prof did not. He left the institution after a few months. To even think about all this sickens me. The students who do this should be ashamed and have some moral sense not to invade someone's comfort zone/privacy. Same goes for an elder who's in charge of teaching students and not using them for other reasons.",

I\u2019ve had some attractive professors before, but never have I (or any classmates that I was aware of) start flirting with them. They\u2019re acting inappropriate and should really know better by now. The professors are doing their job, and deserve to not be sexually harassed in the workplace.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable with it, you could pull him aside and suggest he file a complaint with Title IX office. He might be on the fence about going or not, but if a student speaks up and says they\u2019re uncomfortable with the situation too, he may be convinced to seek assistance with the issue. \n\nThe girls would likely get reassigned to another class with a different professor. My bf (student) and a few other classmates had an issue with this one kid in their group asking them all kinds of awkward sexually charged or personal questions, and he ended up getting reassigned to another class immediately and the Title IX eval process itself happened a little later.\n\nYou should show up to an office hour and say you need to talk to him and if they make a stink then tell them it\u2019s a private conversation that\u2019s actually academics related so they need to gtfo. If you feel comfortable you can also call them out on being weirdos every time they do it, in class or out of class.\n\nThe fact that you can\u2019t even get an office hour because of these immature brats is incredibly ridiculous.",
