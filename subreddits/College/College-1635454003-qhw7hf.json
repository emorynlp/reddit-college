  "text": "I'm in a freshman level class where the ages range from 18-20. Our professor is fresh out of his doctorate (28-29) and many of the girls in my class have a crush on him. I can never get into office hours because the same three girls are always there asking him weird questions, a bunch of girls pooled money to buy him a stuffed animal, and anytime I have to meet with someone outside of class, they just go on about how much they love his accent, and about how he's such an awesome professor, and some flat out gush about how cute he is. Some of them have started flirting with him in class, and you can tell it makes him uncomfortable, because sometimes it borders on sexual harassment. This makes me wonder why anyone would even flirt with professor. It's not illegal, but there's an obvious power imbalance. Additionally, the professor may not have any way to address this. It puts him in an unfair position, and it's pretty awkward for everyone involved. Has anyone noticed a situation like this before, and how was it handled?",

      "text": "As a prof, I've had young/attractive male colleagues who've faced exactly the same thing, and yes, it made them incredibly uncomfortable. There's a difficult double standard here; it's perceived by many to be a compliment if a man receives that kind of attention, while really, if it's unwelcome it IS sexual harassment every bit as much as it would be with a woman. \n\nThe problem is that there's not much you as a student can do, unless you feel comfortable speaking to the girls in question. As a prof I've called out students I've heard talking like that about male professors and pointed out the double standard, but I can do that a little more easily.",
