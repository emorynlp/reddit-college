  "title:": "I got a zero in a core class, am I screwed?",
  "text": "Long story short, I was in the military a couple years ago and I thought I could handle a class in the middle of a training cycle. I ended up spending most my time training in the field with limited access to electronics. Completely neglecting my class and resulting in a F with a grade of zero. If I retake it is the grade completely replace or is it averaged out? Even if I do retake it are my dreams of being college educated screwed over me being a clown? Honestly I get some much anxiety thinking about it, I was so dumb and unorganized then.",

I retook classes, got As in others, ultimately ended up transferring to a prestigious CA public uni, and now have internship offers from also prestigious companies.\n\nYou will be fine. Just don't take an online class during another NTC/JRTC rotation yeah?",

Its especially true in things like STEM, a class like Organic Chemistry has a 40% failure rate here and the professor even tells people day one about it.",
