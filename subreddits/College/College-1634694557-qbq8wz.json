  "title:": "Completely flopped my webdesign 2 class after so much effort.",
  "text": "I was a semester shy from graduating but of course i had to have the most nihilistic professor for my last semester this fall.  I explained to him that my webdesign class only dipped our toes on simple terminology, function ,elements and tags. His \"level 2\" class as he likes to call it is so advanced that it feels more like a webdesign 3 class instead. I studied 4 hours additionally aside from the course lectures and still wasnt able to get my code functioning properly for his requirements and assignements. Even worse, i tried to get a hold of tutoring but my college is currently out of webdesign tutors. This blows! Any references to better learning is appreciated.",
