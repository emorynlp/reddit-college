  "title:": "Professor gave me a 0 on a test for emailing her a question.",
  "text": "I was taking an exam for a resourcing class which was open book. I had put the wrong choice for a question and wanted to change it however, the test did not allow back tracking so I took a screenshot of the question I had put wrong and emailed the professor after the exam asking if I could change the answer to this question. \n\nAfter some time, my professor emailed me saying I was given a 0 for taking a screenshot of the question and being on an electronic device.\n\nThis makes the class extremely difficult for me to pass as I need a 100 on the final exam and 100 on all other assignments now to pass with a 70 average for the class. \n\nI am confused on why I was given a 0. The test was online and open book so I would have to be using my computer. I took a screenshot for her to know which question I was referring to. I can\u2019t cheat because it\u2019s an open book test. If I was cheating I wouldn\u2019t be dumb enough to have went to the professor. \n\nFailing this class would put me a year back as I cannot progress in my program without it. I\u2019m wondering what I can do to appeal this?",

          "text": "You have to consider that to a prof, taking a picture of exam questions = students are sharing the exam with others. That\u2019s why they don\u2019t typically* give you the hard copy tests back, usually just your scantron and maybe they go over the questions missed next class. Academic integrity has always been a policy. Also, online tests where you cant go back after submitting an answer has been a thing since like atleast 2009-10. I can remember them being set up that way. Regardless, college can be a bit of a culture shock for people who come in thinking it\u2019s gonna be similar to high school. It\u2019s a harsh lesson, sure. But OP\u2019s scenario is not new nor is it something to accommodate due to covid. Sorry - thats just what I know to be true as both a college student and having worked in higher education the last five years.",

With these online tests, professors will tell that you cannot use a mobile device, take pictures of the test, etc. but how would they know? they don\u2019t. Unless, a student does what you did and uses a mobile device and take pictures. Then he has a valid reason to give you a zero. You could be taking pictures of the exam and sending to other students; the professor doesn\u2019t know. That is why the professor has to punish you. Also, when the professor says \u201copen book\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean use your phone, web browser, etc. No, it means use the book and/or notes only. But, how would he know? he doesn\u2019t. Unless, someone does what you did.\n\nI\u2019m on the professors side, you should have not taken the picture. You should have just told them the question number in an email. If you go to the department or admins, they\u2019ll tell you the same thing. Rules are rules.",

You should've just got the answer wrong instead of emailing about one question, that's lowkey weird and dumb. \n\nWhat you should do, in my opinion, is ask the professor to give you a 50 on the exam. I'm studying education and this is apparently becoming popular in classrooms. By giving students a 50 or what ever failing grade (above a 25 normally I assume) you allow them to see that they failed but still bring their grade up to pass the class. If you get a 50 now and a 100 later you will have a 75, so you pass and are not set back a year, but you have major consequences still (a C which can affect your transcript). So, I say, ask the teacher to do something like this instead of knocking you out completely. If they can't do that, try to get the 100s. If you know you cant then try graduate a year late I guess. Sorry.",

The only proof is apparently a screenshot of the exam which absolutely should not have been taken.\n\nIf you jump the gun and take this to the higher ups (which is actually a terrible idea) they are going to investigate to see if those exam questions have been posted on any of the study share sites. They will also reach out to those sites to ask if you have ever been active on them and if so that could be enough for them to claim you intended to upload those answers even if you haven\u2019t posted them specifically (or if you have taken them down). Alternately, they would be justified in saying that what you did was equivalent to making an unauthorized copy of a paper version of the exam.\n\nPersonally I find this story hard to believe as it is presented here. You couldn\u2019t go back to change the answer but you were able to go back and take a screenshot of your answer? That doesn\u2019t make sense. I cannot think of a single online proctoring system that does not allow you to change your answers prior to submitting the exam. If you were unable to change your answer that means you confirmed/submitted the answer as final before realizing your mistake. In that case it is on you for not paying attention to the parameters of the exam procedure.\n\nMy conclusion based on what you have presented here is that you were taking screenshots of the questions as you were going along, or you were taking screen shots of the final review page prior to submitting the exam, which would violate 99% of academic integrity policies.\n\nAs someone who did undergrad and an MBA online I have done tons of online exams and this story absolutely does not add up. Either you are not being entirely truthful about the steps you took, you are not sharing the entirety of your professor\u2019s reply, or both. Personally I would apologize to the professor for not understanding the academic integrity policy, chalk it up as a lesson learned, be happy I wasn\u2019t being reported to the Dean, then move on.",

Otherwise, how would they have them?\n\nI\u2019m not privy to the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of Lockdown Browser but I\u2019m assuming it flags every time you do a mouseclick outside of the browser window or something. If OP was using a screen grabbing tool that means the instructor could see OP was clicking outside the window, right? And with what frequency, etc.? I\u2019m not naive enough to believe OP took a screenshot of just this one question.\n\nAlternately, if OP was taking the exam inside a VM as an attempt to bypass some of Lockdown Browser\u2019s functionality, providing a screenshot would demonstrate they were doing that (i.e., system didn\u2019t flag OP for clicking outside the browser but now they magically have a screenshot).",

I\u2019ll take physics 1 at my university for example. 5% is recitation attendance, 20% quizzes, 15% homework, 10% exam 1, 10% exam 2, 10% exam 3, 30% final (we had 4 midterms but the lowest is dropped). I think the main motivation for the professor for having such a large percentage of my grade be the final is because he sees it as such a culmination of what we learned. My 3D calc class was even \u201cworse\u201d in terms of having exams be a large part of my grade. 10% homework, 20% quizzes, 20% exam 1, 20% exam 2, 30% final. (I actually pulled up my past syllabuses for this, haha) As to why my professors do this, I\u2019m not sure, but these are all well-established introduction level courses that have been taught already for many years. As for my CS classes the theoretical CS class I\u2019m taking right now has 35% for each of the 2 midterms, and my computer systems class has a final worth 30%! Perhaps you are right that this is not necessarily the best way to access our knowledge in the course, but I think it\u2019s relatively standard for college classes to attribute a big portion of grades to exams.

With that said, mine are proctored and it explicitly states in the instructions (syllabus and exam page) that resources are allowed, such as handwritten notes, pdf textbook, and whatever resources I deem useful that I can show the proctor at the time I take the exam. However, I cannot browse the internet, talk to individuals during the exam, use electronics, or take screenshots. My tests are also not returned with my correct/incorrect answers. While the open book/notes format doesn\u2019t really quiz you on knowledge you know since you can look them up during the exam, the latter are to ensure the integrity of the testing process. They don\u2019t want their exam questions on quizlet, etc. \nThe violation was the screenshot, not that OPs had asked a question about changing an answer.

In a real-life exam room, you are allowed to show the professor your exam if you have a specific question. The only way to emulate that in an online setting is to screenshot. And here's the thing. If you make a claim to a professor about an online exam, chances are they will ask you for proof. Therefore, taking a screenshot has no inherent connection to communicating with other students.",

I mean, in what world are you not able to fix a misclick on a question nor ask the prof questions about how the test works during the exam itself? Even if it seems a bit dumb in retrospect, I can totally see why OP ended up doing what they did, especially under exam pressure.\n\nYou make it seem like the mere act of taking a screenshot has the potential to compromise the test, but that\u2019s not really true. Either you share a screenshot or your don\u2019t. And if you are doing something inappropriate with those screenshots you probably don\u2019t e-mail them to the professor ... In reality, what OP did is no more damaging than just having memorized the question to refer to it later, prof is over reacting to the particular method IMO. A zero on an exam for this just seems way out of proportion with what they actually did (and also nearly irrelevant to the goal of actually stopping the people actually cheating on these tests). Kind of like a cop arresting people for jaywalking instead of trying to fight actual crime or something.",

That way they don't have evidence you may have cheated.\n\nThat's going to be the issue here - she'll say you \"cheated\" and you'll have to defend yourself. You'll need to talk to the dean of the department and give solid reasons why you didn't think that was cheating and that you haven't shared the info with any other student. Just tread carefully, but definitely talk to her again, escalate to the dean, and escalate further as needed until someone does something.
