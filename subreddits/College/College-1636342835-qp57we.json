All these labs and bullshit about cells and whatever, I guarantee I'm gonna forget this information once I graduate. In fact I'll make sure I never use fucking biology ever again!!! Fuck biology!",

These two courses require a decent amount of work outside the classroom in order to grasp concepts. Chemistry is way less about memorizing, and more about understanding the concepts and hammering practice problems. Biology is straight forward, but do not fall behind. I suggest looking at material ahead of time before it\u2019s taught. Take lighter courses with these two. It\u2019s definitely very common for freshmen to have these two courses.",

When I was taking molecular biology and Gen chem, a lot of my classes had overlap with one another so it was easier to understand.",
