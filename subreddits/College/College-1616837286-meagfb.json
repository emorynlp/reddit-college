I transferred to a new college last semester, and ended up withdrawing from one class, and barely passing the remaining 3, although 1 of them I\u2019m retaking because it\u2019s such a core class and I still don\u2019t understand a good portion of it, and the curve was really low which is the only reason I passed.\n\nNow this semester I tried to lighten the work load and take only 3 classes, and struggling again and might have to withdraw from a core class. I\u2019m so over learning online, I\u2019m so much more engaged and happier in person, but I can\u2019t retain information when I sit at a computer screen for 10 hours a day. These semesters have plummeted my mental health to the worse it\u2019s been. It feels like this year amounted to nothing and I\u2019ll basically be redoing my sophomore year of college all over again next year, and I\u2019m ok with that as long as in person classes resume but idk it makes me feel like a complete failure. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this and is getting a similar experience out of this past academic year? All my friends are passing their classes and managing far better than me and it\u2019s hard to talk about this with them, would just like to know that I\u2019m not alone in this", "author": "RyzingThunder", "created": 1616837286, "retrieved": 1632947847, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 750, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gt4qxg5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/meagfb/these_past_2_12_covid_semesters_have_ruined_me_as/gt4qxg5/", "text": "OH, another tip that I can recommend but may not be for everyone depending on their level of discipline: Some of the classes I'm taking will by asynchronous, meaning no zoom meetings.

I feel you so hard on feeling like you do better with in-person classes. I'm internally screeching right now because I am having to take both Anatomy and Physiology one AND two ONLINE, currently taking the first one and it is no ***J O K E***. **Y'AAAAALLLLL** half the time I'm dying inside because I feel like I'd be learning this a lot more in person, but I mean all you can really do is the best you can in this situation. I'm trying to not kick myself as much because let's be honest, this is a h e a v y subject to learn with lots details that also tie into what you learn in BIO. So much muscles, so much bones, joints, articulations.... It's my first time taking a class like this so it's to be expected to find this challenging. That's normal. Some subjects may be more challenging to you than others too and that's fine. What doesn't make this as bad for me is that I'd rather read about A&P than math, hahahahaha. No shade to those who really like that subject, I just cannot get myself to focus as much. My attention span is shorter with that one. What also really helps is that the professor I have for A&P is super understanding and has made certain accommodations for some situations.\n\nOther than that though, you seriously aren't alone here. What has helped me a bit is knowing that other future people that you may run into like interviewers at grad schools or whatever will hopefully look at this point in time as a time to give us a little bit of grace due to the circumstances. Like right now, I'm just aiming to pass the first part of A&P with at LEAST a C or at most a B if I'm lucky (LOL). Then once I take part 2, I'll at least be more prepared and know what to expect. If I absolutely have to redo this first A&P class for whatever reason, I will worry about that later.\n\nNot sure how exactly the workload is for you but, because you mentioned feeling so drained, make sure you give yourself some time to breath in-between assignments. I know damn well I need to give myself a break once I notice myself making dumb mistakes on practice quizzes/exercises/homework and can't maintain enough focus to finish whatever I'm reading. This could be anything from going outside to get some fresh air, meditate, listen to music, anything that can help recharge your battery and relieve your eyes from lots of screen-time.\n\nAlso if you can, to make bigger tasks/projects look less daunting, try breaking it up into smaller bits and disperse it throughout the week (or however long you need) in a way that you feel you can get it done. The chapters I gotta read for both A&P and my developmental psychology class are ***T H I C C*** and there's no way I'd read that all in one day. Trying to do so will only spike my anxiety so therefore, I break it up into chunks throughout the week by dedicating a chapter to a certain day to focus on. How you do this will also depend on the pacing of your coursework.", "author": "Rosebudx0", "created": 1617363214, "upvotes": 1}, "gsmavlp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/meagfb/these_past_2_12_covid_semesters_have_ruined_me_as/gsmavlp/", "text": "Same", "author": "there_will_be_tears", "created": 1616965708, "upvotes": 1}, "gslbbza": {"link": "/r/college/comments/meagfb/these_past_2_12_covid_semesters_have_ruined_me_as/gslbbza/", "text": "I might as well have written this because I\u2019m literally in the same position- in fact, I\u2019ve been debating dropping out entirely these last 24-48 hours.

I am a 31 year old vet that started school after I got out of the army. I've been going to community college for 5 years working towards transfer to a university for aerospace engineering. I finally got to the point last semester where I could apply for the fall 2021 term at universities. After 5 years of work and a 3.8GPA I've gotten accepted to every school I've applied to, including CalPoly SLO and I was so proud because it is my top choice. But these past two semesters have been so rough. I am currently trying to get through this very last semester before I transfer, but I am having to take multivariable calculus, engineering statics and physics of electricity and magnetism, NONE of which lend themselves well to fully online instruction, but are all required major-prep courses for all but 1 of the 9 schools I applied to. I've managed to keep my head above water in math and engineering, but my physics teacher has made it his stated goal to make the class as difficult as he can so that he protects his \"reputation as a tough instructor\". I've had tough classes in the past, but the workload is insane, the class average is <50% and I am sitting at 53% which means that if I can't pass this class I am looking at an entire year before I can reapply so I can get into a decent university. I feel like the last 5 years has been for nothing. All of my work and all of my other grades (at least in the eyes of the universities I want to transfer to) will be overshadowed by one single class...

Can you get a physical copy to reduce looking at the computer? Do you have to attend lecture?  I stopped attending my cal class. The professor goes to quickly for me to keep up.
