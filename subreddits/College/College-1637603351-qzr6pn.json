  "text": "I\u2019m currently a freshman, and I have this really bad habit of doing schoolwork during breaks from school. I have 2 exams, 1 essay, and a project due the week after thanksgiving, so while I feel like taking these next few days to rest and recharge, I know that it will bite me in the ass when I have so much work to do when I get back.",

      "text": "Always. Thanksgiving \"break\" only accounts for 3 actual closure days at my school so I don't really see a point. It's not like I don't lie in bed smoking weed every day anyways. Sometimes I'll use a break to use the labs at school for my own projects as well. I'm an art student so I try to do an extra project or so on my own time just so I can use the studio space and equipment",
