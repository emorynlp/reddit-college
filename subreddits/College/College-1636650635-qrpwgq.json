  "text": "I\u2019m thinking of doing whatever I can, and not worrying about the grade. I might just take the F and move on. I can\u2019t do this _online_ course. I was unable to write the essay. I did not understand the directions, teacher takes a long time to respond to emails, but she does do it. \n\nThe work is long, but when I do hw assignments I do them as full as I can. I try as hard as I can on hw but only get a max of 80%. \n\nI\u2019m having trouble staying organized in that class, too. At the beginning it was fine, but now everything is just chaotic and Ive emailed her multiple times. Every single time I\u2019ve emailed her she has said \u201cget x into me by y\u201d which has never been a time that has worked for me, but I don\u2019t want to push my luck because she already is extending deadlines for me I don\u2019t wanna be a begging chooser.\n\nI\u2019m honestly just contemplating failing, asking the dean to remove the class, and taking another course to replace it. \n\nFuck online courses",
