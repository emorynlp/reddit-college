  "text": "So it\u2019s currently my freshman year in college and I feel like a workaholic right now. I can\u2019t see myself having fun because I think it will get in the way of studying and if I do go and hang out with the friends I made I just feel like I wasted my time. All I think about are my job and studying half the time I want to just enjoy myself but I just can\u2019t. I never really studied in high school and did fine but I came to college started studying and now I feel like all I need to do is work.",
