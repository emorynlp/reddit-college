  "text": "This is my second year of college and I feel exhausted\u2026 I\u2019m a bio pre-dental major and I\u2019m taking two science classes which isn\u2019t bad, however I spend most of my time studying. I really do like my major but I can feel myself slowly loosing interest bc of how much work it takes. I need advice on how to stick with it and not give up. Bc I feel like a ticking bomb that will explode anytime now.",

      "text": "If it helps take some pressure off - I was a bio major till February of my sophomore year. Then I realized all my love of natural science, animals, biology etc was being eaten alive by college courses. I switched to computer science, and never looked back. Still enjoy bio stuff, but not having it be my *job* is a big part of that I think. \n\nChanging majors is not a huge deal, especially if you stay within STEM. That being said, college is a slog with a shiny certificate at the end saying you survived. Take it one day at a time, see if any of the upperclassmen would tutor you for a reasonable rate (if you have the money) and remember that you probably won't use a lot of the knowledge that gets forced down your throat outside of that class. They don't tell you this, but college is more to teach you *how to* *think* than it is to have you memorize 4 years worth of stuff. If you can go \"oh I remember learning that concept\", then google/research a bit to pull the learning back out years later, you're good. \n\nIf you want to talk more, or anything feel free to DM/reply <3",
