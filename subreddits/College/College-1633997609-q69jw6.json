  "text": "Hey guys, I need some help with staying focused. I tell myself everyday that I will stay focused because I want to actually learn and I know what I learn is for my career, but when the time comes, I always end up zoning out. I have a busy schedule so I'm tired usually but I am getting enough sleep. And I usually have a 3 hour break in the middle of my classes, and although I get a lot done there and can relax, a lot of my tiredness and zoning out comes from that. I get to the class after that 3 hour break having trouble concentrating. A lot of the times, I get caught up thinking about the homework I have to do when I get home and planning for when I get home I noticed. If you guys have any advice, please let me know. Thank you",
