  "text": "Adjunct professor here.\n\nI need some help from students because I'm \\*dying\\* here.  Student emails are overwhelming me.\n\nIt's my own fault for telling students \"*if you have any questions, just shoot me an email.*\"   I realize this is totally on me.  But the reason I say it is because I really want the students to do their assignments, and I know if I don't answer their question they won't hand in the assignment, and then they'll say \"*Well, I didn't know how to do X so I didn't do it since you didn't get back to me*.\"\n\nI now know that I've \"coddled\" them into creating a monster that's just not sustainable.   I also think it's worse right now because they can't talk to me after class since we're still online at my college.  \n\nBut I need to set boundaries when it comes to emails.  Some professors are hard asses about it.   Other professors say \"*Use the LMS like Canvas to send out notifications and limit your emails.*\"  Other professors say \"*I only answer emails during office hours*\" or \"*I answer emails once a week*.\"\n\nI'm getting upwards of 25 student emails a day.  A lot of them are ridiculous things like \"*When's the exam?\"* (Information that is easy to find if you click on \"class schedule\" or the syllabus or the FAQ I made.)\n\nSo, I don't want this to come across as me complaining - I chose my job and I do love it.  I just would like to hear from students what they think is \"fair\" but \"reasonable\" and what your professors' rules are about contacting them.",

      "text": "What I think is fair would be along the lines of...\n\n1. Check the syllabus first. If it's there, don't expect an answer via email.\n2. I'll actively respond to emails during office hours, and whenever I have time during the day. Expect a response within 24 hours.\n\nA good number of professors have said they check during office hours, and at the start and end of their day; don't expect a response outside normal business hours.",

      "text": "I guess you have to suck it up since you said it but going forward you should\n\n1. Clarify that you will only answer questions through email not found on the syllabus. If they are there you will not answer.\n2. Answer during business hours only. Anything sent past 5 should not expect an answer until the next business day (unless you have late classes and your office hours are late).\n3. If students have questions on assignments that can not be answered through email (basically if they need to have it explained or want to go over a paper) they need to come to office hours.\n\nThose three seem pretty fair for most people.",

      "text": "As a student, I will always include in an email that \u201ca response is not required\u201d if all I am doing is relaying information, and really don\u2019t need that \u201cok, got it, thanks\u201d as it\u2019s a waste of time. \n\nAnother helpful reminder I try to include in my emails to professors is \u201cfeel free to make this an announcement to the whole class\u201d rather than solely replying to just my email because I am sure others have the same question. \n\nSo I would say, maybe try to consolidate questions from students and then either answer them in class or post an announcement to everyone. \n\nSome of my professors have a discord or slack channel per class for questions where they are available 24/7 and so other students can see what other classmates have problems with and can help in answering questions.\n\nAll of my professors have been wonderful at being good about getting back in reply even the busy ones so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a matter of organization and a good system. But no, you don\u2019t have to be at every student\u2019s beck and call all of the time.",

      "text": "Most of my professors were hard asses and threw a fit you emailed them. They basically wanted you in office hours or to stfu.\n\nOne poor kid emailed from the ER they were missing class, got a note, showed up next week and got yelled at that emailing didn't count as notifying the professor even if it was prior to class. So uh, try not to be THAT hard ass but also I might outline all requests for extensions / so on need \"reasonable\" time frames. Most people will read reasonable as over 2+ work days notice. \n\n\nRandom ideas\n\n* Set up a template. Once per day sip coffee and mass-email the stupid questions. Something like \"this information is listed on your syllabus. If you have lost your syllabus, you can find a copy on Class Website Link Here\" You can mark the rest to answer once you have more time, but copy and paste sounds like it'll cover majority of emails.\n* Also make sure the class website is useful. Even a notice like exam times have not yet been released, check back the week of Dec 1st should lower some questions\n* I think 2-3 work day turn around and no after hour responses is reasonable. I also think answering questions about topics with here is some resources for anything else please come to office hours is also reasonable.",
