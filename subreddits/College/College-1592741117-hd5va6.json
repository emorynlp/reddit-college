I feel like giving up.", "text": "I just registered for my fall 2020 classes, and am already overwhelmed.\n\nI'm still considered a SOPHOMORE at my age, and it's extremely frustrating when everyone else is graduating with their masters at 24!\n\nMy biggest issue is that I used to take two courses per semester because I have ADHD, and get side-tracked so easily. I go from studying to thinking about what I should eat for lunch, and my mind goes on an adventure. Next thing you know, two hours have passed, and I didn't get anything done.\n\nFull-time semesters are HELL for me, and I recently changed majors from nursing to software engineering. The only way I can get out of college on time is if I tackle full-time semesters instead of just two courses, but how on earth are people surviving 12+ credits when they're dealing with calculus and upper level programming/engineering classes?? How do you manage to not fail taking these overwhelming classes all at once?\n\n**EDIT: Seriously, I thank every one of you for your comments. Your thoughts and advice alone make me feel encouraged.\nI should add that I am not getting any professional help for my ADHD. For some reason, I feel shameful in asking for drugs like Adderall because I don\u2019t want people thinking I\u2019m just trying to boost my way through college with the help of stimulants. Another HUGE issue of mine is insomnia. It\u2019s currently 4:18 AM, and I can\u2019t sleep (this is the norm). I have constant racing thoughts, and it leads to day time drowsiness. Not sure if I\u2019ll ever get a college degree. I guess it\u2019s time I get some professional help for my health issues. But aside from that, THANK YOU FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT.

You just have to be patient and not worry so much about the future or any external factors. I'm 26 right now and a Sophomore in college as well. My major is in Finance with a minor in Computer Science. When I'm done with this, I'm going to get my Masters in Accounting. I was just like you, comparing myself to others and letting things distract me. I have a wife, a 2 year old son, and we are all living in one bedroom at my wife's parent's house. My wife and I were both in the Air Force, but we got out and now we are full time students. I have plenty of distractions and worries, but what helped me is to really think about what it is that you want to do. What is it that you ACTUALLY want to do, not something that sounds cool or that makes you look smart, or that will make you the most money. When you focus your thinking inward and decide what YOU want for YOU, it makes focusing on whatever you need to do to achieve that much easier (i.e. studying). I'm currently carrying 16 hours per semester and I'm not taking breaks. I finished this past Spring semester with a 3.5 GPA, then went right into a Summer semester carrying 16 hours, got a 4.0, and next week I start the second module of the summer semester, carrying another 16 hours. After that, I'm going right into the Fall semester, and I plan on doing this until I'm finished with my college career. YOU can do this as well, just focus your thoughts, figure out the path that is really right for you, put it in your mind that you CAN and WILL do it, and the rest will fall in line. If you don't work out or exert yourself physically, start doing that, it'll help with sleep.

You changed from a really difficult major to a really difficult major. I burned out trying to do software engineering during my Jumore year back around the turn of the century.

You might want to try out accounting or economics. They both have enough complications at the higher levels to remain interesting. And the math is scaled way back. It feels like sandbagging a little, but it's kind of nice stressing over whether it's an A or A minus versus doing the same math problem 10 times because your brain decides to randomly check out.

Take advantage of your schools disability resources, they\u2019re they\u2019re for a reason and did wonder for me. My school didn\u2019t give any extra time but gave me a private space to test so I didn\u2019t get distracted. \n\n2.  Take more classes. This one sounds counterintuitive, but you want to graduate on time with minimal debt. Don\u2019t jump from a part-time to full-time schedule right away, but work your way up. First, add a libed, then each semester add a few more classes. Keep in mind your liberal arts classes are *much* easier than your STEM classes, so they can be nice to add at first to ease into the idea of taking more credits. Just make sure not to anger the prof, since even though those subjects have really high grade inflation the professors impression of you affects your grade. \n\n3. Try to get a full 8 hours of sleep. I took sleep medication to help with this, but now I can do it most nights. It works *wonders.*\n\n4. Try to get habits. Go to the library to study at a set time, even if you\u2019re not studying the whole time at first and get distracted. 15 minutes of studying out of 45 of being at the library is better than nothing! \n\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s some of what I did. Lmk what you think.

Otherwise, you're just wasting time going to class getting lost and not understand a thing. \n* **Review your notes and re-study after class.** This is to reinforce the information you gain so you won't forget it as easily. This way, you won't have to study nearly as much later on.\n* **Studying some everyday > cramming last minute.** The subject area you're pursuing is not something you can cram last minute and still do well. It requires constant and consistent practice over time to understand. Resting period in between is very important because it allows the information you absorb to settle down and become knowledge.\n* **Warm up to your activities.** There will be times where just don't feel like studying or practicing. But start with some easy stuff that you know you can solve just to give yourself a small confidence boost just to get things going. Then work your way up to the main stuff.\n* **Practice coding on your own.** This isn't something that you can read about and wing it when the time comes to get tested on it. Practice makes perfect. Practice also generates confidence.\n* **Practice math problems on your own.** Same thing as coding.

I went to the library to get *free* prep books and practice questions. At work when I had free time I would look over questions and my personal study guides. Read your notes after each class.

I know that this is a controversial thing to say especially given your diagnosis but if you budget your time and focus, you can get through a lot.\n\nHere's what I recommend you do: create an hour by hour breakdown of each day. First, start with your needs. You need to sleep (and yes, you should schedule 8 hours of sleep each night) and eat. Carve these blocks out as you can't study when you are sleeping or focus very well when you're eating (I like to watch youtube when I eat so I would generally carve out 30 minute blocks for breakfast and dinner and then an hour for lunch).\n\nNext, put your classes in the schedule. Also put anything that you need to do (e.g. work if you have a job). You will also need to commute to school. Time walking/driving isn't time you can study, so also etch these out in your schedule.\n\nNow, determine when you are going to study. If you need breaks, figure out when to schedule your breaks in a way so that you can stay focused during your study hours. Remember, for every 1 hour in class you should schedule 2 hours out of class. As a sidenote, I know that they say for STEM the ratio is 1:3. I did not find this to be the case as some courses were closer to a 1:1 and others were a 1:3. It averages out to about 1:2 in my experience.\n\nAs some background, I dual degreed in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, minored in Physics, wrote two research publications, and still managed to play college Rugby and train 10 hours of MMA per week once I stopped playing Rugby. It **all** comes down to time management. You can be the most brilliant person in the world and you will still do poorly if you do not put in the work.\n\nI know I am probably going to get downvoted for this post, but I sincerely wish you luck and highly recommend that you create a timetable. College isn't that hard and I find my time in the Army to be much more draining emotionally and physically.

You have to take College one step at a time. Especially when you have ADHD. I understand how looking around, you may be discouraged that other people are progressing faster but it does not matter. You have decided to take an important step of going back to school. If being full time doesn\u2019t not work for you, than take a class or 2 until you are able to handle a full load.\n\nLike someone mentioned, attend your disability center and get the necessary paperwork done so that when it comes to tests and quizzes, you have extra time to finish it. It\u2019s time we started normalizing people starting their undergrads after 23! You can do it and I have faith in you OP.
