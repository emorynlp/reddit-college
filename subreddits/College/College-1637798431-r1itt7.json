  "text": "Sophomore here. I go to a small school and do XC/Track (d3, but that still eats up a lot of time), work very part-time but plan on increasing that, and I\u2019m one club that requires minimal time commitment. I am a STEM major. Recently, I\u2019ve been going on LinkedIn and getting super, well, jealous honestly. My GPA is \u201conly\u201d about a 3.4. I\u2019ve found out from LinkedIn that so many of my classmates in my major have really high GPAs and are in a long list of extracurriculars with board positions. I just can\u2019t do that. I get tired easily honestly. Also so many of them have internships lined up. Do I really need to be in a bunch of clubs? I just don\u2019t have the interest. To be clear I\u2019m not talking about eschewing professional societies. But I don\u2019t see myself joining or sustaining participation in Greek life, service clubs, or clubs like film club. \n\nEdit: I was originally planning to graduate in 2023, but I\u2019m not going to now, hence my old flair.",
