  "text": "I thought it was going to get better but it seems to only be getting worse. It\u2019s been a few months now and I have yet to make any friends. The only person I talk to is my roommate who used to be a friend in high school. He kinda bailed on me so I stopped spending time with him and now we are nothing but roommates. As someone with social anxiety, I tend to spend a lot of time in the room and he seems upset at me that he has no alone time even though he is the one that chooses to hang out with people and come back late every day. He asked me to leave the room today so I stayed outside after classes but now it\u2019s been a few hours and he is not replying so I\u2019m just sitting downstairs like an idiot. I realized I need my alone time so I want to get a single but that won\u2019t be possible until at least next year and even that is far from guaranteed. I absolutely hate everything about college other than my classes and I\u2019m considering transferring to a commuter school or to get an online degree. It\u2019s just that my education is really important to me and I enjoy my classes. I know I won\u2019t be able to get the most out of online classes and I\u2019m unsure what to do",
