UV light doesn't kill COVID almost instantaneously unless it's an extremely high dose and the most recent paper I read [did so at a distance of 3 cm](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.07.031) and others back up that [it could take 11-34 minutes in the summer and over a day in the winter months](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/php.13293) and that there's a risk of it becoming aerosolized again with that long of an inactivation time.  Quick UV disinfection of objects is done at high doses with specific types of UV radiation and in much closer proximity than we are to the sun.\n\nSo yeah, going outside is a good idea to get some vitamin D and all of that, but you're not \"good\" because of the sun and wind.",
