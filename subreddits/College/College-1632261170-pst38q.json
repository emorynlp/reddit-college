I love my major, but I know it's hard to find jobs in this market, hence the business minor.   \n\n\nHowever, another thing I'm really interested in is History. I'm considering a minor or double major in history, but my question is, would a history degree be as safe a choice as a business minor or double major? I see some say the history major is very widely applicable and marketable to other jobs, while others say it's useless. I know it's probably still not as easy to get a job with a history degree compared to a business degree, but is there still more safety there than a film degree?", "author": "Banananna6", "created": 1632261170, "retrieved": 1632800951, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"he3vhex": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pst38q/how_hireablesafe_is_a_history_degree/he3vhex/", "text": "Hi! Background of me: I am a 24 year old Dancer who went back to school late. I just changed my Social Work degree to a History degree, I am planning on getting into education and contributing to my community that way. \n\nReflect on what your goal is in college. Do you have a specific job you want, or are you studying your interests and seeing where that takes you? A lot of places will look at your degree and look at your skills that you've learned rather than your degree, depending. An example: A mentor of mine majored in Anthropology in her bachelors and graduate studies: She is now on the committee for Public Art and runs a Non-Profit Performance Company, and is on salary. Also, are you looking to make a lot of money? Are you okay with an average pay? Are you okay with not making a lot of money (below 50k) but doing what you love? Evaluate your values, goals, etc. I feel like the creative types and visionaries want to learn about humans, the world, how they work, etc. We are not looking for a specific job title. We want to contribute our ideas to the world and make money.... and that is really hard. \n\nGo to Bureau of Labor Statistics, and look up jobs that would be marketable in your area, because it's different depending on where you live. I looked up Social Work and High School Teachers. On average nationally, the growth is higher in Social Work than Teaching (teaching is average compared to SW being faster than average,) however when I looked at the breakdown in my city, there was more jobs available for Teachers than Social Workers. (Teaching 1790, Social Work 500.) \n\nI know this is a loaded statement, but do what you love and follow your intuition and the rest will fall into place.", "author": "Maleficent_Break6521", "created": 1632500283, "upvotes": 1}, "hdt3g5g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pst38q/how_hireablesafe_is_a_history_degree/hdt3g5g/", "text": "If by \"safe\" you mean set you up well for good jobs after graduating, I would say generally no. Not to say you couldn't get a good job with a history degree, but its a degree that doesn't lead to a well defined career path after graduating, unlike computer science, nursing, engineering, accounting, etc.\n\nIf I were you, I would seriously consider what career you want after college, assess how attainable and well paying that job is, and then pursue it. Talk to your career counselor and other students in your major, and try to find out what percentage of them get \"good\" jobs, (using your own metric of \"good\" - high paying, fulfilling, etc.) Then make the decision of whether this is a career that you think you have a good chance of getting, and whether it is well paying enough.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1632284752, "upvotes": 1}, "hds2u9n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pst38q/how_hireablesafe_is_a_history_degree/hds2u9n/", "text": "Hi! So I\u2019m doing a double major in History and Mass Communication. (mass comm is similar to film, television, and digital media but it also encompasses journalism). Personally, I believe a history degree is quite marketable. You learn to read and write and do analysis which are all important skills that can be transferred to a lot of jobs. As for getting a job in the field, most history majors I think don\u2019t usually, at least from what I\u2019ve heard. I personally plan to work in a museum or archive.

This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, as employers will see you still put in the work to get a bachelors degree, but there isn\u2019t anything particularly \u201cremarkable\u201d about a history major.\n\nA film/digital media major will show employers that you can work various broadcasting equipment, are familiar with different media formats, etc. A history degree will just show that you have knowledge of past events\u2026 which doesn\u2019t bring much to the table in many places.

I had much better luck in the job market as a musician and music teacher than my history major relatives, because I had a clear-cut skill-- I could perform and I could teach. In film, I'm sure you are building skills that you could market yourself with, even if that market isn't very big. But with history, you'll certainly ending up learning stuff, but the main skill you'll build will probably be writing skills which is common to every humanities major so there's nothing about a history major that would set you apart from other majors. Seems unlikely to me it would be much better than a film major, but again this is all conjecture on my part.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632262178, "upvotes": 2}}}
