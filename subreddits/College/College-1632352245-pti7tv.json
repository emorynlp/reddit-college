From all the in-person colleges I've seen, I could finish a major if I was a full-time student in 2 or 3 years.  \n\nAt this point in my life, for various reasons, I'm only looking into online college programs, though I want the online college to also have a brick-and-mortar college (to prevent online college stigma, because yes, I know it does matter, I've seen it).  I can only be a part-time student, (since I work), and I'm hoping I can find a major program that is more broad / open in what classes it considers as counting towards the major, so that I could finish earlier than in 2 more years or 3  more years.  Since I already have 115 units completed, and I don't want to do college over twice or thrice in a sense, because technically one only needs 120 units to graduate.  I'm looking for an online college program that fits my requirements that at the very least could accept all my the credits I've done.  Any suggestions?  I've no luck finding a college program that fits my requirements, since I don't even know where to start.  I'm hoping I can find a college that fits my requirements, since I do want to finish with a degree.  Though if I can't find such an online college, it's not worth it to me for various reasons to pursue it.", "author": "pleasethankyou1", "created": 1632352245, "retrieved": 1632946495, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdx82zm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pti7tv/any_recommendations_for_online_colleges_that_are/hdx82zm/", "text": "But this is really a transfer question, so I encourage you to ask around in /r/CollegeTransfer", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1632367564, "upvotes": 1}, "hdx7z0j": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pti7tv/any_recommendations_for_online_colleges_that_are/hdx7z0j/", "text": "Here, pick a school:  \n\n[US News & World Report Ranking of Best Online Undergraduate Schools](http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/bachelors/rankings)    \n\nThere is no way to know which schools will accept all of your completed credits for transfer towards whatever degree you select until you apply, are accepted, and they evaluate your credits.  \n\nI think it is a safe bet that some of your credits might not be accepted towards your degree, or might only be accepted as elective credits.  \nSo you should warm up to the idea that you're going to have to complete more than 5 more credits to complete a degree.  \n\nAlso, most good universities don't like to award a degree with their name on it if you only complete 5 credits from their institution. Be prepared to be told there is a minimum credit requirement.", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1632367505, "upvotes": 1}}}
