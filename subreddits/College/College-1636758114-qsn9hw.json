  "title:": "Need help with creating a more productive study space",
  "text": "For the past several months I\u2019ve fallen into some bad habits and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anyone who can offer advice if they\u2019ve been in the same situation or just in general. \n\nWhen I got back to college for the new semester I fell into the habit of waking up and then immediately going to my desk to open my laptop and watch something on Netflix or Hulu. It\u2019s gotten so bad that I feel like there\u2019s a complete mental block when attempting to engage with material I know I should be studying but I can\u2019t seem to get my mind where it needs to be. \n\nI\u2019ve read tips about not watching tv in bed or scrolling through your phone because your brain will associate bed with those activities. I fear I may have created an association with my desk/study space where now it\u2019s become the space where I sit mindlessly watching things that are not helping me in any way. \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions, tips, books, podcast, anything that can help me refocus AND reprogram my mind to see my desk as a place where I study instead of consume digital media?",

              "text": "Agreed. I used to light a candle whenever I studied. It changed my settings just enough to put me in the mood to study. Plus, you can only burn a candle so long before it gets messed up, so it was like its own little timer. Better get stuff done before the candle goes out!",
