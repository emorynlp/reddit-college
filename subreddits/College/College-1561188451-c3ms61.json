  "text": "I understand this idea may seem a bit dumb, but with college housing costs going as high as 10k-15k, I have been seriously considering living in my car through college. I figure if I've got a nice van with livable space to sleep and rest, I could use the hygienic facilities offered on campus for cleaning up and the libraries and classrooms to study and work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI apologize if this post seems rude to those who have struggled through homelessness in college. This is by no means a romanticization of the situation, only an option being considered due to financial constraints. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone had experience with living in their car during college in the past, and would you consider the money saved worth the difficulty? Would colleges even allow students to live in their cars? And for context, I hope to be attending CalPoly SLO, transferring in from my local junior college. Thank you!",

I lived here my whole life and the police are pretty devoted to stopping people from sleeping in their cars. There are a few places that people go to not get harassed but even those are risky.\n\nEven then, it\u2019s difficult getting through college without a place to stay. School can be stressful enough trying to do well, and knowing you don\u2019t really have a place to sleep at night is rough.",

Maybe you could pay someone to park your van in their driveway or something, I\u2019ve thought about doing that before. I go to Cal Poly and the parking in SLO is already pretty crowded especially on campus. The best thing would definitely be to set up a place to park and pay them like $100 a month for the privilege. Maybe you\u2019ll even become friends and they will let you use the house during the day and just leave the van parked there all the time. Lmk if you have any questions about the area and I\u2019ll see if I can help. \n\nEdit: Being an RA in PCV (apartment style housing on campus) is supposed to be very little work per week, and they comp your housing plus you get ~$1500 a quarter in on campus dining \u201cplus dollars.\u201d\n\nEdit 2: Also, you could get a double room in a house  off campus for around $400-500 a month if you searched pretty hard. Get on the facebook communities and start looking!",

      "text": "Hey man, I've been homeless too.  (Twice) from living in a tent on an island, to later post-accident had to crash with friends.  As counter-intuitive as it sounds being homeless is MORE expensive than having a place for most people.  Think about it, free time in a shelter is well, free.  Free-time in a car costs money.  When you get sick you'll stay sick longer.  Heaven forbid you're female (chances of rape go up so much).  Need internet at 1 am for a project?  Tough.  Your grades will suffer.  You can't get a job without a physical address (dead serious).  You have to drive way out every night so people don't catch you then come way back into town.  Having a dirty car (or a car that dirty) quickly becomes suspicious, that's gas going up to 4X and car washes going up to 8X.  The car needs a little heater $, car needs a little a/c fan, $.  More batteries, more oil.  You need your car to be at 100% every day all day.  You can't do anything without that car.  This also means if your caught and your car is impounded you'll be on the streets.  Without the ability to do school work.  If you just get tickets twice a month for car camping then you've basically paid enough to live on campus.  This isn't even counting food!  Making a salad when you have a counter top and a fridge is a fraction of the cost of pre-paid salads.  That goes into the \"cost of living\" they give you isn't for just a place, it's also food.",

      "text": "Yes this is a doable option. I have been living this way for a little over a year. \n\nHere's the basic shape of it for me:\n\nAfter minimizing my possessions they went into a rented storage unit. Got a PO box and made arrangements with a home-owning \nfriend so it doesn't look like I have a gap in my housing history.\n\nThen I bought a camper shell with tinted windows for my pickup, insulated it and made a somewhat comfortable bed. The only time I'm back there is when I'm sleeping. The rest of the time I'm living my life pretty much as usual.\n\nI work two part time jobs, go to school full time, and volunteer with several organizations so my schedule is fairly structured which helps  me feel more houseless than homeless. \n\nTuition gets me access to all kinds of perks like a rec center membership for maintaining hygiene and physical health; private restrooms so I have a place to cut my hair and toenails; a box of fresh food once a week; WiFi; and a full calendar of open activities.   \n\nIt was difficult calibrating to the lifestyle at first but the freedom from rent and landlords alone makes it worth it for me to continue doing this for at least another year or two. You'll have more money to spend on experiences when you aren't paying someone else's mortgage or trying to accumulate more possessions. \n\nThere are drawbacks, of course\n\n* You'll always need a bathroom plan\n* It gets hot\n* It gets cold\n* People in your life may not understand\n* Always rotating between spots to stay stealth\n* Changes your dating pool\n* Psychological stress from limited sanctuary\n\nTL;DR Vehicle dwelling is a viable option for surviving college/late stage capitalism.",

Laws have gotten stricter and people are more wary of transients (which they will consider you). You will have zero peace of mind. This isn't anywhere near the same as living with a room mate. You will have people fucking with your vehicle (especially if you aren't very stealth) and you'll have the cops called on you. Even if you are stealth, people will notice a pattern and call the cops.\n\nCars have shit insulation, so you're looking at modifying your vehicle so that it isn't freezing in the winter and scorching in the summer. Unless you've got a luxury car, you don't have much sound dampening. Every twig that falls on the car, every rain drop, every dog bark, and raccoon crawling on the car is going to sound like it's coming from inside the car.\n\nWhat are your plans for meals? If you're going to have a fridge you'll need to set up some way to power it without killing your car battery. So, you're looking at solar (expensive, will get fucked with, not stealth if there are ANY multi-story buildings) or you're running a generator (noisy, expensive, not stealth). If you're not going to have a fridge are you doing runs to fast food / cafeteria / grocery store daily? That gas adds up, especially in a van that likely gets 15mpg with gas at $4/gallon.\n\nLooking at Craigslist, there's rooms for rent starting at $550/mo including utilities if you want to share a room, $650/mo including utilities if you want a private room. Are you really going to save THAT much money living in a van?",

Also if you live with roommates it's totally possible to spend less than 10k on housing. I spent around 7k a year! It's also very easy to find a job on campus to help cover living costs.

In my experience, if you don't have financial aid covering a decent amount of your housing, then the most affordable option is to find a cheap house our apartment and find roommates to split the cost between a few people.",

Additionally, while Walmart seems like a good option, none of the Walmarts near SLO allow it.\n\nIf it's possible, I would advise trying to live on campus in the Cerro Vista apartments/ other transfer housing. I know it's going to cost a hell of a lot more, but you'll have the social environment, the campus police if anything goes wrong and the Cerro Vista apartments are really nice. It'll be better than constantly getting slapped with overnight parking tickets. \n\nLastly: there is a city ordinance in SLO that bans you from parking in the same place for more than 72 hours. After that you need to move 500 feet.",
