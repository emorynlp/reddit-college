Need internet at 1 am for a project?  Tough.  Your grades will suffer.  You can't get a job without a physical address (dead serious).  You have to drive way out every night so people don't catch you then come way back into town.  Having a dirty car (or a car that dirty) quickly becomes suspicious, that's gas going up to 4X and car washes going up to 8X.  The car needs a little heater $, car needs a little a/c fan, $.  More batteries, more oil.  You need your car to be at 100% every day all day.  You can't do anything without that car.  This also means if your caught and your car is impounded you'll be on the streets.  Without the ability to do school work.  If you just get tickets twice a month for car camping then you've basically paid enough to live on campus.  This isn't even counting food!
