  "text": "Hey friends, fellow disabled student here. I'm writing an article for my school paper about how incredibly inaccessible Boston University's campus is! I'm talking about pre-covid problems and problems created by covid restrictions disabling accessible pathways on campus. Drop your grievances, complaints, and rage here, and I'll include it in my article (anon) to hopefuly get some sorely needed change!! Thanks friends!\n\nI'll start: the only ramp to the building where students have 90% of their classes is extremely steep, has no platform at the bottom (which is illegal btw) and no handrail, so if you wheel down it you do run into the door!! And every other entrance has at least 7 stairs!!",

      "text": "I don\u2019t know about Boston but \n\nEven where there are ramps or no stairs, 99% of the doors can\u2019t be opened with a cane or crutches or a bum leg or hand or even by someone with bad balance.\n\nAccessible bathrooms- my ass.  It is not an accessible bathroom if there is only one in 9 floors and it requires the beneficence of the gods to take the only elevator and go to the other side of the building in the 10 min between classes.\n\nThere is not nearly enough handicapped parking and even that there is - Often not really handicapped parking (like the stupidly small spaces next to someone elses F150 and you can\u2019t open the door of your car wide enough to get out when you are spry, forget about managing a walker or anything else).\n\nIf the doors to the classrooms are closed, the classrooms are all inaccessible to people in wheelchairs or walkers or are at best awkard with canes.\n\nIn places where there is only one coffee, or snack place in reasonable distance (like our science building is miles away from any other form of food) there is not a place to sit and eat or drink it.  So only able bodied people that can carry a drink in their hand while walking can have a coffee or a sandwich?",

The doors are so unreasonably heavy, and I cannot tell you how many times I've hit myself by the door trying to squeeze through with my cane, both for classrooms, bathrooms, and building entrances. And half the bathrooms on campus don't even have handicapped stalls. I haven't thought about it before, but I can't think of a single handicap accessible parking spot on the main campus. Wtf",

Besides those, the nearest handicapped spots are at least a 2-3 minute walk from the buildings. Just thought it was a strange implication that if somebody\u2019s disability is more debilitating, they have to pay for a better accommodation",
