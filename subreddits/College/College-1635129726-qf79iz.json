  "text": "so I've been at sac state for one semester as a freshman, and I kinda regret not going to community first. dont get me wrong, its great here, but would it be possible for me to go to community college for the spring semester and following year then transfer to a UC? I kinda miss my family and realized saving up money while at home is smarter",

You\u2019ll save money, the classes are easier, and with everything online you aren\u2019t missing anything. If I could re-do it, I would have gone community college first.",
