  "text": "I have been to university for 5 years now. It always kinda shocks me that people / friends consider me popular or known around campus. \n\nBesides my friends, I would walk and people would say my name . I\u2019m not even trying to be full of myself when I say this , but It\u2019s an weird feeling when people say that I\u2019m popular\u2026.. \nI am part of one club and one sorority. \n\nI was never given the time of day in high school . I was too myself I really didn\u2019t have close friends. I was bullied and not even asked out by any guy until prom and even that I kinda asked him out \ud83e\udd2d\n\nMy roommates and I were talking and I casually said how I had a busy month because I had a party every weekend to go to and homecoming activities in three schools etc , I was invited to go to by friends . It didn\u2019t occur to me how highly people think of me and want to be surrounded by me . It feels good to be liked for being genuine version of myself.",
