  "text": "In high school, I was on track to go to college. I got good grades, and got into some great colleges. I couldn't afford any of them, even in-state public colleges.\n\nI then worked for 2 years, became an addict, got clean, paid bills, experienced life, etc. I enrolled at my local community college, and finished 2 years.\n\nI'm now 22, and think I'm too old to go and move into a dorm, and experience the \"traditional\" college experience.\n\nEveryone I went to high school with, and my friends from the college I was SUPPOSED to go to, have now graduated. Everyone is done, and on with their life. It feels like I will be alone, watching everyone else live life, while I'm years behind.\n\nWhile I wanted to experience college SO bad, I now believe I'm too old. I don't want to be moving into a dorm or off campus apartment at 23, living with 19 year olds.\n\nI'm thinking about just finishing through an online program? Does this sound like a logical idea?",

I was 20 years old when I had applied to college (mostly out of boredom and because someone I knew at the time applied also who was a year older than me). Its never too late for anyone to go to college. In some of my classes that I took there were people in like 30s to late 40s, whether it was to get their bachelor's or higher Idk. I'd honestly say that your around the right age to go since you know how it is in the working world and know what companies want when they hire someone",

It's never too late. You got this! We might be strangers but I got your back. It's always worth going back if you found something you're passionate about. Don't think you're \"too old\" for college because I've seen 40-60 years olds go back to school and get their degree.",

I would say if you can afford it, go for it, and live on your own. If that isn't feasible financially, try looking for a roommate that is done with school, or an upperclassman.

You'll have lots of options!\n\nThat being said: an online program isn't a *bad* option, either. I did my master's degree 100% online and got a lot out of it.

      "text": "Nah, you're definitely not too old. I didn't start until I was 24, same as you. Granted, I didn't do the dorm life. I purchased a house off campus. I don't know what you mean by \"college experience\" as I think that means something different to everyone. Do you mean connected with friends, going out, partying? Studying your ass off for the mid-term you've got in the morning? nose to the grind stone to finish, or pulling all-nighters for a paper due the next day?\n\nWhatever you're looking for you aren't too old for any of that. Though the online portion you don't have a choice in right now (haha...)\n\nHowever, while slightly older, I still got along wonderfully. I wasn't even the oldest in my program. We had a 45 year-old (civil engineering, married with 2 kids) and a 60 year-old as well (mechanical engineering).\n\nI didn't miss much living off campus. I still went to bars with friends, and went to parties and things. I didn't join a frat/sorority either, so if that's something your going for, you might be older than some of the members, but who cares?\n\nYou're never to old to start college, and in fact you might be a bit better off as you've had a chance to \"grow up\" and *theoretically* know how to self direct, & not procrastinate. (I say theoretically as I still lack that particular skill). And there's some scholarships out there for older students.\n\nSome kids will say things about you being too old, but who gives a shit what they think?",

I think he was in his late 30s because he had 2 kids and appeared older (I don\u2019t know if kids do that to you though lol). There are so many stories of non traditional students I could go on forever but, the way I see it, you\u2019re never too old to go to college, and most of the time the older people who do go to college end up being some of my favorite people!!",

Plus you might get lucky - back in my early 20s I met people my age or a couple years younger who were more mature than people in their 30s. Sometimes life forces people to grow up really fast.

I started college at 19 because I had a really hard time in high school and ended up taking off another year over two nonconsecutive semesters due to family issues.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to see all my HS friends that graduated two years ago with careers and families and I\u2019m still taking tests and complaining about homework.\n\nAlso I\u2019ve lived in a dorm or on campus every year and I\u2019ve always liked it. It\u2019s so nice being close to everything and not having to worry about stuff that goes along with owning or renting a place to live. That said I am moving into an off campus apartment this year and I\u2019m very excited. \n\nYoure\ud83d\udc4fnot\ud83d\udc4ftoo\ud83d\udc4fold\ud83d\udc4f and if you want to experience college DO IT. I\u2019m so glad I\u2019ve gotten to experience college \u201cproperly.\u201d (I had a rough start and didn\u2019t have any friends but after transferring to another school I\u2019ve had so much fun.)\n\nCollege is great because unlike in high school, no one really cares how old you are or what you wear or look like. There will always be shitty people but they\u2019re not as prevalent or outspoken.\n\nIt\u2019s kind if fun being an older student because no one expects it. I apparently look younger than I am because whenever I tell someone that I\u2019m 23, they\u2019re always surprised. I also always make jokes that I\u2019m 100 and my friends or people I\u2019m friendly with should respect their elder. They always laugh. \n\nI truly understand that it\u2019s daunting to imagine going to college when you\u2019re not \u201ccollege age\u201d and also really upsetting to see your friends living their lives after graduation while you haven\u2019t reached that milestone yet. It\u2019s not impossible and it\u2019s very much worth the effort and the anxiety. Plus if you find a major you really love then that makes it even better.",

I\u2019ve been through my fair share of bad stuff, and it took me until I was 22 to enroll again in college classes. But I think us slightly older folks bring a different perspective to the classroom. I think we may also have a sense of maturity the 18yo kids don\u2019t yet possess, which makes us great candidates to be leaders in the classroom (I\u2019m a TA and a tutor through my school). Some of my classmates are retirees. Some are fresh out of high school. We\u2019ve all got our own stories, and as long as everyone puts in the effort, we all get a fair shake. I say go for it.\n\nHell, I found out I\u2019m not transferring this fall because of Covid. Meanwhile, my friends (26+) are pursuing PhDs or finishing law school! Don\u2019t compare your journey to those of your peers. They\u2019re not you.",

Always had lots of respect for those folks.\n\nHowever I'd recommend not doing on-campus freshman dorms. You'll feel more out of place, even though you're only 23. If affordable, go with an off-campus apartment. Plenty of \"older\" folks (grad students, local young professionals, etc) live in arrangements like that.\n\nI knew many people who were close to your age in college, and they fit in just fine.",

When you get with a tight-knit group of college guys/girls, age doesn't matter as much. I'd encourage you to make the most of your 20s. They fly by way too quick. But like someone else said, you may get sent on beer runs. Congrats on getting clean, that's fantastic. And that isn't easy to do. If you can conquer an addiction, you can definitely do college.

A freshman dorm is likely to feel pretty weird at 23, but given your 2 years of community college you'll probably be a transfer student, rooming with slightly older people. You could also try and find roommates and a house/apartment nearby, though I'm not sure you'd go about that without knowing any students there. Maybe the school will put you in touch with other transfer students. And honestly if you end up living with 18-year-olds, just lean into it. There will be some glaring immaturity (particularly people just learning how to handle alcohol) but it's not like they're children and you could make some great friends as long as you try not to see yourself as above them because of a few years age difference\n\nDon't do online classes, I've done a couple and they suck in comparison with in-person class. Way harder to stay motivated (imo) and you never get to know your classmates or professors. If you do go that route, do your research and do an online program from a real university, there are a lot of for-profit and otherwise scummy online schools where you won't learn as much and your degree won't carry much weight with employers",

In your situation, commuting or living in an off campus apartment would probably be better.",

I can tell you that even though I had the same worries like you, I wanted to have the traditional college experience, and I moved into a dorm (although not a freshman dorm). My suitemates were two sophomores who each had their single, and another freshman who for whatever reason was matched to share the room with me (he might have been a bit older too, but definitely not 25). \n\nBtw, I started college in the spring semester. In my first semester, I made friends (mainly by asking random groups of people to sit with them in the cafeteria) and after the summer, I moved into a suite with 7 guys that were all rising sophomores, but all like 19. I had a fantastic year, we had so many fun parties in that suite, I had a girlfriend and wasn\u2019t there for all of them, but all in all, I had a college experience that could have not been better in hindsight. My age never felt like an issue to me. Did people sometimes give me a weird look when they learned I was 25 or older? Sure! But that was very rare, and my friends and classmates certainly didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m sure some people made fun of me behind my back, but again, all in all I feel like I had a great time, a great group of friends, and I loved my classes. I would have absolutely hated to take even one class online. I\u2019m so glad I went the traditional route. I lives on campus until the end of my junior year, by the way, and moved into a shares apartment for my senior year. Oh, and I never got asked to buy alcohol by my suite mates, not once. They all had their fakes.",

Most colleges should have some sort of older college housing, though that is mostly for upper classmen, I would see if you could talk to your school and move in there? Starting college late is nothing to be ashamed of and might actually be a plus when it comes to life experience outside of college. Overall, you can have that traditional college experience and still be older, your classmates won\u2019t think any different of you. I would talk to housing at your college of choice once you\u2019ve been accepted, if you haven\u2019t already, and see what you could do for moving into a dorm with students who are on the older side. Also, most off campus apartments I\u2019ve seen, are filled with older people, so that could also be an option. If you find later that you can\u2019t do in person classes, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for purely online classes if that\u2019s where you find you learn best. Remember, in most cases, online classes can still mean that you can do things on campus, especially if you live on or are close enough to campus and it\u2019s not strange for people you meet in class to also be doing an online class, ultimately figure out what is best for you and your learning.",

I want to own a dive bar that serves gourmet bar food, or just be a high paid person who does cool shit all the time, like a celebrity or something. \n\nMy after graduation plans may be different from my younger classmates as I'm continuing my education in pursuit of a second career. My first career was as an active duty Marine for 20 years.  The plans will most likely include a lot of freaking out (swerving) and maybe some travel to cannabis friendly areas. Ideally, I would find employment at a place for a year or three (looking at hotels and gaming industry) and then move on to pursuing entrepreneurship. \n\nI did an internship while in culinary school at an upscale private beach club. It was a great experience. (We cooked so much freaking food!)  I have not done an internship for my current (HTM) degree. There were several offered at the beginning of the (spring 2020) semester and I'm glad I didn't pursue them due to COVID 19 shutting everything down. My professors send out internship, professional devopment opportunities, and job announcements frequently. \n\nCurrently awaiting the start of summer classes and trying to find trouble to get in to.",

Plus, professors may like you more. At the end of the day, it's your future and your education.\n\nThere's a sentiment I've seen along the lines of \"You don't want to go to college because you'll be 40 when you graduate, but in 4 years, you'll be 40 anyways.

I had many detours in life and it also stressed me out a lot to start college from scratch (I had attended 2.5 years at a different college and transfered into FRESHMAN year). It definitely took some getting used to in the beginning but going to college (FIT) was the best decision I've made so far. Now that I'm older, it's so much clearer what my goals are and why I'm doing it - it's better than college at 19 because you don't go through all the young adult angst. Also, I was surprised at how many others were my age and had transferred. Don't let your age hold you back - you have another 70 years of life ahead of you, this won't matter in the long run.",

Now I'm 22 and just wrapped up my first semester of university since having a two year break.\n\nNobody is too old to go back to school these days, its all about motivation. I know people that are going into their thirties, living on campus and still working towards their degree. There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nIt wouldnt be weird to stay in a dorm, if nothing else it gives you a means to meet others. However, keep in mind that not all people enjoy living in dorms, regardless of their age. Several friends of mine dormed in their first years of university and they outright hated it. They started commuting from their parent's home and had a much better experience.\n\nIf you really dont feel comfortable, there are alternatives to the dorm experience. Some universities have co-ops (cooperatives) on their campus where students can rent out rooms for a cheaper price than most campus housing, some may even include groceries/meals in the rent. I would check your school's resources, some may have listings for housing and/or roommates.\n\nBest of luck to you!!",

Really, college should be meant for people that feel it is necessary for their careers to go to college, but that can be whenever. Your delayed attendance of college, while minuscule in the grand scheme of college, is actually helping college students by dropping the cost if the amount of students going to college were either spread out or decreased.\n\nMoral of the story: Go to college when you have to.

Then the last semester during my Bachelor's degree, I broke my leg. Try to study while on Percocet. Lol! IDK, mother nature trying to tell me to slow down I guess. For me, I just wanted to finish up as fast as possible. Pretty much blew off any social life for 1.5 years. It was very stressful. All I did was go to work and spend all my free time doing homework and writing papers. I also had to give a speech each week on whatever assigned topic for 3 of the 5 classes.",
