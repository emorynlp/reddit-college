  "title:": "Realizing Academics isn\u2019t Meant for me in my senior year of college",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my second to last semester of getting my degree in Industrial Engineering. I have come to realize that academics isn\u2019t meant for me. Yes, I have almost finished up my 4 years but in the past and recently, I have spurts of really bad struggles of doing well in my classes. I do find my degree interesting and worthwhile but have came to a realization that my heart isn\u2019t in academics. Although the courses will set me up for industry jobs, I feel as if I am not able to connect academically in terms of studying and applying them in my head. I work extremely hard due to having past struggles and I just don\u2019t do well enough to my standards. I put a lot of pressure on myself to do great but I continue to disappoint myself. I applied for our 4+1 program for a masters degree but I\u2019ve decided not to pursue it anymore.\n\nHas anyone felt this way before? What did you do? Any advice or suggestions you could give me to ease the pain I am enduring mentally?",

      "text": "Start looking for jobs **now.** Once you have a job, you can then reject your acceptance to the master's program.\n\nJust stick it out. You don't want to be in a position where you've spent 3 years getting this degree and have nothing to show for it. Nobody cares about an almost-completed industrial engineering degree.",
