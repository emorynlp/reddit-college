Make a playlist with videos of Tyler Dewitt, Organic Chemistry tutor, Professor Dave etc. these are some I used to get through general chemistry in a 7 week summer semester. Watch videos and do practice problems from your professor or textbook.",

Many people don't study for 1 week.\n\nThe problem is ensuring the 2 weeks is not procrastinating, which many don't.\n\nIf you actively sit down a few hours a day for 2 weeks, you'll earn an A no problem.\n\n---\n\nAs for a 'schedule', make them short, daily sessions, with reasonable breaks; cramming in bursts doesn't work (may vary). You may have either two separate, or  combined sessions.\n\nIdeally, set sessions early; that your brain is rested, and, set them ~1-hour after a meal; past digestion.\n\nSet alarms 30 and 5 minutes prior. At 30min, begin resting and lightening activity beforehand. At 5 min, go to the study area and gather material. Set a 10 minute break halfway. At that time, relieve yourself, drink, and eat lightly.\n\nWhen finished, eat a meal.\n\nLastly, fix your sleep schedule if need be.",
