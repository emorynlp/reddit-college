  "text": "Can anyone help me make a schedule with 35 hours of classes (8:50 to 4 pm with a lunch break of one hour) and then 3-4 hours of work Mon-Saturday, 4 hours of work on alternate Sundays (yes part-time culture in India is fucked)?\n\nCommuting from my dorm to campus will take around 30 minutes (I'm still not there yet. Just started freshman year and will go there soon). I would love it if I'd be able to go to the gym too but I don't think I would be able to make time for that. I'm double majoring in Economics and Political Science. \n\nI am a night person and hate waking up in the morning (ik. I have to get used to it from now on). \n\nso folks in college, can you please give me advice regarding how I should manage my time?",
