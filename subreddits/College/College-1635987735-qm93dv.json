  "text": "So I have two lab instructors, and one at the start of the term told us that she doesn\u2019t care for formalities and we can call her by her first name.  My other lab instructor didn\u2019t provide his preferred title.  I suppose I internalized \u201clab instructors go by first name\u201d and have used first name for both, since day one.  \n\nToday I heard another student call him \u201cprofessor\u201d, and it dawned on me that I may have been inadvertently disrespecting him.  I now feel very ashamed.  How bad is it?",

              "text": "First name is very common with grad student TAs, unless they tell you something else. It varies but I think it's not a huge deal. I don't even remember what I told students to call me when I was a TA, but I am 100% sure I did not care. TBH grad student TAs are probably just happy you aren't yelling at them or complaining to their professor, because they're usually trying to juggle this job with their research, which is the \"real job\" that they have to make progress at to continue in the PhD program. So if you are nice to them and not hugely demanding, you can probably call them whatever, if they didn't explicitly say otherwise.",

How do you prefer to be addressed?\"  \n\nThe student will reply \"Tim\" or \"Mr. Smith\" or whatever, and then you'll know.  \n\nIf it's something different from what you've been using all semester, you don't need to get flustered and fall on your knees apologizing or whatever.
