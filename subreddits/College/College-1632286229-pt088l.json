The prof teaches straight from the textbook, and what\u2019s in the textbook doesn\u2019t match what\u2019s on the homework and quizzes (homework and quizzes don\u2019t match either). I spend about 8 hours a week on the homework (after multiple attempts I usually am able to max out at an 80%), and an additional 2-3 hours trying to study the material myself, but nothing seems to get through my head and we\u2019re in week 4 and I don\u2019t understand anything. It\u2019s starting to affect my other classes because I truly don\u2019t have time or energy for my other studies. I\u2019ve tried to sign up for tutoring, but the only time they have accounting tutoring is when I\u2019m in other classes. As well as that, the prof\u2019s business hours are while I\u2019m in another class and I can\u2019t speak to him after class because I have to sprint to the other side of campus for a class afterward. There\u2019s an exam this Friday, and I\u2019m just stuck and I don\u2019t know what options I have at this point.", "author": "dvd-player", "created": 1632286229, "retrieved": 1632800930, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
