Others may have dropped out due to online school, I have two friends who did. To add onto this, many people dropped out mid-semester and are now unable to pay back their financial aid money which is an obstacle to going back.",

Pandemic, changing job market, economic uncertainty, rising costs of not just education but also living, lots of non traditional jobs out there now that might not require a degree. Many in demand skills are often self taught like \u201ccontent creators\u201d in the many different ways that can look. I know many people think you can learn things equally well online with free resources. It could be so many things!",

Federally backed student loan debt means that colleges can charge ludicrous premiums without fear of retaliation from creditors refusing to offer student loans. \n\n3.) We live in a stagnant economy, especially in our current, artificially spawned recession. The computational world has seen decent growth, where most engineering and physical sciences have been moving very slow.\n\n4.) I know that homogeneous University culture and politics can be off-putting to some people. If you are a person who holds contrarian views, it will be difficult to communicate those opinions in a university setting without some social backlash and isolation. \n\nI really don\u2019t think an untracked college degree is worth it. In fact, it is very saliently not worth it at all if fiscal stability is your goal. \n\nAsk yourself: am I doing this for the social credential or my future?",
