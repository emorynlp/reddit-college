  "title:": "I Can't bring myself to do essays, its a wrap for me",
  "text": "I've been in College for four years and it's getting to the point where its impossible for me to do essays. I have no problem doing homework and other assignments in my math and accounting classes. However; English is gunna be my downfall. Its to the point where now when I'm trying to do an essay it'll literally take me three to four hours to write 30 words. I mainly just sit there and stare at my screen thinking about how much I don't wanna do this. Its ridiculous because I only have one English class I have to pass before I'm able to transfer to a university, and I don't even want to do it lmaoo.  Now I'm worried even if I do pass I'm gunna transfer and the university is gunna be filled with me writing more bullshit essays about stuff that's not even real. It sucks because there's so many things I wanna do In life with my degree and this damn English class is the only thing getting in the way of that. I'm a believer in everything happens for a reason and I'm starting to think that I'm not able to write these because I wasn't meant to go to college. Lack of motivation isn't the issue as I'm currently working toward getting my real estate license and becoming a volunteer firefighter which are pretty much the only things on my mind these days, but this just ain't it haha. My momma didn't raise a quitter but dear god it might be a wrap because I can't write worth of shit.",

      "text": "It's not impossible at all. You can do it. Just make a step-by-step plan for how you're going to construct the essays. Start by choosing a topic. Then, brainstorm a list of ideas you have about the topic.  Once you've got some more specific issues within your topic, come up with a thesis statement. After you make your central claim (thesis), come up with a list of reasons you could use to justify your central claim. Look for pieces of evidence (scholarly research, assigned readings, lecture videos, etc) that you can use to prove your case. Make an outline of what you intend to write, staring with the thesis and body paragraph arguments. Save the intro and conclusion for later. Write your thesis statement and your body paragraphs. Once you're done writing out the bulk of your paper, then you can come up with a relevant opener and closer. Then, proofread, revise, and turn it in. It's always safer to check it multiple times over and to get other people's feedback too before you submit. \n\nYou don't have to do it all at once. Take one step, then take a break. Work on something else, then take a break. Come back to your essay and do another step. Take another break. Work on a different something else. Take an extra long pause to eat and relax for a while. Get back to the essay and do a few more steps. Be proud of yourself and go to bed. Repeat the next day, and again and until you've finished the assignment.",

The music really helps me concentrate since I like a background noise when I'm writing. Or if you prefer you can have a TV show, podcast, or movie playing in the background. Just listening to anything really helps me.\n\n\u2022Take a break every page you write: I like to stop writing and take a 10-15 minute break after I write a page on my essay. It gives me motivation to get the page I'm on done and gives me time to do something I like between pages I usually browse reddit, text friend, and call my parents too.\n\n\u2022Write about things you care about: If your professor is letting you pick your own topic, pick something you actually want to do. One of my classes let me do this, and we had to watch one movie and one TV show that depicted similar crimes and compare them. It was a 10 page paper due by the end of the semester. I chose American psycho and Dexter because those happen to be my favorite TV show and movie. This tip really just helps me be more interested in what I am writing about and more excited to do the research.",

      "text": "Just do your research on your topic and find your resources you want to use first. Then layout how you want your essay to go(basically your talking points, one point for each paragraph), add an opening sentence to the beginning and a recap or conclusion sentence at the end. Then add sentence to each point you uave to make and expand on it, repeat for each point you have and then fill up your opening and closing paragraphs. English is one of my worst subjects and this is how I deal with writing papers, I use this method to spit out 20 page papers in about 2 hours on the first try and get at least a b+ on them.",
