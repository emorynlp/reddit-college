  "title:": "The Psychology Debrief: A podcast for students studying Psychology",
  "text": " Hi,\n\nMy name is Dr. Sam Fairlamb and I am a teaching-focused lecturer in the Psychology Department at Royal Holloway. I am passionate about supporting students learning, and in line with that have developed a new YouTube channel where students can learn more about Psychology and the ways it can apply to real world issues (such as COVID-19). I also plan to release other content on the channel down the line such as essay writing tips.\n\nI am hoping some of you might find this interesting, and if so consider subscribing to the channel. Our third episode, which will be about experiencing failure, will be up on Monday! [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPetSFSh6Oasx0h4nvpmoA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPetSFSh6Oasx0h4nvpmoA)\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. Thanks!\n\nSam.",
