  "text": "so I took off the last two semesters from school due to personal reasons. is there a way to redo my classes without it showing up on my transcript if I get a bad grade? I don\u2019t remember anything from my bio or chem classes but I got an A in both so I don\u2019t want to change my current grade if I mess up when retaking the class. I have a 3.87 GPA and don\u2019t want to ruin it.",
