Need advice on time management", "text": "Sometimes I work on homework for up to 12+ hours in a day. I just sit in my room and work. I don't come out to eat or socialize. If I don't forget to eat, I'll usually use food as a reward. I get about 3-4 hours of sleep before I'm back at it again..and that's if I sleep at all. There's no time schedule, somedays I'll just wake up at random hours and start doing homework. I can't stay organized and my thoughts are going at 100 miles an hour, some are even repetitive and it's hard to focus on my work. I'm not on Adderall or any medication. This just all feels like pure energy or something, it's like I can't stop. It feels like I can't take a break or I'll get all panicked. I'm sorry if I don't make sense, it's hard to make sense right now. Just want help managing my time please.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I've been feeling paranoid as well, another factor as to why I can't sleep on top of the energry. Like I said no drugs, this just naturally happens. It's either this or I fall behind on everything and become a depressed mess due to the guilt of procrastination. Sometimes it's a mixture of both(which is my normal I guess).", "author": "SpaceC0wb0y_", "created": 1611543200, "retrieved": 1632947338, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1066, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"glrp5z5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/l4ea47/please_help_i_do_homework_for_12_hours_this_is/glrp5z5/", "text": "I\u2019m probably in the vast minority, but so far, as a freshman in college, I barely spend more than 5 hours a week studying.

During my first 2 years of college, I sacrificed my social life, my mental health, my physical health (the forgetting to eat, sleeping a few hours a day and for me, drinking coffee like water and not exercising at ALL) in the hopes that I am going to ace every class. Honestly, I regret that for many reasons. First, acing every single class is not an achievable goal for most students. Sometimes you study for hours and days for a class and it just doesn\u2019t click and you end up not doing great. It took me a while to realize it and actually BELIEVE that it is okay to not get As. Second, not taking care of my mental and physical health just lead me to feel awful in my head and my skin and in the end, lead to me procrastinating even more because I was exhausted and anxious. The accumulated stress actually made me less able to focus on my work and I ended up doing worse than I could have done if I just had taken the few hours a day to take care of myself. Third, friends and acquaintances are fucking important. You don\u2019t need to make best friends in college but people strive on human connection and emotional support. Even people you barely know can help you out and give you tips (reddit showed you that). Just knowing that other people are in the same boat as you gives some sense of relief. Helping out other people make you feel better about yourself. Just talking and unwinding can make you feel relieved. \n\nI don\u2019t know if that little paragraph will convince you about how important it is to take care of yourself but please, just give it a try and I promise that once you are just a little more relaxed, you\u2019re going to see your work as easier and more enjoyable and in the end, you\u2019ll probably do even better in your school work. \n\nThis is how I started out and I hope it will help you, even if it\u2019s a little bit. \n\n1. Set reasonable expectations for your goals for each class. Instead of \u201cI want to get an A in every class\u201d try to think \u201cI am going to understand the material the best I can and do my best on my assignments and exams, and it\u2019s okay if it means not acing it) \n2. Write down/ type on a calendar what your commitments are during a typical week (classes, club meetings, etc) \n3. Take a piece of paper, open your syllabus for a class and write down what you need to do every week for each class. Example: physics class: - reading chapter + small homework due every MWF at 8 am; - quiz due Sunday at 11:59 pm\n4. Set a time in your weekly schedule to finish your work for each class. To continue on the physics\u2019 class example, I decided that right after each physics class on MWF, I am going to do the readings for the next class and the short homework. Saturday I reviewed the material and took the quiz.\n5. For exams and big assignments, you\u2019ll literally have free time in your schedule to study for them since all the routine work has a time to be completed. \n6. Incorporate time to eat for every day. I know that being anxious make you forget to eat, so I think this is crucial bc you need food to function, even if you feel like you don\u2019t. Also, since eating is a time of the day you NEED to commit to, try to find someone to share it with. Eat with or facetime a friend during lunch. Maybe shoot a text and check up on someone. \n7. Incorporate time to exercise. Personally, I think that with my schedule, it was impossible to work out every day like my friends did. I started with working out once a week and then progressively, I WANTED to work out more and more. Now it\u2019s 4 times a week and I have never felt better. Just find a pace that fits you and start with it. \n8. Finally, set an end time to your studying time. Like 9 pm, close your books and do anything other than studying. Meditate, shower, eat, go out, hang out with someone; do whatever you enjoy doing. \n\nDM me if you need to, I\u2019ll be happy to help.", "author": "salismith", "created": 1611599737, "upvotes": 1}, "gkqhfkn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/l4ea47/please_help_i_do_homework_for_12_hours_this_is/gkqhfkn/", "text": "This happens to me as well but not to this extent.

I\u2019ve finally been able to sleep at 2am instead of 4-5am (12-1am is the goal) and designated an hour on Sunday nights to plan the new week. I take the time to familiarize myself with the upcoming assignments and sometimes begin an outline, or something of the sorts. I use a planner app that\u2019s tailored for students and allows you to enter detailed information in an organized manner which I find useful. I try to add the page-count for a chapter or section; honestly, so I know how much time to plan in case I decide to change things around (or reward myself with a night to relax). It\u2019s a process. It has been quite challenging to say the least, however,  I\u2019m seeing results. What I\u2019ve learned thus far is proper nutrition is important to your overall energy and brain power (vitamins, and avoid foods that\u2019ll make you tired when studying), exercise (such as walking a dog, or walking in general), pre-planning, and consistency. I\u2019ve had great days and I\u2019ve had harder days, but I\u2019m just trying to stay positive and get back up when necessary.

Create a plan. \nThis can be a schedule or something as simple as fridays are this class and saturdays are this class and friends are sundays. Best advice I got from the valedictorian. \"Do what's worth your time. It required self discipline to do the hard things you need help with but there isn't anything to learn from doing things you have down. After all there there to learn not do.\"\n\n2. Go to office hours. \nEasiest way to turn 6hrs of work into 2hrs is office hours. Professors are there to teach if they want to do research and have no time for students they should have gotten a research grant from industry or worked in a professional lab. They are professors first. Also no professor will be upset for dumb questions. After all the height of education know all to well sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something. Be brave be honest and trust they will help you. 12+ hrs is enough to ask for some help. \n\n3. Manage your expectations. \nNot everything will be perfect. Not everything will work out. Take it as a lesson for real engineering. You will never have all the time you want to make it something your proud af about. An old axiom I heard my freshman year a long time ago was \"the engineer who makes it perfect the first time will never work again\" I thought it meant something a lit like automation work smarter not harder. I quickly found out that that isn't the case do it enough. Worry about things worth worrying about. Big project spend some time on it. But don't finish it in one night. \n\n4. Make friends in class\nIt makes you go to class. First step to passing is showing up. Also engineering is no place for ego we all have to know all of the fundamentals and we end up in the same classes. Ask for help amd trust they might ask you. Return the favor and understand you need to know it it's not a competition of knowing fundamentals more. \n\n5. Its about learning not performing. \nTake it easy and try to be the best you can not more.", "author": "zechositus", "created": 1611551485, "upvotes": 5}, "gkoeh0s": {"link": "/r/college/comments/l4ea47/please_help_i_do_homework_for_12_hours_this_is/gkoeh0s/", "text": "I would recommend that you consider the pomodoro method.

People do it on YouTube too with and without music so you could do it with them and then eat, take mini-naps, and relax over the breaks.

None of that is normal, even for people who have severe time management issues.\n\nIf you're not exaggerating and this is an ongoing problem, I'd seriously consider contacting your school's mental health services ASAP. I am no psychologist, but what you describe sounds a lot like mania, which is a serious condition and one that warrants being seen by a professional. Even if that's not the issue, reaching out to somebody about this problem will help get you other academic support like tutoring, academic skills workshops, accommodations for classes, etc...Every university has resources like these, some of which might need a referral from the counseling/mental health services.\n\nIn the meanwhile, take a look at this definition and see what you think: The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania) touches on this, but a manic episode is described by the DSM-5 (basically the Bible of psychology) as:\n\n\"A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day.\n\nDuring the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\"\n\nAgain, I do not mean to armchair diagnose you or suggest you internet diagnose yourself, you really would be best served talking to a professional.
