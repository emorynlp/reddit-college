I told my mom she can\u2019t track me in college and she immediately asked me \u201cwhat are you going to be doing that I can\u2019t know about????\u201d. I have never done anything. Like seriously ANYTHING. I have no friends, have never gone to a party, haven\u2019t had a sleep over since the 9th grade, never snuck out, never been in a wreck, never underage drank without them knowing and never done anything ever. But she still tracks me on Life360. She then asked \u201cwell do you want me calling and texting you all the time?\u201d  She already does this WITH the tracking. She threatened to take my car, take my phone, and not pay for room and board (I got tuition and fees paid for). She is overly cautious of everything and the type that goes to bed at 8 pm. I\u2019m careful but she just plain out doesn\u2019t do anything ever and has no desire to ever. I know it\u2019s downtown Birmingham and it\u2019s dangerous but roommates track roommates! And friends track friends. I don\u2019t want to do anything crazy in college, I just want to be able to go out without my mommy knowing my every move. Is she being ridiculous or me?\n\nUPDATE: Wow! I am so surprised and honored so many of you cared about me and my situation to respond to me\ud83d\ude2d and I got two hugging bear awards??! I\u2019ve read about half of the comments so far and y\u2019all have suggested everything from softwares, burner phones, sucking it up, going out anyways, a heart to heart, paying for my own stuff, loans, and everything in between. And some suggesting my mother may even be right. \n\nTo clarify some things: I am 18, I will be 19 this year, I have a job but I just can\u2019t make enough to support myself yet, my DAD (who I don\u2019t think anyone has considered yet) is partially on my side, Birmingham is dangerous but my mom is especially scared bc she is not from the city. \n\nMy mother is controlling and overly cautious of everything. She is toxic but I don\u2019t believe her to be \u201cabusive\u201d (maybe that\u2019s just the language of the abused though). She also 1000% has anxiety as someone suggested. I understand why she wants to track me, I really do. But I just want to go out to eat with friends without her asking me who I am with, when we will be back, how is Sarah\u2019s mom?, and what I ate...\n\nI want more than anything to be independent. I acknowledge that I\u2019m not yet (and it kills me). I make $8.50 an hour and am trying to come up with another \u201cside hustle\u201d too. \n\nI appreciate you all.

She needs help, and she needs to know that her demands are unreasonable. \n\nWith all this in mind, there is a proposal of a compromise. Since Dad seems more reasonable, what if Dad has the Life360, with a pass code that he can use to check up on you... but also play as a bouncer to mom's anxiety.

One parent came all the way from China because their adult (they were in grad school so NOT a child) didn't answer the phone. I'll never forget the look on the student's face. I just looked at them like all you had to do was answer the phone. I think to help you and your parent avoid all of this, a serious heart-to-heart needs to be had. I could see if you gave them any reason to be distrustful but you haven't. It could be possible they are dealing with excessive worrying (I don't want to diagnose her but sounds like they might need to talk to a professional and see if anxiety could be to blame) For her peace of mind you both need to start giving and establishing a sense of independence now. Her worst fears are based on a lot of reality, to be honest. Some students do go off to college and get buck WILD! I saw it as an undergrad and in my career. But that doesn't mean that will be your fate. Trust and communication will be very important moving forward or these will be some very miserable college years. You need to have a backup plan though because I have seen some parents do something as shiesty and conniving as stopping payments for dating someone they didn't approve, poor grades, changing majors, or the absolute worst in my opinion after their child comes out as LGBTQ.

There obviously isn\u2019t compromise with her. Let her track you. I think the lesson is that when people do things for you expect that there are strings attached. Try your hardest to get to a place where you don\u2019t need to get help from others (more like handouts) and be self sufficient. Look, these are crazy times. She obviously needs boundaries but as a mom I can tell you I carried my son for 9 months and am raising my child everyday putting in so much work. If something happens I want to know right away I want to go kill someone if I have to before they can hurt my baby. I can see where she\u2019s coming from as the mother and also understand from your perspective because I had crazy parents who did the same thing to me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ok let me be clear.. but look at what you\u2019re getting.. free college? Her requirement is that she tracks you. What you can do is get a job and get another phone pay your own bills and leave the phone in your dorm. As long as it\u2019s just the life 360 I don\u2019t see the problem. I don\u2019t know the whole relationship or why she is like that so I can\u2019t really judge. My parents were abusive and controlling because they didn\u2019t want to get caught and liked sabotaging me. I got the if I can\u2019t track you I won\u2019t pay for college too. Look, she\u2019s not going to let go. You can try to sit down and have a boundaries discussion (RESPECTFULLY AND CALMLY) with a mediator.. but know that may be the start of many discussions. She might just not budge. She\u2019s an adult. You\u2019re now an adult and learning how the world works. One day she can\u2019t track you. What do you want to do? Do you want her to pay for college and you just turn on life 360? Or do you say no to that and go into debt or drop out? It\u2019s up to you. I\u2019m not trying to make you feel bad either.. it really is up to you what you want to do. Try your hardest in your youth to look at this with long term perspective. Breathe. Our family can get under our skin the most sometimes. I understand that. I don\u2019t know what the situation is with your mom. But you can only control yourself. Think about talking through it with her with a mediator perhaps prepare with a therapist far in advance, let her track you or you take on the payments. Breathe deep, plan and think. You\u2019re not being ridiculous and she is being a mom. Moms tend to have a hard time letting go and tend to be fiercely protective of their babies. I\u2019m a mama bear myself. She hopefully will learn boundaries eventually. Maybe buy the book boundaries and read it then suggest she reads it and tell her how you feel about this over a lunch you pay for and again come prepared and calm. It will happen eventually.

I\u2019m a bit opposite in that I\u2019ve done some crazy sh*t in college, so my parents have reason to be concerned and to want to track me. I\u2019ve been a good kid my whole life, though, and, up until college, never did anything or even wanted to try anything crazy. Even when I do, I\u2019m cautious and I talk with close friends about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ve talked to my parents about it since they were raging at me about spending the night at my boyfriend\u2019s place. Out of all the things they could be raging at me about and that was what they chose. Granted, I grew up in a religious household and, while I do still hold those beliefs, I still want to do some self discovery and do some exploring in college life. Of course, you do you, and you do what makes you happy, so if that\u2019s not something you wanna do, that\u2019s totally fine. But regardless, when you go to college, you\u2019re an adult and it\u2019s about time your parents start letting up on the reigns AT LEAST a little bit. It took me a lot of talking to them before they stopped threatening me in the same way, and they still track me, but they\u2019ve let up on it. If you haven\u2019t already, I recommend sitting down with them and trying to tell them to trust you, especially since you\u2019re an adult now. Try explaining to them that, especially since it sounds to me like you\u2019ve been a good kid, to let you go out and start experiencing your life without the helicopter parent over the shoulder. Eventually, your mom isn\u2019t going to be there to supervise everything and you\u2019ll need to know how to be dependent and not lean on her. The more she can understand that now, the more it can improve your parent-child relationship and the more she can trust you, especially if you once in a while feel like you want to/can tell her some positive things about your college life.

She is the one being ridiculous. Part of the entire point of college is to finally separate yourself from your parents and learn how to become an adult without being under the rule or influence of other adults for the first time in your life. You\u2019re supposed to figure out who you are and test out independence so that you can get used to the idea of having to take care of yourself just to be sure that you can make it alone. Colleges provide things like room and board so that you can test out having to remember to go eat and having the most advantageous dwelling as possible very close to campus. Eventually you\u2019ll likely want to move off campus into an apartment and feed yourself but you\u2019ll quickly notice that it\u2019s hard to maintain apartment rent and it\u2019s harder to get to classes and the food you buy and cook yourself kind of sucks and that cooking every day for yourself isn\u2019t really all that fun.\n\nHaving your mom track you during all of this is problematic. It\u2019s not about whether you will be doing anything wrong (you probably will from time to time), but having all of your movements watched in a way that isn\u2019t passive, but active and involved. Honestly, if she ends up tracking you at college, then it may just be worth your while to leave your phone in your dorm room 100% of the time. It\u2019s really not worth having a college experience if every single thing you do is being watched by someone. And you have to not answer the phone every five seconds for your parents when you go to college. That\u2019s an unreasonable hold they have over you.\n\nA lot of parents talk about how important it is that their freedoms are respected, that they want to be able to exercise their personal freedoms without being told what to do, but this is entirely ironic given that so many parents these days are incredibly and overly involved in their children\u2019s lives in an authoritarian way. They don\u2019t realize that the authoritarian rule they have other children right now is going to cause a gut reaction in their own child\u2019s lives that will make them resist the idea of any kind of authoritarian rule for now and forever, especially the type that watches over people 24/7 or that enforces rules or tells people what drugs they can and can\u2019t do or what genders they have to be. I feel like your generation is going to be so repulsed by the idea of not being able to exercise their own freedoms after living in homes of people who control your every movement or at least watch them that you\u2019ll never agree to live in or sustain an environment like that ever again.\n\nSo, yeah, stop that crap as soon as you can because it\u2019s ridiculous and you\u2019ll be an adult.

I think your mom is just extremely worried about you and wants to make sure you\u2019re safe and she can find you if anything happens. God forbids something does happen and your mom can\u2019t find you I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll feel terrible at not being able to do anything. \n\nWhy should your mom having your location stop you from having fun though? Lol my mom has my location and I still live my life as normal I go to clubs, bars, shopping, etc. You\u2019re an adult if your mom wants your location in return to paying for college don\u2019t let that stop you from living your life and meeting friends! \n\nAre you super close to home where she\u2019ll be able to drive to you?", "author": "girl-w-glasses", "created": 1622737250, "upvotes": 1}, "h0gefcn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nrf11d/my_mom_threatened_to_not_pay_for_college_if_she/h0gefcn/", "text": "Honestly, that seems extreme but she is a mother and like most mother's, she also worries, all of the mothers do. Based on what you said, honestly a good idea would be to have a sit down with her and just discuss about this situation and try to explain how college works, if she is super against everything, you can try to ease her into giving you more freedom by telling her that you can call her once in a morning and once in the evening and go to once in a evening after a while etc etc.\n\nObviously, you try to find ways to sneak out and do all the things as she is not going to be there and no matter how hard she tries to track you, there are going to be scenarios that she can't do that and it's gonna escalate even harder.\nSo, the way I see if the best way is to straight out talk to her, now changes might not happen immediately and you might have to be patient but always try to acknowledge her feelings and express that you understand where she is coming from and that she needs to believe that everything she has taught you until now will help you in college and thank her for paying everything and for taking care of you.\n\nJust keep explaining things to her but try to do it as gently as possible while also acknowledging her teaching, sacrifices etc. \n\nThis is just my opinion based on what you have said and it might not work 100% but I still believe that communication is key.
