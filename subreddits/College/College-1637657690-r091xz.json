  "text": "**TLDR:** I don't see why it matters if I go to a diverse college or not (racially & ethnically or otherwise). Just read the two bullet points at the bottom.\n\nI'm a Community College student that has been thinking about transferring, and thinking about how much diversity (mainly race & ethnicity but also in other ways) matters for the college experience. I'm Bengali American, I don't practice religion nor do anything cultural, I'm more like your typical American in that sense I guess. While my CC is only 40% white, I've been doing it all online so far.\n\nI've always heard that diversity is important but can't tell exactly why it matters for my college experience. I grew up in a diverse city (I don't wanna say which one, but it's even called \"a diversity bubble.\" My high school was 38% white, but it was well known that students of color were concentrated in low level classes and vice versa (I was surrounded by white students in most classes, but I didn't care at all). The one low level class I did in high school (in 9th grade) was the only one with more POC than white students (only 2 of them). I don't think any diversity I've been exposed to has had any or much of an effect in my life. In fact, I think I would be relatively the same person even if my city and school system had a much higher percentage of white people.\n\nI spent a good amount of time googling and reading various posts about diversity in college, and they just list general things like interacting with people of different backgrounds (not only race but socioeconomic status, political views, religion, etc.) which somehow prepares you for the real world for working with people very different from you, and gives you new perspective on things. **Would I not be prepared or not be able to do those if I don't get exposed to people different from me? Would I be unable to \"relate\" to different people?** (I think relate meaning empathize or sympathize, not necessarily having shared a similar experience to theirs of whatever) The points I read just seem to be vague / general and I haven't found specific examples of how college students have benefited from being in a diverse environment or interacting with different kinds of people.\n\n* If you finished or are in college, do you see benefits or had any positive experiences as a result of spending time with people different from? If you have, be specific about it, giving concrete examples or info. \n* As a POC, Would it make any or much of a difference if I went to a college that was say, 80% white, compared to 40-50% white? Again, I don't care if I'm surrounded my mostly or entirely white students or not.",

      "text": "You should go to a school with POC because when you go to schools with majority white, the city or town is mostly white as well. It\u2019s good to see people alike you. When the schools says like there is 5% of whatever race, that is insignificant compared to the overall population. So going to a school with 50/50 POC and white is better",

      "text": "This topic is centered around race and segregation. Segregation in America ended over 70 years ago, but some folks continue to advocate for it to be reinstated in various ways. This topic seems to be most popular among extremists on both sides of the political spectrum. Unfortunately, an increasing percentage of the minority population are willingly choosing to segregate themselves from the rest society. Needless to say, this does not benefit anyone.\n\nAccording to the latest U.S. Census, this is the current population of the United States by race:\n\n* White - 60.1%\n* Hispanic - 18.5%\n* Black = 13.4%\n* Asian - 5.9%\n* American Indian - 1.3%\n* Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander - 0.2%\n\nIf racially unbiased, nearly every school in the nation would consist of a student body that closely resembles these percentages. Opting instead to attend a school where the population of Black students (for example) is 2-3x higher than the national average would be a form of self-segregation. The only benefit of attending such a school is comfort. You are around people who you can easily identify with. As you have found, there are no social or economic benefit that result from segregation. Most often the opposite is true, where the segregated class is exploited and abused. This is why a war was fought to end segregation and why it has been outlawed for decades.\n\nSelect a school based on the educational quality and the cost of attendance. Those are the only factors that matter. You are paying tens of thousands of dollars for an education, not a social dating experience.",
