I mean, are you aware that this is a real human being that might not be able to do these things, or may already being doing these things? \n\nAlso, lol a combination of fixable daily habits isn't going to fix stress(reductive as f) as though stress is a singular thing existing permanently within one's own control. Wtf\n\nHere's the legit advice\n\nIF YOU CAN\n\nCharge your phone away from your bed\n\nTurn down the lights way earlier than you think you need to, use black out blinds\n\nUse a lamp on a timer as a way to wake up by light instead of sound\n\nAdd as many fruits and veggies as you can to your diet(some is better than none)\n\nTry to park a little farther from places, go outside but don't feel bad if you don't feel comfortable in a gym because covid.\n\nBut, my advice for you is to think about if you're framing things helpfully, or from some place of reductive judgment.
