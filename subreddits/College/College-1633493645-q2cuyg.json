  "text": "Do your colleges allow u to check for plagiarism yourself? My college is saying that we shouldn\u2019t worry about plagiarism if we\u2019ve written it ourself and cited correctly but the profs use checkers once we submit it. What\u2019s the point of them checking it if we can\u2019t check our own work ourselves? And it\u2019s so unclear whether some of these checkers store our work or no, so even if I try to use one myself it might show up as plagiarised when my prof checks it. What do you guys do? Any recommendations?",

      "text": "They use checkers that compare it to a database from other works. They are checking to see if you directly stole work without citing it. There really shouldn't be a need for you to check for plagiarism, but online checkers work if you are paranoid. The online checkers do not store your work without permission.\n\nI don't use plagiarism checkers because as long as you didn't plagiarize there is no need for them. Incorrect citations is not plagiarism, so the worst that will happen is point off for formating errors, which the plagiarism checker won't catch anyway.",

Funny enough, my latest assignment got a 34% because it found the same links and question phrases from other sources. \n\nBut really, plagiarism shouldn\u2019t be an issue if you are paraphrasing or quoting outside sources properly, and citing them. With most of the work being your own thoughts and ideas.",
