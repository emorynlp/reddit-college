  "text": "Hello I'm in my second year of college for hospitality learning about becoming a leader and I find that some of the stuff that I have learned in a previous semester, I just forget, and then there are some other classes that the professor did not teach really good at all, for example, my revenue class, and I am worried that when it comes to graduating in 2023 for me that jobs are not gonna want me due to forgetting the stuff or the professor not teaching the concept well enough.",
