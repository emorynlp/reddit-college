In what topics do you understand *how* to handle a particular type of problem but not *why* it works, versus understanding the *why* but not the *how*, versus understanding both, versus understanding neither. Basically come with specific questions if you can! \n\nA good tutor will ask probing questions and analyze your work for \u201cthreads\u201d of mistakes that you might be making over and over again, but it\u2019s helpful both for you and for them for you to have put some thought into your own strengths and weaknesses ahead of time. It\u2019s also more efficient, which means less expensive. \n\nSide note - shameless advertisement: if you\u2019re in the process of looking for a tutor I\u2019m taking new clients!",

If homework help isn\u2019t allowed you can go in and say i\u2019m having a problem with ____ concept and they should have practice problems available to go over with you.",
