Lucky for me, I had been taking about half of my credits online before covid hit, so the adjustment wasn\u2019t bad at all.

But that's not necessarily because of online classes, more like the consequences of them (and the whole situation).\n\nIn theory, yes, studying from your own space is more comfortable, but my uni does full online with live classes. And with my workload that means I've been sitting here in this 3m\\^3 of space for two semesters now and I'm sick of it. My days were get up early, stare at the screen for classes until afternoon then start working on assignments on the same screens until past midnight then sleep. Rinse repeat because time has no meaning and all structure is gone from your life other than the grind.\n\nAnd this is the same space where I - theoretically - go to relax and unwind. That means all my personal projects and crafting and tinkering is here. Things that by week 4 I'm infinitely more interested in than my streamed lectures which just further erodes my focus. There is a reason most of my uni work is separate on my laptop and my home pc is mostly dedicated to gaming/free time stuff. \n\nIn-person classes meant that I had to move around all day and I had a clearly defined me space where I could relax. Especially since I did most of my studying camping in my friends' dorm rooms. \n\nI'm not an extremely outgoing person. But I need the social interaction. I live in the capital, my university is in the capital an hour of public transport away. Most of my uni friends do not live in the capital.
