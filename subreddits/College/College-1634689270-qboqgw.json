  "title:": "Can you add a Calculating Wizard to a TI 84 Plus?",
  "text": "Everyone in my Statistics class had something called a Wizard on their TI 84 calculators but me.  One has TI 84 Silver Edition, most have a TI 84 CE, and one other student has one looks exactly like my TI 84 Plus - but all of them (even the one \"identical\" to mine) have a Wizard function for finding normalcdf and invNORM.  Mine only allows a single line of input for the lower, upper, median, and standard deviation.  Sometimes it needs a closing ) and sometimes it needs two )) at the end.  \n\nThey are getting fast answers and I am getting Syntax Error the first few tries until I find the just right combination to get the calculation and diagnostic functions to give answers.  I am guessing I need to buy a new calculation with this function to keep up - BUT before I do I thought I just ask if there is a way to \"program\" the one I already have.  ANY IDEAS of ANSWERS out there?",
