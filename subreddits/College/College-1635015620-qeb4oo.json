  "text": "Hello. So I an a third year mechanical engineering student NOT from the united states. There is a chance to participate in a student transfer program to the Northern Arizona University next semester and I am considering going except for the fact that its kind of pricey. Now other than the fact that I am going to enjoy my time there, are there any long term advantages for going? Lets say when I apply for masters degree in the US, will universities say ah he studied in the US before so lets prioritize him instead of the other applicants? Or lets say it makes my CV look better? Or is there not going to be any long term effects. \n\nThank you and I appreciate any truthful help",
