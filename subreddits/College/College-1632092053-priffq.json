  "text": "I am a Freshman at an American university. When I first started my semester, I was a business student. The following week I changed my schedule with my advisor to be an Undecided major. My plan is to just knock out the common core. While we are rearranging my schedule, my advisor throws me into a research writing class and tells me that I should take it because i am at the minimum for credits. I was really upset that she did that. I never wanted to be in the research writing class this semester, and the reason why I was at the bare minimum of credits was that some of the classes I was taking were under 3 credits. So now I have a research paper due at the end of the week and I have been behind in that class since I started. I also have two other papers due in other classes I generally care about. Basically, this research class is too much for me right now, and I don't care about it. There is supposedly a first-year writing class as well that I could have taken but id have to look into it to see if it satisfies the university credit. I can take the research writing class any time I want too. There is a senior pre med in my class. That leads me to the withdraw. I was going to drop out when I was put into the class but decided to hang on and see how it goes. The deadline has long since passed since I could drop it without a W. Now I just want to withdraw because I am too busy. I am not sure what to do, and I probably have the wrong perspective. \n\nthank you to everyone in advanced",

      "text": "Advisors are there to advise you, not to decide for you. I don\u2019t want to say that this is you own fault, but it kinda is, the fact that you are an \u201cundecided\u201d major and have no idea how to structure your classes by your own, it\u2019s kinda your fault that you are in this situation. This is your career, please start learning how to mange it. When enrolling in classes and planning your semester, first look at your requirements, then look at the class catalogue and pick the classes you want to take, structure your schedule by your own before talking to an advisor. When you meet with your advisor, tell them what you came up with and then the advisor will advise you on it. After this then you can decide your schedule. Taking control of your schedule is vital for your success. When you decide what classes you take, and when to take them, college is way easier, you know what\u2019s coming, not curve balls coming your way. \nYou got two options here, clutch, or drop. You can commit and work your hardest to fulfill all your requirements, or you can strategize and drop the class that is dragging you down. If you feel one class puts your other classes at risk, better drop the one. However, I don\u2019t know if you are in some sort of special program that requires you to take a specific amount of units per the semester, if you are, dropping might put you at risk. One W is better than an F, once you drop, you have time to focus on the other classes and feel sort of relieved. Even if you are headed for a C on the class, I would take a W over a C grade. Some universities, I don\u2019t know if this is your case, when you get a C, you\u2019re not allowed to repeat the course. When you get a W you can. I would take a W to later get an A on the class. I will also put it this way, if you are taking four clases, this: A A A W, is better than this: B A B C.",

They say the average people take at my school is 13-15 anyways. I wouldn't be able to drop the class myself at this point. I meet with my advisor Wednesday regarding next semester schedule. I could definitely ask to withdraw that day, but I don't think she will be too happy about it.",
