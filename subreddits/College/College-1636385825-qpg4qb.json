  "text": "I am a freshman in college this year, and my first semester hasn\u2019t been great. I am a procrastinator and on top of that I got very sick for a long time earlier on in the semester. This has lead to the work piling on in all my classes, and Im pretty sure I\u2019m going to fail 3 or 4 out of my 5 classes. What effects will a bad semester have in my future as far as majors or jobs? I know I will do better next semester now that I am adjusted to life here away from home, but how will this semester effect things?",
