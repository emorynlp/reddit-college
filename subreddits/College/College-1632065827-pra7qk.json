  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019m a freshman to college who just started in early September after taking a gap year after high school. I\u2019m having some trouble with studying / HW. So I have most of my classes M-W and 1 morning class Thursday. Now I really want to get stuff done early way before it is due so I have more time to study / myself. I\u2019m split between cramming HW the day it\u2019s assigned on M-W then I have the other 4 days to relax and study. The other option would to split the HW / main studying up between M-F. I was wondering what you guys recommend.\n\nThanks for reading",

      "text": "Question- is your homework actual assignments or largely reading? Because if it\u2019s the latter, then skimming is your friend. Not my words, but from a few of my college professors. Some professors advised us that we wouldn\u2019t have time to complete all our readings and that we should learn how to manage our time and skim properly. It\u2019s worth noting that this method doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but personally if I hadn\u2019t done it, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had time to do anything else. And, despite what someone else in this comments section might say, college isn\u2019t just about studying- forming social relationships and participating in fulfilling activities is also important.  As a graduate, I can tell you that apart from graduate school, most people don\u2019t care about your GPA. \n\nHonestly, I started doing better in my classes when I learned how to skim material. I found that focusing on certain information was better than trying to retain chapters worth of material across multiple classes at once. However, it takes some practice to master. If you wanna do it, I\u2019d advise the following:\n\n-Learn more about the class: figure out what the tests require. For instance, I once took a class that assigned a textbook and separate books. The material from the separate books made up maybe 5% of the exams, the textbook was the other 95%. So I focused on the textbook and just read online recaps of the books. \n\n-Triage: what classes depend on the readings more? If class A has tests about the readings, but class B has essays, then I\u2019d prioritize the Class A readings. You can research and flip through the book for an essay, can\u2019t necessarily do that for a test. \n\n-Adapt your reading techniques: practice skimming, looking for keywords, using a highlighter, making notes. Skip side sections that don\u2019t seem important. Skim fast over sections you understand, dedicate time to sections you don\u2019t. Practice makes perfect.",

      "text": "My method is that I write down assignments in a To Do app as soon as the teacher mentions them. \n\nI use Microsoft To Do and I made one task called Homework and Assignments. Then within that task I can add Steps. The Steps I add are the assignments or reading I have to do that week. I made the task to repeat daily. \nAt the end of the night I check it off and it immediately pops up again. This is very important to me because the steps stay on the task unless I delete them and so the running list of assignments is always available to me yet I feel like I\u2019m closing out the homework task every single day. \n\nI do the same method with house cleaning. I made a repeating task called House Cleaning. Within that task I wrote down the steps (dishes, laundry, vacuuming, bathrooms, etc) at the end of the day I check off the main task even if I haven\u2019t actually done any of the steps\u2026. just to feel accomplished. It immediately pops back up on my list as due tomorrow. \n\nOther than that, I say no to hangouts with friends and family more during the school year and do it in a confident brag type of way. It makes me feel good about keeping the promise to MYSELF to study and work more.",
