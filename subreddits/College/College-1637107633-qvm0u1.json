  "text": "We usually don't talk much but we have a friend in common (Ana) and usually do group projects together (3 people). The guy (John) and I, have already hung out with a group of friends, birthday parties and some random occasions. Today we had to do an presentation, I was paired with Ana and were the only duo who did this project. The professor gave a second chance and let the others to come up with something next week, same topic. John asked us in our group chat (John, Ana and I) if we can send him the PowerPoint, so he can have an idea of the main points and do his research. The thing is, we had JUST presented our project for the whole class and if he had paid attention he could've catched some points. \n\n\n\nAm I exaggerating? I mean, it's not really a big deal and he's a nice guy but I thought it was just lazy to ask when he had just watched our presentation. It took some time to search the subjects related to the topic... and he also had time to do his own research... what do you guys think?",
