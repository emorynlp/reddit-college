  "text": "So I'm in first year of a double-diploma (idk how it's called in eglish) of History/Italian, and before that I repeated first year of \"Economical Management\" (pretty sure it's not the right name) for 2 years in another college. \n\nI have absolutely NO motivation whatsoever, and I don't know what I would rather do if I dropped out. As the title says, I'm 2 months behind, I did nothing, missed a lot of classes (I'm pretty sure I'll get a 0 in three or four classes that I skipped too much), missed a couple of assignments, didn't read any of the books I have to read. \n\n TLDR : Didn't do shit for 2 months, don't even have the material to study, huge piece of shit, thanks.",
