I completed all the questions and even came to him a couple of times during the exam. My exam has been written with a pencil, and I got 26/30. I lost 3 points because one of the questions I didn't attempt. I assigned the meeting with him on January 7 after almost a month after the grade was posted because he was not able to see me earlier. When we met, I didn't expect that I missed a question, and I definitely forgot everything about this exam, but when I came home that's got clear that I actually completed this part, but it has been erased because I personally remember how I was coming to him regarding this part. I got B for this course with 88%, but if this part would be completed I would get almost 94% what would be an A.

Then you sat back down and continued the test without actually answering the question.  Or perhaps.....Frankly, stating that your arrival home \"triggered\" a sudden clarity regarding the situation sounds like you've presented this narrative to your parents who are calling you out on a lie by asking you to pursue the matter further.

Is there anything I can do?\" \n\nAs another commenter mentioned, the much more likelier case is that a fellow student got a hold of your test and erased an answer. Even if the class isn't curved, someone could have just been salty about doing poorly in the course, or wanted to look better, or resented that you seemed to be doing well. Maybe they saw you raise your hand in class and got jealous, or maybe they don't know you and just erased some random answers on random people's tests. \n\nIt's a good idea to bring this to your professor's attention, because first off it's possible this was a more widespread problem, and second off he should have some knowledge about who handled the tests, where they were stored, etc. that could help answer if another student accessed them. \n\n(Not only would suggesting he changed it ruin your chances of him helping you, it's also very implausible. If he had too many A's he could just curve the test or final grades.)", "author": "emelita_mouse", "created": 1579396579, "upvotes": 72}, "feu3yvr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/eqm3o6/professor_erased_my_answer_on_the_final_exam/feu3yvr/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1579382909, "upvotes": 62}, "fetwgq6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/eqm3o6/professor_erased_my_answer_on_the_final_exam/fetwgq6/", "text": "I agree with the other commenter here, I can't think of a single reason why a professor would feel the need to do something like that.
