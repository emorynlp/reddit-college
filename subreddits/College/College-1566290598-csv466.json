  "text": "I move into my dorm in just 6 days and my classes start only 2 days after that, but it feels like I've got to wait an eternity. I'm currently sitting in bed and can't sleep because I'm just too excited to experience what college has to offer. I feel like a kid on Christmas eve, that's the best way I can describe it. Anyone else feel this way, or am I just being naive and overly hopeful?",

Classes just started Monday and I'm so glad because the weekend after move in day was so boring and lonely because I didn't know anybody. I transferred in as a junior because I did most of my Gen Ed's at community college to save as much money as possible. And being 21 in some freshman classes is scary because most people are straight out of highschool and it's a little hard to relate to people. But, this is my first time living this far from my family even if it's not my first time living alone so at least I can relate on that note. And no one knows anyone so I'm relating there too. I've already completed 2 and a half years and I'm still excited for college I hope you keep you're enthusiasm like me!",

While being on your own finally is extremely exciting, it comes with responsibility that usually isn\u2019t included in the stereotypical college dorm scene. There will come a point where while you\u2019re glad you\u2019re on your own, you will miss the security and comfort of your home, so just enjoy the last few days of peace and time with your family before your adventure begins!",

I work 9 hour days, sometimes more, and I still feel like I work less than I did in Uni, albeit with less free time because I now live in an apartment alone and have all the chores to myself.\n\nLook forward to a job, but still cherish the people and time you have in Uni while you have it. :)",

She offered to show me so I followed. She hooks arms with me and swallowed some toothpaste (I assume for hygiene) and whispered in my ear: \"~Lets pretend we're a couple~\" proceeds to lock the bathroom door behind me and me being too insanely freaked out peed the equivalent of all the fresh water in the Saharan desert and then darted out.(May I add she was twice my age like around 45, and complained about having a period after inviting herself into the bathroom with me. I would've been down if she didn't smell like a corpse)\n\n\n2) When then we made it to the motel room afterwards. It was a LOVE MOTEL. Since there was a strict policy on people count per room, 2 of us had to sneak into the room of the other 2 friends. When we turned on the spa; a bubble of organic matter came up and instantly turned off the idea of taking a bath.  We all shared a heart shaped bed with stains on it with a mirror that's on the ceiling facing us. We tried to open up the blanket but it opened up like a door, not like a fabric.\n\n\n3) We then take the Uber home and the Uber driver straight up crashes into a car. She then proceeds to speed away pretending nothing happened.\n\n\nI only wished I said yes to California because I wanted to see if I can almost die of embarrassment there as well",
