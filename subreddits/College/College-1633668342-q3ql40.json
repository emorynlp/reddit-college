  "text": "My university is having an extended, 6-day weekend this week. I had planned to stay on campus, but it sounds like the vast majority of people are going home or vacationing. I've hardly ever been anywhere, so I've made the last-minute decision to travel somewhere. \n\n**Any recommendations?**\n\nIt has to be relatively inexpensive (apparently I'm the only broke on campus :/, I could probably afford a day or two). I'm in New England/the northeast. I don't care where, I just want to see *something.*",

I could be wrong so please correct me if I am! \n\nBut maybe just take some friends to go see Niagara Falls or something. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful there. Tour NYC. Hiking. Cave touring. Amusement parks. Or just take a road trip across all the NE states if you have the money for that. \nSorry for the somewhat vague response but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to come up with something from the ideas I\u2019ve listed \ud83d\ude04",
