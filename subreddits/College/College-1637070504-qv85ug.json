  "text": "Hey Reddit. I'm in college currently for a Heavy Duty/Agricultural Technician course. It's a 2 year diploma. \n\nI'm feeling very burnt out lately. I'm working part time here as well, and my girlfriend is here too. I'm sleeping 8 hours a night, but my days are 12+ hours between school and work. I can only go home every 3 weeks because of work.\n\nI live on campus in a townhouse-thingy with 2 other guys. I don't have a meal plan (couldn't afford it).\n\nBetween work, school, regular life needs, friends, and my girlfriend I'm feeling burnt out. Trying to make time for everything and save money at the same time is incredibly difficult. \n\nAny ideas on how to make this easier on myself? I'm extremely grateful for my girlfriend, who makes the stress alot easier to cope with, but it's still tough. I know I have it in me to succeed, but it's making me unhappy.",

      "text": "I recommend meditation. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone, but some simple 5 minute meditations can help calm yourself a lot. I started doing this daily about a month ago and it made me feel much better day to day. \n\nMy go to routine is as follows: sit down and set a timer for 6 minutes. Close your eyes and focus on your breathing, try to make them calm but comfortable. The speed isn\u2019t too important, just feel comfortable. Keeping your eyes closed, starting counting. When breathing in you\u2019ll count from 1 to 9 and when breathing out from 9 to 1. You want your complete focus to be done on your counting. Don\u2019t think about anything other than the numbers or your breath. I\u2019ve found that trying to visualize the numbers help me focus on them. Just keep going until your timer runs out. The reason you set the timer to 6 minutes is so you have a minute to get into the zone and start counting. The first few times I did this it felt a little weird, but now it just feels wonderful and helps me slow down and recover from long days.",
