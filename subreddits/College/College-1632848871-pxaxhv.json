There were some questions where I had to match the hiragana letter to the pronunciation (audio), but it marked the incorrect answer as correct with the pronunciation. So I asked my professor about it, and he kept telling me that they can't show us the answer because other students will know the quiz answer. But the quiz I'm asking for is from the past, including ones from a month ago, and it only asks how each hiragana is pronounced, but he still says he can't. I'm really stressing out because he keeps telling me that it was me who got the answer wrong not the quiz.. AHHHH I don't know if the other students just accepted it, but most of them commented that there was an error with the specific question right after the quiz.( it's an online class) I thought he would've fixed it already because lots of them said it and that's almost confirmed. What should I do? Am I the insane one like AJKGHHHH... pain\n\n\\+ Does students have the right to know the questions that they got wrong on the quizzes? (not even an exam..) Because if he keep says that I can't check what I got wrong I need to bring up a reasonable reason for it.\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "Proper_Potential_192", "created": 1632848871, "retrieved": 1632945468, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
