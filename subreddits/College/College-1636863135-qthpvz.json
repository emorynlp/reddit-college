  "text": "I grew up believing that college would be the best time of my life. But so far it hasn\u2019t lived up to that. Before you say I\u2019m an introverted loser, I have talked to new people and gone out of my comfort zone to try new things and meet new people. However, being told all about how great college is supposed to be, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s as great as I was told. What am I doing wrong?",

Honestly, a lot of people end up disappointed with college. And that's ok. It can vary greatly depending on your personal background, income, etc. Try to make the best of it any way you can and don't dwell too much on the boring/negative times.",

      "text": "you\u2019re not doing anything wrong. there\u2019s just an unrealistic version of college in pop culture and besides, it\u2019d be sad if the four years or whatever you spend in college are the \u201cbest years of your life.\u201d \n\ni\u2019m disappointed by my college experience too but still try to savor the good moments. college really is what you make of it, friends and parties and all that don\u2019t just come to you, you have to go out and make to effort to have them. so if you want to make new friends you should reach out to the people in your classes or join a club or something like that. you got this, hope things get better for you.",
