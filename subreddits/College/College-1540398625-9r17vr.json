If your college has any kind of counselling, use it. It's ok to feel over whelmed, happens to everyone, just be sure you are handling it correctly.",

My advice to them (and you) is this... it\u2019s okay to be embarrassed, to feel overwhelmed, and even cry. Give yourself permission to be human. No one goes to college because they are perfect,  know everything, and have their shit together. No one. So easy up on yourself a bit. So you had an emotional moment\u2014 it\u2019s okay. All you should do is move onward and upward.  Don\u2019t sabotage yourself and your success because you had a moment of normal human emotions. :) \n\n",

We're used to it, and other than with the plagiarists I think very understanding. When reading this I immediately flashed back to one of my former students who lost it in a meeting with me some years ago, over her (undergraduate) thesis which she had decided she wasn't capable of finishing, and cried in my office for quite a while. Last year she earned her Ph.D..\n\nHell, as a professor I have even choked up in class on several occasions over the years...I teach material that is sometimes quite emotional and there are passages we read, bits of films we watch, or just stories that come up that are sometimes overwhelming, especially if I'm stressed or tired. My students are pretty understanding and I try to be the same with them.\n\nDon't worry about it OP. People cry. It's human and natural.",

      "text": "College instructor here: I'm only in my third year of teaching, but I've seen quite a few students cry. Most of those cases have been from stress, both related and unrelated to school. There have been a couple of times when students have cried and I've cried with them. I also cry from stress and frustration (which is a vicious cycle, because I get even more frustrated when frustration makes me cry).  \n\nIf a student cried in front of me and then skipped class or didn't come back at all out of embarrassment, *that's* what would upset me, not the crying itself. Anxiety blows everything out of proportion in your own mind, and I'm talking from experience. Learning to manage it, putting things in perspective, and moving past something that makes you uncomfortable (like this situation) is part of life. Don't sweat it, just go back to class.",

As a TA, I once walked into office hours to find a student from another class crying. We talked, I tried to comfort her and help her with her questions, and that was it. Honestly I forgot about it shortly afterwards until I saw her a few weeks later and she said something like, \u201cno tears this time!\u201d If she hadn\u2019t said that, I never would\u2019ve remembered. \n\nI\u2019ve also been the one crying in a similar type of situation, except it was when I was a CC instructor. I was trying to decide to stay in my job or leave (I was more stressed than I had ever been and my mental health had seriously deteriorated throughout the year yet people at work thought I was doing fine). In the decision making process, I cried in front of our lab coordinator and the dean (my boss). It was okay. They both never mentioned it later and it (as far as I know) did not impact their opinions of me/my work. \n\nAnyways, please don\u2019t add this to your list of things to stress about. I promise it was a much bigger deal to you than it was to your professor. It will be okay. :)",

It's embarrassing I get it, but feeling things and crying are normal human reaction and you should never devalue them by being sorry for what you feel. \n\nStressful semester. They are humans, they understand. They don't want your apology, they want your success and they want to see you try even if it involves lots of crying. ",

That professor though is notoriously known for being super kind and heartfelt. \n\nHowever, a second professor (upper level science course) wouldn't have it. Seriously. He told her he thought it would be best for her to leave since 'nothing productive would come from being emotional in a meeting.' As you can guess it, he is notoriously known for being a douche, and has a 1.2 on rate my professor lmao.",

      "text": ">just cried in front of my professor for half an hour, now what\n\nTo be blunt, your professor does not mind that this happened nearly as much as you do. College is hard for most, if not all of us, and i'm sure you're not the first student your professor has seen cry, and i'm  sure you won't be the last. Things are hard, and that's okay for things to be hard. At the very least, your professor can ascertain that you care enough about the course to be driven to tears over it, and I'm sure that in no way this will reflect poorly on you.\n\nYou're doing okay, and you'll figure things out. Others before you have, and some have made it out fine with less advantages than you may have. You'll get there, and don't let things wear on you too much.\n\n\n>this is a permanent feeling of embarrassment \n\nNo reason for it to be. I understand you feel very upset about what happened, but I encourage you to let things go and learn from them what you can to better your future. Bad/unfortunate things happen to us all, but we can learn from these things, and improve our lives going forward. This is a hard thing to learn, and I myself struggle with it, but it is rarely the case that good habits are easily assumed. ",

Explain what made you feel the way you did, feel free to apologize for interrupting class but do not do so excessively.  \n\nProfessors want you to succeed and if you explain what is stressing you, they are the best person to help you construct a plan to succeed in their class.  Ask to meet with them or for help planning things you can study or do to be more prepared.\n\nThis process will only start with you reaching out though, please do not let your social anxiety steal your own success.",

She'd offered to be a \"sounding board\" but we just kept bouncing the same things off of each other. I should've just emailed her but she feels she has some \"connection\" when we show up in person. \n\nShe also scolded me for assuming things like she wouldn't like the topics I wanted to use; I was so afraid to do something because just in the beginning of the year she told me \"idc what you think about a certain topic; it's my class and the only thing that matters is what I like/want\" which is fair but now it was suddenly \"It shouldn't matter what I think about your topics if you like them\". Anyway,  it triggered my fear of English teachers. My first year I had one who'd constantly berate me/my work so I am extremely intimidated by professors on top of my already present social phobia.

For a lot of people its about time management, which goes hand in hand with managing stress. Once I realized that fretting to the point of tears over the next exam/assignment/report was not gaining me anything, the answer was simple. give less fucks because the  world is not going to end because you didn't do that last assignment.  Don't pressure yourself meaninglessly, and if it is not 100% critical for you to pass the class you really ought to take it with a smirk and whatever your vice may be (yeah, i just suggested you do your hw high/listening to music/on the roof so you can watch the sunset - ANYTHING). Sometimes fuck it is the correct answer. Prioritize sleep over studying the night before exams.   \n\n\nAs for \"permanent feeling of embarrassment\" - nothing is permanent and its only embarrassing if you are thinking about it in that way. You could just as easily convince yourself to sit at the front of the class the rest of the year and engage as much as possible with this professor *because you think she hates you.* The world is how you imagine it to be. Don't imagine yourself embarrassed and flustered. Imagine yourself struggling and yet still proudly trying.",

We had an advising meeting a day later and it seemed like he chose to forget it, because he treated me the same and actually joked with me a little bit rather than making things awkward. So, if you make it awkward, it will be. Professors typically would rather not make things awkward, so I doubt class will be uncomfortable unless you make it that way. ",
