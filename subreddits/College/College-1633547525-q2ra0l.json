  "text": "I need to vent about how stupid I am.\n\nI've been skipping my polling class because my motivation and mental health has gone down the drain and from the first class I was confused and felt stupid so I just stopped going most of the time. I know it's dumb and it's fully on me but this shit is hard. This class uses the program SPSS and I missed most of the classes where my professor explained how to use it and now I have this huge assignment due tomorrow before midnight and I have no idea what I'm doing. I need to recode variables, find percentages, etc. and I don't know how to do any of that stuff (because I'm stupid and skipped class a billion times). Also did I mention is assignment is worth 10% of my overall grade??? I'm in a groupme for the class but everyone in the groupme seems to have finished it already and I'm embarrassed to be like \"hey guys, I've been skipping class and have no idea what I'm doing now, can someone help.\" Also this professor is known to be incredibly strict and unforgiving about these kinds of things. She has a super low rating on rate my professor, someone said that when her grandpa passed away and she couldn't complete an assignment my professor said, \"Your academics should be more important than your personal life.\" So I'm too scared to even email her and tell her my situation.\n\nI'm so ashamed and humiliated and scared because I need to pass this class but I honestly don't think that's even a possibility for me anymore. I just keep staring at the screen with the assignment, completely confused and lost. I am well aware that it is 100% my own fault but I just needed to vent about it to other people who might understand.",

      "text": "Bleh, rate my professor is usually a better indicator of how hard a class is than the actual professor. You have to realize that there's a HUGE variation in the people posting reviews for professors. Judge your professor by the way they treat YOU, not some person on the internet claiming crazy shit. \n\nI went to college in my early 20's dropped out for similar reasons to what you're going through and I'm back at 32. \n\nHere are some key difference why I think being older has improved my success. My work ethic actually exists. I didn't have one before and would often skip classes, try and finish assignments without reading the material and just generally trying to pass instead of understand. \n\nMy grasp on money is so much tighter now. Let's take your example. This is what, a 3 credit hour course? My college charges 600 dollars a credit hour. You've got 1800 bucks tied up in this class. You paid 1800 dollars for the material, lectures and homework. Skipping one class is the equivalent of not getting 50 dollars worth of college you paid for. So every time you skip, you're not getting value from your 50 dollars. \n\nI don't know about you, but 1800 fucking dollars to an early 20's kid is a TON of money. In fact, that doesn't change much once you're in your 30s. \n\nOther than that, college is about 50% as hard as work was for me without a degree. I busted my ass 10 hours a day on concrete and sitting was only permitted during breaks. Now I get to walk around a beautiful campus, sit in a class on my fat fucking ass for an hour or so, walk around, do it all over. This. is. cake. I treat it like work. I work for about 8 hours a day on any given day to get my stuff done. My days off are Saturday and Sunday. When I have no classes, I'm working ahead to get done. \n\nMaybe this is a good lesson for you. You're about to toss a stack of 1800 bucks into a fire and you're not allowed to even watch it burn. \n\nFrom here you either start doing absolutely everything in your power to work as hard as possible or take a gap year. If college isn't working for you, take a break man. Go get a job and an apartment and live a bit. If you want to come back, you can. It's been incredibly beneficial to me. I kind of wish I'd have done it sooner but this was the time for me. Maybe your time isn't now. Don't be ashamed to stop attending school. You can have a shit ton of fun not in college in your 20s.",

I came from not being able to pass classes to 4.0 semesters. My biggest concern it seems is getting As. I don't ever worry about passing. \n\nMy perspective on it is so much different because I'm 10 years older than my peers. I'm not worried what anybody thinks. I'm not worried about their feelings. I'm there to get my education and nothing else. If you impede that process, I'll be sure to let you know. \n\nAt 30, you'll look back and see how much of a child you were throughout your 20s. I would argue that I wasn't an adult until around 27. 18 are absolute babies. It's crazy how inexperienced and unprepared an 18 year old is for the world. Some are better off than others but for the most part, they're all little lost puppies in fucking Mordor but they somehow think they're wolves.",
