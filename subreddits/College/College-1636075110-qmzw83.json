  "text": "For context, I took last year off partly due to COVID and partly due to burnout. I came back to school this year (as a Jr) excited to start my program. Only to find out that I won't be able to get into my program because the average GPA cutoff moved from 3.0 to 3.5 in one semester. The averages for the previous three semesters were 2.9, 2.8, 3.0, which I easily surpass. I was even even given the explicit reason for this drastic change that was due to \"Inflation from online courses.\" Yet, there were no exceptions for people who took the year off or didn't attend any online classes. I'm not sure if I am going insane or if I have a right be pissed off. I feel like I am learning absolutely nothing in online classes. What's the point in studying for hours and risking getting a poor grade, when I can just find most answers online and guarantee a really good grade (that I need to get into my program for next semester). I don't even know what to think. Am I being irrational? Do others have this problem..?",

I understand it was my decision to leave in the first place, but man is this a shitty situation. Gotta throw more money at them for filler classes to increase my GPA next semester too!",
