Comparing photos of me before I started college and now that I\u2019m almost done, I currently look so unhealthy and lackluster. Now that I\u2019ve finished all the hard stuff, I thought I would be happy. I even have a steady income and I will be well off financially after I finish. I feel selfish for saying this, but now that it\u2019s over and my stress is reduced, I feel so empty inside. When I think about life after college and how I\u2019m all set, I can\u2019t help but feel like something is missing. I know it\u2019s silly, but without all this stress, I feel like I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore.

A new life begins after you finish your studies, so don't stress about it and just enjoy your life.\n\nAll in all, just rest a bit and let your brain acomodate to the changes in your life and move forward.\n\nSide note: idk why my punctuation is so weird here.", "author": "D_Leshen", "created": 1621021600, "upvotes": 1}, "gy4si92": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nc5ea4/i_dont_know_who_i_am_without_stress/gy4si92/", "text": ">I feel selfish for saying this\n\nThere you go.
