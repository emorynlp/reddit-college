  "text": "There's just. So much on my mind, and I'm not sure how well I'm handling it? I'm so tired, like all the time, and it's crazy. I gotta get a job next summer, I gotta pay for gas, I gotta eat, I gotta do well in class, I gotta be sociable and friendly, I gotta worry about grad school, and I gotta do all of this while getting misgendered more often than not and wrestling with some pretty serious anxiety issues and ADHD making focusing on anything pretty damn difficult. \n\nI'm not like. Dying. But I'm very tired, pretty constantly, and I just wanna know if anyone else is feeling the same.",

      "text": "I feel the same. I feel like my body is on autopilot but my brain is swamped in an endless cascade of new tasks, deadlines, information, everything. If I take a break to try and relax, I feel guilty as hell. Even being on reddit right now instead of studying, I feel like I'm in trouble. It's neverending. I dont feel like I can keep going like this, but I have no choice if I want to pursue my dream job. But I cant work without completely disrupting my bare bones ability to handle school, so my boyfriend is supporting us both. I feel so guilty and sad about it, but I can't take on any more right now. I desperately want everything to just go away, but that's not gonna happen. I feel like I'm going to break soon and drive my car off the cliff.\n\nHang in there, friend.",
