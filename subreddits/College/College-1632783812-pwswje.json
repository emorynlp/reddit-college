Me and her do not see eye to eye with the COVID situation, she goes out to parties and I like to stay in. She eventually catches COVID-19 at a party and did not tell me that she had physical contact with the person who was positive until days later when she did test positive. she kicked me out of our dorm so she could quarantine, and she still goes to parties and participates in sorority gatherings. After this incident, she has become extremely spiteful and petty towards me. I have contacted every higher up I can, and my RA says that her superiors do not think the room change will be approved because my roommate and I are not \u201cmessily fighting\u201d which is absurd to me because this whole conflict is stressing my mental health and physical health so much. I really do not know what to do. Is there any help or advice???", "author": "sadboihoursbabey", "created": 1632783812, "retrieved": 1632800083, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hej6npn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwswje/roommate_situation/hej6npn/", "text": "And \"every higher up I can\" includes Student Advocacy?", "author": "vampyreontitus", "created": 1632786843, "upvotes": 1}, "hej0jr5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwswje/roommate_situation/hej0jr5/", "text": "Yikes!
