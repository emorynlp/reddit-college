I was wondering if it gets easier in college workload wise and socially? Cause during my lurking period I saw a lot of posts here about burnout and loneliness. Any thoughts are appreciated, thanks!",

      "text": "No the workload for college is more challenging than high school. The expectations on your learning are higher as well. However, I do want to emphasize the importance of study habits and passion for your field/subject. I found that although college has a heavier and more challenging workload, I enjoyed it more than high school. I was able to actually show and apply my knowledge in a field that I loved. \n\nIf you have trouble with burnout and loneliness in high school I suggest rethinking the way you study and how you develop and maintain social interactions. You might be using inefficient studying strategies. \n\nSocial connections in college can include: close friends, study buddies, mentors, professional networks etc. You want to meet people who share similar values and respect you for who you are. These should be people who lift you up and can give their honest thoughts on your weaknesses. The social aspect of college can be intimidating at first but you will learn to grow into it. Once you find the right people, you can feel confident in sharing and improving your work and your ideas. \n\nIf you are interested in preparing for college I have some resources that I can share with you. \n\nIt helps to start reading and taking notes like you would in college. When I was in high school I started learning college studying skills from my sibling. I also attended information sessions and workshops at universities I was interested in.\n\nI would suggest reading journal articles now. The Journal of Emerging Investigators offers free access to journal articles. The articles are written by middle and high school students, but you can start training your skills in reading articles. \n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)\n\nI also have a College Freshman Starter Kit. This useful for getting you familiar with how to transition from high school to college.\n\nLink to the kit:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV\\_W7K9wV5HvoFWK\\_Es2E/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV_W7K9wV5HvoFWK_Es2E/edit)",

      "text": "The workload is actually roughly the same but the type of learning changes dramatically. For instance, in high school, you might be doing 45 hrs of school stuff a week, out of which 35 is in class and just 10 doing hw and stuff outside of class. In college, its about 50 hrs a week but your class time is only like 15 hrs. The rest is all hw and studying that you have to do on your own. Some people find this more challenging and others find this easier. \n\nAs others have mentioned, a major plus is that for the most part, you\u2019ll be taking classes in subjects you at least somewhat like. So that makes college more exciting and tolerable imo",

The freedom to design your own schedule in college can be a breath of fresh air compared to high school.\n\nMost engineering majors, though, will find college harder. You really don't know what it will be like for you until you try it-- you might be one of the lucky ones that finds college easier.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I found both undergrad (in a non-STEM field) and grad school (in a STEM field where all the students with engineering degrees in my classes complain it's \"hard,\" lol) to be easier than high school.",

I also went to a college prep high school, which dished out at least 3 hours of homework every night.  Community college is at most 6 hours of work a day including class (I\u2019m studying accounting and econ, not engineering).\r  \nSo if you\u2019re planning on going to CC, then don\u2019t worry at all. Most of the professors are laid back.  I expect my workload to increase significantly when I transfer and start upper division classes.\r  \n\r  \nSocially:\r\n\n  \nCollege CAN be better socially than high school.  The amount of social activity you experience is really up to you.  People are nicer and more understanding in college overall, and joining clubs and meeting people is great experience.  \r  \nThat being said, it is also very easy for college students to just do their school work, go home, and never meet anyone outside of class.

Think of the difference between middle and high school courses, then double that.

You have weekly homework and lab reports, depending on your classes you may have an exam every other week. Concepts are harder and if you have an in depth question the professor may tell you to come to their office hours to ask it. Socially, it depends honestly.

I will say that I struggled A LOT in high school and was very burnt out by the end of the college application season. I was taking a bunch of AP classes and also struggling with how early school started (7:20 am wtf). \n\nI\u2019m a STEM major and I can say the content in college is much harder, but it doesn\u2019t feel as bad as high school. I am better equipped to deal with classes since I\u2019m older and have learned how to study more effectively than when I was in high school. The workload also mostly depends on you\u2014do you want to coast through college and not be involved in any extracurriculars, or do you want to pad your resume with everything you can? I know people that play video games for hours every day and people who don\u2019t have any free time, even on weekends. \n\nSocially, college is a much better experience for almost anyone. It is a little different during the pandemic, but finding friends you vibe with is amazing. \n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged by the idea of burnout in college!! Learn how to study effectively and take care of your mental health, especially around exam times.\n\nEdit: word",

The biggest thing for me was learning how to use my free time, because you will have more and won\u2019t have parents around to nag you about school work or chores so you will have to be the one to actually get this done. As a STEM major my classes got more difficult afterwards and some weeks I definitely experience burnout multiple times a semester, but you learn to power through it. Socially, I already knew some people at my university, but it might take a sec to make friends, but by sophomore year I had a good set of friends and definitely started to go out more than I did in high school (if that\u2019s your thing). Joining clubs, possibly Greek life, and talking to people in your classes and dorm will help with this.",

It\u2019s been a year since I graduated and I miss college days all the time because life was much simpler for me but now it\u2019s basically just work, paying bills and at the same time it\u2019s a nice feeling to see your hard work in college paying off. \n\nSo good luck and never stress out remember college is not hard but it\u2019s challenging so do yourself a favor and know how to time manage your day. Also remember everyone is looking for a friend in college so expose yourself to people cause they will be the people to cheer you up and help you study.",

From my experience, senior year was kind of a drag for me, I didn\u2019t study much, but now I started college this year and I can tell you it requires more studying. \n\nMy one regret from senior year is not having better study habits to start college strong. If you can resist senioritis and start studying more now, you\u2019ll be in a better position when you start college.\n\nSome good tactics for studying include self-testing on knowledge you learned in class (one of the most effective methods for studying) and (as difficult as it may seem senior year of high school) paying attention in class. Doing those things will better prepare you for college and will allow you to have good study habits going right into college. Hope this helps!",
