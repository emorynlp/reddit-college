I see your questions and your comments on the front page of /r/college. Some of you have parents that went to college and some of you don't. Some of you are traditional and some are nontraditional with respect to age. Some of you are veterans and some have never had a job. I want to give you a piece of advice I give to my family members. You can take it or leave it, but don't discount what I say because you don't like it; I'm tenured, I've been doing this a very long time. I've spent nearly two decades now within the walls of a college in some capacity. \n\n**1. The top students in any field will get a job in their field, but the % considered \"top\" varies by discipline.** Jobs in editing are less plentiful than in engineering. Majoring in either does not ASSURE you a job, but if you are in the top percent out there, you will likely be hired. For English, that may be the top 5% and for engineering it is probably the top 60%. Just like anything else, it is supply and demand. If you aren't competitive within your major with your classmates then you likely aren't going to be competitive in the jobs designed for that major (unless you already have an \"in\" somewhere). That said, it doesn't mean you will be unemployed, as many jobs in retail still want a bachelor's degree. \n\n**2. College is expensive and many of you will waste money.**  If you are on this sub (or conscious) you know college is expensive. The average student loan debt in the US right now is around $30K for a bachelor's. This is about a $300/month loan payment for 10 years. In general, you can expect $100/month repayment for every $10K you take out. I see a LOT of students who are ROYALLY screwing themselves over here. Look at a few scenarios: you go to an expensive liberal arts school that costs you $100,000 over 4 years. You are literally owing more than most mortgage payments when you get out. Some of my students take out the maximum aid dollars and then go out to eat, pay for an expensive phone, new computers every year, and shopping trips. Some people say, \"yes, but I'll be a ____ and have plenty of money when I'm out.\" Will you? Do you know how many students change their majors? Flunk out of classes/their major? Aren't the top whatever percent in (1) above that won't be competitive for those jobs? It's a LOT of people. Google tells me that 80% of students change their major at least once and 44% drop out (70% drop out of a 2-year college). The average job with a bachelor's earns about $50K/year (+/- $15K depending on the field). Your take-home pay after taxes will be around $35K-$50K depending on your location and tax bracket. Do you want a solid 1/4 of your income to go to student loans for the next decade? If not, read the following points.\n\n**3. Don't waste money.** Unless you are in the top 1-2% getting very powerful, high ranking jobs with a bachelor's degree, the college you choose is largely irrelevant (think Harvard business school, and you have family connections on Wall Street). Regional public universities offer the most affordable education, and many are within a driving distance from home. You may want freedom from mom so you go away and live in a dorm for 4 years, but when you are 22, living back with mom because you have too much student loan debt, you'll wish you took my advice. Most of you will lose nothing by going the affordable route. You will still be a teacher, or an engineer, or a chemist, or a writer. Just be the top %. An exception obviously is if the local school does not offer the program you need. \n\n**4. Don't retake classes. Ever.** This means you have to take college seriously. Don't ever fail classes. Don't retake them. When you do, they still show up on your transcripts but the GPA is ignored by your school from the first time. A med school will see 3 hours of F in organic, followed by 3 hours of A, and average to 6 hours of C. You can't escape poor decisions. So be studious. Be serious. Don't ever fail a class. They are expensive. I see students wasting thousands of dollars in their classes by retaking them. It delays your graduation, it costs you money, and if you are on student loans, you'll literally be paying for classes you failed for a decade. This brings me to my next point.\n\n**5. Know when to change your major.** Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, wants a physician that has to do everything twice to get it right. I have a ton of students every semester that struggle in every class in their major (I'm in chemistry). They MUST be doctors though. So they keep taking the same classes over and over and over and... it is never going to happen. As I said, nobody wants the doctor that has to do everything twice to get it right. Pick a major that you are good at. It will help you do well in school, which will save you money in the long run. Develop reasonable career goals that fit your strongest attributes, not ones that will showcase your weakest. \n\n**6. Don't go to college if you don't want to.** I have a lot of students who waste a lot of money going to college because their parents wanted them to. Let me share a story. I'm 3 years older than my brother. He had a ton of learning issues and decided to pursue a trade (auto mechanic) while I spent a decade in college. My salary at 30 was the same as his salary at 30, but his lifetime earnings are more than mine since I took out 10 years of full time work to pursue studies while he was working full time. There are plenty of ways to be successful without a degree. \n\n TL;DR Don't spend more money than absolutely necessary in college. Be smart and don't fail classes. Don't go to expensive schools. Don't fall into the \"real college experience\" bullshit that will keep many of you in poverty until you are well into your 30's.

Particularly #3...there are ~4,500 colleges in the US and whatever people might say the \"product\" they offer is not consistant across all institutions. Not all colleges are created equal, and not all offer equal educational opportunities. In fact, there is a tremendous gulf between poor/middling/elite schools both in subtance and in outcomes-- in part due to who is in the seats next to you. If you choose to attend a highly selective school you will be in classes with other high-performing students, which raises the bar in almost every way. It is also likely to mean you will benefit from a much better network after college-- who you know is important, and it doesn't require an Ivy degree for that to make a difference. \n\nOn a more practical basis, not all students are well suited to all types of schools. Some may do well in a lecture hall setting with 400 classmates, while others will thrive only in small classes (say 20-25) with much more direct attention from the instructor. It's important to know the difference between types of schools and to determine which fits your needs. There are also a lot shitty schools out there, to be frank, where faculty don't care about teaching and admins care only about revenues...fine for many people, but others will be much happier in a setting that offers more support, more services, and is more student-focused. Those are also quite often more expensive. But look at outcomes: OP is correct to suggest that many students drop out; graduation rates at many large public schools are <50%. There are also private schools with graduation rates of 85%+. Cheapest does not always mean most cost effective.\n\nFun fact: for many students an \"expensive\" school can be cheaper than a \"affordable\" one if you are simply comparing sticker price. Private colleges engage in [tuition discounting](https://www.agb.org/briefs/tuition-discounting), which means few students actually pay the sticker price; much of that is  done through merit aid so high-performing high school students should never decide \"I can't pay for that school\" until they have received a finacial aid package for comparison. At my school-- which indeed has a high price tag --a strong applicant from a family with $100K income might well end up paying less than they would at State U, which will not offer the same aid. They are also likely to require five years to graduate from State (because classes are often full) wheras our four year graduate rate is 2X that of State.\n\nIf all you care about is a credential-- a BA or BS on a piece of paper --then perhaps going to the absolute cheapest school you can find makes sense. But if you want an *education* it's worth being a bit more discerning about the process and taking into account more than just price.

My parents mandated I go to school there even though they had a very limited list of majors. At the end of my freshman year I got stabbed by some people I thought were my friends. The school did literally nothing to help me regarding this and local police ceded authority to campus police (due to local legislation) who ceded authority to the vice president of student life (due to school policy) who didnt respond to the attack or my case until the end of my senior year. During my sophomore year I looked into transferring to another college... And none of the credits I already had would transfer at all (schools in Texas are still sort of like this but less so now a days because they talk to each other more now). So at $30k into a 4 year education my parents and I decided we'd wait for the school to make a disciplinary decision, which they didn't. Long story short the vice president of student life really screwed up, the guys who attacked me wrote me death threats for 4 years, and when I made complaints to school officials higher up, due to a lot of evidence the school lost, they were unable to do anything and instead mandated that I had to post a written apology to my attackers around campus for committing an act of slander against my attackers. It was bullshit and a terrible experience. They didn't offer a major I wanted, and had a limited selection to begin with, so I wound up with a ba in philosophy, and a really screwed up transcript that has caused problems pursuing further education. I have no senior level courses in my degree because the school didn't offer them, and I have more courses in my minor than my major, and my minor isn't even listed on my transcript. This has caused major problems pursuing a masters degree, and has caused major problems pursuing a second bachelor's degree. \n\nI have written my college a bad review on Google, yelp, etc... And that has caused the vice president of student life to call and harass me a number of times since graduating 8 years ago. He's hostile on the phone, and sometimes makes vague threats of physical violence. I've changed my phone number a few times, and I've recorded some of the phone calls. I've submitted everything to the police local to my area as well but what he's doing doesn't meet the legal definition of harassment due to time scale issues, and his threats of violence are too vague for the police to prosecute him. \n\nIt really sucks and I wish I hadn't gone to college at all, I wish my parents had been less dead set on the school I went to, they wish they hadn't been so dead set on it as well, my mother has developed an alcohol problem as a coping mechanism since graduating (for according to her \"damaging her kids before college and during\"), I wish the credits had been transferrable, I wish the school offered a computer science degree when I went to school there (they do now though), and I wish there had been a less violent student body at the college I went to, and most of all... I wish I didn't have a little round hard lumpy scar on the side of my torso from being stabbed, because it itches sometimes still and everytime I scratch at it, it's a constant reminder of the awful traumatic events I've been through.
