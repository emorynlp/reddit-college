  "text": "Today at work I was approached by my manager and told to sign paperwork from my University asking to see what hours I am at work. My manager said \u201cThe reason why they are asking is because they want to monitor what students are doing outside of class\u201d. He also said \u201cwe are getting a kickback from this\u201d. I asked him what\u2019s in it for me? He then said \u201cYou get to keep your job\u201d. Has this happened to anyone else and what should I do???",
