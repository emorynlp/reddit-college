  "text": "Seriously. My classmates don\u2019t use citations, and if they do, they use them wrong. These are seniors. Some of them also have a large amount of errors in their posts. Sometimes I think I do so well on writing assignments just because in comparison to my classmates, me doing the bare minimum or slightly above it is considered \u201cexcellent\u201d by professors. Of course, I don\u2019t mind the good grades. The lack of writing skills just baffles me.",

With many of them, it wasn't even a matter of \"this needs some editing.\" There just wasn't much solid prose and coherent thought to begin to work with. It was sad. And quite frankly, being an absolute lover of writing and reading I was unable to bridge the gap and figure out how to communicate to them. It was so frustrating.",

A key, if not the key, goal of education is for the student to become at least some of these arts, these fundamental and primordial forms of expressing what it is to be human, and we are falling far short of that goal.\n\nFor that reason alone it's entirely fair to say that the education most people get is very poor.",

Holy fuck did all those little baby guys act like writing a paper was going to kill them. The amount of them that put off classes with a slight writing component until their last semester was baffling to me.\n\nI remember in one of my last semesters in one of my 4000 level CS classes there was a group project for a huge research paper that spanned half the semester, and the groups were premade. I had already signed myself away to writing the whole god damn 20 page paper by myself, until I got matched with one of the most attentative guys who asked the most questions in the class and one of the only girls other than me in the class as well. Her track was STEM education, one of the only people in the CS school with that specific track.\n\nWe killed the paper and our professor was super proud of us. I was so glad I didn't have to do everything. We brainstormed and decided the guy who was the most passionate about the class and project should organize us, he did, and then none of us slacked off.\n\nThat never happened again for any other group project or paper I had, but it was such a breath of fresh air compared to the shit that happens normally.",

After I was gone making extensive changes, my mom asked, \"so what do you think now?\" My sister responded, \"yeah, it's actually really good.\" \n\nI find the biggest issue within essays and responses is that people have the idea, but they either never flush them out, or continue it. You can't expect this great idea to have two sentences, make it a paragraph were you fully develop your point. \n\n I've been told my writing is really good by various professors and I credit it all to my English teacher in HS, who I had for two years. Every paper I submitted would get ripped apart, and for the first year I never earned more than a 70% on any of them. \n\nWhenever I proof read things for friends or classmates, it just hurts. Its like I'm looking at an extremely rough draft of a paper, not a finalized copy. Incomplete thoughts and sentences, sentences that either add nothing or drift off to never be completed... stuff like that.\n\nI think at the end of the day, the problem stems from horrendous lack of proper education in English wiring skills in general. A lot of my HS classes in English were focused on reading and the language used... not so much how the sentence was structured or even how to write.",

      "text": "Yes and no. On one hand, it's wild when you get into an upper-level course (or any college course) and see that students study with the basics of writing. On the other, writing is a skill. If a student isn't taught a skill when they're in K-12, if they get in programs where they can get by without being pushed to improve their writing, if no one teaches them the importance of effective written communication, then of course they will write poorly. Besides that, I think there are plenty of people who want to write well but don't know what good writing *is* because they were never given instruction on that beyond the surface level stuff, which they then brush off as \"I'm just not a good writer.\"",

If you go to a school like I did with very low teacher retention rates and literacy rates below 20%, it is very easy to get stuck behind the rest of your peers in college.\n\nPlus, it isn't taught in college classes because its assumed students already have in-depth knowledge of these concepts.

I'm nearly 25 and I vaguely remember nouns, verbs, clauses etc but it was perhaps only for a week in year 8 or something.\n\nThe new model of English teaching is focussed on \"natural\" learning, supposing that we can identify the \"correct\" grammar even if we don't know the formal rules. Young people are more likely to say that a sentence \"looks wrong\" but not be able to convey what's wrong with the structure using any standard terms.\n\nSo your students actually *shouldn't* know these things in any great detail. The curriculum has changed, so now whenever people try to give us feedback on grammar we lack the vocabulary to understand it. The system relied on us reading a lot of books and getting a lot of natural feedback, which obviously didn't happen in too many schools.",

A lot of the resumes I review are written without any errors but are missing a critical component: they don't consider how it comes across to the audience, what the audience wants to see, and how the audience makes decisions.\n\nWriting in many cases is about critical thinking and emotional intelligence. *How will he interpret it if I phrase it this way? What type of arguing style is this group most receptive to? What feelings does this person have about the topic and how can I write in a way that works with them?* You can practice writing to eliminate spelling mistakes but you need to grow as a person to write in ways that win over people.",

I think it depends, I\u2019m a doublemajor in a humanities and engineering field- but the worst writers I\u2019ve seen come from the \u201csocial sciences.\u201d (Think psychology, communications, etc.) Lots of engineering programs stress critical technical communication skills that can enforce some baseline competence, on top of increased quantitative/academic rigor. I know my school\u2019s unit ops classes had four different eighty page reports due in the semester the class was taken. Meanwhile the capstone psychology class only required a single ten page paper.\n\nMost halfway credible programs know that communication skills and leadership are important and that need to be stressed- lots of the engineering stereotypes come from the cringe first years who fail out. \n\nStill, the people who are really screwed are the people in the social sciences\u2014 their degrees lack the technical/blunt quantitive communication skills of STEM, but also lack the more creative and qualitative skills that you\u2019ll learn in the humanities. For example, a \u201cupper level psych stats\u201d class at my school is basically an introductory calc-based science stats class \u2014 minus the calc. While the writing-oriented classes will still do less intense writing than you would in an upper division philosophy or ethics class, not to mention increased grade inflation. This can be generalized to a whole class of degrees that a lot of people use to \u201cjust get a piece of paper.\u201d \n\n(Bear with my typos, my phone is bugging out so I can\u2019t type easily.)",

In chemistry you may note the color of a mixture, but if I said it was \u201clight green\u201d that might mean slightly different things to different people, making that statement inherently less scientific than specifying the concentration, absorbance, etc. \n\nSo yes, purely qualitative research *is* less scientific, and if you disagree with that I would suggest you take a class in scientific philosophy/ethics.

I received my degree in classics last year and am now getting one in chemical engineering, so I\u2019ve seen both sides of the coin when it comes to qualitative academics being compared to quantitive academics. Unfortunately, growing up that means I\u2019ve had to read some pretty poorly supported studies- not to mention listening to practicing professors complain about their field all day. \n\nMaybe my viewpoint is jaded from growing up with adults in both fields and being exposed to them at an early age- but dismissing what\u2019s happening in your field all together is just burying your head in the sand. \nIf you can\u2019t reckon with the reproducibility crisis in your own field you probably won\u2019t be able to push it forward. Then again, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re a grad student- so you don\u2019t really understand the field too well either. You\u2019ll really only start to run into these troubles as you go up the academic food chain, when funding, prestige, and pedigree begins to overtake academic honesty. The pot is really calling the kettle black.",
