  "text": "my grandma passed very unexpectedly a week before my first day. we traveled to my hometown (9 hours away from here i live now) and put together a funeral last minute. that same week i went to another funeral for my great aunt. i haven\u2019t felt okay and i\u2019ve felt overwhelmed went school and work, but i never know if i\u2019m doing enough. i\u2019m struggle so badly in algebra and my computer science teacher doesn\u2019t help me. it\u2019s my first semester but i\u2019ve just been feeling extremely overwhelmed and i was wondering if anyone has ever gone through the same thing or if anyone has any tips for me.\n\nsorry if this was a tmi, just wondering if anyone can relate",

      "text": "I fortunately havent had this happen to me (yet (knocks on wood)) but you should try again/harder to try to get some leeway on due dates. Unfortunately tho it is up to the professor so they may, heartlessly, not give you any grace. Its totally okay in that case to slack a little if thats what you need to do. In some of my classes the lowest test grade is dropped so if thats the case with you then plan on the current unit being the dropped grade. If not, when you can gather the motivation, work on the easier things like hw, attendance points, etc. Thats more manageable than a big paper or something. Maybe set aside some time each day to grieve and remember the people who passed. I dont know, honestly its just going to suck for a while. Since this is your first semester the important thing is to not derail completely. I know its hard, but force yourself to do enough to at least pass. Im very very sorry for your loss <3",
