  "text": "I'm in my senior year in a developing country, applying for colleges and scholarships. Most merit based scholarships are requiring the students to have exceptional academic achievements. My GPA is 3.81 unweighted. I had solid 3.9 - 4.0 gpa in my freshman and sophomore year but completely bombed it in my junior year with online schooling. Also i was one of the few dumb kids to not cheat in online exams.\n\nBut I have some community and volunteer works. Student council member, school newspaper member, taught at an orphanage, at a small village in the countryside and some fellow students year above me and few more works, as well as active in many national and private Olympiads and competitions like MUN's (but everything locked down before i could achieve much)\n\nWill I be eligible for most merit based scholarships?\n\nI come from an average income household, but after all my elder siblings moved away and my father got promoted with some good invested stocks, its now considered above average and im much more privileged & luckier than my elder siblings tbh",
