  "text": "She already gave the requirements and their corresponding percentages but I want to no how she treats each grade individually.\n\nLike, we have three requirements:\n\n- 8 Reading Assignments (50%)\n- 4 Quizzes (25%)\n- 4 Reflection Papers (25%)\n\nFor the Reading assignments specifically, it\u2019s out of 50. \n\nWhat is the usual computation that happens?\n\nLike, Get the average by adding the scores then multiply by 50%? Or doing the same but instead of the scores, it\u2019s the percentages like 90% if I got a 45.\n\nCould it also be adding all of the scores then multiplying them by 50%?\n\nI have teachers who\u2019ve done these different computations and it\u2019s making it difficult to gauge my performance.",

      "text": "What you\u2019ve listed are the category weights.\n\nThe final grade of each category is worth __% of your final grade.\n\nSo, if your average on all the reading assignments is 80%, you then multiply by .5 and get 40% towards your final grade. Do this with each category.\n\nI have no idea what math you\u2019re doing, but the way you\u2019ve explained it none of those would produce a correct answer.",
