Will changing majors affect my financial aid?",

No test or anybody can tell you your path in life except for you. \nI\u2019m a biology major that went to a UC for first year and transferred to a local CC so I can transfer to a closer UC school. When I was at uni, I had a professor in biology who lectured\u2026 really weird. He didn\u2019t seem interested at all, felt like he was just reading off of a textbook and it made it harder for me to learn. I questioned if biology was for me because of my experience in this intro bio class. In the end, I stuck it out, and I\u2019m currently excelling in a bio class with lab practicals. \nJust ask yourself these questions. Do I still want to be a doctor? Are my other professors treating me well and am I learning well from them?",

      "text": "I suggest picking a major that keeps your options open. If you don't go to grad school/professional school after a biology degree, it has pretty bad employment prospects. I would suggest a degree that is useful even by itself.\n\nAlso, if you're being swayed away from your path by one bad professor, I would reconsider if you were truly dedicated to that path anyways. So think about your options. Start going through the academic catalogue and look at degrees that seem interesting.\n\nAlso, no it would not affect your financial aid for general pell grants and stuff. It would only affect it if you had major/department specific grants or scholarships.",

You can major in anything, and in fact it may even help you stand out because so many bio majors apply to med school. Anything from CS to history to English, as long as you have the pre-med coursework done that's required for most med schools it doesn't matter what your major is.",
