  "text": "I took four class this semester and two of them are asynchronous. I try to be very diligent with my assignments and sometimes need to send emails to my professors asking them stuff.\nThe thing is they don\u2019t reply back that often. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making a mistake but I double check their emails, give a headline and ask how they are doing. Then I proceed with the questions. \n\nAt most I send one email a week asking for example: my due dates got accidentally deleted so can I get a picture of a new one? Etc about assignments. Am I asking too many questions? Do professors dislike answering to emails? I know they don\u2019t have the time to hate me but do they lol idk. Is this normal?",

      "text": "We don\u2019t hate you. In fact, I prefer students to ask questions if they don\u2019t understand something or need help. That\u2019s much better than getting half-assed, wrong, or missing assignments. I might start to get annoyed if someone asks a bunch of questions I\u2019ve either already answered or have been addressed elsewhere (syllabus, announcements, etc.), but the act of asking questions itself isn\u2019t bothersome.\n\nHaving said that, we are all different, and I don\u2019t know exactly what all your emails have asked. In any case, unless someone says something to you about your emailing, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.",

      "text": "Some profs have a policy that they will not respond to emails if the answer is within the syllabus or course website. So for example, if deadlines are deleted in the course website, but they were announced in class, they are in the syllabus, or are somewhere else, profs won\u2019t answer the email.\n\nI promise it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t like you, but more often if emails are missed it\u2019s because the volume of emails we get is so high. I miss emails sometimes just because they get lost. It happens. You can resend if the email is important, but if the info can be found anywhere else look elsewhere first.",
