  "text": "My financial aid got reduced this past fall - I\u2019ve been having a hard time getting good grades. My GPA is still ok (3.2 but will probably drop after this semester). However, I can\u2019t afford rent after this month. What options are there to get a loan? I tried to do a private student loan but only got certified for $1043 when I got approved for $10000 and need that this year for my rent.",
