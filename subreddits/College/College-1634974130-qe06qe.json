      "text": "The sports business is all about who you know. If you have no connections there you wont make it, so network as much as possible, send out cold emails, do all you can to get in touch with people that can help you land your first gig. During undergrad, work part time jobs with some of the D1 teams and get to know the players that could go pro. Again, it s literally all about who you know",
