  "title:": "GPA Reset when I transferred in. I'm doing worse in my major courses. How to motivate myself to finish?",
  "text": " \n\nWhen I transferred I had an A+ average with around 70 hours. That was wiped away upon transfer, and everything started fresh. When I apply to grad schools, will they take that into account at all? It's scary being a psychology major with the thought that I might not get into a grad program..\n\nI feel hopeless. I couldn't get by with minimum wage jobs and taking care of sick family. I went to school, after dropping out fairly young, hoping to be able to create a better life for myself and to make a difference in others. I've taken advanced classes in various subjects from science to business, but the classes in my major, *I've done the worst in*.. which is just sad.. I'm worried it will look bad to grad schools that I managed to get all A's in subjects of wide varieties, but my major courses I do the worst in (B's). It's also a downward trend. I feel like I've not made any meaningful friends, and I just feel sad this has been my experience. I don't know how to force myself to even finish my last semester. I just want to break but I can't afford to due to loans/supporting family/scholarships etc.",
