  "title:": "Should I intentionally fail a course so that I can retake it?",
  "text": "My entire 2 years at university have been spent in and out of lockdowns and I have discovered that online learning really sucks and it's been affecting my grades and my enjoyment of my degree. I started this semester on campus, fully expecting not to have another lockdown (kinda stupid to think that tbh) but when my university decided that we would not return to on-campus learning for the rest of the semester regardless of coming out of lockdown, I just felt like there was no point in trying anymore. I've already decided to take a leave of absence for the next year or until on-campus learning can be guaranteed.\n\nI can't focus in zoom lectures or on assignments, no matter how much I try and it's stressing me out. I'm doing okay in most of my classes. But no matter how hard I try or how long I spend staring at my laptop screen, reading articles and stuff, nothing sticks. I've read the same article five times and I still don't know what it's about. The problem is this course is a prerequisite for a course I need to take next year and I have to get an A on this course to get into it. Since I haven't turned in my midterm worth 25%, there is no way that I can make up the grade to get an A overall. Withdrawing would be preferable but since I have a student loan to pay for tuition which is conditional on being a full-time student (taking at least 4 courses per semester) if I withdraw from this class, I will have to pay for all of my tuition fees for the semester outright, which is money I don't have. My university also does not allow you to retake a class you have passed, even if it's barely passed. \n\nAt the moment, the only thing I can think of is intentionally failing my exam or just not doing it so that I can retake the course next year. I just really hate the idea of failing a class because it will bring down my GPA and it just makes me disappointed in myself.",

      "text": "You should speak with someone in the office of student affairs or your division's dean's office. Someone responsible for guiding your progression to degree. Sometimes they're called advisors but nomenclature varies. \n\nYou may start by addressing your concerns with your instructor.  A lot of times we don't like forced Zoom format either. Document what they say and then take it to the dean's office (or equivalent) and take the late withdrawal.  An incomplete may also be an option which allows you to retain the workload level but defer finishing the coursework til a later term (usually a year).\n\nBottom line is that colleges and universities have been given leeway and should be extending flexibility to the faculty as well as students to navigate learning through a pandemic. \n\nAdvocate for yourself.  Let them know you intend to finish but you need to have a format that works for you.  You're paying after all, I take.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nEdit:spelling",
