      "text": "It doesn\u2019t need to be a particularly \u201cimportant\u201d thing to be descriptive. I\u2019m guessing the professor suggested because it would be the easiest to come to mind/write about. Even if the essay needs to be a narrative you can still write about any small thing from your routine or just something you did yesterday. The most important part is starting your draft because ideas will come easier to you once you have something to work with. Type on your phone too if that makes jotting something down easier. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",
