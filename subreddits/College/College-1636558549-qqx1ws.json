  "text": "For starters, I\u2019ve never been an outgoing person. I\u2019ve always had trouble speaking/participating in class. I can when I need to, but I\u2019ll never just volunteer to do so; I think it comes from my fear of \u201csounding dumb\u201d or saying the wrong answer. But I have been struggling a lot when it comes to participating in class this semester especially and I feel like it\u2019s hurting my grade and overall college experience.\n\nI also am not a math person but am taking statistics this semester (it\u2019s a requirement to graduate), and I am afraid I won\u2019t even pass. The workload for all of my courses is insane and it\u2019s just so difficult to study and take the time to understand the material\u2014particularly for stat. And when I do try to make time, I still don\u2019t understand anything; my prof records each class so I watch the recordings when I miss class\u2026 and I miss quite a bit 1. Because it\u2019s 8am and he records the class anyway, and 2. When I sit in the classroom around all of those other people, I cannot retain any information and am usually just so lost. It\u2019s kind of like \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of even going if I\u2019m not going to be able to learn anything there?\u201d\u2026 but then missing class makes me feel really bad. \n\nOn top of this, I was chosen to be an \u201cattorney\u201d for a moot court (mock trial) for my Constitutional Law class, and I am so so nervous for it. The moot court is a huge part of my grade, and my fear of public speaking and sounding dumb is really getting to me and is going to make the whole thing very difficult for me. On top of that, understanding the 60-page case is very difficult as a lot of legal terminology is used\u2014and most of it I am unfamiliar with. \n\nI also have a million research papers to do with very detailed instructions, and then I also have to teach one of my classes for 50 minutes about the material we read (with two other students though).\n\nBut yeah between my fear of speaking/presenting and all of the work I have to do ALONG with trying to bring up my failing grade in statistics up, I feel like I am doing nothing but drowning while being back on campus. Dare I say I miss online school? I am just beyond stressed out and am not doing well this semester :(",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you are so stressed that sucks. I felt really overwhelmed when my university went back to in person classes. It still feels like a sensory overload sometimes. I feel like with anxiety about public speaking or participating you just have to feel proud about the fact that you are doing it at all. Even if you aren\u2019t doing it as much as you would like, every time you try that\u2019s a win. You could always try letting your professor know why you don\u2019t participate as much. I think professors just want to know you are trying. I hope this helps and you feel better.",
