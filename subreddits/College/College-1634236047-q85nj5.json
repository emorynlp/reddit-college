  "text": "i\u2019m supposed to graduate at the end of this semester but i\u2019ve reached a point of zero motivation today. i keep skipping classes and it\u2019s hard to get through the week with 4 classes, an internship, meetings, commuting to campus which is almost 2 hrs away, still paying for tuition so now i\u2019m basically broke and have to start working again too. and i have to move out in the beginning of next year too. \n\ni\u2019m just tired of everything and it\u2019s about to be midterms. i don\u2019t know how to tell my professors anymore that i am mentally just declining. i know it\u2019s almost over but i\u2019m just so tired. today i\u2019m skipping my class to take a nap. i feel bad but i am also unprepared for class and i can barely keep my eyes open.\n\nidk how to get through this. how are you all doing?",
