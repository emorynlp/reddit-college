      "text": "The good and free combination is hard to come by. The closes to that I have fond is plagiarism checker but they also have a word limit of 3000 in a day and 300 per search. Which is fair I guess. I ended up upgrading to a perpetual license for unlimited scanning but other than the word restriction, it is a pretty decent plagiarism checker and easy to access to unlike turnitin where you have especially request professors to scan your docs.",
