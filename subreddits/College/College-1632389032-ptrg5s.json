I was scared but hoped it wasn't anything bad\n\nTurns out, I apparently plagiarized a paper for his class last school year, but he said that he's letting it go for now since it was just an optional/additional paper, but that I have to be careful next time (I obviously will).\n\nI was shocked to hear that though, because I thought I'd never plagiarize (even accidentally!) since I really didn't intend to, so I didn't know how to respond, so I just said I didn't realize I did, and then thanked him for telling me. He said he'd send a copy of my paper with annotations of why certain parts are considered plagiarized. And I'm honestly so thankful for that, but I still feel so horrible and ashamed. (and disappointed? at myself)\n\nMy friend said I should email him to explain that I'm \"innocent\", but should I? If he's letting it go for now anyways? I think I should, but idk how to phrase it. \n\n\"I apologize for the plagiarism as I did not realize I did that. Thank you so much for telling me and for letting me go this time with a warning. I will not do this again, even though it is accidental.\"\n\n???\n\nedit: I obviously did cite my sources. I also really don't recall copying stuff word for word, but it could've been an oversight", "author": "mangofloatt", "created": 1632389032, "retrieved": 1632946116, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hdzh7xk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptrg5s/what_do_i_do_if_i_accidentally_plagiarized_but/hdzh7xk/", "text": "How did you \"accidentally\" use someone else work that you presented as your own?", "author": "TheRightSideOfDumb", "created": 1632416717, "upvotes": 5}, "hdz8vet": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptrg5s/what_do_i_do_if_i_accidentally_plagiarized_but/hdz8vet/", "text": "Professor here.

Ask genuinely about citation policies and how to make sure you never do this again. Your Professor sounds like they will be open to helping you. Also, use the writing resources you have on campus.
