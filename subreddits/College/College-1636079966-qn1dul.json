  "title:": "What to do when roommates have people over?",
  "text": "Looking for ideas on what I can do to pass the time while my roommates have tons of people in the room. We live in a pretty small triple room so when people are over it can get pretty cramped. Normally I just hang out with them and it's no big deal, but some nights I would just rather chill than basically host a dorm party.\n\nI used to sit outside and talk on the phone but now its freezing cold outside so that doesn't seem like such a good option anymore. Any ideas would be appreciated, thanks!",
