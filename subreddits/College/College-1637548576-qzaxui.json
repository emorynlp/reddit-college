  "text": "I\u2019m in a non committed program at school that helps first gen hispanic students with getting the basics (such as how to transfer, and academic support etc) and I believe we\u2019re gonna be in it for the rest of the years we are at our junior college but, the problem is the english teacher that comes with the program (we have to take her english classes throughout the year & counseling class - which the counseling class is fine) but, she grades SO harshly and is one of the teachers that make it nearly impossible to get an A. this semester was my first semester in the program and i have a\u2019s in all my classes except this english one. anyways, tomorrow is sign up classes for next semester, should i continue the program and keep having that english teacher or move on from it?",
