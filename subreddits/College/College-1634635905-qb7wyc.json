  "text": "I am currently in  my first year. My university's method of teaching grading is different. Previously, I had to write an exam for 80 marks and that is my score.  Here in Uni however,  we have a minor, a major and two-three projects, each with a completely different weightage. My group project and major is left, I will get a B for one of my subject.(83%), which is lower than my class 12th (88% overall). (A is 90%)\n\nshould I consider a drop out? or stay?",

Do not give up on your education because of your dad's dumb opinion. If your dad doesn't want to pay for your tuition if you don't make all A's in your courses then get financial aid. Talk to your advisor first and financial aid before making a drastic decision.",
