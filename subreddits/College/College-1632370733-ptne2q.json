  "text": "So I'm on a trip through my college with my classmates and my professors. \nWe went to a museum where I started getting really anxious for no reason. I came back into my bus where one of my professors were sitting with 4 or 5 others students talking to them. I realized I need my anxiety medication and since all the students weren't back I decided to go get the medicine since I didn't have it in my purse. \n\n\nNow my prescription  requires it to be taken after eating something so I got off the bus after informing that im leaving to go get someth and went to get my food and medicine under the impression that the rest of the students weren't back yet. The food that I got was a sandwich which was being prepared while I got a call from someone in the bus saying the bus is leaving because we were on a schedule. So i asked them to wait for me. \n\n\nAnd when I came back he asked me \"whyd it take so long\" so I told him that I'd asked him prior to going and then he starting YELLING AT ME for just responding with a logical answer. And then he started saying I have an offensive body language. Now that sentence is what triggered me the most because I've never seen my body language as rude and all day I was anxious about my sense of self worth.\n\n\n This sentence broke me right then. And I still tried to defend me he was very loud and scary and i started shivering. We got out of the bus to our destination. We were going up the stairs to some performance while my nose was running and it was evident on my face that I'm struggling. My vision started getting a bit blurry , I saw another professor who I went to , to ask if I can go to medical store he said yes. I went downstairs crying I asked everyone around me if there's a pharmacy near by i walked for hours while I couldn't see ,my chest was hurting and breath became shorter.and since Its a trip I don't even know the city well enough as to where i should go. \n\nA lot more happened but that is unnecessary for this post if you wanna know u can dm me.\nMy point is. How should I have responded to my professor in this instinct he was unready to listen and I've actually started contemplating if my body language is offensive and how should I have dealt with this situation. I just don't want a situation like this to happen again.",

I carry a small emergency supply with me, like 2 or 3 pills, in mine. \n\nYou can probably do this in other countries too, I just don't know what stores will sell them.",

      "text": "I would literally say \u201cexcuse me (until he stopped) and would say I would prefer this conversation take place in front of a dean. Then you meet with the dean and explain the situation and would like to file a formal complaint (if you think that\u2019s necessary- I think it would for sure) for unjustly ridiculing you in a state of fragility (Rightfully so! That\u2019s literally so awful I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you). And also I mean there\u2019s the whole liability with the whole seeking out medicine in a state of panic thing. And your reaction to what happened was totally warranted i mean you were feeling anxious and got yelled at by a grown man.Hope any of this helps!",
