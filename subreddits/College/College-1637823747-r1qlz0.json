  "text": "Graduation GPA is 3.1. Trying to apply to a UC for a music major, but the m requirement is 3.2. I\u2019m going to apply anyway, but I\u2019m case I don\u2019t get in, I\u2019ll also apply to some community colleges. One of those schools has a sport I like, but offers less music programs than the other school. The other school had an abundance of programs, but it doesn\u2019t have the sport I like. Which school should I prioritize the most?",

      "text": "The better transfer program. I'm assuming you're not a college athlete, but even if you are, you're paying 10k+ a year in tuition for your schooling, not for your extracurriculars. Especially being in California, I'm sure you could find a group, even if it's not sponsored by the university, for a sport you like just because there are so many people.",
