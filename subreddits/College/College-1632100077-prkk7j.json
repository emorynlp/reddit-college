  "text": "My old roommates moved out of the apartment that I have been living in for the past 2 years. Now, two new guys moved in (they came in together as friends) and they are big time stoners. I asked them not to smoke in the common areas, and they stopped for a while but now started again.\n\nI started having problems with breathing, and I'm annoyed that my clothes smell like weed. Any ideas of what I should do? (The lease prohibits smoking as well)",

You could try to tell them your feelings, but it sounds like they don\u2019t care. Telling the lessor that your roommates are smoking pot would get them kicked out, but your roommates might be quite hostile.",

I wouldn't mind telling the lessor, but I honestly just want to move into a different apartment as soon as possible without causing much of a scene. Just not sure how I can explain the urgency of the situation to my lessor without telling them about the smoking...",

If they don't have any rooms available, I will probably move to a different place. I appreciate the encouraging words and tips. Thank you.",
