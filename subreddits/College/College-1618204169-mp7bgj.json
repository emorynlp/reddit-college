  "text": "It has to have 8 sources, a title page, table of contents, executive summary, letter of transmittal, body of report, conclusion and references page and I am just now starting it!\n\nDue in 2 hours LETS GOOOOO\n\nI\u2019ll update y\u2019all when I finish lmao\n\n(i hate myself)\n\nUPDATE: well, unsurprisingly that was quite possibly the most dogshit paper i have ever written. I was supposed to include at least 3 graphs/pictures, only had time to include 1. My executive summary and conclusion were basically the same thing and both were too short and my paper overall was too short. All in all, a dogshit paper but at least i turned it in on time lol. Good news is that I have 100% in the class rn and this is the last paper we have to write so I can afford 1 bad grade and I\u2019ll still get an A in the class so I\u2019m not worried. But still- let this be a lesson to y\u2019all to not wait till the last minute to write a paper!!!",

And I love how you try to justify it by saying it was a. Art History and b. an elective, as if that makes your bullshit any more palatable. And no - I have never cheated. And people who use file corrupters just to trick their professors because they are lazy ans  wait until the last minute are the reason why said professors don\u2019t believe honest people when things legitimately go wrong. Cheaters and liars always justify their bullshit and usually assume that everyone else is depraved as they are. Thankfully, most people are not like you.",

              "text": "You're absolutely right. In my uni in particular the teachers are very lazy and won't even read it, some will read but will not bother to check for plagiarism. I think that is because we are taught in English and most of the material we copy and paste is translated from English sources so it is a pain in the butt for most professors. I would argue that the biggest reason I can submit a plagiarized paper from start to finish and still pass the class is because the professors couldn't care less! Many don't even come to class. One has even complained that he hadn't received his payment for the past months so he didn't care.\n\nbtw I am from Mozambique. Third world problems.",

Apparently, my group mates were not updated of the revisions and we only learned it that same day like, an hour before submission and presentation. (was absent when it was announced, prolly sick idk i don't really remember). \nLong story short, we managed to present and pass the paper on time hahahaha. Will never, ever, do it again. Can't forget the amount of anxiety. That's where I learned my capability of functioning under high pressure. \n\nWe passed the subject at the end of the semester hehe.",
