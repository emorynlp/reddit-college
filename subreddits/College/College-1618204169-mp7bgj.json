Just now starting it", "text": "It has to have 8 sources, a title page, table of contents, executive summary, letter of transmittal, body of report, conclusion and references page and I am just now starting it!\n\nDue in 2 hours LETS GOOOOO\n\nI\u2019ll update y\u2019all when I finish lmao\n\n(i hate myself)\n\nUPDATE: well, unsurprisingly that was quite possibly the most dogshit paper i have ever written. I was supposed to include at least 3 graphs/pictures, only had time to include 1. My executive summary and conclusion were basically the same thing and both were too short and my paper overall was too short. All in all, a dogshit paper but at least i turned it in on time lol. Good news is that I have 100% in the class rn and this is the last paper we have to write so I can afford 1 bad grade and I\u2019ll still get an A in the class so I\u2019m not worried. But still- let this be a lesson to y\u2019all to not wait till the last minute to write a paper!!!", "author": "mylifeisinshambles5", "created": 1618204169, "retrieved": 1632802086, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1162, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gueeu32": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mp7bgj/12_page_formal_report_due_in_2_hours_just_now/gueeu32/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1618339047, "upvotes": 2}, "guec2b8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mp7bgj/12_page_formal_report_due_in_2_hours_just_now/guec2b8/", "text": "I did this yesterday, I had to write 10 pages from executive summary to conclusion.
