      "text": "10 years working jobs that don't require a college degree. I think it's understated how horrible those jobs are. I was in woodworking. Go to r/woodworking, read it for about 20 minutes, and throw all that away. It is nothing like that whatsoever.\n\nThe hours were ALWAYS 10 hours a day. Seasonally you would have no work in the winter and all summer would be overtime. None of these places are air conditioned so you tote a fucking fan around to dry the sweat. From the time you get there, you've got saw dust in the crevices of your arms and neck. \n\nNot only that, the labor part of it is insane. Making thousands of cabinets for a hospital means that somebody is lifting each one of those cabinets and all the sheet goods to make them. I'd be lifting parts from the CNC and putting them on a pallet on the ground for 10 hours straight. \n\nThe people I worked with had a 50% chance to be absolute scum. I've worked with prisoners, drug addicts, child molesters and racists. I've watched 3 men go into a single restroom together to do cocaine at work. I've found more than one roach/joint on the bathroom floor. The finisher did either acid or mushrooms at work one day, and he talked to me while I was standing with the vice president of the company. The finisher would smoke pot outside during breaks and everyone knew but nobody did anything. He'd drive the forklift around while all sorts of fucked up. \n\nThe owner of the company was the worst narcissist I've ever encountered. No matter what you would say about something, he'd immediately say no then tell you what he thought. 9 times out of 10 it'd be what you said. Everything was about him. It was insane. He was untrustworthy. He forged the paperwork to keep the illegal immigrants on payroll when their social security numbers didn't match their names. He's using illegal work to undercut the market and put strain on the guys who do it right. \n\nOur turn over rate was 1 person a month. Within a year of when I started, a guy who'd been working there for 8 years walked out one day. He went from 70k to 45k. The business would hire people and micromanage the shit out of everything they did until they got tired and left. It was a load of horse shit. \n\nLastly, I've been in shops that just don't care about your well being. One shop's finish room wasn't properly vented and the finisher would roll freshly finished pieces out of the booth for them to cure. This would ultimately flood the cabinet shop where I worked with VOCs. This is enough to give you a headache in 20 minutes and it lasts all day. They wouldn't do anything about it. So here I am making 16.50 an hour killing myself in the name of cabinets. Add the fine dust of MDF and particle board and you're on the fast track to some sort of lung disease. \n\nStanding on concrete for 10 hours straight is the absolute worst. There are no shoes capable of keeping your feet from absolutely throbbing by hour 8. All of these shops prohibit sitting. You do not sit in wood working EVER. I assure you that whatever you thought was a good idea to sit and do, isn't. \n\nThey need mindless people who love to work hard and fuck themselves up. Believe it or not, there are plenty of people that exist like that. They don't think, they just work hard and smoke cigarettes. They are usually terribly unhealthy people and they don't mind working their body into their grave. They are inundated with back problems, joint problems, fucked up hands from table saws, teeth falling out and so on. Those people are good for those jobs, not me. \n\nThat's it. That's what keeps me in school. I've already suffered back injuries that I'll keep forever. All for 16.50 an hour and being so mentally broken down from micromanagement and narcissism that as a grown man, I often found myself hiding in the bathroom trying to reason with myself. I remember driving to work and not being able to stop myself from screaming at my steering wheel and pounding it with my fists. A few times I was within 5 minutes of work and called in sick. \n\nGet a fucking education.",

I am in my last semester of junior year of college and i will be a senior next year.\n\ni have struggled with learning disabilities my whole life and have dealt anxiety, panic attacks, and occasional but intense bouts of depression for a good chunk of my life as well.\n\nSince I transferred to the University of Arizona in the Fall of 2019, I have had a learning specialist/ counselor/ case worker who i meet with once a week and she helps me stay on top of my academics and checks in with me to make sure learning disabilities and mental health challenges don\u2019t go unchecked/ unnoticed. I also have a support network of educators who make sure that i get my learning accommodations.\n\nSo, part of what keeps me going is showing my learning specialist/ counselor and my support network that i can take what they have taught me and use those tools/ coping mechanisms to be successful.\n\nMaybe one day, i can pay it forward by working with students who have similar challenges to those that i have and show them the way and provide them with the same learning techniques and tools and mental health resources that i have been provided with.",
