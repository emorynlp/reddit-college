  "text": "There's a class that I want to take but all of the ones that align with my schedule are full except for one that is second-half term. So it starts halfway through the semester and goes until the end of the year, basically just half a semester. Does this mean it will be more difficult than a typical full-semester course? I would think this means we have to learn the same amount of information in half the time.\n\nIf anyone who has taken a second-half term course could let me know how it went I'd appreciate it!",

      "text": "You\u2019re right that this will be harder. It\u2019s basically an accelerated class with the whole semester crammed into a half semester. Generally expect to spend twice the amount of time per week on a class like this as you would otherwise. If it\u2019s a subject you\u2019re strong in, you will likely be fine (unless your school and work schedule are overloaded) but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for one of your weaker subjects (or something that you find difficult).",
