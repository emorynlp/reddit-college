  "text": "Greetings,\n\nI am a computer science major. A lot of things have happened in my  life recently, but overall I wasted a year of my life not going to  college. I am 20 and technically have two more years to go in order to  get a bachelor's degree in CS. After some personal struggles, I was able  to get into Cal State LA, but they are not going to offer any online  classes in the spring 2022 semester, which is what as planning to do  since I moved to NC a few weeks ago. Because I am an out-of-state  student here in NC, I do not know what else to do; college tuition is  quite expensive, so I cannot afford to go to a four-year university. \n\nMoreover, since I completed all the requirements for my major,  there's nothing else I can take in a community college at the moment. I  wish Cal State LA offered online classes in the spring, but they do not;  I might lose another semester without taking any classes.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I came up with three ideas about what I could do next.\n\nI could:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Work at Target for about 3 months or more and have them pay my tuition (for online universities only)\n2. Work at UPS (and earn $17 an hour) and have them pay my tuition (up to $25,000 in total; $5000 per semester)\n3. Wait a year uand then become an in-state student and pay my tuition yourself.\n\nOther than these options, I do not really know what else to do. What  do you guys think? Is there a way for me to even attend a 4-year  university in the spring without being charged a lot of money in NC?  What should I do?",
