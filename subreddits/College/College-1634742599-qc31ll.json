  "text": "Hi all, doing some syllabus research and I'm curious to know - if you don't read the syllabus, why not? Is there anything that would make you STOP reading it? Any red flags that keep you from actually digesting or remembering what's in it? Or any syllabi you've loved (if love is an emotion that can be applied to a syllabus...)? Really appreciate the input!",
