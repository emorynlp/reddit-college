  "text": "So, I\u2019m currently a junior in college. So far I was an English major (considered being an editor or going into law), exercise science major (considered pursuing physical therapy, and now I\u2019m a public health major. I was considering getting a accelerated nursing degree after I finish public health but I\u2019m facing a dilemma. I don\u2019t know what I want to do. Time is ticking and so is my financial aid. Any advice?",

      "text": "My advice is to choose a major that has classes that you enjoy. \n\nYour GPA matters since you want to apply to a grad school. And even if there are prereqs, you can fulfill them after your degree or as electives. An example is that you can get a medical degree after getting a bachelors in english even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it would work. It\u2019s more about the skills you can apply rather than the content (because you will learn more content in your masters).\n\nIf your dilemma is what you should do after you graduate? Well. Do what makes you happy. Get some experience under your belt if you\u2019re unsure. Shadow and intern and find out what you\u2019d like your daily life to be like. Then apply for grad school if you find it necessary.",
