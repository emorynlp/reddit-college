  "text": "I am in my senior year and after I finish my classes this fall of 2021 I have 5 more classes in the spring. I am so tired of school and have a great opportunity that doesn\u2019t involve getting a degree mid spring of next year. So chances are I won\u2019t even use this degree but I also might not go back. Best advice? Go back to school in the fall or finish this spring and put it off. I\u2019m also not good at school at all and am constantly just studying or in tutoring. And working a full time job. My credits will never go away? Like in 3 years if I want to go back, I won\u2019t have to take more classes? Suggestions?",

      "text": "Despite the opportunity, I\u2019d get the degree. You have 1 semester left and put a lot of money into it. If you change jobs after your opportunity, you might find yourself needing or wanting a degree to help with the application process. That being said, if your major doesn\u2019t have a lot of job opportunities, you wouldn\u2019t miss a lot by taking the job. Usually credits aren\u2019t applicable for transfer or graduation after 10 years if it\u2019s STEM. Also if the program gets removed or changed, you may be behind in graduation or unable to complete it altogether.",

      "text": "I got out of military and ended up in college cuz that was just, like, what you did.  I didn't really want to be there and ended up in a situation kinda like yours: got a solid gig working part-time for a government contractor during my senior year.  They asked me to commit to more hours / take a jr. leadership role that would be full-time and keep me busy.  \n\nI bit.  NGL, the money was decent.  I didn't drop out though, just punted to taking 1 class a semester.  Dragged out 1 semester of full-time classes to like 1.5 years.    \n\nJob was a shit-show and I regretted it.  Easy as a part-timer, but not as a full-timer.   \n\nOther jobs weren't as receptive to my application without the degree, too -- had a lot of go-nowhere interviews.  Despite having a clearance and lots of recruiters hitting me up, lots of misses.  I did an IT minor and was able to (eventually) transition to IT but I wish I started that move a lot sooner, and finishing the degree faster would have been Step #1.   \n\nPoint is:  finish the degree now.  If you don't have the time or energy now, why do you think you'll have the time or energy when you're older?",

      "text": "If there's absolutely NO WAY to take this opportunity and finish your degree (even at part time) maybe see if you can defer? You may be able to get up to 5 semesters \"break\" from school without losing your acceptance. Definitely talk with your academic advisor to see if any classes or credits would expire in that time. Deferment will at least keep your foot in the door at university while you test out this new opportunity. \nI still believe that a 4-year degree, no matter what it is, opens more doors than not having it, so if you can finish, do it!",
