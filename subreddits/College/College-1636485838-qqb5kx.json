Then there's confidence intervals and alphas and disproving the hypothesis... I don't understand why I can't grasp it. Any suggestions?",

      "text": "I got you.\n\nZ scores let you compare data and averages of different scale. You want to see if a 70/100 is better or worse than a 1530/1800 and which has a wider or narroewer deviation from the mean? You look at Z scores. \n\nT tables are similar, but they compare data to a theoretical \"normal curve\" of standard deviation and outliers, etc. So if there is a difference between a population and a sample, and you want to know if the difference has a statistical significance, then you look at T table. \n\nAlpha and confidence levels are \"the same but opposite\" an alpha of 0.05, is the same as a confidence level of 95%. Think of the confidence level as 1.00 and you subtract the alpha to get confidence level. So Alpha of 0.05 is 95% confidence and an alpha of 0.01 is a confidence level of 99%.\n\nSo! Because we're talking about confidence levels in regards to your hypothesis, and you NEVER have a 100% confidence level, you CAN'T test it. So instead you're testing the Null Hypothosis. You run your T test and you can \"disprove the null hypothesis\" or \"fail to disprove the null Hypothosis\". If you disprove the null, the opposite is accepted, you accept the hypothosis to a degree of certainty. If you fail to disprove the null hypothesis, than the null hypothesis COULD BE true, and you can't accept your hypothesis with a degree of confidence.",
