I forget if this is the same for undergrad, it\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s April 10th and I haven\u2019t heard from a school. I\u2019m already 95% sure I\u2019m where I\u2019m going anyway but I was curious so I sent an email asking what\u2019s up. They ask what email I used to apply and I\u2019m like \u201clet\u2019s check that, although I\u2019m sure I know the email it\u2019s on\u201d ... I never hit submit on the application. I replied and said, \u201chey, so I never hit submit on my application. I\u2019m EXTREMELY embarrassed by this. Can I just assume this won\u2019t be reviewed in time?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m kicking myself right now but it\u2019s still a funny story to laugh at.", "author": "cr1ss-b", "created": 1618071486, "retrieved": 1632947345, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1044, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gv5pcbc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mo7pw5/heres_a_fun_story_for_you_guys_to_laugh_at_i/gv5pcbc/", "text": "Check out [Zoom Orgo](https://www.zoomorgo.com)", "author": "mnm821461", "created": 1618885719, "upvotes": 1}, "gu7lwb5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mo7pw5/heres_a_fun_story_for_you_guys_to_laugh_at_i/gu7lwb5/", "text": "I did this with a job application before they closed.
