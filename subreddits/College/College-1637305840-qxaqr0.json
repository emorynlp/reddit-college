  "text": "so. my CIS110 instructor does nothing. like 0. this is an online class, but so are my other courses and they all have recorded lectures and office hours. this one has neither. he doesn\u2019t even have office hours in his syllabus, it just says \u201cN/A.\u201d Like wtf? It also says on his syllabus that he\u2019s traveling so he will be few and far between. How does he even get away with us? \n\nAnyways. This is what I\u2019m most upset about: he told me to google it. Yep. He said to google it. And I was like LITERALLY I asked you for a meeting to discuss the material and you want me to GOOGLE it?!!? \n\nSo. Do I write him a nasty course eval or take it a step further. Thoughts?",

      "text": "I had a similar situation last year and I was fucking pissed that my professor was giving no effort into teaching the class but rather, just making us rely on the online homework site. I would say give a bad course eval and try to talk with a higher up like a dean or something and express your feelings on how the professor is not putting in any effort. It is your money that your spending on this course so you should have every right to be upset.",
