  "text": "Okay, so I am a sophmore this year and I have an essay I am doing. In all my years of writing I have never cited a lecture or my lecture notes. I have never heard a consistent answer with this so I am curious. Most of my profs have said there is no reason to cite lectures and beyond because they were intended for us to learn and use with them. However, when I look it up I see some saying you should and now I am totally lost. So I am curious if you think lectures/lecture notes need to be cited.",
