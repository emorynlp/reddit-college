  "title:": "Can I be in a frat and avoid hard drugs",
  "text": "This is my second year of college but my first year at a big university. I really want to join a fraternity with my friends, but my desired career field has a zero tolerance policy for everything other than weed (polygraph tests are commonly used). I\u2019ve heard cocaine is pretty heavily used in all the frats and I don\u2019t care if others do it I just can\u2019t ever do it myself. I guess what I\u2019m asking is, can I be in a fraternity for the remained of my college years and never do these drug without seeming uncool?",

I know a few guys in this particular frat pretty well and they\u2019re always really nice and inclusive when I\u2019m around and they encourage me to join the fraternity next semester. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m very bias in making this decision, I just need to make the best decision for my future.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t really speak for fraternities but it depends on also where is your school and what fraternity it is. I\u2019m in a sorority and I\u2019m very much so a homebody and I don\u2019t really extend myself to others. But my sorority sisters understand that and if they are truly decent people they would not make you do anything you\u2019re uncomfortable. Also the fraternities I have on my campus are pretty low-key and very nice but I go to a women\u2019s school so take what I say with a grain of salt. Also all the fraternities we have are POC based.",
