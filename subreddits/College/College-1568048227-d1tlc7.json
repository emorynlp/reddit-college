I did not live in the US or whatsoever, I was born in Portugal and although my parents always told me to get good grades I was never forced to get straight A's in fact I'm mostly a B student, 13/14 in a 0-20 scale, I mean I would love to get 18's and more to get more scholarships and honors. But now that I am 21, I realized that it doesn't matter what you study or where you study as long as you are passionate about something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, its perfect that parents want their kids to get good or perfect grades, but it comes to a point that the kid achieves exhaustion without even noticing.  In the US, kids are so used to get perfect grades and always achieve their maximum or close to potential that they don't know what is like to fail. And going to college most likely kids are told by their parents what to pursue as a career, you did not have time to explore in high school several things, sure you took extra classes and enroll in some clubs but most of that work is just for appearances in the college application. \n\nKids whose parents pressure them too much to get good grades did not enjoy their teenage years enough and don't know the concept of real world, I suppose... I mean your job is mostly to study, get straight A's and everything you need your parents provide, and you probably never wondered what it took them to get that, or where it came from. \n\nWhen you go to college is a whole different level of pressure, its a lot, like way more than high school years combined, and don't go to college with the mentality you had in high school, get a good GPA, but not like straight A's.... If you manage to get straight A's and still enjoy life, congratulations, I wish I could do the same, maybe I can and I'm too lazy to try... \n\nOne thing you need to do when you get into college is to realize, specially if you live in USA, CA, AUS or UK, is that tuition costs a lot but like a lot of money to your parents... Like 40k a year, you would get your Bachelors, masters and PhD in Europe, with accommodation and food paid and some trips... Get summer jobs somewhere, start giving value to money. It doesn't matter where you work, it can be a coffee shop or restaurant or whatsoever, you are nor above nor below anyone.  When you do that you start seeing how much you cost to your parents life, they don't care, I wouldn't either as long as my kid would get somewhere. But look after your mental health and put yourself in your parents or someone with less opportunities than you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne strong advice I would give you is to ask your parents permission to take a GAP year and come to somewhere in Europe and find some volunteer projects you can get involved at, they would cost you far less money than college, although you would miss a year, your thoughts would come clear. I wish I had done the same in my 18's... Once you experience the world the clear your thoughts get and the more open minded you get. Life is not only about getting A's... Thats nothing, that is absolutely 0 in this planet. Sure, you get in a good Ivy league, good job, perfect life, but monotonous and without knowing what really matters. H2H, Human to Human and Heart to Heart connections are extremely powerful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.
