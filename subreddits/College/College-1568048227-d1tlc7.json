  "text": "I grew up an A+ student who was always told by my mother, \"You have to go to college or you'll be making minimum wage your entire life. Only guys can make a living without going to college.\" This honestly trapped me and I felt forced. I've become extremely burnt out from school and college seems like a major waste of money to me. Even if I didn't think it was a waste of money or it was free, I would not be able to mentally handle the shit that comes with college because of how insanely fucked my mentality is due to trauma. College just isn't working out and this is my second attempt at trying to do so. How can I have a reliable future without attending college as a female? I'm honestly worried to no end right now, so any help is appreciated.",

      "text": "Hi! I'm female too. I actually am still in college but dropped out of a traditional private college and am now going to community (much better, I feel less sad now). Meanwhile however, to support myself I am working in manufacturing (a factory job assembling hospital equipment like beds and such). If nothing else you could try going to a temp agency and work through them (and eventually get hired in). I am close to getting hired in myself and get paid $13/hour weekly working 40 hours a week not counting overtime if we are asked to work weekends (time and a half on Sat and double on Sun). People who are hired in where I work make $15/hour but not sure if they are paid weekly or biweekly. Minimum wage where I live is $9/hr. It's not perfect by any means and money is still tight for me but yes you can absolutely still survive esp if you don't start out living on your own (so utilities like electric etc can be split). Good luck!",

      "text": "you can join the military or join the peace corps. I recommend talking to a  military recruiter and hear him out.  A majority of jobs in the military don't go into combat nor see combat. Some people have desk/admin jobs that deal with paperwork. You get a steady paycheck and get to travel. The military will also help you get a degree so you can get a civilian job after the military. You can make a career out of it and retire at like 30-40 years old.\n\nThere is also the peace corps. You volunteer in a foreign country for two years. After your commitment with the corps they give you $10,000 to readjust to normal life. I'd look there. GOOD LUCK!!",

College is stressful, but there are ways to keep yourself going. Not everyone follows the same path. Heck I'm going back to college in my 30's and still feel like you do but to be honest, it's more of a trap not to have a degree or certificate.",

      "text": "I feel like, mostly, US students suffer a lot with mental depression, in any stage. I did not live in the US or whatsoever, I was born in Portugal and although my parents always told me to get good grades I was never forced to get straight A's in fact I'm mostly a B student, 13/14 in a 0-20 scale, I mean I would love to get 18's and more to get more scholarships and honors. But now that I am 21, I realized that it doesn't matter what you study or where you study as long as you are passionate about something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get me wrong, its perfect that parents want their kids to get good or perfect grades, but it comes to a point that the kid achieves exhaustion without even noticing.  In the US, kids are so used to get perfect grades and always achieve their maximum or close to potential that they don't know what is like to fail. And going to college most likely kids are told by their parents what to pursue as a career, you did not have time to explore in high school several things, sure you took extra classes and enroll in some clubs but most of that work is just for appearances in the college application. \n\nKids whose parents pressure them too much to get good grades did not enjoy their teenage years enough and don't know the concept of real world, I suppose... I mean your job is mostly to study, get straight A's and everything you need your parents provide, and you probably never wondered what it took them to get that, or where it came from. \n\nWhen you go to college is a whole different level of pressure, its a lot, like way more than high school years combined, and don't go to college with the mentality you had in high school, get a good GPA, but not like straight A's.... If you manage to get straight A's and still enjoy life, congratulations, I wish I could do the same, maybe I can and I'm too lazy to try... \n\nOne thing you need to do when you get into college is to realize, specially if you live in USA, CA, AUS or UK, is that tuition costs a lot but like a lot of money to your parents... Like 40k a year, you would get your Bachelors, masters and PhD in Europe, with accommodation and food paid and some trips... Get summer jobs somewhere, start giving value to money. It doesn't matter where you work, it can be a coffee shop or restaurant or whatsoever, you are nor above nor below anyone.  When you do that you start seeing how much you cost to your parents life, they don't care, I wouldn't either as long as my kid would get somewhere. But look after your mental health and put yourself in your parents or someone with less opportunities than you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne strong advice I would give you is to ask your parents permission to take a GAP year and come to somewhere in Europe and find some volunteer projects you can get involved at, they would cost you far less money than college, although you would miss a year, your thoughts would come clear. I wish I had done the same in my 18's... Once you experience the world the clear your thoughts get and the more open minded you get. Life is not only about getting A's... Thats nothing, that is absolutely 0 in this planet. Sure, you get in a good Ivy league, good job, perfect life, but monotonous and without knowing what really matters. H2H, Human to Human and Heart to Heart connections are extremely powerful. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. I have probably went to mars and then moon and back to earth, but I hope you get the idea.",

Along with the other recommendations, you could get your real estate license.  You just need a high school diploma or GED to get started with real estate school.

You have so much more free time, you can set your own schedule so you can allow yourself to wake up late if you wanted to, eat lunch on your own time, and you can even skip class without an repercussions. \n\nYou could try out community college for a semester and see how it goes, it's cheaper and I wish I chose community college to get my gen ed's out of the way. Other than that I feel like you most likely have trained yourself to have a pretty good work ethic in high school, and that'll transfer really well. \n\nI used to think the same as you, I got burnt out right after my senior year of high school, finished off with just under 2 years of college credits under my belt (none transferred tho lol) and I kept telling myself there's no way I'm dealing with another 4 years of this bullshit. So far it's pretty great though, and I have plenty of time to do whatever I need, I just need to cut back on playing games late at night and instead should probably be doing math homework.\n\nWhatever path you choose know it's never too late to switch, I have people in their 40s and 50s in some of my classes, and they're the most interesting people I've talked to.",

If you have the drive go to codecademy.com (may be .net) and also freecodecamp.org These are very good sites for entry level programming. There are more. With the rise of AI and all things tech, programmers are needed and I think this field will be one of the most secure going forward as so many jobs will phase out in the next 10 - 20 years. Good luck with everything and I hope you find something you love. I know our socks but for the average person, a degree means a lot. It's difficult to get someone to look at your resume without a degree. UNLESS! You can show them good work like a very well built program/app and website. These are all thing answers that I've either experienced or found in my research. Again, good luck! I wish you the best!",

She walked into her first day of college as a Sophomore.  \n\nYou're not the only person who can do math to perform a financial planning calculation.  \n\n> It must be nice at least knowing she got one of the easier ones.  \n\nI'm not sure how to interpret this.  \n\n> I presume she isn\u2019t going into law because that\u2019s reserved for STEM graduates.  \n\nI'm pretty sure Business, English and History are the most common sources of Law School students, and not STEM.  \nSo if you have evidence to support your claim to the contrary I'd love to see it.  \n\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/pre_law/  \n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/articles/2017-12-14/choose-the-right-college-major-for-law-school  \n\n\n> Let her be a lesson to your other children.  \n\nShe graduated #8 in her class of 400. She is a pretty solid example to others, including her sisters.",

You haz interview skillz? You can haz job.\"*  \n\nUVA offers no noteworthy employment benefit over VCU for these jobs in question.  \n\nYou could make a reasonable argument for the quality of education at UVA over VCU. UVA is extremely well funded and equally well known for delivering a high quality education. But to their credit, and in their defense, VCU has a fine reputation for delivering a good to above-average education. It does not suck. It has no negative shadow looming over its diplomas.  \n\nTo say that VCU is academically not as good as UVA is fair and reasonable.  \nTo say that VCU sucks and damages your employ-ability is not fair nor reasonable.  \n\n\nBeing a HS Teacher is a state or county government job.  \nThe salary offerings for a given applicant has practically no leeway for a high-quality applicant over a mediocre applicant.  \n\nSo the additional investment in a (arguably) higher cost/higher quality education has practically zero return on that investment.  \n\nNow, 10-15 years from now when she starts to apply and compete for Principal or Administrative Faculty positions, the quality or pedigree of her education may become a discussion point.  \nBut school teachers are eligible for subsidized continuing education, so she might throw another Masters degree on her resume at some point, and if the state is paying a heqalthy portion, investing in something of a higher quality might be a worthwhile investment.",

              "text": "This is such a shit take. Many trades put a lot of stress on the body but sitting at a desk all day has its own health risks. Frankly no 40 hr/week job is truly healthy long term considering how much longer ppl these days will have to work before retiring. And plenty of trades/careers that don\u2019t require college still require good problem solving and interpersonal skills, it\u2019s not all mindless grunt work. \n\nUnder $25 an hour is a totally comfortable and respectable income for many people. Not everyone is highly money motivated. Plenty of us are ok with making just enough to live comfortably.\n\nOP, it looks like you got plenty of helpful replies, just my 2 cents but before I decided that I did in fact want to finish college (since I had already put nearly 2 years in) I had thrown around the idea of being a vet technician or an esthetician/doing nails. Neither are incredibly lucrative but they seem like enjoyable jobs for the right type of person and aren\u2019t the typical electrician/plumber type trades people typically think of. My mother is a hairdresser, she loves her job and no, we\u2019re not rich but we are certainly not destitute in any way even after she separated from my father and I consider her to be very successful in her career... she is also self employed which many people find very empowering in a career.",
