      "text": "Make an exam from the material the professor is using. \n\nI've adapted my strategy in my Materials and Manufacturing class as it's just a shit ton of memorization. \n\nThe professor gives us 'skeleton' notes. Essentially she fills in blank spots. The first exam didn't go too well, but I'd like it to go better. I got a 79.5% after a 10% curve with the average at a 70. I'm happy with it for the most part. \n\nIn class, instead of simply writing everything she does, I use the time to try and write questions about the slides like she would on an exam. For example, when going over the slide on stainless steel alloy percentages, I make the question \"What is the main alloying element in stainless steel?\". \n\nI'll usually end up with about a page and a half of questions at the end of the 50 minute period. I throw these into a flashcard program and study them every so often.",

      "text": "Things that took up a lot of class times or popped up a lot in assignments. Concepts that may carry over to upper level content.\n\n\nAnother way to do it: if there are multiple exams, you can get a feel for how they ask questions and what sort of content they focus on. Chances are, even if the actual concepts are different, the exam structure will be similar.",
