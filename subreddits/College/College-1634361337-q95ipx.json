  "text": "Hi, I've been intending to study in a community college, although I am Brazillian, and then transfer (Computer Science) to an American university (2+2). My doubt is, Is the community college affordable for foreigners if studying and working at the same time? I am from a low-income family and I'd have to help my family to afford my costs of living.\n\nAs a second option, I'm considering Canada because as I've seen, foreigners have more freedom to work and the tuition is cheaper.\n\nI want to work in the technology field in the future but I don't know what is the best choice for me right now.",
