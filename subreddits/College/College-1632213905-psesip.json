Any insight?", "text": "Right now, it sounds really silly but I am in quite of a predicament right now. I am a freshman in college and not one month in, I found out that engineering is not for me. I know what you're thinking, \"you're only taking GEs what's the issue?\" everything IS the issue. I am barely getting by in Calc 1 and according to the BME roadmap at my Uni, I have to take up to Calc 3 and Linear Algebra or some shit. I always hated math in hs but the reason why I did engineering was partly due to the fact that my parents both work in that field and they sort of forced/encouraged me into BME. Now I am regretting this choice and I am starting to gear my interest towards MIS (Management Information Systems) or Business Finance. How are the job options for an undergrad in these majors? I heard for BME, not many jobs hire undergrads for it. I am not looking forward to grad school. I am heavily interested in pursuing MIS or Finance. Please help something else that is not engineering.", "author": "Banananickle", "created": 1632213905, "retrieved": 1632800994, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdq1x2a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psesip/i_am_thinking_of_switching_out_of_biomedical/hdq1x2a/", "text": "Are you leveraging any of the array of support resources for math that I'm sure your university offers?  \n\n-----  \n\nMIS is gloriously versatile, and thus generally very employable.  \n\nA good MIS program can be technical, or business-focused, whatever you want it to be.  \n\nI encourage you to explore career options on the other end of the rainbow now, so you can tune your elective options in the correct direction towards your objectives.", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1632235509, "upvotes": 2}}}
