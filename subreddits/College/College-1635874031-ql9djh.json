  "title:": "How do you deal with unsupportive family?",
  "text": "I posted a really long post in another sub if you care to read my sob story about this. \n\nBasically the only family member I have, my grandmother, doesn\u2019t support me at all. She\u2019s never proud of me for how hard I have been working in school or my grades or anything I do really. I have a good job that I love even though it takes a lot out of me, I\u2019m getting all A\u2019s in my classes, and I take care of her full time. She acts like all of this is nothing? As if it\u2019s easy to have these 3 huge responsibilities on my shoulders at all times. She has one other grandchild (my cousin) who is\u2026 not a good person and has not been very good to her, yet she thinks he\u2019s the best thing since sliced bread. She praises the crap out of him for doing nothing. He dropped out of HS, has never had a job or future plans to do anything even at the age of 22, he lies to her to take money from her, etc. Yet she talks to him in ways that she doesn\u2019t talk to me. She\u2019s soft and caring and encouraging. When she speaks to me, it\u2019s usually to verbally abuse me or talk down to me.\n\nI know most people will say that as long as I\u2019m proud of myself, that should be what matters. I\u2019m very proud of myself. I suffered for years getting bad grades through HS and early college because of untreated mental illness, having to take care of her while also taking care of my drug addicted mother, and just trying to survive. I\u2019ve worked hard and I know I deserve these good grades now. But it hurts when I get excited to tell her about a good grade or getting good feedback at work and she gives me a short answer as if I\u2019m the most unimportant person to her. \n\nAnyone have any advice on how to accept the fact that I may be the only person who is ever proud of me? Or how to accept that I will most likely continue to not get support or recognition from her even though I desperately crave her approval because she\u2019s been my only real parental figure/caretaker since I was in first grade?",

It really meant a lot. Now that I think of it, it meant more than anything my grandmother could ever say to me after many years of abuse. So you\u2019re absolutely right. Again, thank you. I do have some people and I need to focus on them.",

In my honest opinion he\u2019s dumb at both, school & street. She\u2019s just blowing smoke up his ass for no reason. My thoughts, she hates me so much and gets tired of talking down to me and acting miserable, so she has to have someone where she can flip the switch and be extremely nice to them and act happy. I could be wrong. But I don\u2019t see any other reason why she\u2019s his biggest fan when he\u2019s overall\u2026 an idiot who does nothing for her.
