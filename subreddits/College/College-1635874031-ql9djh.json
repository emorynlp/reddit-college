  "title:": "How do you deal with unsupportive family?",
  "text": "I posted a really long post in another sub if you care to read my sob story about this. \n\nBasically the only family member I have, my grandmother, doesn\u2019t support me at all. She\u2019s never proud of me for how hard I have been working in school or my grades or anything I do really. I have a good job that I love even though it takes a lot out of me, I\u2019m getting all A\u2019s in my classes, and I take care of her full time. She acts like all of this is nothing? As if it\u2019s easy to have these 3 huge responsibilities on my shoulders at all times. She has one other grandchild (my cousin) who is\u2026 not a good person and has not been very good to her, yet she thinks he\u2019s the best thing since sliced bread. She praises the crap out of him for doing nothing. He dropped out of HS, has never had a job or future plans to do anything even at the age of 22, he lies to her to take money from her, etc. Yet she talks to him in ways that she doesn\u2019t talk to me. She\u2019s soft and caring and encouraging. When she speaks to me, it\u2019s usually to verbally abuse me or talk down to me.\n\nI know most people will say that as long as I\u2019m proud of myself, that should be what matters. I\u2019m very proud of myself. I suffered for years getting bad grades through HS and early college because of untreated mental illness, having to take care of her while also taking care of my drug addicted mother, and just trying to survive. I\u2019ve worked hard and I know I deserve these good grades now. But it hurts when I get excited to tell her about a good grade or getting good feedback at work and she gives me a short answer as if I\u2019m the most unimportant person to her. \n\nAnyone have any advice on how to accept the fact that I may be the only person who is ever proud of me? Or how to accept that I will most likely continue to not get support or recognition from her even though I desperately crave her approval because she\u2019s been my only real parental figure/caretaker since I was in first grade?",

It really meant a lot. Now that I think of it, it meant more than anything my grandmother could ever say to me after many years of abuse. So you\u2019re absolutely right. Again, thank you. I do have some people and I need to focus on them.",

I know it\u2019s hard because we crave validation from our family, but sometimes that just doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nMy mother never really liked college, she was a dropout herself. She devoted her life to the Catholic Church, die-hard religious. So everything was all about rules. My sister, an ex alcoholic with a bad past, got pregnant at 27 while she was unmarried and moved back into my spot at my parents house the second I left for college. Every single thing was all about her and she loved it. Her moving in and becoming the center of my moms world, completely overshadowed me going to college. My parents didn\u2019t really care, my dad at least tried to, but my mother never gave a shit. She doesn\u2019t see the value in higher education. However, when my sister had her baby out of wedlock and decided to go to community college, she was so proud of her. She bought a sweatshirt for the college and car stickers, did research on the school. My mom just treated my FAFSA as a chore. She never said she was proud of me, ever. But dear god if she\u2019s proud of her awful other daughter.\n\nThe thing is, seeking out someone to be proud of you will only hurt you in the long run. It\u2019s wonderful to have someone say \u201coh I\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d But you have to take pride in your own work sometimes. You have to be proud of yourself for the work you put in. College is hard work. Hell, I\u2019m a senior in college with almost a full engineering degree heading towards my masters, no ones proud of me so I\u2019m proud of myself. \nIt is hard, but in this case you have to do it and it sucks. But hey, from what it sounds like you work really hard and it can be frustrating, so listen I\u2019m proud of you.",

To work full-time, go to school full-time, and take care of her means I have almost no free time. Yet he is amazing because he does nothing with his life and lies to her and says that he\u2019s going to college so that he can get tuition money to use for his long-distance girlfriend to come visit him. She knows about all the lies and refuses to do anything about it.",

                  "text": "You\u2019re correct.\n\nI\u2019d say what makes me care for her is how it\u2019s expected of me from my extended family. I mentioned it in another comment but my family thinks that I \u201cowe\u201d this to her. She took care of me when I was young and now it\u2019s time for me to take care of her. That kind of thing. Little do they know that her \u201ctaking care of me\u201d has put me in a worse place mentally. I agree that with the way she treats me, I have no obligation to continue taking care of her. \n\nI also mentioned in another comment that she does help me financially when needed and she paid this semesters tuition. If I felt fully comfortable being on my own financially, I would leave so quickly. Living with her at my house doesn\u2019t feel like \u201chome.\u201d I don\u2019t feel safe or secure or relaxed here. I feel like I am walking on eggshells constantly. I get uneasy at the sound of her voice. I feel on edge when I hear her walking towards my room in fear that she\u2019s going to talk to me (or I guess you could say just yell at me.) I am working to become financially independent. My state is an expensive state to live in. I\u2019ve even thought about applying for jobs out of state (I attend school online) to move somewhere more affordable for me. I\u2019m definitely working on it but it\u2019s not easy being a student and trying to find a higher paying job than the one I have now. I make decent money but not enough to live on my own fully especially if I stay in this state. I\u2019ve been thinking about renting somewhere close by with a friend. I will keep exploring options until I find what works for me.\n\nEdit: I also wanted to mention that because of my horrible grades from my previous attempt at college, I was taken off financial aid. After this semester, I should be eligible again. That will be a huge relief to not rely on her for that any longer and will make leaving a lot easier as well.",

          "text": "Not really, most parents/parental guardians do not verbally abuse their children. Most families I know get along just fine. There may be arguments from time to time. But they do not tell their child that they\u2019re a bad person, worthless, or stupid. Especially if that child is their caretaker who ensures that they are okay to live in their home. If I wasn\u2019t here to take care of her, no one else would do it meaning she would need assisted living or something along those lines. When I mentioned my cousin, I forgot to mention that he also refuses to get a drivers license. He can\u2019t even drive here to take care of her, can\u2019t drop off groceries or medication, he can\u2019t offer her rides to doctors appointments that she needs to go to. I genuinely want to be here because I know no one else would do these things for my grandmother, she has no one besides for me and my cousin. It just hurts that she favors him when he doesn\u2019t do anything for her at all. I am stuck with all of the responsibilities while he gets praised for just living his life on his own without a care in the world for her. \n\nIt\u2019s not life. Getting verbal abused, screamed at, and told you\u2019re a bad person by your parents/guardian is not life for most kids or young adults. If you think that\u2019s life\u2026 well that\u2019s pretty sad and I feel bad for you that you\u2019ve been taught such a warped version of a parent and child relationship.",
