I'm currently in 2nd year and I've been doing well with balancing my responsibilities with my life and other interests/hobbies. But the problem is, I'm easily affected by my surroundings and the people I have to deal with at school everyday. I can learn to take things less seriously if I need to (also for my mental health), but I am surrounded by other students who are vocal about being hard on themselves, students who flex being overworked, students who gossip a lot, students who feel satisfied when others also have low grades, it's just diminishing my spirit because I don't want to be an outcast or unrelatable, so I just go along with these people. I want to thrive in my own way and have peace of mind, but it's so hard when you're surrounded by the opposite. Have any of you guys experienced this or are experiencing this? What did/do you do? \n\nBtw, thank you so much to any one who answers, it's nice to feel not alone.", "author": "springxxday", "created": 1632927272, "retrieved": 1632945354, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
