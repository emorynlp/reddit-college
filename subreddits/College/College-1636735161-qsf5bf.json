  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nI thought that I could pay it off next semester because I'm not working this semester. I was wrong. Class selection is next week and my savings account can barely cover 1/6th of the amount. My parents are already paying for housing and the meal plan, and convincing them to pay for those was a hard battle won. I'm not sure what to do. If I tell them I dropped, they probably won't pay in which case I can't pick out classes. I'm looking for a job now but there's literally two weeks in the semester left.\n\nCollege isn't for me. This freaking sucks. Any ideas?",

Talk to the school to see if you can take a semester off and still keep your scholarship for Fall 2022.\n\n> College isn't for me. \n\nWhy are you saying this? Because if you're not sure you should be in college, taking a break is probably a good idea until you can get yourself focused and driven (and financially stable) enough to be successful.",

Google your uni + emergency loan, and if you don\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, go and talk to financial aid and see what they have to say.\n\nGood luck. College is for you.
