  "text": "I\u2019m writing an essay about Shakepeare\u2019s \u201cSonnet 130\u201d and holy crud it is so annoying. I have like 600 words so at least I\u2019m halfway done but jeez, this essay is making me hate poetry. Like I understand the poem (sort of) but it\u2019s going to be challenging to get it to 1,200 words because I do not have a lot to say about it. Anyways, thanks for tuning into my venting session.",

To me, how language has changed and evolved is interesting so that is what I would do if I had to stretch out a paper. The Shakespeare stuff that I have read normally has references to things that a modern audience wouldn't immediately realize, and these references are easily found with a bit of googling.",

              "text": "It's really not hard.\n\nThere is so much you have to set up before you can even begin writing about the painting itself. Art being a reflection of the society that created it, we have to consider the artist, the perception of them in their time, the social, political, and religious factors that were in play for the artist at the time, the materials that were used and why they were chosen over other materials, they style that was common at the time.\n\nI just did 5 minutes of reading on Sonnet 130 and would have no problems writing 800 words about it. Shakespeare was trying to turn the style on its head, he was satirizing the style popularized by Petrarch some 300 years in the past. He is kind of saying \"guys, it's been 300 years. Can we do something interesting already? The style is played out.\" He is the Lonely Island of his time, elevating the style parody to real entertainment, and it clearly worked, since we are reading it some 400 years in the future (take that Andy Samberg).\n\nThere might also be some kind of class divide commentary, can we consider the education of the time? To even read and comprehend poetry one would have been quite well educated. Most people may not have understood it at the time to be a commentary on the style. They may have taken it more literally, as just ol' Billy The Bard roasting some lady he is banging.",
