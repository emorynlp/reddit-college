  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my third year in engineering and I honestly have no idea how I\u2019m still here. I had to drop a whole semester my freshman year, drop 2 classes sophomore year and also failed a class in the summer, now in the end of junior year I\u2019m skipping classes again and I feel lost in a class and have no idea what is really going on. I want to get a job but this is just so much for me. I\u2019m already deep into my major and would just end up wasting money and time switching. Besides, I do like my major. I just end up failing at managing my time. I can\u2019t focus on 4 classes at once. Also morning classes suck. Despite this I still have a 3.52 gpa but honestly it\u2019s embarrassing taking a class filled with freshmen as a junior. I see people I knew from high school doing so much better than me and I feel like a loser for it. Right now I just had to fail this assignment for a class because I literally could not understand a single question.",

      "text": "It sounds like you're bragging.\n\n\"yeah, I can't manage my time and I'm failing classes but still have a 3.5GPA\"\n\nIt sounds like you need a semester off. Engineering isn't a particularly easy major to get through. Its one of the reasons why jobs pay so much in that field.\n\nMy college had a 54% drop-out rate for CS and engineering majors.",

      "text": "If you aren't going to class and aren't doing something better with your time (I skip class a moderate amount for research and an internship, but this is usually a fine trade-off), you're wasting either money, time, or both. If despite your best efforts, you're still failing things and unable to finish courses, you should probably consider getting professional help (sounds to me like it could be undiagnosed ADHD) or picking another career path that doesn't involve college. It sounds like you're on track to finish college in about 6 years, and even with a full-ride, that's a huge opportunity cost: missed time in the industry, late start to grad school (though it sounds like that isn't for you), and even the lost time that invested money from your job would compound for retirement. If you're still paying college costs, that's just money down the drain.",
