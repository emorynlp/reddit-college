As of today, this is my final semester of undergrad.\n\nFreshman year was my lowest point. I was new, inexperienced, socially stressed, dependent on particular attention, uncomfortable in my own skin, and commuting from home. I was eighteen at the time, and equally responsible for maintaining in vain my eroding high school relationship that would only have enough fuel for another year. Freshman year was defined as the year that I stuck to what I was familiar and most comfortable with because, one, I wasn\u2019t forced to act differently, and two, I didn\u2019t exactly know how to act differently. I\u2019d be excessively self-conscious and self-critical, and never in a way that was constructive, because I knew that something wasn\u2019t quite right, yet I\u2019d no real idea how to remedy it. I thought it might have been the way that I walked, or talked, or wore my clothes. It was not.\n\nI was, to be honest, a sheltered boy throughout my life up until the end of first year. My parents, bless them both, in combination with the fun and playful dynamic between my two younger brothers and I, fostered an environment that never placed me in a position that required an \u201cadult\u201d level of reasoning.\n\nMy best friends from my high school had all gone in unique directions and pursued their own college goals. I was left to my girlfriend, her friends, her friends\u2019 friends, and some guys from their high school that knew me and liked me well enough. My relationship would be tumultuous the entire year, which I\u2019d rather not discuss, but we stayed together to our mutual detriment.\n\nFall semester, sophomore year. The fall was clean, and crisp, and familiar. Come October, some days before my third anniversary, I broke off my relationship. At first, this was liberating, but I was hurt, I was very badly hurt, and it would take months to come to this conclusion, consciously. The remainder of the fall semester of sophomore year would be spent making half-assed attempts to grow my social network. I\u2019d reconnected with an old friend from elementary school, who\u2019d instantly in my mind became so much more than just a tom-boyish girl that would skateboard with me and ask for my chocolate milk during the fourth-grade lunch recess. That might be too specific, I\u2019m sorry. Anyway, this turned out to be a stinging waste of time and emotions. I was left alone.\n\nMy best friend from high school, who\u2019d been occupied with his new fraternity and his own personal and academic journey, had successfully applied and been working as an RA for a private student-housing company\u2019s dorm on campus. He said it was fun, it was paid, and it was hiring. With his support, I applied and interviewed, which was the first time in my life that I was well-spoken and secure in a professional setting. I was hired, and would need to move in to my own room in the dorm before the upcoming training session.\n\nTo announce the news to my family was bittersweet. They were supportive and proud, but sad to see me go. My mom took it especially hard. This would be the first time I would live away from home.\n\nSpring semester, sophomore year. I\u2019d settled into my own room within the most popular dorm on campus with a big bed built from combining two twin mattresses, and a desk that doubled as a literal battle station in its length and space. My co-workers welcomed me. My management reassured themselves as pillars of professional support. My best friend lived a building away, and would visit often. I was, in spite of these luxuries, so helplessly anxious. On the very first day of training, I\u2019d just barely missed a panic attack, and had persistent, quiet, and racing thoughts of regret. This was so new to me. It felt like I was tossed into a place with extreme expectations that I didn\u2019t think I could ever capably meet. This was never the case. Becoming an RA allowed me to fully express myself as an empathetic and understanding individual able to make a difference.\n\nAfter getting a hang of the work, and accustomed to my class routine, I turned my focus to my social life, and how to begin to tip-toe out of my shell. I\u2019d started exercising with my best friend, and we\u2019d frequent the dining hall, just like everyone else. We\u2019d go to house parties on Fridays and Saturdays and sometimes flash fake IDs to careless bouncers for entry into two-bit bars and clubs, toast shots of tequila and rum in friends\u2019 apartments and dorm rooms, and flirt and fuck with unprecedented beauty. This persisted almost every week until I noticed I was losing myself and my way, and did not feel any less lonely. Nothing ever felt explicit fulfilling, and I broke my own heart. Toward the end of the semester, I would meet a girl I\u2019d only ever seen twice, and she became my current girlfriend. I love her from the floor of my heart.\n\nJunior year was defined by unremarkable classes, stress, professional and personal drama, my resignation as an RA, and the start of my new job as a graphic design specialist and marketing director for our campus movie theater, an organization overseen by the student government, which I, by association, became a member of. It was by virtue of this experience that I met many disciplined and exceptional people with a passion for the school, its students, and its future, all part of a social side of the university I\u2019d never seen nor thought of. My mentality shifted significantly. Everything that I was doing, I was doing to make a difference, inspired by the similar feeling of being an RA. That\u2019s what\u2019s most important about your time at school, in my opinion, that ability to share what you know with others and have them share what they know with you, so that this cycle of knowledge and inspiration can take place and potentially change the world.\n\nSenior year, finally, I came full circle. I was living at home and commuting again, parking at the same stupid guest lot of the same stupid off-campus dorm that my ex lived in throughout our freshman year. However, everything was different. I\u2019d become my own person, independent, caring and compassionate, with strength and security and the ability to make his own decisions, create his own opinions, and establish his own boundaries. However, I maintain the room to learn from others. That\u2019s what matters most. I believe I absorb the very best of those around me, because that\u2019s just what I see in them.\n\nThere is no peak, only a journey, both highs and lows, undulating like the ocean. My life changed when I decided to be myself. Don\u2019t waste your time by asking if this is the peak or about to be the peak. Peak every day. How will you spend your time? What do you want to learn? Who do you want to meet? What difference will you make?

Full stop. Socially, it was amazing. However, I\u2019d say I \u201cpeaked\u201d my junior year. I turned 21 two weeks after classes started and had just moved into a bachelor pad with like 9 guys from my group. \n\nBetween all the drinking games, parties, bars and night clubs I *somehow* managed to actually *raise* my gpa from the previous two years. I\u2019m still questioning how that happened... But I look back at that year with very fond memories. \n\nDon\u2019t think too much about it.

I went out a lot freshman year, like most weekends, and I did my fair share of drinking. The next year I tended to only go out if there was a particular party to go to, like someone I was friends with was hosting. I did have the worst hangover of my life though that year, and I almost wish I would have blacked out so I didn\u2019t have to remember that night. Anymore it\u2019s just birthdays or a beer/whiskey at dinner on occasion.\n\nI also struggled in finding my stride. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do and I tried multiple things. I joined clubs I never went back to, but I found some I still try to make time for. I\u2019m happy with my major now and the friend group that I have.

If you peak your first year, you totally miss out on the value of all the other things you do or will do.
