  "text": "Report bc original post got removed bc my title mentioned a laptop (?)\n\nHi all, this is probably a super dumb question. Throughout high school and my past 1.5 yrs of college, I\u2019ve always printed out notes supplied by professors and taken notes manually. However, it\u2019s started to be more of a hassle and I don\u2019t like to use so much paper. I\u2019m really bad with technology tbh so I don\u2019t really know where to look. Does anyone know any applications/programs that I can use to take notes of pdf files of lecture slides (on a laptop)?\n\nI always see people using their iPads to take notes and I\u2019d honestly love to do something like that, but unfortunately I\u2019m way too broke for an iPad right now lol.",
