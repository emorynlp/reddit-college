  "text": "I used to be on top of everything. Even my sisters would agree by joking that I would start on an assignment two weeks before it was due. I looked down upon those who procrastinate and complained about having so much work to get finished in such a short time. I thought those who claimed they lacked motivation was just trying to make a excuse to not do their work. Now, I have become a victim and I do not know how to handle it.\n\nI am in my last semester of completing the general classes for college. The first year was alright. As I said, I was on top of everything. The the second year came and I started struggling, but kept on. Now in the last semester I am about done with everything. The thought of having to start something fills me with a strong lack of interest. I had this problem for most school subjects, but I sucked it up and got it done. I now dread starting something so I come up with excuses as to why I should not do it it at given moment, telling myself I will do it later. I repeat this action until the last minute, filling three days with nothing but work. Even then I feel little motivation. I have lost seriousness. I now convince myself that getting one zero wont kill me. I turn in work that is only half way done, telling myself that the teacher wont grade it too harshly. I no longer pay attention in class, choosing to get on my phone instead (my classes are still remote). I even missed the deadline for graduation applications because I was not treating it serious enough.\n\nI have never felt this defeated. I have never felt this finished. I do not know how to handle it as each time I tell myself \"do better,\" I end up repeating the same thing next week.",

I haven\u2019t really bounced back from it and don\u2019t know how to. Perhaps it could burnout or mental exhaustion? I wish I could be of more help to you, I wish you the best and hope things start looking up for you \ud83d\udc9b",
