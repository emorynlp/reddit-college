  "text": "Based on the little stuff I\u2019ve been reading and see how y\u2019all feel about ppl dropping out let me say this. It was my 1st year. I have some scholarships but tuition per semester is about 7,000. My mom can barely afford it as is but she could mange. I have seasonal depression which would automatically make college hard in the beginning to an extreme. I tried for 2 months. Only went to 3 classes in the past month. I wouldn\u2019t exactly have a way to not have straight Fs. So I think it\u2019s better to start over. I setup tutoring was preparing to switch my major felt better then crashed again. This happens weekly. I have little social life but I was on the way to fixing it. I love the school and as much I don\u2019t want to. I have to leave. I would have to work hard to come back to the school I\u2019m dropping out of but I think it\u2019s just the perfect case of right school wrong time. Too much has happened over the past year in the world and my personal life. I thought I was ready but I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m trying to come up with a plan for the future and have already started to get things together. Maybe I have to stay closer to home in order to get better idk. I\u2019m just mad at myself for disappointing others. I know this is what\u2019s best for me. I know I don\u2019t owe anyone and explain or reasoning but I just don\u2019t know how to handle the comments and judgment.  Anyone have any advice on how to handle that? Or what to say to ppl when they ask my plan? Ik what I want to do but something about everyone asks stresses me out and I\u2019m stressing my mom out Ik she trying to just help. Anyone have advice?",
