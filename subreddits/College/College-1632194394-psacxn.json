  "title:": "Given the pandemic, how hard (or possibly easier) would it be to make friends once I transfer from community college next year? How could I sort of make up for missing out on the college experience this and last year?",
  "text": "I feel painfully lonely in CC right  now, knowing that I'm missing out on the college experience, people are  having the time of their lives as I write this, partying and making  memories (even though I don't even know if I'm a party guy).\n\nI'm  worried that I'm not gonna get much out of my undergrad in terms of the college experience, 2 years at a 4 year school just feels like too little (I wish I cared about this back in high school). Here are some things  I'm wondering:\n\n* Normally  by junior year, friend groups are solidified since students already had  two years. How true is that given that everyone was cooped up in  virtual classes and what not, last school year? Would it be at least a  little easier?\n* Once  I do transfer, I'll actively think about if the college experience is  something truly special and that I would never get it in my life again.  If so, I might want to spend a 3rd year at the school I end up at,  though lots of students my age would graduate? Would I end up lonelier,  even if I had friends in \"grades\" below me? Could I just make more  friends during my 5th year?\n* I'm  thinking I might want an MBA and would consider doing so at the school I  get my bachelor's (I'm studying CS in CC), Would that help at least a  little, where I get to spend more time at the college? I researched that  grad school is vastly different from undergrad and the social scene  isn't the same. Would it help if I started grad school with some friends  in grades below me and continued to spend time in places like clubs?  Even if I got busier?\n\nI know some people like to say that college is glamorized in America and the \"college experience\" is overrated, but the I'm very sure that lots of people (more) make a good amount of friends and memories in their at college, and the pandemic made me realized I want to as well.",
