I am constantly in communication with professors because they practically baby sit our work by requiring notes as a grade...\n\nSo because I'm older/not tech savvy, I did not know I could merge individual PDFs into one. So I turn my notes in ON TIME and she refused to grade it because it needs to be one PDF(she told me this two days later), ok cool.. figured it out and uploaded it and all those notes turned in on time no longer matter because I get points chopped off because it was \"late\".\n\nTen years ago college sounded more like \"show up, you should take notes, but everything is your responsibility and the test/quizzes/projects will let me know if you studied or not.\"\n\n\n\nTLDR/ All notes are graded, had to create a pdf and prof didn't want to grade the 5 individual PDFs so learned to merge them and reupload into one PDF only to get a chunk of points taken off because it is considered \"late\" since prof responded two days later.\n\n\nUpdate: I read the syllabus and it is not stated in any specific way how the PDFs are to be uploaded.\n\nThanks to a fellow redditor, I emailed her and she is updating the grade.\n\nThis micromanaging is not only one class but three others too where I am graded on notes every week. So all the note taking that HAS to be neat and understood by the professor IS DIFFICULT!

It's obviously quite frustrating when you just want to study, complete assignments and turn them in and be on with your day. The micromanaging is definitely not something I thought I would have to deal with in my late twenties.

Sadly, many students dont put any time or effort in class and then they do poorly. The students response then is to complain to the dean about how cruddy the professor supposedly was. When you ask the students what they did in class, you find out they didnt really do anything. Read through reddit. Countless college students saying how they never even opened a book and tried to rely on powerpoint lecture slides. Guess what, passive learning doesnt really work. Yet somehow this falls on the instructor to fix even though the student puts in zero effort themselves. \n\nAdmin gets pissy about bad student reviews and students having to repeat classes they failed. This has led some instructors to start pushing back by making attendance and notes mandatory and part of the grade. Looking at notes helps instructors by giving them feedback about their lectures. If they can see through notes that students appeared to totally miss a concept, they may focus more on that during the next class. \n\nInstructors dont want to be be spending a lot of time reading student notes outside of class. We have better things to do with your time, just like you. My students have to turn in hand written assignment each week. Im not grading on penmanship, grammar, or \"doodles.\" I can read chicken scratch. And I have many times found students having incorrect thinking about a concept which I was able to give feedback on and correct. \n\nSo is note taking annoying for some, yes.
