  "text": "I\u2019m at an American college and my friend goes to university in the UK.\n\nHe is always shocked by the sheer amount of classwork I am assigned. Weekly discussion boards, a paper due every week, online homework every week, quizzes every week, exams monthly (at least), final projects. Not to mention the fact that I am taking 5 classes and he is taking 3. \n\nWe are both pursuing the same degree/major. For most courses he only has a final project and one or two exams, and that\u2019s the ONLY work he has to turn in the entirety of the semester. He can abandon classes for weeks at a time and not fall behind. \n\nDo American colleges just assign busy work? He tells me to just \u201ctake a break\u201d from schoolwork but I genuinely can\u2019t if I\u2019m flooded with assignments every week. I\u2019m tired.",

The UK system is basically one giant exam at the end of the year and then cramming 9 months of lectures into that exam, it is incredibly stressful and exhausting and overall just a total pain in the ass. The American system on the other hand prioritizes more consistent effort, which is so much easier to follow along and actually learn the material you are studying.",

Pros to busy work: helps you absorb and review what you\u2019ve learned, exposes you to the materials, forces you to study, can bump up your grade by simple participation, makes your projects/midterms and finals  worth less. I\u2019d say this is all especially important in STEM classes. \nI get overwhelmed by the work sometimes but I don\u2019t like putting all of my eggs in one basket, the idea of my entire grade depending on 1-3 tests seems risky to me. Yes sometimes the busy work can drive my grade down if I run out of time but if I do the work then my test scores tend to improve as well so I see it as a win-win. \nI will say this though, I had a professor once that assigned so much work that I just gave up on the class past the drop date and just took the F, it was unreasonably busy for the class I was taking. Retook the same class with a different professor and got an A.",

Yeah it might sound easy to only have one exam at the end of the year, but that exam is comprehensive and covers everything you learned over the past year. You have to sit and revise for weeks/months to know all the material from day one onwards. I think the majority of people would choose all of those assignments and quizzes over the exam that has everything lumped in together.",

I make it very clear that if they keep up with the tasks then their lives will be easier when it comes to the assessment as they will have had feedback to help develop their work but if they don't then it's on them, it's uni not school or college. \n\nI think there are differences in the way courses are structured and assessed everywhere but I think we (the UK) put far more weight on that final assessment as evidencing their learning.",

It may be more time consuming but it\u2019s easier to get a good grade, I feel. In the UK (or Australian) system, you only have maybe 2-3 assessments and then a final. So if you don\u2019t score well (and like, breaking an 80 percent is really tough) you\u2019re SOL. So it\u2019s less time overall but there is more cramming and stressful assessments and getting a good grade is more difficult. That\u2019s my experience, anyway",

Semesters are typically 12 weeks, but I've have 10 week semesters for the last couple of years. \n\nWe do have discussion boards, reading for tutorials etc but it doesn't count towards our grade.",
