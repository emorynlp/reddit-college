  "text": " So this is really bad but my biggest issue is trying to motivate myself to do the schoolwork and to perform well in school. I go to class and not pay attention but my current grades suck right now because I don't take school seriously at all and i want to change that 100%. I can't be living like this forever and I need to find a better way to get better and do my work more. What tips and tricks can I do?",

      "text": "Are you struggling because you are bored by the way your professor teaches or because you are bored by the content you are learning? If it is the former, you can try self-teaching the content (personally, I find this a lot more motivating). If it's the latter, you might want to consider changing majors.",
