  "text": "UPDATE: Guys...I am still in shock from this. I actually can\u2019t believe this is real. I SOMEHOW BY SOME MIRACLE GOT 100% ON THE PAPER. WTF. I\u2019m convinced he must\u2019ve not read it \ud83d\ude02 either way I\u2019m so relieved and so happy to be done with that. Ended the class with an A- and overall made the Dean\u2019s List this semester! LET\u2019S FUCKING GOOOO!!\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI didn\u2019t even know that this was humanly possible, but I did it. Somehow. \n\nI had this paper that was assigned in MARCH and my professor repeatedly told us all over and over again throughout the semester, \u201cplease do not wait until the last minute to write this paper. I promise you will regret it. Please please start it early and do a little bit each day.\u201d\n\nWell what did my dumbass do? I started the paper 4 hours before it was due. I have never regretted a decision so much in my entire life. I\u2019ve always said that I have no regrets, but for the first time in my life, I have a regret.\n\nI was crying the whole time while writing this paper and felt intense anxiety the entire 4 hours but I did it. I somehow fucking did it. I genuinely did not think I would pull it off but somehow I submitted all 22 pages at 11:54 PM, just minutes before the deadline.\n\nNow granted, they were 22 pages of pure dogshit and I\u2019m probably gonna get a horrible grade but hey, given the circumstances I\u2019m proud I at least finished it and powered through.\n\nIf y\u2019all want an update once I find out my grade, let me know.\n\nEDIT: A lot of you have been asking what the paper was so I\u2019ll go ahead and explain. It wasn\u2019t a research paper luckily so no sources needed or anything like that. It was for my marketing class and throughout the entire class we did a marketing simulation project where we had to run a business and marketing campaign selling products and it was divided into quarters. So the paper was basically explaining every single business decision you made in the simulation for each quarter and WHY you made that decision and what the result of each decision was and reflecting on the results so mentioning what you would have done differently, etc. Sounds like it wouldn\u2019t take too long or be too difficult but you\u2019d be surprised lol because overall there were A LOT of decisions made during the simulation and you had to go in depth on every one of them.",

(It was a music based thing. All they had to do was listen to two songs and answer some questions.)\n\nI had to create fake people with my friend (God bless her) and was able to hand in a 17 page and had to present it the following Monday.

I drafted individual parts in separate documents and then pasted and edited on the paper itself. It seems hectic cause you would have multiple docs instead of one paper but I prefer focusing on one segment at a time, cause drafting at one document feels overwhelming.\n\nSo for example, I need three literature reviews that corresponded to my study. I made three separate documents and typed a two page summary for each review (that's 6 pages in total) and after looking over what I wrote, I copy and pasted into the paper document and edited it to flow good. I'm a mass communications major so writing is easy but because it was a sr. Seminar paper and needed my experiment with it, that's where I had issues.\n\nMy best friend used a few of her siblings as reference for answering the questions and I used what I knew my friends and family would say as well. Then I had to correspond that to my paper for the next couple of pages. I was able to hand it in around 11:53 and needless to say it was messy (I didn't know how to put numbers into percentages because numbers give me headaches, like genuinely) but I got it in and it was rough.",

It was a capstone essay that had a lot of requirements that needed fulfilling, and I started it about 5 or 6 hours before it was due. Absolute bullcrap essay. I had multiple panic attacks and genuinely contemplated ending it all during and after the process of working on it. To my absolute, intense shock, I ended up getting a C on the assignment. I got a B in the class, overall. I pray that you end up in a similar position. Good job on completing the work.\n\nAdditionally, even if you don't end up scoring a high grade, you can always retake the course. Remember: it's JUST a class.",

It didn't matter if the class was a 2000-level class or 4000-level class, if you seemed to follow the prompt and guidelines and met the page length, he would give you a 100% for the essay grade.",
