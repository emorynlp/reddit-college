I actually can\u2019t believe this is real. I SOMEHOW BY SOME MIRACLE GOT 100% ON THE PAPER. WTF. I\u2019m convinced he must\u2019ve not read it \ud83d\ude02 either way I\u2019m so relieved and so happy to be done with that. Ended the class with an A- and overall made the Dean\u2019s List this semester! LET\u2019S FUCKING GOOOO!!\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI didn\u2019t even know that this was humanly possible, but I did it. Somehow. \n\nI had this paper that was assigned in MARCH and my professor repeatedly told us all over and over again throughout the semester, \u201cplease do not wait until the last minute to write this paper. I promise you will regret it. Please please start it early and do a little bit each day.\u201d\n\nWell what did my dumbass do? I started the paper 4 hours before it was due. I have never regretted a decision so much in my entire life. I\u2019ve always said that I have no regrets, but for the first time in my life, I have a regret.\n\nI was crying the whole time while writing this paper and felt intense anxiety the entire 4 hours but I did it. I somehow fucking did it. I genuinely did not think I would pull it off but somehow I submitted all 22 pages at 11:54 PM, just minutes before the deadline.\n\nNow granted, they were 22 pages of pure dogshit and I\u2019m probably gonna get a horrible grade but hey, given the circumstances I\u2019m proud I at least finished it and powered through.\n\nIf y\u2019all want an update once I find out my grade, let me know.\n\nEDIT: A lot of you have been asking what the paper was so I\u2019ll go ahead and explain. It wasn\u2019t a research paper luckily so no sources needed or anything like that. It was for my marketing class and throughout the entire class we did a marketing simulation project where we had to run a business and marketing campaign selling products and it was divided into quarters. So the paper was basically explaining every single business decision you made in the simulation for each quarter and WHY you made that decision and what the result of each decision was and reflecting on the results so mentioning what you would have done differently, etc. Sounds like it wouldn\u2019t take too long or be too difficult but you\u2019d be surprised lol because overall there were A LOT of decisions made during the simulation and you had to go in depth on every one of them.", "author": "aworkinprogress98", "created": 1619423588, "retrieved": 1632946785, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2397, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gyrcgew": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mysg5u/i_just_wrote_a_22_page_paper_in_4_hours/gyrcgew/", "text": "This is me in about 4-15 hrs when I get the fire to sit on my ass and type.
