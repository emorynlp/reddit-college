  "text": "So, for one of my units, I have managed to get pretty good grades this semester. I have done well enough that if I decided to just not do my final assignment I would still pass the class. Normally, I would be against doing this but I am really behind on the work and I have a big exam for another class in a week that I am concerned that I might fail.  \n\n\nSo just wondering if you think it is worth sacrificing a better grade in one class so I can study and be better prepared for my exam?",
