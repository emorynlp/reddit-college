      "text": "No.. college just gives you enough info on the topic to be dangerous. It lays the ground work for teaching you how to absorb knowledge. Mastery takes lots more research and practice post college. In my experience, the only thing that comes close would be a doctoral level program, but even with those you'd be lucky to master only a small facet of the overall field. \n\nThink of someone who goes to school to be an MD. They graduate and still have many years of training ahead to actually master the thing they want to specialize in.",

          "text": "You didn't get my point. I'm mainly asking whether it's feasible to master several fields instead of one very deeply. Like whether it's possible to effectively master both EE and CS. Traditionally paired, but I think both are too broad today in order to do much of meaningful work without plenty of specialization.",

      "text": "Think about something like biology. Once you get into medical school, they cover 3 semesters of an undergrad course in a fraction of that time. Still they don\u2019t master it. Majoring in something just gives you a good basic understanding on a range of topics in that field. You are going to know a little more about plants, cells, human anatomy, biochemistry, viruses, scientific writing, microbiology, etc. They are still taught at a foundation level. You are constantly learning even if you finished a masters or PhD.",
