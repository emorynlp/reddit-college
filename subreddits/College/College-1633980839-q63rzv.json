  "text": "So I made a mistake. I accidentally let myself get behind in one of my classes and apparently, I'm supposed to have read 2 and a half full-length books on Greek history now. I'm anticipating a lot of long, tedious reading this week, but please give me any tips you have on how I can organize my reading schedule and read as efficiently as possible!\n\nP.S. Should I still take notes?? That slows me down quite a bit.",

      "text": "A lot of textbooks are filled with fillers. Generally speaking, you shouldn\u2019t be reading each page word for word, but skimming and pulling out the main topics and supporting ideas. \n\nTaking notes would be helpful, but in your case if you feel it will only slow you down then just omit it. But you do want to understand what is being explained because otherwise there\u2019s no point in reading.",
