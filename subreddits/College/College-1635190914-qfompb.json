  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore at a pretty high stress school, and it has been rough. I am beyond burnt out, and have very little interest, motivation, or energy left for classes or anything else. I have always done well academically, and my grades are good in college too, but I\u2019m wondering if it is worth it. Nothing here sparks my interest or really brings me joy, and it feels like I\u2019m wasting my money just because college is what I\u2019m \u201csupposed\u201c to do now. \n\nI have thought about taking a leave of absence or transferring schools, but I really have no idea what to do. Home isn\u2019t a place I can go back to, so I would have to figure out something else. Does anyone else feel this way? Any advice?",

      "text": "if i were you i would take a gap year. you don\u2019t have to worry about reapplying and you can funnel all your energy into doing some soul searching and figuring out what it is you really want. you\u2019re only a sophomore, so you haven\u2019t spent too much time slaving away at school to turn back. i wish i could say the same, but i\u2019m a senior now and i\u2019d be crazy not to power through and get my degree at this point.",
