  "text": "So, I have a class that's probably my roughest (foreign language) and I have a quiz today like we do literally every day. It takes an hour to commute there and back. The quiz should be relatively easy. I'm considering not staying for the whole class though as I have a big take home test I need to finish and submit today, and an hour and a half class that will mentally wear me out and a 2 or 2.5 hour drive is a lot. I've honestly mostly decided I'll leave after the quiz if I go at all, but I'm wondering if I should tell my professor that I'll head out with some sort of excuse or just only bring a pen for the quiz and leave.",
