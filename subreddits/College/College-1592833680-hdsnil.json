No matter how hard I try, I never do as good as others - from the people who put zero effort and cheat their way through uni just to get some degree, to the ones who are really into their studies. For example, I could spend weeks learning something I\u2019m genuinely interested in, and my absolute best would be a 50%.\n\nI know comparison kills, but almost everyone does it whether it\u2019s in college, their job, or life in general. Sometimes it\u2019s a good to see where you stand, keep yourself in touch with reality in a way. Everything just makes me feel extremely inadequate and incompetent in the field I\u2019m supposed to be knowledgeable in.\n\nHow do you overcome that? I\u2019m not by any means striving for perfection, I just can\u2019t help but feel as if I\u2019m not doing something right, and wish it didn\u2019t bother me that much.\n\n\nEDIT: I wrote this before bed and didn\u2019t expect so many people to see it.

This method worked perfectly for me and I feel like I spent wayyy less time than other A students. I usually tried to go over the textbook (based on what was done in lecture) each week so I don\u2019t have to do it all at once before the exam. And once you have a good understanding, all you gotta do before the exam is to memorize what you already know for an A anyways. Psych exams are not to measure understanding or how well students can memorize terms. It\u2019s both. So you gotta make sure to work on both to get straight As.

They are only different in 1 or 2 ways as far as studying is concerned. \n\n###1. They have a better memory/working memory than you. Yes this sucks but their are many things you can do to compensate. \n\nLearn all of the modern memory techniques and choose what works best for you. Lots of interesting ones out there. Me personally I have an average memory and I prefer my own method of memorizing things. Basically I break studying down into two to three stages depending on whether it is conceptual or not. First stage is familiarization. Just skimming and basically adding all the words and concepts into my brain and not thinking too hard. 2nd includes learning the topic and spaced repetition. Studying in small blocks multiple times a day is far better than all at once. 3rd is active learning and doing for conceptual math or programming type work. \n\nA poor working memory can also make it harder to understand concepts quickly. I find this time to be greatly reduced if I do step 1 in my studying plan. Basic familiarization of a topic can greatly reduce the difficulty of picking up hard concepts. This is especially important for understanding what is happening in lecture. Many times I am just watching the professor with no idea wtf is going on. Basic familiarization with the topic before class and now I am following along and feel like a genius doing it. \n\n###2. You are not good at studying. I've already touched on this alot in the memory section but there is still much to be said about studying.\n\n1. The most important is that studying should not be hard or frustrating. If you find yourself sweating in frustration trying to wrangle a topic then you are studying wrong. WAY wrong. Take a break. Go drink some water and come back when you are not frustrated anymore.\n\n2. You are studying too long. You should never study for more than an hour at a time. Preferably 30 mins.  Your studying effectiveness decreases after 30 mins for most people. Its best to study multiple times a day is small intervals rather than all at once. You can time it but me personally I just rely on how I feel. If I feel like shit I will do 5 minute intervals, if I feel good I will do an hour. \n\nThere are many things that can be said about how to study effectively. More than I am willing to type. I suggest going to youtube and searching \"how to study\" and watching several videos. Also some videos on how to be smarter and metacognition couldn't hurt either. Ignore brightside and \"life hacks\" type videos. \n\nLastly remember that you are not mediocre or a poor student. Limiting beliefs can really hold you back from learning. Feelings of inadequacy and frustration are a self fulfilling prophecy. You are just as capable as the next guy. I am not saying this to blow smoke up your ass but because I personally believe a stupid person (with the right studying techniques and mental wherewithal) can easily get through college and with hard work even make all A's.", "author": "KillingMyselfTonigh1", "created": 1592864673, "upvotes": 2}, "fvokbrb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hdsnil/how_do_i_come_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im/fvokbrb/", "text": "You can usually supplement lack of natural talent with lots of hard work.", "author": "afterschoolsnacks19", "created": 1592863716, "upvotes": 2}, "fvofgdj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hdsnil/how_do_i_come_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im/fvofgdj/", "text": "if you\u2019re calling yourself mediocre, you\u2019re subconsciously (or consciously) comparing yourself to others. don\u2019t do that, focus on yourself and work on wjat you struggle with.\n\njoin groups and communities that help with your degree. i\u2019m only a 10th grader but i struggled with this too, stop worrying about how you are compared to others", "author": "SirDerpington660", "created": 1592861199, "upvotes": 2}, "fvoecs4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hdsnil/how_do_i_come_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im/fvoecs4/", "text": "Well most people are mediocre so I wouldn't be too worried", "author": "Almonsp", "created": 1592860637, "upvotes": 2}, "fvods69": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hdsnil/how_do_i_come_to_terms_with_the_fact_that_im/fvods69/", "text": "Coming off of this... persistence is key. I was not particularly good at school either throughout in certain classes, yet I was passionate about it. I retook my fair share of classes, but I made myself stand out in a different way. I racked up multiple majors (5) and minors (3) in science degrees sprinkled with a variety of others like History and Anthropology. I also overloaded on credits (16-24 usually) while working two or more jobs on campus and now off campus for extended periods of time to build connections. I talked to professors and advisors on a weekly basis and even studied with the stellar A students of my courses. I tutored those in easier courses and my fellow peers. And on top of this, I joined and ran as an officer for no less than 5 different clubs ranging from Microbiology to the Veterans Club to Fencing to Swing Dancing and was a regular member of around 8. I even sometimes encountered the stellar students regularly in some. Beyond this, I always believed that grades weren\u2019t everything and the true test of school was coming out with improving yourself, your capacity of learning, always asking why, saying I don\u2019t know, and not giving up.\n\nBut most importantly, enjoy yourself and the time now. You won\u2019t have that in the future and find clubs/extracurriculars that you really enjoy. I always wanted to learn Fencing in high school so I did that. I came from a military brat background and I liked to help veterans and hang out with them. I never thought I\u2019d learn to dance but I did. I loved Microbiology and Anthropology so I joined those clubs and took classes for fun yet still had social time outside all of these. Find something you enjoy and everything will find its place. In doing so, you will truly find what you want to do in life.\n\nIn the beginning, no matter the effort I put into classes, I still ended up with mediocre grades. Despite this, I looked deeply at how I could efficiently manage my time into improving myself as a person and everyone else around me. By making myself happier and busier, I improved my management skills and improved my grades exponentially. Ultimately I found out that I wanted to go into Medical Lab & Nursing because I liked the constant change of environment and threw my previous degrees into the trash, however, I took with me the fruits borne of asking questions to understand concepts better as a whole with no regrets of achieving them to begin with.

People who are stressed can score 2 whole letter grades below what they would normally get.

When you have a lot of smart students competing for the same grades, it's only natural for most students to fall in that average. Celebrate the fact that you are doing your best and holding your own!\n\nI was always one of the top students in my *very* small high school.  Little did I know that in University, I would be competing against thousands of bright individuals who all wanted to succeed. I came into uni *thinking* I was hot stuff, but when I got my grades back, I realized that I was less than average.  During my  first semester I really struggled with feeling inferior and that I didn't belong.  \n\nWhat helped me was seeing the bell curve for my intro Chemistry course.  There was over 300 students in the class.  The professor put up the grading curve of the class up on the projector, and I realized that MOST students were C+ students.  And then I realized that nearly all of the students in this class were probably A and B students in high school.  When you get hundreds of intelligent and hard working people competing for the same grades, not everyone can be the best.  So only the very elites will be able to achieve the coveted A and B grades.  It is perfectly normal to be average.  The reason it's called the 'average' is because that's what MOST people can achieve.  \n\nMy advice for you:  Celebrate the fact that you are average! It means that you work hard and can hold your own.  University is not an easy undertaking, and that's why not everyone goes through with it.  Make friends with people who are smarter than you, and learn from them, don't envy them.  It took me WAY too long to learn this.  Good luck, and keep plugging away.

Is instead of comparing ourselves to all the successful people around us, we compare oursves to the less successful.

I did really well in high school, graduated with honours. Then I went to a small school to complete my first two years of undergrad to save money and transferred my junior year to finish it off at a more reputable school. My first two years of undergrad I made the deans list so naturally I thought transferring would be a breeze. That definitely did not happen. I pulled straight C\u2019s my first semester at the new school, and it kept going downhill from there. I managed to keep ink a 2.4 gpa at that school, getting A\u2019s in courses I loved and barely managing with C\u2019s in classes that I hated. I would study for a week before the exams and think I did great, then ended up with scores that looked like something from someone who had a night in Vegas and tested hungover. This ruined my self confidence and self esteem, and it spilled over into me overcompensating in other areas of my life, thinking people wouldn\u2019t like me for me because I was \u201cstupid.\u201d Then my very last semester before graduation, I failed o Chem 2. I was absolutely devastated and had to take it in summer in order to pass. I thought I was destined for a life of failure and jobs at McDonald\u2019s. You know what happened?
