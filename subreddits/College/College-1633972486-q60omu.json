  "text": "I'm in shock and I don't know who to speak to so I wanted to post on here. I'm a grad student, as is my roommate. He already has one graduate degree, and today I got called into our head of department's office and told that he had a Title IX investigation against him in his previous grad school. It's definitely not for assault, and the case apparently didn't have enough to take it forward, so it could be anything from an offhand comment to something a lot worse. I'm just completely in shock because he's the nicest guy and he's engaged and his partner is lovely and I've met her, and I feel like if it was anything bad then she'd have broken up with him, because this happened whilst they've been together. I don't know how to act around him any more. I don't feel unsafe but I just feel utterly lost. What should I do? If the case didn't have enough to take it forward, then it's probably not bad, right? He's been employed as a teacher twice since so I don't think it can be bad? I'm just so anxious now and worried about living with him for the rest of the year.",

      "text": "Okay the way I see it there are 2 options that I could think of \n1. Talk to him, if you are someone who needs context ask him. Be upfront but don\u2019t seem as if your perception of him changed. This way u are not constantly thinking about what exactly he did, which can lead to u thinking even more negatively without proper reason(full context).\n\n2. You could let it go and don\u2019t be like the other guys in the comments accusing people without proper justification, now I am not saying this completely frees the accusation of the person. Whatever happened, happened. However, there may be more reasons as to why people could get a title IX. As said it was not for assault so we can deduce he didn\u2019t go around punching people, you say he is a very nice person and seems to have a great gf. So far he seems to shows signs of an okay person, ofc it\u2019s hard to justify things of such a manner, but this can relieve some of the negative thought, also u know him more than we do so u may be able to justify if he can actually do any of the harsh things may be thinking. A lot of accusation could be turned by people, I am not going to state any examples. I often here stories on this subreddits and others as well of how they received an awful title by minimal action such as when a person was given an act of dishonesty charge after writing her essay in apa instead of mla format. The teacher put the students essays together after seeing this change and took it to the deans office. There are a plethora of other situations. \n\nAt this point this is all I could say, hopefully some of this relieves you of some stress and pain. Again for the second part I am not saying if an action was done it wouldn\u2019t be wrong ,however, if u believe the person did not do such a bad act because of his personality there would be no issue atm as u were not given the full context of his situation.",

Many Title IX cases lack enough evidence to meet even the scant preponderance of evidence standard. The fact that the case did not go forward does not *prove* innocence, rather it means they were not able to show a >50% chance of guilt. The accused party in a Title IX case does not have to prove innocence the same way you don't have to prove innocence if someone said you blew up their car.\n3. Anyone can file a Title IX complaint and the reasons vary dramatically. It isn't the same as getting a ticket or indictment either: there is no requirement for evidence or compelling testimony when making a Title IX complaint. It is making an unfair assumption to assume the worst because a lot of these cases are somewhat benign (i.e. he made a sexual remark).",
