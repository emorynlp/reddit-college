We're still happily together over two years later so it seems to have worked out pretty well! \n\nI think I got really lucky tbh, I'm pretty introverted and not into dating apps, and we are in very different fields so I don't think we would have crossed paths any other way. \n\nI wasn't going into college expecting to find a partner or looking for one, but being honest about your feelings and straightforward about your intentions should really help your chances. If you dawdle and don't make a move, you are killing your own chances.",

I still remember the first time I saw him in person and he was a lot cuter than his already cute profile picture. We instantly hit it off and at first I thought we were just going to be really good friends. \n\nWe had a lot in common, same major, lab partners in chemistry, we liked watching movies and working on homework together, basically always hanging out both individually and with mutual friends. Everyone was always asking when we were going to start dating but like I said I just thought we were going to be just friends bc we were both serious about school with no time for dating. Idk how I thought we could only be friends especially when we ended up falling asleep in the same bed together after a long movie marathon (all PG sleeping at this point because friends right). \n\nCue two weeks into the semester and he ends up making the first move and asking if he could kiss me. And I realized I wanted him to. Our first date was the kind of date you see in movies, just loads of fun exploring our college town together. And the rest is history. We had lots of ups and downs like any relationship but, four years later, he asked me to marry him and I can\u2019t imagine life without him. He\u2019s honestly the best, only gets cuter each year we\u2019re together. Love is out there, and it really does get you when you least expect it to",

Then we started texting each other, goofing off during class off camera, and ended up picking the same class as lab partners, etc so on. Soon the only reason why each of us went to class was because we always made each other smile. I think the thing was that both of us were non traditional students, much older, into fitness, the same hobbies, didn't live too far away, and had very similar goals.",

We ended up just hanging out daily.\n\nSix months after we had first met at the party we were dating. Four years and eight months after meeting at the party, we are engaged.\n\nUs being friends for a while before getting together made the whole experience magical. There wasn't weird pressure or expectations. We could just get to know each other with less stress and when we did get together it felt really right.",

      "text": "We were freshmen who lived in the same dorm but different floors. There was a big groupchat with everyone who lived in the dorm. A week or so into the semester, he asked if anyone wanted to get sushi and I agreed but later didn\u2019t feel like going out very much. He messaged me when they were heading out and I made up some excuse about homework but promised next time I\u2019d go out with them. Next time rolls around and he asks if anyone\u2019s interested in trap shooting (shooting shotguns at flying clay targets). I\u2019d never heard of it before, but a promise is a promise. We ended up being the only two going and he drove us both. We ended up having tons in common, both liked playing MTG, similar music tastes. We instantly hit it off and had great chemistry. It was pretty unusual for me because I tend to be nervous meeting new people.\n\nTurns out, we were both in our high school relationships still so we ended up becoming friends. He, my roommate, and I ended up going on crazy adventures and hanging out pretty much every day that year. He introduced us to one of his friends from high school and that was our friend group during COVID when everything was closed down and online. A few months later, our relationships had both individually ended for unrelated reasons. We ended up together after a wait that was much worth it and are going strong on a year now. We\u2019re looking for apartments near campus and moving in together next year!",

      "text": "I met my boyfriend at my university's LGBTQ club. It was my first time going to anything like this, so I only did an introduction and sat there quietly for an hour and a half. At the first meeting, I noticed a shy looking boy I thought was looking at me from time to time. After the second meeting, I was really nervous, but I walked right up to him and started talking. He had really nice eyes, so it wasn't hard making eye contact. We talked for a few minutes and I left.\n\nSome time in the next week, he asked if anyone in the club discord wanted to grab food with him, and I took his offer up. We got food at campus dining and got to know each other more. We're both shy and reserved people, so it took a while. Afterwards we walked to terrace-grass area, sat down, and just talked about more stuff. \n\nNext day, he messaged me to hang out again, and we did the same routine for a couple days in a row and eventually I asked to hold his hand. He was shaking nonstop because he was nervous and I found it really cute. Over time, I found out we have a really similar sort of weird humor, we liked a lot of the same stuff, and we just match pretty well. It's only been two months, but we know how to talk things out, so I think this relationship is going to last (fingers crossed). \n\nI guess the lesson I learned is that you have to put yourself out there first. It doesn't matter how small you reach out, but letting people know you exist is a huge first step. From there, it's just your gut feeling and a lot of courage.",

Due to the whole i-have-to-move-back-to-my-country situation we just both agreed to not make it official, until it eventually happened. I guess that when you really like someone you just want to make the most out of that time, even if feels like it has an expiration date. Luckily im almost finished with my bachelors so I can just move back here once im done with that, as the salaries are better anyways. We are making it work and hopefully 4 months of LDR will go by fast :)\nI\u2019ve never had a relationship during my university years before, but something is just refreshing and motivating if you can share each other\u2019s achievements and frustrations, which the academic world most definitely brings. I found joy in the little things like tutoring him for courses i had taken before or having lunch on campus together. On one hand i feel like i missed all of this but on the other hand i guess i was just waiting to do it with him.",
