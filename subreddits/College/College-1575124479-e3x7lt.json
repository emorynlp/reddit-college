This means I wake up at 9am with no progress at all, and finish by 3pm with a completed paper. In the process, I build an outline by stringing 3 quotes in 400-500 word chunks, and use that to rapidly finish a paper.\n\nFirst, you want to come up with a good number of sources. Note when an essay required peer reviewed, scholarly sources. For that, a lot of people go to the pain of looking at physical books, and I say fuck that. Instead, open up your university's library webpage and see if they have a search engine for that library. If so, you might be lucky and have access to a database of scholarly peer reviewed sources, usually in research articles posted to research journals. Do a bit of skimming and collect ones that work with your argument and have quotable material.\n\n\nSecondly, read your sources, obviously, and remember to grab quotes that support that thesis and put those into a word document. This will come in handy later. If you don't have a thesis, just grab interesting quotes that you could build into a thesis. For my Saudi Arabia history class, I had to come up with a way of critiquing King Faisal's attempts at reforming the state government, and noticed that they poured millions of dollars in supporting an agriculture industry while I was doing research. Stuff like that.\n\nFinally, the research usually takes me 2-3 hours, and this includes building what I like to call an essay skeleton. As you collect quotes, start organizing them by common argument. Multiple quotes about agriculture sucking might be sorted into a \"agriculture sucked, therefore [Argument]\" kind of deal. That's the good shit that forms the bulk of what your thesis is arguing towards. For a 4k paper, I ended up with 1 main argument, and 4 sub arguments at 1k words each, usually well quoted.\n\nFinally, the dastardly writing phase has begun. I find a good 3 quotes is sufficient for a decent 400-500 word chunk. My formula is always; [Present Argument] \n\n[Either use a quoted paraphrase or a blended direct quote to further an argument] \n\n[Explain why the quote furthers your argument] \n\n[Set up sentence for next argument]\n\nThis setup allows you to blitz an essay in 500 word chunks and provides for richly detailed word chunks with research supporting a majority of your essay. If they're sourced from peer reviewed databanks, even better. I always have quotes left over as I finish and that's a good sign.", "author": "Dathlos", "created": 1575142871, "upvotes": 21}, "f968wq8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e3x7lt/a_small_adivce_i_thought_id_share_helped_me_a_lot/f968wq8/", "text": "Change punctuation size to a higher font.
