      "text": "College professor lurking here. I will try to answer some of your specific questions.\n\n* Do not just write down everything said in class. This is not an effective way of taking notes. But you also shouldn't just listen and write nothing in the hope that you will find the relevant material written somewhere after class. \n   * Here is a video I made about how to take notes in class: https://youtu.be/ATmJb3bH2E0 \n* You should do the relevant reading before class. If you don't have time to do the reading before class, do as much of it as possible. This will help you understand the content in lecture. It sounds like you are unsure of what exactly to read. On the syllabus it should say exactly what you are supposed to read for each class meeting. If you are unsure, ask the professor\n   * Here is a video I made about how much of the reading to do: [https://youtu.be/BykXwKFlUDg](https://youtu.be/BykXwKFlUDg)\n   * And one about how to read in such a way that you remember what you read: https://youtu.be/uiNB-6SuqVA\n* Yes, you do need to ask the professor for guidance if there is something you don't understand. If you are not meant to have guidance on that yet (for example, the format of the midterm will be announced one week before the midterm), then the professor will simply say 'You don't need to worry about that yet. I will announce that to everyone soon.'\n* No, you are not the only one who doesn't know what's going on. I get many questions from adrift students during the first semester every year. I have noticed that this year, since many first-year students missed out on a year-and-a-half of in-person high school they are less prepared for college in several ways. But even under normal circumstances, high school is relatively easy and \\*many\\* students get through it without having to develop the study skills that will be needed in college. \n   * I also made a video about this specific point: [https://youtu.be/yem9iQVIPbM](https://youtu.be/yem9iQVIPbM)\n\nI have a whole series of videos about how to succeed in college courses, you can watch it here, if that is helpful: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7YPshZMeLIa2KksLNqmWx\\_SANbSjaUbU",

      "text": "I'm a returning student and I dropped out around my early 20's and I'm back in my early 30's. \n\nOne of the biggest differences now is that I cover all the material they give to me. If they've noted you should read it, read every single word. I notice my peers don't always do this. I've heard them talking about skipping the reading to complete the assignment. \n\nMy suggestion is always aim to understand these things, not just try and complete the assignments. If you're looking to just get your assignments done, you'll miss out on information that will crop up elsewhere. \n\nThe first part of class before the first exam is always a little confusing to me. You never know how the exam will be. I have a hunch that ratemyprofessor ratings are more to do with the class difficulty than the professor themselves. If you're in a class with a low rating, consider that the exam is going to be difficult. Usually those exams are more memorization than anything in my experience. Flashcards can be helpful for the memorization based courses.\n\nOtherwise, a good solid way to set yourself up for success is read all the material they supply, go to every single class and complete all the homework.",

      "text": "Advice in a moment, but first: take a deep breath and realise that the majority of first-year students who sound really confident either aren't, or their confidence is misplaced. \n\nApparently I came across really confident in my undergrad\u2014 which I only found out a good year after I'd finished. From my perspective I was an insecure mess. \n\nA lot of my students who are really confident make mistakes, misinterpret things, submit work that isn't on par with their verbal skills. \n\nThis isn't to bash those students!! Some of them are really great. But I want to stress that confidence in class (whether actual or perceived) isn't always what it seems. \n\nNow for advice, first, talk to your lecturer or tutor (depending on the class size). Tell them all this! They'll be able to help, and particularly with their specific field which will be super helpful. \n\nWhen other students mention names or concepts you haven't heard, jot them down and look them up after, especially if it seems to be common knowledge. Don't take other students' interpretations or explanations of these as gospel (unless the lecturer/tutor endorses it), because as mentioned students often get things wrong. Look it up yourself, and go to office hours if you need help!\n\nIn terms of what to read, that very much depends on your field of study, and the structure of your units. In my field (philosophy) I recommend students prioritise set readings, then move to reading about things that came up in class that they didn't get/hadn't heard of. Or to go to office hours/set up an appointment!!\n\nAnything more specific than that really depends on what you're studying. But don't freak out: you're definitely not the only one who doesn't know what's going on, and the fact you're aware of the gaps in your knowledge will only make them easier to fill :)",

          "text": "Just to add one more thing: I don't know your background, but it's worth noting that these issues often have a TON to do with class and privilege. Many of the students you're talking about have gone to particular schools, have grown up in particular social circles that have given them familiarity with certain concepts and names, which you're only just hearing for the first time. \n\nThis doesn't mean less privileged students are any less capable, and it doesn't mean they can't catch up. As mentioned in my previous comment, many of your peers will have a superficial and somewhat inaccurate knowledge of these things, which comes across confidently due to how they've been raised. Do your work and try to get a solid understanding of what's going on, and you'll do well.",
