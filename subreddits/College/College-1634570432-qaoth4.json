  "text": "I am currently majoring in both Accounting and Finance. The problem is my management classes. For one semester I had completed assignments to the best of my ability following the rubric and formatting my assignments by the standards of APA, every time my assignments would tank...\n\nNext semester rolls along and I get enrolled into the same level of management. This time, knowing that I failed once. I had saved all the assignments... turns out... all the management classes hand out the same damn assignments....\n\nI turned in each assignment by a weekly basis as to not raise any suspicion. Long story short.... my  damn grade sky rocketed... THE FUCK?!?!\n\nThis tells me my previous management instructor was a asshole. Expecting WAY too damn much for being management.... This is stupid as fuck... I wasted an entire damn semester.... Waste of fucken money.... Can I get a refund?",
