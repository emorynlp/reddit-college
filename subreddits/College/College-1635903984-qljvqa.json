  "text": "Hi. I was wondering if someone could please help me out with citations. So I\u2019m writing an assignment and obtaining information about it from research papers. I am citing the research papers but I noticed that lots of there ideas come from other papers and they list the little number per AMA citation format. Am I supposed to be citing this as well or am I good just citing the main paper I am referring to. I don\u2019t recall ever going and citing these sources from the main paper before but today I just ended up thinking about whether this should be done. I feel like this would go on and on though. Like if I reference the citation that my main article used would I then have to cite the Information that the information from the main articles reference got and so on?",
