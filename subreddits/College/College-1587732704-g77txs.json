              "text": "Most public universities here are reopening too (besides CSU) because public universities here are backed by the government to a much smaller extent than foreign universities. CSU is staying online because that system consists largely of commuter colleges, so they won't lose much financially by staying online; people going to CSU aren't really paying big bucks for the college experience. I read this article the other day on how public universities are becoming increasingly privatized, and some state flagships apparently have only 2% of their operating budgets covered by the state. On the other hand, many foreign universities are also in countries that value higher education to a much greater degree than our country does, so those institutions will receive a massive government bailout, which is not going to happen here.",

They are waiting to announce just to be safe, though.\n\n\nHarvard, Princeton, Yale, and Cornell haven\u2019t said anything very solid yet. \n\nAlso, their actions weren\u2019t really coordinated. They all shut down individually as many other private liberal arts colleges (such as Amherst and Williams) were shutting down. I am a student at Amherst, and we announced shutdown before all the Ivies except Princeton; we were the first college to announce shut down in Massachusetts, and the next day, hordes of Massachusetts colleges (including Harvard, MIT, and Northeastern) announced closure.",

Also, it is very possible that this next semester, we will have to temporarily pivot to remote instruction then move back to in-person instruction during temporary restrictions due to an outbreak. At most colleges, professors are being kept in the dark just as much as students, so anything from them is also pure conjecture unless they have direct correspondence from the administrators. When they announced we were moving online in fall, it came as a shock to us because we were one of the first colleges to announce it, and the professors found out at the exact same time as the students.",

                      "text": "I go to Cal. carol Christ, our chancellor, talked on Monday about a hybrid situation. It is what they are planning on. UCSD has rolled out a testing program starting this week for the fall. UCSB has said that they find fully online to be equally ridiculous as fully in person. UC spokesperson has said that UCs are working on a mixed approach. Basically, UC is all but confirmed to be a hybrid. To what extent, nobody knows. But they are all offering people who can\u2019t travel or who are of higher risk to stay home during fall, as they are preparing \u201c50 of the most popular courses\u201d to be online this summer. Sounds like to me, that if only 50 courses are being planned to be fully online, for a UC, especially berkeley, it\u2019s not really feasible for the entire student population to be online only.",

I have friends studying in France and other foreign universities and they seem to be way less opinionated about colleges reopening or not than American students are.  Probably has to do with them paying a lot less money for it. On campus housing and dining isn't a cash cow for many universities abroad, and neither are international students. I think only Australia is somewhat similar in that aspect (and they've done a much better job at containing the virus and have a better chance of reopening than we do).\n\nHowever, because American universities are selling and marketing what they offer, they also have to face consequences of how opening up in a non-safe way can affect their reputation. Also, American sue like crazy and every decision they make has to be made with a possible lawsuit against them in mind. So I think almost all universities will end up offering some kind of online form for students who want to, or have students sign waivers to come back on campus.",

Average state university cost is roughly $9,000, so almost exactly the same.

England is so much smaller and denser than the US - New York state has more landmass than England. A lot of US coronavirus deaths tend to be concentrated in hotspots.

But now I'm either going to have to tread the waters of online courses(didn't do well when taking those back in 2009/10), or just plan on being the 50-year old graduate of something.   \nNot too worried about age. But there definitely is something weird and unsettling about all the faces around you getting younger in the school setting. Like trying to fight that \"do I still even belong here?\" emotion. Of course I was always struggling at academics through all my life as well. Barely graduated high school in 2001 and have been scraping by with college courses since then.",

However, they will not be making any announcements until they are absolutely sure. Even though I don\u2019t attend Dartmouth, this actually makes me feel pretty good because they were one of THE MOST pessimistic colleges in their announcement a few weeks ago. I attend Amherst College, which is pretty similar to Dartmouth.",

Also, Dartmouth has much smaller rooms, and I have it on good authority that they have informally decided to reopen. \n\nMy mom is in the Smith College alumna Facebook group, and one of the member\u2019s children was accepted early decision to Dartmouth and was contemplating taking a gap year if the college allows it, and another Smith alumna who is a PROFESSOR at Dartmouth said they were informally told this week by the college that they would be reopening in fall with the students being given the option of remote learning or residential learning (this relieves them of liability).",

That\u2019s a liability/lawsuit waiting to happen from someones mom. Or what about the students with immune issues? I think thats what is stopping alot of schools from committing to in person fall. My university said they will announce in July for the fall semester which starts in August.",

This is why meningitis B outbreaks are common in colleges - you can\u2019t escape contact and close proximity with large groups of people. One student can have it and then spread it to their entire dorm building as well as anyone they have class with. Commuters can then bring it home to their family and friends. This is how another surge starts. It\u2019s not \u201cinevitable\u201d - it\u2019s a huge liability to the school and a big public health concern.

Some of these plans include gathering size limits, hybrid classroom schedules, and a slightly delayed start to the term, if necessary. However, we will execute those plans only if they are needed to further protect the well-being of our community.\n\nIn addition, RIT has already started to invest in tools and technologies to enhance the health of our community. New initiatives in transforming facilities into \u2018touchless\u2019 environments, new food service models, and systemic health evaluation tools are already being analyzed for use in fall 2020 and beyond.\u201d",

But I'll yield to the experts who have called it increasingly likely over the last week or so - to the extent that we should prepare for it as an inevitability. That includes SCHOOLS.\n\nI'm excited to see what the schools come up with, but my original question was whether or not it was prudent for schools to announce plans for fully reopening now when (modifying my language) it is so incredibly unlikely.",

In Iowa at least, we have been doing less than ~2800 tests a day. The graphs show we are two weeks away from our peak and our governor is already reopening parts of the state next week.

The lifting of some restrictions that I'm talking about would be preceded by the sorts of measures that weren't possible in 1918. I'm talking about tracking of infected persons through a computerized system here, as well as a greater understanding by the general public of health practices. Keep in mind, they didn't even have penicillin in 1918.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as far as testing goes: 2800 tests per day doesn't sound great, but it's important to remember that that number was pretty much 0 a month ago, and the virus has only been around for \\~4 months. The test kits weren't even released until 2 and a half months ago. To go from something that hadn't even been invented to being able to do 2800 tests each day in a state with 3 million people in less than 90 days is quite frankly remarkable. You also can't really blame the states for not testing enough people- there are only so many test kits to go around, and all of them are getting used. As we go through this, our testing capacity will drastically increase as our ability to produce testing kits ramps up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, as a summary: Do I think this will be over in 2 weeks? No. Do I think this will be over in 2 months? Also no, but we'll be a lot better at handling it: most lockdowns only started 1 month ago. In four months, I do believe that our testing capacity will be greatly improved, along with our understanding of the virus. I don't think we'll be back to life as normal in August, but I think our strategy will have developed to the point where we can safely lift some restrictions. I doubt we'll have things like in-person spectator sports and movie theaters which are completely recreational, but I could see a partial re-opening of schools.",

              "text": "At this point, we only have one option. It is absolutely impossible to completely stop the spread of this virus. Sure, ideally, we could all stay inside for three weeks with outside contact and the virus would essentially be gone. However this isn\u2019t possible, at all. The reason for social distancing was to give medical staff and researchers time to prepare equipment, study data coming from China and Europe, and to reduce unnecessary deaths from over flooding the hospitals. In most places in the country, we now have enough surge capacity to start letting the virus progress through our population. We absolutely should not take away every restriction, but we need some spread. We need people with antibodies. We need to start working again. We need college kids who are at very low risk of going to the hospital to continue their education. Realistically, if a virus hit a campus hard, most of the student population would be mildly sick, and then immune. Obviously there are at risk people with immune diseases, and we need to have a plan in place to protect these vulnerable students. But to go online just for this small minority would be an overreaction and would cause more damage than good.\n\nWe need to quarantine and contain those at risk until either 1) new treatments come out with significantly reduce the death rate, 2) herd immunity is reached either through natural spread through the virus or 3) a vaccine is available.\n\nAny other option just doesn\u2019t seem viable to me. Let\u2019s pretend we go online. Students are not just going to stay in their house all summer and fall. Some will work, some will take a semester off, some will need to do chores around their community. This significantly increases the college kids exposure to other demographics of the population. I argue that we should keep college aged kids together, so that even if the virus becomes widespread throughout college campuses, college students are only interacting with people of a similar age. Then when we do antibody testing of campuses, we will find a large portion of healthy adults are now immune, and can be active members of the workforce, can shop for their family over break, and can donate plasma if that route becomes successful. \n\nIf we do go online this fall, what\u2019s going to be significantly different come next semester? Why wouldn\u2019t we go online all year? Yes there will be more treatment and better data, but if college students are normally not dying from this disease, why keep them waiting? \n\nWe can\u2019t just wait for a vaccine. We need to start making personal evaluations about our health. Not just our physical health, but our mental and financial health as well. We need to be able to make the personal choice about if we are comfortable getting the virus.",

That\u2019s not really the college experience I want, and if I have to wait a year to get the full four years of college, I\u2019d honestly be willing to.\nIn addition, online classes are just the WORST. It\u2019s still a stressful amount of work but you don\u2019t learn as well, and if tuition rates don\u2019t go down I\u2019d be paying a lot of money for virtually a University or Phoenix education lol.\nSo yeah, I\u2019d end up deferring due to the inefficient process of online courses, but mainly because I don\u2019t want to spend a year or a semester of college at home, doing all my work online and shut in my house.",

So, their decision to return will be based on whether or not our local medical system can handle the projected number of cases that will emerge in the school after students return. On top of that, we'll be required to wear masks, and larger classes will be held online with smaller classes being in-person. But, they're delaying our housing draw (99% of students live on campus) until late in the summer. \n\nThey're *planning* on having us return to fall but are preparing for a fully online semester if need be.\n\nI think this thread is a bit too early though tbh. Colleges will start rolling out decisions in June I think.",

      "text": "At this point, we only have one option. It is absolutely impossible to completely stop the spread of this virus. Sure, ideally, we could all stay inside for three weeks with outside contact and the virus would essentially be gone. However this isn\u2019t possible, at all. The reason for social distancing was to give medical staff and researchers time to prepare equipment, study data coming from China and Europe, and to reduce unnecessary deaths from over flooding the hospitals. In most places in the country, we now have enough surge capacity to start letting the virus progress through our population. We absolutely should not take away every restriction, but we need some spread. We need people with antibodies. We need to start working again. We need college kids who are at very low risk of going to the hospital to continue their education. Realistically, if a virus hit a campus hard, most of the student population would be mildly sick, and then immune. Obviously there are at risk people with immune diseases, and we need to have a plan in place to protect these vulnerable students. But to go online just for this small minority would be an overreaction and would cause more damage than good.\n\nWe need to quarantine and contain those at risk until either 1) new treatments come out with significantly reduce the death rate, 2) herd immunity is reached either through natural spread through the virus or 3) a vaccine is available.\n\nAny other option just doesn\u2019t seem viable to me. Let\u2019s pretend we go online. Students are not just going to stay in their house all summer and fall. Some will work, some will take a semester off, some will need to do chores around their community. This significantly increases the college kids exposure to other demographics of the population. I argue that we should keep college aged kids together, so that even if the virus becomes widespread throughout college campuses, college students are only interacting with people of a similar age. Then when we do antibody testing of campuses, we will find a large portion of healthy adults are now immune, and can be active members of the workforce, can shop for their family over break, and can donate plasma if that route becomes successful.\n\nIf we do go online this fall, what\u2019s going to be significantly different come next semester? Why wouldn\u2019t we go online all year? Yes there will be more treatment and better data, but if college students are normally not dying from this disease, why keep them waiting?\n\nWe can\u2019t just wait for a vaccine. We need to start making personal evaluations about our health. Not just our physical health, but our mental and financial health as well. We need to be able to make the personal choice about if we are comfortable getting the virus.",

There is the faculty to think about. Plus housing situations will provide some of the biggest obstacles. If most of the student population is on campus, then you could lock the campus down and contain the spread. Although, without proper distancing within housing all you will do is circulate the virus between students. If most of your campus commutes then you risk creating a breeding ground for the virus where students will begin infecting other people.\n\nI understand that most students don't want the Fall semester to be online, but that seems like the safest option for now. Emotions seem to be running high around this issue but it's not good to make rash decisions. \n\nMy hope is that colleges will make an official decision soon enough that it will serve to benefit students. It's not fair to wait till the last minute to announce online courses when students will have arranged housing and work by then.",

              "text": "First, thank you for writing a though provoking response.\n\nMy main goal is to save lives in the long term. However saving lives does not necessarily equate to reducing the total amount of deaths from covid-19 within a timespan. The primary goal of the quarantine and stay at home order was to build up hospital surge capacity. Until a vaccine is here, our goal should be to make sure there are no unnecessary deaths coming from a hospital that was ill equipped to handle the vast amount of patients. \n\nWe have built up a substantial amount of surge capacity in most (but certainly not all) the areas of the US. I argue that once surge capacity is sufficiently reached, a stay at home order is just increasing long term deaths from a variety of factors:\n\nEconomic- historically, as unemployment goes up, death rates, poverty, drug abuse, and suicide follow. [source ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448606/#!po=0.943396) Now I am no means associating myself with those who have been protesting to open up the economy. Some services need to stay closed. Some employees are extremely far from essential. However, by encouraging healthy workers to return to work, we can start to get a responsible spread of the virus in the Goldilocks zone. Not too fast to where the hospitals are overrun, not too slow to where the economy is shut down and people are dying from poverty, but just fast enough so that antibodies can be produced and work can be done.\n\nMedicine- Older people need to go to the hospital . Right now physicians have been doing telehealth visits with most of their patients in an attempt to keep them out of the hospital. This cannot continue forever. Some people can\u2019t figure out how to even use the software. Some procedures have to be done in person. How many people will die from not taking their medicine correctly or from not getting properly evaluated during their check ups?\n\nPicture this:\n\n 100 people dying in a day, followed by 100 thousand immune people is the same as 1 person dying each day and 1000 becoming immune per day for 100 days. IF (and this is a strong if) the hospital can handle the amount of cases that would be needed for 100 deaths, then I argue that we should let this happen. It seems like a much more devastating effect (100 deaths is a way scarier number than 1) but in reality it is just getting the same result quicker. \n\nThe reality is, this virus is going to cause deaths. We just need to decide if we are willing to wait inside until a vaccine is produced or if we need to take our chance with the extremely low death rate for healthy adults. Some people certainly might have pre-existing health conditions, or might be of old age, and they will need all the support they can get to stay inside and stay healthy. But if we have adults who have antibodies, they can go shopping for these at risk individuals. They can go inside and entertain their grandparents to dinner. They can donate plasma to save lives. \n\nWe have strayed from the original purpose of the lockdown. We switched from \u201cgive us some time to prepare our hospitals and to get data\u201d to \u201cstay inside until a vaccine is produced.\u201d. It\u2019s not feasible. We have become fixated on slowing the deaths by corona, and not deaths overall. \n\nOne of the easiest ways to get healthy adults immune is to put them all in the same building (dorms), and make them interact almost exclusively with each other (college campuses). Obviously there are older faculty who are at risk. There are non-traditional students who are at risk. Why don\u2019t we let the faculty who are not comfortable teaching large lectures teach these at risk students in small, socially distanced rooms, or teach the online versions for classes for those who choose to take them?\n\nThen there is the added benefit of college students with antibodies. I personally could go shopping for my grandparents, keeping them out of risk as well as reducing the spread. I could donante plasma. I could volunteer for research. I can simply study and get my degree so as to become a productive member of society. Sure we could go online this semester, but what changes come January? We might have better treatment by then (I hope we do) but we certainly will not have a vaccine. Do we do online school for the winter semester as well, potentially costing students a full year of productive study when they are one of the least at-risk populations?\n\nEdit: mild grammar",

                  "text": "I believe you are missing one of the points in my response. How are we going to mitigate the spread from areas outside the campus once the virus begins to infect students? For example, if you were to have the virus asymptomaticly and interact with your grandparents then we have unnecessary deaths that could have been avoided. The only way this scenario works is in situations where all students live in the dorms and a lockdown is put in place to prevent spread outside the campus. For commuter campuses there will be spread to friends and family members.  There is also the fact that Covid-19 can stay on certain surfaces for days at a time, so we would have to be extremely careful with any contact with at-risk loved ones and friends. [Source](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/coronavirus-resource-center)\n\nWe also don't know how immunity works with this virus. Some people don't develop antibodies, which means those people may end up perpetually sick in this environment. Not only that, but we are still not sure how long the antibodies stay in our system and grant immunity. [Source](https://health.usnews.com/conditions/articles/if-i-get-coronavirus-can-i-get-it-again) There is no guarantee that this virus is a one and done situation. Most people are cautious because there is still a lot more we need to know about the virus.\n\nPutting aside the matter of life and death, we should also ask ourselves if these institutions have our best interests at heart. If we get sick with the coronavirus will we be given leniency with school work and attendance? What if we are sick with it more than once? If a professor catches the illness, how will classes be handled from there?\n\nI also think it's interesting how you phrase online school as costing students a full-year of productive study. Most of the people on this thread only have experience with the current online environment. Online schooling is typically much more polished then this semester has been. You can absolutely learn and be productive in an online environment, but you have to want to and push yourself to. Some people are easily distracted, which gives them another obstacle but you have to persevere with online courses. I understand that lab courses probably can't be done online, but a significant amount of your other courses can.",

For your grandparents example, the grandparents wouldn\u2019t be interacting with the asymptomatic student in the first place because they would be in social isolation (but not the student). I think Imward10 put it well: lockdown isn\u2019t intended to stop the spread until a vaccine comes, but instead give medical professionals time to get their feet under them during the pandemic\u2019s early stages\nAlso speaking to online classes, you\u2019re right that online school is doable for some classes, but it is far from preferred. A college education is more than just absorbing academic content. It\u2019s a complex social network of collaborations, relationships, and ideas that can\u2019t be replicated on a computer screen. Most people aren\u2019t going to college just to take in information, spit it out again, and get a degree. Online learning has its obvious benefits (you\u2019re still learning, after all), but the only way for it to be plausible in college next year is if tuition is greatly decreased.",

At this point many hospitals still don't have the supplies they need.\n\nMore than anything I'm concerned about college's having students best interests at heart when considering Fall 2020. There are many issues with going back in person. Will the nearby hospitals be able to handle large amounts of the student population getting sick? As I mentioned above, how will students be treated when they catch the virus and are unable to do school work or attend classes? Most universities wouldn't allow a student to take two weeks off at a time. What about spread to faculty? How will courses continue if a professor gets sick? For those who are immunocompromised and cannot risk coming back to school, how will they be treated? Will they be offered a leave of absence or the opportunity to continue with distance learning? \n\nI understand that people want the in person experience, I do too! I don't think that experience is worth disenfranchising students. It's up to each individual college, but I will be posing questions to my administration as should everyone else.",

Once a successful match is found, the body will remember this match and will be able to destroy the Covid-19 virus for a specific amount of time. That is how you recover from a virus.\n\nFor a certain time period the body will be able to recognize foreign Covid-19 virus entering the body and will quickly be able to destroy it, granting immunity. You are correct that we don\u2019t know how long this immunity will last. But with all the evidence we have of other Coronaviruses like Covid-19, we can assume it will be for a substantial amount of time (at least a year). \n\nPlus after the initial infection and recovery, unless multiple factors change about the person such as health, weight, or viral load, we can assume that whoever recovers the first time will recover again. Furthermore, subsequent infection is likely to be way less severe.\n\nTo say that infection will not lead to immunity is false. Those articles are simply stating that infection will not lead to lifetime immunity, which is correct. \n\nYour second point I would like to address. Young people will die from this virus yes. But from all the studies we have taken so far, the death rate for this demographic is very very low. The IFR (infection fatality rate) is between 0.1-0.01% (I will try to find my sources and comment them below) for teenagers and those in there 20\u2019s, especially when you eliminate \u201cat risk\u201d from this demographic. Think about the amount of students who die from alcohol poisoning, suicide, and other factors. I know it\u2019s very morbid, but there is no situation where no one dies with this virus. Subjecting millions of healthy young adults to this virus, allowing them to donate plasma, develop antibodies, and to continue their education to become doctors, nurses, businessmen, engineers, lawyers, ect, will save far more lives than it costs. For anyone who feels at risk or uncomfortable should have the universitiy\u2019s full support in either taking a year off or doing a hybrid or online only year.",
