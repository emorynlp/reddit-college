  "text": "Ok so I am a senior in high school. My grades and test scores are very good so it won\u2019t be a problem to get into SMU but the only thing I\u2019m worried about is the people there. \n\nI\u2019m from florida and recently my dad and I did a college trip to Texas to visit a few schools. I had no intention to even apply to SMU but when my dad forced me to visit it and I fell in love. After I went home from the trip I did some research and love the school even more. From the beautiful campus to their great business school , they sold it to me. During the research I also came across a very common stereotype of the school for it being a \u201cparty school\u201d and people being stuck up rich kids. My parents have money but I have no intention in surrounding myself with a bunch of dicks. \n\nIf anyone could give me any insight or personal experience that would be great.",

      "text": "I went to SMU for undergrads (finance) and I\u2019ve surrounded myself with people from all walks of life. One classmate is a first generation college student on a full scholarship while another is the daughter of one of the more prominent hedge fund manager in Chicago. \n\nYes the party school reputation holds because it\u2019s a greek life dominant school. A lot of my classmates and I weren\u2019t in greek life and we still had a great time. Dallas is a wonderful city with a lot of things to do!\n\nIt\u2019s really what you want to do, and my suggestion is to make as many friends in college as possible. It goes a long way. SMU has some snobby kids here and there but they also have some of the nicest people I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting. There\u2019s a lot of Florida people attending SMU too. I\u2019m sure you will fit in fine. Hope this helps!",
