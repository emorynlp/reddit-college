  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m a undergraduate chemistry student assisting a PhD student with her research this semester. The work I\u2019ve been doing has impressed the professor supervising and he suggested I apply for an undergraduate fellowship. The problem is that I\u2019m struggling coming up with ideas. Anyone has any tips on how to brainstorm ideas for research?",
