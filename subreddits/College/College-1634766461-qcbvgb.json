  "text": "Obviously, no computer science course at a top CS school is going to be easy. But between top CS schools, I've heard their academic cultures can vary a lot, from hypercompetitive cultures like at UC Berkeley, to much more lax (but still difficult) ones at Brown, for example. \n\nSo, what are some top CS colleges that have relatively \"easy\" academic cultures? A good balance of lower stress yet still being prestigious?",

      "text": "I think this is going to be really difficult to quantify and agree upon.  \n\nI mean, we could make a blanket generalization that UC Berkeley and Stanford will almost certainly embrace that California vibe on campus.  \n\nThe weather is great almost every day. Can practically see the ocean from campus.  \nThose vibes may likely permeate throughout student housing and Fraternities/Sororities/Club-activities.  \n\nBut those are still world-class, top-most-tier CS programs.  \n\nThe coursework and lecture materials are going to be stiff bordering upon savage, even among the GenEd courses.  \n\nSo, at some level, you're kinda asking which jagged shard of broken glass hurts the least when you pick it up.  \n\n-----  \n\nWhat would help more, I think would be to define what your desired outcome is from the education.  \n\nAre you FAANG or die?  \n\nAre you $150k or I've failed?  \n\nAre you \"Meaningful startup opportunity that empowers me to help make the world a better place, and earning a few bucks along the way would be nice...\" ?  \n\nAre you \"I don't care, so long as I never have to be afraid of not being able to eat, ever again.\" ?  \n\nHow do you personally define what a successful education looks like after graduation?",
