  "text": "Good morning redditors,\n\nI am currently a CS Major taking around 18 credit hour semester worth of courses. I currently only spend a few hours a week (outside of class hours) focusing on school work. My current grades are usually all Bs an A or two and maybe one C+. Id like to perform much better in school, Just currently in my sophomore/freshman year there are so many \"fluff\" classes that I'm taking such as Bio 101 N and L that are taking up majority of my study times and burning me out of actual topics I'm interested in and I turn back to gaming or go to work whenever I'm not focused on these two monsters in one semester. I game probably about 30 hours a week as a relaxation tool from life but I believe Iv hit far too much, and far too little time spent on other classes due to burn out. Any advice for future studying? or for tips to cool down on the game time and to focus?",

      "text": "Since you mentioned wanting to perform better in school, this means that you either have to study more effectively/efficiently which you may already be doing or you have to cut down the gaming time. If you don't already do so, I suggest making a schedule. Even if you don't follow it 100% of the time, it's a lot better than nothing. When making a schedule, make sure to put in times for breaks and also make sure you have a set \"off\" time, as in a time when you stop working on school stuff. Doing this achieves two things: it helps ensure that you have time every day to relax (which helps prevent burnout) and it also makes you more effective in studying/doing homework (because you have a reward waiting for you at the end of the day and you only allocated x amount of time to studying/doing homework). Other than that, if you can, study in a separate spot than the spot you game at so you don't get tempted to play games when you're supposed to be studying. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
