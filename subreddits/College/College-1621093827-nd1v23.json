I didn\u2019t do my work, I skipped class, and I didn\u2019t participate in classes I went to. By the end of sophomore year, I was a mere 0.005 points away from failing out of school. I had a breakdown and realized, I didn\u2019t want to fail, that I wanted to achieve this. So I started seeing a therapist, started taking medication, and started doing my work. It took a lot, but my professors noticed the improvement. I finally made some A\u2019s and B\u2019s, discovered my passion for using Linux (and earning my spot among my classmates as the go to for Linux), and was able to get an internship with a graduate professor in Iceland, who saw the improvements in my transcript. \n\nI may not have been the best student then, but I became a better person. I learned from my mistakes and I grew from them.",

Personally if I\u2019m hiring I care more about your internships and your thought process than a good gpa. At the same time if your gpa is below a 2.8 I\u2019m gonna really wonder if you have the work ethic to be a good employee. \n\nThis is for engineering and my own personal opinion.",

For example, someone with a learning disability. These students often times have better worth ethic than a person with a higher GPA. \n\nThen there are people who don't have to try at all, have 0 work ethic, and have a 4.0+ GPA.  \n\nThere is more behind just a number on a page. I don't think it necessarily translates to being a good employee. Of course it all depends on what their employer is looking for.",

All the students I knew that got high grades worked their butt off to turn in every assignment completed. High school people can cruise for a 4.0 but not getting a college degree in engineering. \n\nI also mentioned that other factors are way more important than a gpa, but I\u2019m sorry if you got less than a 2.8 even with working your butt off then I\u2019m gonna have serious doubts I want to hire that person. Test anxiety and stress doesn\u2019t go away when you graduate. In school there is always a right answer to find. For my job and most of engineering there is no \u201cright\u201d answer. And a lot of guess work and assumptions are made. \n\nGpa is just a number and just one piece of the puzzle. For me experience and personality is a lot more important.",
