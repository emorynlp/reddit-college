I'm in the process of applying to be a DJ for the radio station at school and it's fun so far (I have to list 100+ bands I would play), but I'm also really nervous. My voice makes me self conscious and I'm not great with technology, so I'm worried that I'll make a fool of myself if my application is accepted. Is anyone else involved with campus radio? What made you start, and do you have any tips for overcoming nervousness?", "author": "DesperateBass5353", "created": 1632778199, "retrieved": 1632800073, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hej6qtj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwr3hr/is_anyone_involved_with_campus_radio/hej6qtj/", "text": "I'm not involved in radio, so this might be irrelevant, but hear me out. If you don't at least give it a shot you're going to kick yourself about it forever. Seems like one of those things where you'll look back on it and think \"Damn, I should have gone for that\". I'm sure they'll train you on the tech side of it as well, and iirc you need to have an FCC broadcast license which has a tech piece. I think most people think their own voice sounds weird, I wouldn't sweat that too much! I say go for it, you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain!", "author": "AL1630", "created": 1632786885, "upvotes": 3}}}
