I didn't think anything about life after school until graduation night. I was driving home and thinking about what I should do the next day, and it suddenly dawns on me that this isn't just the weekend or summer vacation; this is the rest of my life now! In that moment it just all collapsed on me: Why didn't I plan ahead better? I should have been trying to get into college all this time. What am I going to do for money? Do I have to join the military now? How do I choose a place to live? ...holy crap, how do you even pay bills!?!?!? It's daunting, it's huge, and it's scary. The only jobs I'd had were your then typical teenage spending money jobs like pizza delivery and a video store. How do you even go about getting a real job!?\n\nI felt wildly unprepared for the real world. And back in 2001, the internet wasn't nearly the prolific beast that it is now, so I couldn't just Google \"how to boil a pot of water\". (Unrelated but awkward story; my first time cooking meat for myself, I cooked using a pot instead of a pan because I really didn't know any better.)\n\nSo what got me to where I am now? I had a lot of learning and feeling out the real world to do. I was a crappy employee for my first couple 'real' jobs because I didn't know a thing about self-discipline. I had to have a supervillain of a boss tear me down so that I knew that you couldn't get away with calling off all the time and screwing around on the job. That probably sounds awful, but I feel privileged for the experience. because it helped shape my work ethic. I had a lot of downs living in bad neighborhoods, having drug-addicted roommates, developing panic disorder, blowing about a decade on a dead-end career path, and wasting a few years on a marriage that meant nothing to me. There were quite a few ups like making a lot of money for someone that was barely educated and wildly inexperienced, getting jobs that were steady and secure. It was a lot of luck, but a lot of my saving grace was my parents. They were young and stupid once as well, so when I goofed up, they were there to catch me because they had experienced their own stupidities that needed help. My dad helped where he could, but my mom especially was this powerful force of a woman that could sense when I was in real trouble and knew the right thing to say.\n\nBut here's the real secret of it: I've got a steady career in local government, I've been back in school for a couple years, I'm married to the person that was the best possible fit for me, I have hobbies that I've had enviable successes with, and I'm generally pretty happy. But twenty years after high school, and I still feel like an impostor. I'm still just winging it in a lot of ways, and I don't feel that I've really hit adulthood yet.\n\nTL;DR: It's scary, and it will always be at least a little scary, but with some help, you'll find your way through the real world and settle in.

A lot of what happens after college depends on many factors as many peeps here know (area of study, established networks, history of internships, etc). Taking a break does provide a step away from school, and what you do with it does matter. Maybe you just don't want to do anything, that's fine, enjoy it. Maybe you seek other personal goals, cool! or take time to reflect on your journey so far, great! all those are great options.
