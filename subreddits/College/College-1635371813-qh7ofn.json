  "title:": "Which is better? Maintaining a 4.0 gpa but getting a W vs having a 3.7-3.8 and no Ws?",
  "text": "I am a comp sci major + minor in psych  at a CC who wants to transfer eventually. I am doing well in all my classes except for Calc and greatly considering a W. I could push through and maybe get a B or so but in the same token I want to maintain a 4.0. Which do you recommend?\n\nIt seems that Ucs don't care that much about Ws if it's not a pattern but I don't want my options to be limited. Do you know if more prestigious schools like small liberal art colleges would dock me for a W when I apply to transfer? Towards the end of high school, I didn't do well so I wanted my CC experience to be an 'epic comeback' and I'm petrified I already let that go..",

      "text": "Depends on how much time you have left at the cc. If you take it again before leaving there isn't a W on the transcript. If you don't take it again it's not that big of a deal. I don't know where you're from but here in Texas you're allowed up to 6 W's on a transcript in your entire undergrad career before you have to start providing a reason for withdrawing. I withdrew from calc 2 after I bombed my first test this semester. I'm taking it again in the spring so while I'll have a W come December, by next May that W will change to a letter grade. If the W stays for you, most transfer applications provide a spot for you to explain any bad grades or similar, so again I wouldn't sweat it having a W.",

      "text": "Every admissions office is different, but most won't care at all about a single W on a transcript, especially if you retook the class the next semester and got an A. I doubt you'd even get asked unless it's like 5+ W's.",

The time and effort you put into maintain a 4.0 are not remotely worth the returns (almost nothing) it will give you in the future. Take the grade hit (as long as you'll still pass the class) and move on.",
