I personally would encourage anyone towards greater knowledge and education, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing something else\u2014in fact, the US is suffering from a shortage of trade workers and other skilled manual workers, and you can make a lot of money in those sectors. It really depends what you want to do.",

      "text": "All high school degrees are essentially the same, but this isn't the case for your bachelor's. Your major matters, as does what you put into your studies. Many people slack off during college and don't learn shit, and then complain when just having a diploma won't get them anywhere. However, if you use your college education as an opportunity to get good at something that employers find valuable, then your degree is going to be worth a whole lot.",

Rather than needing to be 90 percent of what they need, you can be something like 70 percent of what they need. It will be assumed that you can learn the rest over time.",
