  "title:": "Feeling frustrated by my math class.",
  "text": "I did well in high school math and got placed into this college math class which should've been my level... In the past, I've definitely had to work hard to understand some mathematical concepts, but I usually didn't mind. Overall, I enjoyed math and thought about potentially majoring or minoring in it. Now, I am not sure I want to take many more math classes after this (and probably not even minor in it). It's kind of a shame, but the way my class is taught is not great in my opinion. I feel like we barely do any example problems and I just don't have a solid foundation going into the practice problems. We watch videos for homework and that's about it. We move fast through the material.\n\nI find myself googling for the answers or trying to watch videos. I've gone to office hours and extra help sessions (1 of the tutors couldn't help me once). There's no partial credit, and there are more things that are weird about the way we take quizzes but I'll spare those details. I'm not saying I want a teacher to just tell me the answer for every single problem without explanation (I really need to know the WHY), but my teacher doesn't really help (they'll just give hints) but doesn't really walk me through a single problem until they bring us together for the end of class.\n\nA third of my classmates stopped showing up about 3 weeks ago. One time I had to miss (I didn't skip) and my teacher kept saying they'd post the sheet to the class page, but they haven't yet. I also thought one of the quizzes had an incorrect correct answer (which happens time to time) and they said last week that that could have happened and they'd look at it. I still haven't received the quiz yet. A week later.\n\nIs this normally how math is taught in college? Is it less guided than high school? Even over Zoom, my math teacher still did better and we had a textbook and tons of homework problems to practice and spent class going through detailed examples. Maybe it's just hard to transition to math in college as everyone is coming from different math backgrounds..",

      "text": "All college classes are taught differently from high school. You're going to be expected to do a lot more work on your own to understand the material. You shouldn't expect your classes to be like your high school classes, or to spend all of class time going through examples. You *should* make use of the math center which your campus absolutely has.",

Yeah, a study group would be great! The problem is our class doesn't really seem to click well and the three classmates at my table haven't showed up since the beginning of October. I don't know them outside of math at all....",
