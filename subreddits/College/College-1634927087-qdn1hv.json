  "text": "I\u2019m in a group of four for a project due on Monday. Not sure how, but I\u2019ve become the team leader and have had to assign tasks to each of us (otherwise my classmates won\u2019t complete anything). \n\nAt the pace that everyone else is working, I\u2019m scared that the project (an oral presentation!) will not be finished in time. This puts me in a position where I feel I have to choose either saving my grade or maintain relationships with my peers. \n\nI really want a good grade as it\u2019s the first assignment, but I don\u2019t want to burn any bridges this early into my course. Any of you had a similar experience?",
