We cannot prevent every covid death; it is unfortunate, but people will die of covid, just as people will die of other causes. People will die of heart disease, the flu, cancer, car crashes, etc., and so will people die of covid, which is becoming endemic regardless. It is time to hold covid to the same standard as other causes of death and stop making moral outrages about spreading covid being a personal failure of responsibility. We have to stop living in fear of scenarios like \"but what if such-and-such person gets covid\" because there are plenty of factors in life besides covid that we need to pay attention to; prioritizing covid above everything else in life is psychologically unhealthy. \n\nFor the record, I am in favor of the covid vaccine; I am vaccinated and at this point the ground on which arguments against this vaccine stand get shakier as time continues to pass. However, making moral outrages about not getting the vaccine is unproductive, won't convince people to get vaccinated, and in fact makes people with varying degrees of hesitancy dig in their heels more against the vaccine. The vaccine is effective, but we cannot compel people to get it if we want to maintain trust in relevant institutions. No wonder the CDC has lost a lot of trust given how Fauci isn't interested in educating the public in a reasonable fashion; he is so out of touch with the average American that he thinks they are just too stupid to do any better but comply indefinitely. \n\nAll this to say: at some point individual rights and liberties, which are among the fundamental building blocks of Western civilization, cannot be neglected any longer. It is mentally destructive to live in fear indefinitely, I know because I struggled academically and socially last year. Living life normally again (which the vaccine can facilitate) cannot be considered conditional. Given that rights and liberties are not conditional on there not being crises, and that simply existing does not infringe on anyone's rights, it is therefore beyond time to accept that life will go on, and perpetually fearing covid is unproductive in so many ways. This is perhaps a harsh assessment of mine, but some things are inevitable in this world.\n\nTL;DR: Generally speaking, fearing covid indefinitely will get in the way of living life in a productive and healthy fashion, and accepting risks in life, especially with covid becoming endemic, is inevitable.", "author": "Highway_Star_6", "created": 1631233697, "upvotes": 0}, "hc90iwa": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pkufwe/schools_are_not_taking_covid_seriously/hc90iwa/", "text": "It pisses me off.
