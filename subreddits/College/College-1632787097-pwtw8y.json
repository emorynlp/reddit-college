  "title:": "College Roommate Sleeps\u2026A Lot. Is It Concerning?",
  "text": "Hey, my boyfriend\u2019s roommate sleeps a lot. And I know that not everyone is like me, who is an insomniac and finds it difficult to get 6 hours of sleep, let alone the recommended 8. But my boyfriend\u2019s roommate sleeps a lot more than 8 hours a day. I\u2019m talking he sleeps some days from about 12 at night to about 2-4 pm, and then back asleep at 12 that night. And some days he gets up at 11, comes back at 2 and sleeps from ~3-7 pm OR later, and goes to bed at 12 again. \nMy boyfriend is doing his best to remain respectful, but he doesn\u2019t feel like he can do any of his work in his room or watch tv or play games because of his roommate\u2019s constant sleeping. He doesn\u2019t have a Reddit, so I figured I\u2019d ask here and get a third opinion on it and what he can do. / what people think is going on, because it\u2019s baffling to me.",

Asking him if he\u2019s okay opens the door to conversation about mental health hopefully. And then he can ask if it\u2019s cool if he watches tv or plays games until midnight (like reasonable people hours).\n\nI mean, it is a bit concerning but maybe he\u2019s working on it. Best thing your boyfriend can do is talk to him about it. Maybe his roommate needs a friend and needs more structure to avoid sleeping. But you won\u2019t know until you ask",

He\u2019s asked him \u201care you good\u201d before, because I\u2019ve heard him ask while we\u2019ve been on the phone but never like a sit down conversation about if his roommate is *actually okay.* Not that it\u2019s any of his business per-say, but he said that he noticed the roommate takes a lot of medicine so he had a suspicion that it\u2019s something medical and he didn\u2019t want to be \u2018disrespectful and pry\u2019 too much. But he also won\u2019t know if the roommate considers it confidential or not (assuming it is maybe a medical condition) until he asks, and if he finds out it is, then he knows to steer clear from inquiring too much about it. So I\u2019ll let him know to maybe attempt to ask one day when he catches his roommate in the room awake and thinks it\u2019s a good time.",

He needs to tell them both that he's concerned and thinks help might be in order, but also that during normal hours he needs to be able to use the room. If the roommate absolutely must sleep during the day, ear plugs and a face mask can do the trick to block out your boyfriend's movement in the room. It's his space too and he should feel welcome.",

Because all he does is cut off all the lights and lay down in the bed too and watch a video or something on YouTube with earbuds in until he falls asleep. The only time I\u2019ve had him complain a bit to me is when it\u2019s like 3 pm or mid-late afternoon he needs his lab manual or needs to get his lab kit (because he has online labs but has an actual kit) and supplies from the room, but his roommates sleeping. So he feels like he can\u2019t do his labs and stuff in the room and has to go in and out and in and out to gather all the stuff and take it out of the room into the common area just to do his work.",
