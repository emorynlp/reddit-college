Is It Concerning?", "text": "Hey, my boyfriend\u2019s roommate sleeps a lot. And I know that not everyone is like me, who is an insomniac and finds it difficult to get 6 hours of sleep, let alone the recommended 8. But my boyfriend\u2019s roommate sleeps a lot more than 8 hours a day. I\u2019m talking he sleeps some days from about 12 at night to about 2-4 pm, and then back asleep at 12 that night. And some days he gets up at 11, comes back at 2 and sleeps from ~3-7 pm OR later, and goes to bed at 12 again. \nMy boyfriend is doing his best to remain respectful, but he doesn\u2019t feel like he can do any of his work in his room or watch tv or play games because of his roommate\u2019s constant sleeping. He doesn\u2019t have a Reddit, so I figured I\u2019d ask here and get a third opinion on it and what he can do. / what people think is going on, because it\u2019s baffling to me.", "author": "AimlessFucker", "created": 1632787097, "retrieved": 1632800113, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hej98t3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwtw8y/college_roommate_sleepsa_lot_is_it_concerning/hej98t3/", "text": "I would tell your boyfriend to ask the roommate if he\u2019s okay and that he noticed he sleeps a lot. Asking him if he\u2019s okay opens the door to conversation about mental health hopefully. And then he can ask if it\u2019s cool if he watches tv or plays games until midnight (like reasonable people hours).\n\nI mean, it is a bit concerning but maybe he\u2019s working on it. Best thing your boyfriend can do is talk to him about it. Maybe his roommate needs a friend and needs more structure to avoid sleeping.

I think it's time for your bf to have a gentle talk. He needs to tell them both that he's concerned and thinks help might be in order, but also that during normal hours he needs to be able to use the room. If the roommate absolutely must sleep during the day, ear plugs and a face mask can do the trick to block out your boyfriend's movement in the room. It's his space too and he should feel welcome.", "author": "HummingMyThemeSong", "created": 1632788058, "upvotes": 3}, "hej7qzj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwtw8y/college_roommate_sleepsa_lot_is_it_concerning/hej7qzj/", "text": "Honestly the roommate sounds depressed.
