  "text": "\n\nI submitted an assignment for a class a few weeks back and was working on the second one today when I realized I may have really messed up. The assignment involved using a few journal articles which I referenced properly. It also involved taking about some jobs. I used google/indeed and the company websites to find information about them like the role and duties to complete my assignment. \n\nThe thing is I just realized today if I was supposed to cite those or not. I was rushing the first assignment last week and the thought never occurred to me that these may need to be cited. Throughout university so far I\u2019ve really only cited journal articles and government websites, but I guess this was since none of my other assignments required other sources like I used in this assignment?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just overthinking this (I have severe OCD) or I really messed up. I\u2019m just so scared I\u2019ll get academic dishonesty for this and my dream of going to med school will be shattered.\n\nI don\u2019t really know anyone in the class but I asked in a groupchat and they said to cite these just to be safe. I will for this assignment but what about the assignment I already submitted?\n\nShould I email the TA and explain this or is this not something to worry about?\n\nThank you guys, I would really appreciate any advice!",
