Our signature assignment in stats was interpreting 3 data sets about \u201csocial media usage\u201d\n\nIn English, I have written 2 papers that included some sort of social media propaganda. One was a presentation about \u201cteen mental health\u201d, citing social media as a huge factor. The other was about \u201cusing social media in a constructive way\u201d. \n\nWhat the fuck. College students are adults. Can we stop patronizing them about phones?? \n\nI was so disappointed in the statistics signature assignment. We spent all semester doing complex math and interpreting data. I finally learned how to do this all stuff and I thought maybe I could really apply it to a data set of my choosing, or look at some interesting statistics. But no, more Boomer propaganda shoved down my throat. \n\nI get that social media can be a problem for young people, and I understand that young people are struggling with mental health but can we challenge them with some interested material instead of reminding them constantly? \n\nHas anyone else had this experience or is it just my CC?\n\nEDIT: I understand that the topic of social media usage is important, but do we have to make every assignment about it in every class? Social media usage is an exhausted topic in the media, at home, in high school etc. I have teenagers who I know have been listening to adults drone on and on about social media for most of their life.

This is all to point out I feel your pain in many ways. \n\nSomething I\u2019m surprised no one has pointed out that I saw, is that we are on a social media platform right now. You must have seen some toxic behavior on here before. Teaching young people (or anyone for that matter) how to evade that content as much as possible and/or respond with common sense and empathy seems like a worthy goal. Even if this is not explicitly stated, thinking consciously about social media practices will encourage these behaviors. I have hope.\n\nI have also worked extensively with students from underserved communities (including older/re-entry students). A lot of these go to CC, especially before transferring to a 4-year, where they go to learn basic college-ing skills. Many don\u2019t know what a syllabus is or how to read it. Most don\u2019t know how to effectively read academic material or take notes. These are all parts of varying levels of cultural capital that we bring with us. I think those of us who have these skills are lucky and should be aware. \n\nI have always struggled with mental health issues and study mental health in my discipline. I think the more awareness out there that this is an important issue, and access to resources will encourage those who feel alone in their situation, the better. Some people have said \u201cthose who have mental illness or say they do,\u201d knock it off. You don\u2019t know anyone else\u2019s status. \n\nFinally, I have come to feel kinda protective over my students and younger people from my experiences dealing with them. It seems like you do too in a way, but I would suggest trying to get to know more of them better maybe, to see what some individuals feel, and try to avoid assuming for a large portion of your classmates.

And as you might imagine, students suffering from anxiety and depression tend to perform a lot worse.\n\nNow also, unrelated to social media, is the problem that Gen Z has been delayed in developing independence and autonomy. So, they arrive at college with life skills closer to a 16 year old of Gen X -- not their fault, that's just how we're raising them. That makes college far more stressful and also leads to a lot more poor decisions being made.

Maybe that was your main point, but I've found that colleges condescend to students in even more ways than that. Hell, I haven't even started my freshman year, but one of my very first experiences interacting with staff at my community college went very poorly. \n\nMy mom and I went together. I'm 21, she's 46. We're both going back to school. We went in to discuss the FAFSA and to figure out what our next steps should be with the only person in the financial aid department that continued to work in-person during the pandemic. (For context, both of our phones were messed up and we live next to the campus, so in-person worked better for us. In hindsight, we probably should've taken our chances with meeting someone else over a phone call.)\n\nDuring our meeting, my mother asked plenty of important, relevant questions about how we receive financial aid money, how it's distributed if she decides to go part-time versus full-time, etc. She's the only one between the two of us that has been to college, but the whole experience has changed since she was in school in the mid to late 90s, so she didn't want to assume anything about how things work these days. She was well within her right to ask questions, but the financial aid lady seemed to expect us to shut up and listen to her monologue while quickly running us through a PowerPoint on a small computer screen that my mom couldn't even see clearly (let alone keep up with at that pace). \n\nThere came a point about halfway through the meeting where the financial aid lady literally looked my mom dead in the eye right as she started to ask a question, and put her finger to her lips to shush my mother like a kindergartener. \n\nDuring the whole interview, my mom was shushed twice and I had to start writing my notes with a pen on the papers in front of me because every time I would write down relevant notes in my phone's memo app, the financial aid lady would glare at me as if I'm being rude. I guess she didn't believe I was taking notes, despite me explicitly telling her what I was doing and showing her my screen. Even after that, she would pause and huff any time I started to write anything down.\n\nI feel like, at least in my area, college staff are prepared to condescend to *anyone* (with the notable exception of wealthy parents). I don't know if it's because they're used to dealing with young, rowdy high school grads, or if it's because they're not used to any level of pushback - either way, it's kind of ridiculous.\n\nSince then we have dealt with a similar attitude from the Assistant Dean at that same campus, and have also been treated poorly for calling the school to ask about things that they don't ever bother clarifying. \n\nI'm not even sure how to handle it, honestly. I'd love to bring attention to the issue, but I need them to not make my academic career hell.
