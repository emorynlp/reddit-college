              "text": "I think it's understated that changing how you study can have an incredible impact. Not all classes require the same type of studying. \n\nI have a materials course that the professor makes 'skeleton' notes. Essentially an outline that she fills in blank spots on. The first 1/3 of the semester I just used those. I studied for the first exam and got a 80 after a 10 point curve. I wasn't exactly happy with that to be honest. It's a good grade but makes all the A's in my other courses look bad with a B sitting there. \n\nI did a little research into study methods and found one that seemed to fit the bill. Mind you, this class is a TON of memorization. There's no equations and only a few charts to be able to read. \n\nMy method was to sit in class, not fill out her notes, and make questions from her slides and write them in my notebook. If she was discussing carbon content in steel, I'd write \"What is the carbon content of cast iron?\". I write around 2 or 3 questions per slide. From there, I turn them into flashcards on a free flashcard program I found.\n\nI took the second exam yesterday and I literally felt like a joke. I knew \\~90% of the answers before looking through the multiple choice. Compared to the first exam, this was a HUGE shift in the way the exam went. It took me 20 minutes for 49 questions. I checked over my work twice, waiting for someone to get up and leave. I ended up being the first one done. \n\nThe shift in studying was incredible. I took it upon myself to find something that worked for the class and more importantly what worked for me. Although, that study method wouldn't do shit for me for my math oriented courses.",

Maybe they\u2019ll let you retake at full credit and if you can snag a B with some tutoring or supplemental studying you may make out well. \n\nDon\u2019t give up and if you do fail, failure is apart of success my friend. I have failed numerous times before and I am about to fail a group lesson assignment because my group mates blew me off \n\nBut let\u2019s be real, if you fail this exam today, odds are you won\u2019t even be thinking about it a year from now.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure if you actually are going to school for Stats or not but don\u2019t give up and there is always the option to retake as well. \n\nStudy the methods before the class too. I mean right before. If there is a formula, study it the night before but also cram before class. Draw a picture In your mind as to what the formula should look like. (Literally the only reason I passed college algebra in freshman year, of which I got a C- and is the only reason why I didn\u2019t have a 4.0 for my first year of college)\n\nIt\u2019s in your best interest. If you have a cognitive disability or something going on in your life, use it too.",
