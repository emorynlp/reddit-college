  "title:": "me when i want to change my major but counselors r completely booked bc of registration next week",
  "text": "Ive made the horrible mistake of not scheduling an appointment with my counselor when i should have. i just didnt realize how close we are to this semester ending (literally in a month) and how close registration is (literally in a week) i have a lot of mental health issues and struggle with dissociation and it\u2019s usually involuntary so im not conscious like 95% of the time so i didnt realize i should make an appointment and even when i did i kept forgetting and putting it off. this morning i called and tried to make an appointment and they said they\u2019re completely booked. i really wanted to change my major and also get help with choosing my classes but im an idiot and didnt do it sooner. i dont even know what classes i should be choosing for the next semester with the major i have rn\u2026 my question is though should i choose classes for the major that i want and hopefully get an appointment with the counselor asap to change my major or should i just choose classes that align with the one i have rn? will it matter if i do the latter and change my major? and if i do do the latter and change my major will i get to choose different classes right away or do i have to go through the rest of the semester in those classes? my bf says he\u2019ll help me choose my classes since i didnt get to ask for help from my counselor and he knows what he is doing, he is smarter snd more prepared thsn me, and he also that i should just choose classes that align with the major i want to switch to. i guess i should mention im currently majoring in psychology and want to switch to literature. please help T_T",

      "text": "I think you can change your major anytime during the semester (depending on the school you should ask about this), so sign up for the classes in the new major you chose. \n\nI had a similar experience. I signed up for classes in the new major during the end of the spring semester and then changed my old major to the new one way after I signed up. I think you'll be fine if you change your major after signing up for classes in the new major.",
