  "text": "I\u2019m a third year student and I recently transferred to a more academically rigorous school. At my old school, I was doing fine. I got good grades, kept my mental health up, and got plenty of sleep. Now, I\u2019m barely keeping up, my grades are dropping, and I\u2019m barely getting more than four hours of sleep. I feel like it\u2019s constantly taking a toll on my mental health and I just want to give up. I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve never experienced this type of problem before. I want to seek help, but I don\u2019t know where to start. I just know it\u2019s getting worse each day.",
