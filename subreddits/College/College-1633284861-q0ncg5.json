  "text": "So I've been in this college for just over a month. I realized I hate it here and the price isnt worth it. The Comp Sci program is so bad here. I applied to a few colleges back in California and am waiting to hear back from them. My credits wont transfer so Im glad I realized I didnt like this college after 1 semester. If I stayed I wouldnt have been able to transfer.",
