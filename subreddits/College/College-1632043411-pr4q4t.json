But I've just not done incredibly well as I hope to. I've got Cs in all my subjects- I do one A Level and 2 BTECs. I have until May for my final exams and I want to get As or Bs at least, but my depression is just getting worse, I'm still grieving for my Dad who passed away last year, trying to help my mum take care of my grandma who is receiving chemotherapy. My family want me to do well, they know I have the potential but my confidence just isn't there.

Keep putting one foot in front of the other, try to celebrate even the smallest success. And take each day as it comes.

Please do this. I struggled in high school for months while dealing with a mother going through cancer and ended up failing a few classes that semester just from stress. I finally broke down to my health teacher when he was asking about missing work and he ended up letting me get away with passing in less assignments and talking to other teachers.\n\nMost were really empathetic and helpful. Did have one teacher who didn\u2019t give me an extension for a major project. Mom was having 16 hour surgery on Monday so I asked for an extension until Wednesday on the weekend before. I wasn\u2019t only spending all weekend with my mom, but I had senior prom Friday night too. He said I\u2019d get 20 points off for each day it was late either way. Fuck that guy.
