I'll finish all my classes, come back to the dorm, do all my work, then boom, it's 4:00PM and I have nothing to do. I try to ask my suite mates if they want to go out and do stuff, but they usually prefer to stay in the dorm. I live around 40 minutes away from campus, so I always just find myself leaving every day to do the things that make me happy and productive back at home.\n\nI know I probably, \"should\" try harder to be more social, but in my experience, the best friends just come into your life when you're not actively seeking them out.\n\nI'm not an antisocial hermit, there are just a lot of things I would rather do that cannot be done on  campus. The way I look at this, youth goes by quickly, every day is short, and every day is a chance to make interesting memories, make money, or make the next day(s) better. \n\nSorry if this sounds like a diary entry.

I've tried just going out of my comfort zone every chance I get to go to events, club meets, little things, and whatnot. Sometimes they're boring, and you just do everything alone, but sometimes people will feel bad and come up to you, ask how you're doing, etc. That's sort of what happened with me! I went to some class picture thing (wasn't even for my class) and some girl made this insanely obnoxious laugh that this guy behind me and I just laughed at. Now we're best friends and talk like everyday! Him and I also have gone out to other events, talked about nerdy stuff, and attracted other people who hear us talk about stuff they're interested in. Now I'm in a good group of like six people that I do stuff with every so often, and I still go out on my own from time to time to meet more people. It can take time, and it sucks for a while until you meet some people, but just forcing yourself to go do SOMETHING is the best thing you can do (in my opinion at least)! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9e", "author": "LoveMeKovu", "created": 1632847630, "upvotes": 5}, "helqe8j": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px74bq/anyone_else_not_enjoying_dorm_life/helqe8j/", "text": "Are there any clubs you could join that happen after 4?
