  "text": "I feel like I am killing time more than I am spending it, if you see what I'm getting at. I'll finish all my classes, come back to the dorm, do all my work, then boom, it's 4:00PM and I have nothing to do. I try to ask my suite mates if they want to go out and do stuff, but they usually prefer to stay in the dorm. I live around 40 minutes away from campus, so I always just find myself leaving every day to do the things that make me happy and productive back at home.\n\nI know I probably, \"should\" try harder to be more social, but in my experience, the best friends just come into your life when you're not actively seeking them out.\n\nI'm not an antisocial hermit, there are just a lot of things I would rather do that cannot be done on  campus. The way I look at this, youth goes by quickly, every day is short, and every day is a chance to make interesting memories, make money, or make the next day(s) better. \n\nSorry if this sounds like a diary entry. But I invite you to share similar experiences if you have any.",

I\u2019m not shaming you, that\u2019s literally my life now lol. It\u2019s just that usually people who say quotes like that use them to advocate for partying and stuff. If that makes you happy that\u2019s fine, but this philosophy just doesn\u2019t seem to add up with the kind of decisions you\u2019re making.",

          "text": "I know it sounds mad cheesy but it was just what I was thinking haha. Basically because you are in college you are actively helping your future self, however with college comes significant downtime, and one should use this downtime to do the things that make them happy and productive. I don\u2019t see how I said I\u2019m content doing the same thing every day, I\u2019m definitely not. I am happy to get an education, but just personally speaking, I would rather not idly sit around doing nothing that would be productive or conducive to growth. Now that\u2019s just me, if you like staying in the dorm and that makes you happy, please continue. Just personally that\u2019s not my cup of tea and I find it difficult to stay on campus and not go home every day. Like I said, I could definitely be more social, but there are things I can\u2019t do on campus that make me content and make me feel like I\u2019m progressing in life.\n\nI\u2019m also the furthest thing from a party person, but that quote can definitely be applied to anyone.",

              "text": "I was just confused by the wording, sorry if I offended you. I mean, it\u2019s a good mindset to have. Definitely healthier than the usual context it\u2019s applied to (which, in my experience, is usually to pressure others into doing things out of fear of their youth expiring). I\u2019m against the whole \u201cyouth goes by quickly\u201d mindset in general, I know of 40 year olds that party harder than some college students. But I see now that\u2019s not really how you meant it.\n\nAnyway, I was never content with just staying in the dorms. My life now is not my college life. Personally I would spend my time on campus with friends. I didn\u2019t start drinking until sophomore year, so didn\u2019t really go to parties until later, but we went to lots of on campus events. I never felt like I had much downtime because I was heavily involved in a club and had a job. A lot of things I did weren\u2019t necessarily productive for my future, but they were good for my present.\n\nIf you\u2019re happy, that\u2019s all that matters. But personally I would recommend maybe trying to do a mix. Like go home and be productive some days, try to stay on campus other days. If you don\u2019t like it, switch back. You can be happy and productive and still try to get out of your comfort zone to attain new opportunities \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Unlike past generations, the current and future generation of students attending/ will be attending college are not as gullible as previous generations when it comes to the college experience. The sparkles are gone and the jig is up. College is just a period of your life where you take classes for credit with the hope of attaining a degree.",

      "text": "I tend to consider myself more introverted, especially when it comes to meeting people. I've tried just going out of my comfort zone every chance I get to go to events, club meets, little things, and whatnot. Sometimes they're boring, and you just do everything alone, but sometimes people will feel bad and come up to you, ask how you're doing, etc. That's sort of what happened with me! I went to some class picture thing (wasn't even for my class) and some girl made this insanely obnoxious laugh that this guy behind me and I just laughed at. Now we're best friends and talk like everyday! Him and I also have gone out to other events, talked about nerdy stuff, and attracted other people who hear us talk about stuff they're interested in. Now I'm in a good group of like six people that I do stuff with every so often, and I still go out on my own from time to time to meet more people. It can take time, and it sucks for a while until you meet some people, but just forcing yourself to go do SOMETHING is the best thing you can do (in my opinion at least)! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9e",
