  "text": "**PLEASE HELP ME SO I CAN PASS THE CLASS**\n\nhello!\n\nI have been assigned a group project where we have to discuss the school-to-prison pipeline. We have to create a project that our target audience can access from the internet so my group is wanting to make a youtube vid of us talking about it. **We are asking for submissions of your experience in k-12 education that we plan on sharing with the class and anonymously ofc.**\n\nIf you are unaware of what the school-to-prison pipeline means, it's a process through which **students are pushed out of schools and into prisons. Students of minority groups (people of color, disabled, special needs, LGBTQ+, immigrants, etc) and or students who come from low-income areas are disproportionally targeted by teachers and school staff.

Having some type of wall all around the school, screenings, metal detectors, strong police presence on campus, drug tests, backpack checks, etc\n\n\\- targeting LGBTQ students who are showing PDA, ignoring when they are getting bullied, staff using words that can label a student in a negative way, possibly resulting in dropping out, fighting, delinquency, suspension, expulsion or any threat of those possibilities  \n\n\\- black students (or students of color) getting hyper-criminalized whether they are behaving or misbehaving.

Did this kind of school environment make you feel safe? Did you feel supported? Did you feel excited coming to school? How did this affect your mental health?**\n\nThank you for your time",
