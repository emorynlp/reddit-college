  "text": "Long story short, really bad stuff happened to my family that caught everyone off guard and majorly impacted my already tanking mental health. For weeks I just laid in bed, unable to accomplish anything. Now, it\u2019s nearing the end of the semester and I\u2019m failing 3 classes. \n\nMy depression medication kicked in too late. They started working approximately a week ago, and now I\u2019m finally motivated and feeling so much better. But I don\u2019t know what to do about my classes. I can\u2019t just fail them because I have an out of state scholarship I have to maintain. What do I do?",
