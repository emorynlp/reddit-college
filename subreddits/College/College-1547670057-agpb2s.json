  "text": "STOP PACKING YOUR STUFF EARLY!\n\nIt's extremely rude to start shuffling papers, zipping up your bags, and chatting to your neighbor with 5-10 minutes left of class while the prof is still talking. Especially when it's a big lecture hall, it's very hard to hear for students around you.\n\nI say specifically freshman because I'm in 3rd year and people still do it in my programs, but it's the odd couple first year classes I have that are the worst.\n\nJust wait till the end of class. If you are really in a hurry then arrange yourself so that when the prof is finished speaking, it's easy to pack your things and leave.\n\nEdit: If you must leave early to not be late for your next class then so be it. But have some sort of exit strategy, keep your bag unzipped till you leave the classroom, sit as close to a door as possible, generally don't make a ruckus. My post was more aimed at the cumulative effect of the whole class who think packing up and chatting before the prof is finished is acceptable. The odd few people who must leave early can very well do so in manner that doesn't disrupt anyone and that is totally fine.",

If you really must leave early, you can do so quietly. I don't assume someone is an asshole for leaving early, I assume someone is an asshole for disrupting everyone around them in the process.",

Yes, some professors do that but I think it\u2019s absurd when they do that. \n\nAt my school there are two campuses 20min apart and people can have class on both OR commute to the school (so there can be lots of traffic), so none of the professors I\u2019ve had so far lock the door. they understand some students have a longer trip. One professor I had even took questions from early students then started class about 10 min in since a third of the class would be arriving from the other campus, late. Every day. But you know what? That was fine as everyone understands ",
