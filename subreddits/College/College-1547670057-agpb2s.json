Especially when it's a big lecture hall, it's very hard to hear for students around you.\n\nI say specifically freshman because I'm in 3rd year and people still do it in my programs, but it's the odd couple first year classes I have that are the worst.\n\nJust wait till the end of class. If you are really in a hurry then arrange yourself so that when the prof is finished speaking, it's easy to pack your things and leave.\n\nEdit: If you must leave early to not be late for your next class then so be it. But have some sort of exit strategy, keep your bag unzipped till you leave the classroom, sit as close to a door as possible, generally don't make a ruckus. My post was more aimed at the cumulative effect of the whole class who think packing up and chatting before the prof is finished is acceptable. The odd few people who must leave early can very well do so in manner that doesn't disrupt anyone and that is totally fine.", "author": "OstidTabarnak", "created": 1547670057, "retrieved": 1632802548, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 849, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"efdlf6m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/agpb2s/psa_to_all_students_specifically_freshman/efdlf6m/", "text": "Also, if you're only coming to class to talk and take half-assed notes, just don't show up.
