He coached me through writing, left helpful and excellent feedback. I wish I could have been a better student- I participated every day we met, went to virtual coaching office hours, always went above and beyond because I genuinely enjoyed the class and his teaching style. \n\nI started my semester with an unexpected back injury (yay for ruptured discs!) and ended the semester with an adult ADHD diagnosis. He was the first person I told - it was more of an accidental email \u201cconfession/rant\u201d though- it was definitely not graceful and I felt so embarrassed afterward, but I was in the deepest part of a mental illness (pre diagnosis, I was scared, sad, feeling all of a sudden so understood . I\u2019m 31 years old and going to college, being diagnosed with Adult ADHD made me realize I\u2019ve lived my whole life untreated and it was really overwhelming for me.) \n\nAnyway, he was just so kind and understanding and patient. I ended the semester with a B- in the class, though we both knew I deserved an A. I didn\u2019t turn in my last essay because at that point, I was just mentally done. \n\nOf course I sent him an email thanking him for the semester, but I plan on sending him a much better, more collected email toward the end of this current semester to truly thank him. I just wanted to let some time pass, and I also want to read one of the books he recommended to me too to use that as a talking point.\n\nHe really changed my academic life and mindset for the better. He was one of the best instructors I\u2019ve had in my life. He even told me that I have the intellectual curiosity and unique perspective To be successful in grad school should I choose to go in that direction. \n\nCan you believe that?! I\u2019m in my associates degree right now and that comment gave me the confidence to know that once I continue on my mental health diagnosis process, I know I\u2019ll still have to work hard but getting my bachelors degree doesn\u2019t seem as intimidating now.  Through him, I also learned how to show up for myself by advocating for my needs. \n\nI really miss his class and teaching style. He was like a mentor to me in a way. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nI hope that my future email to him will be received well because I just want him to know that he did impact my life positively.\n\nEdited: a sentence.
