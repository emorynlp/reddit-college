  "text": "I asked my groupchat how everyone is doing so well in chemistry and I was basically asking like \u201cthe secret\u201d to passing chemistry. This girl said I\u2019m an attention seeking complainer because all I\u2019ve ever mentioned in the groupchat is my bad grades. I do mention them a lot but I wanted a genuine answer; I wasn\u2019t trying to seek attention or sympathy. So I told her to stop being a cunt. Then everyone got mad at me. Then this other kid kept making fun of me for failing chemistry, so I called him a dipshit. And then girl said she was reporting me to the dean for \u201ccyber bullying.\u201d Will anything actually happen? Was I in the wrong?",

Insulting people is wrong too, but that just means you\u2019re both wrong (and you more than her). \n\nThey\u2019re unlikely to actually bother reporting you if you just stop trying to take advantage of them and being a jerk. If they do, you\u2019ll have to talk to the Dean of Students and they\u2019ll tell you more details there.",

Most people recognize a one off argument, and it doesn't sound like you made a threat. Now if this is a pattern of behavior or you continue to be a cunt, then yeah no your going to get in shit. \n\nLeave the group chat or stfu for a while.\n\nGo to the school tutors. You pay for them.\n\nFind other communities like /r/getstudying for answers on how to get A's. \n\nStop asking for the secret and admit that you need to do work. \n\nStop immediately getting pissed when someone tells you your being annoying. Also it's a group chat, you literally can go put your phone down.\n\nStop monopolizing the group chat with complaining, especially if this is a casual group chat not like a school focused one. No one wants to hear constant complaining, especially when it sounds like you didn't take the advice last several times. \n\nSometimes people are cunts. But if everyone is being a cunt to you, your probably the cunt. I recognize social skills are hard, but dude your acting like a child.",

And dear god are NTs annoying, but people don't care what you meant. \n\nIn this case the why seems to be interrupting, not listening and applying previous advice, or asking too much. Probably would have been better to ask and segue to a one on one chat with whoever was willing to help. \n\nAlso if you don't know why (I get it, college is hard) try office hours and ask what particular things your struggling with. A lot of times it's not obvious that your choices in sources, writing style, grammar, not writing in-between steps for math and science, using pencil in lab notebook or whatever is causing marks to go down. \n\nDon't challenge the professor, just be like I have gotten lower grades then I would like on these assignments, I'd like to know what I can do to improve in the future. Bring the assignments btw. Try to suss out the reasons. \n\nIf it's wrong answer in math, you probably need to restudy the steps. You might be struggling with a primary one. If it's wrong answers on like, multiple choice only one true answer things, you might need to up your spaced repetition studying. If it's English, you probably need to improve the formatting and grammar.\n\nIf it's stress in exams or distraction Steve is chewing gum the entire fucking exam again, you might need to go to disability services and take exams in a private room instead.",
