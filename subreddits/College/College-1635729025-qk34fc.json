  "text": "Hi, I'm currently struggling with first-year college calculus and chemistry. My school offers tutoring, but it's about $30/hr, so I'm looking for cheaper alternatives online. They also offer free drop-in sessions, but that would only be 4 hours a week, and I think I have too many questions for 4 hours. And, other students will be there asking as well. SO, if anyone has recommendations (such as discord servers and websites) where I can find free tutoring or cheap tutoring, I would appreciate it. :)",

      "text": "$30 is actually quite generous as tutoring is generally expensive. And proper, free tutoring isn\u2019t going to exist. It is those drop-in sessions your college offers.\n\nBut in the meantime of finding a tutor, I recommend using [Paul\u2019s Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu) which offers notes and problems on Calculus I-III. Professor Leonard on Youtube is also great at explaining certain topics you may be confused about.",
