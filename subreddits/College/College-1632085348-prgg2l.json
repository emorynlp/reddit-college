  "title:": "A group of people are relying on me to be their tutor for my accounting class and I don't know what to do",
  "text": "So I'm currently taking an accounting course that's a requirement for a good amount of majors at my school.  Most of the class is through McGraw Hill Connect (ugh), so almost all of the assignments are independent with the professor being on standby if we get stuck.  The course is notorious for being a pain in the ass for a lot of students since the workload is pretty rough, and the weekly quizzes and homework can potentially take a while to get done.  Luckily you get unlimited attempts at any of the assignments, so as long as you can do decent on those and get at least a 60% on both exams, you can get the course over over with with at least a C.\n\nI sit near the back of the lecture hall by myself and there's a group of people behind me who are *constantly* talking through lectures and are clearly confused by what's going on, and the other day they saw me finish the in class activity assignment with about half an hour of class left.  They asked me how I got it, and I took the rest of the class and a little bit after to try and help.  Afterwards they added me to a groupme for the class and they've been asking me all weekend how I've been getting the answers to certain questions, but now I don't know what to do.  I don't want these people to fail, but I also don't want to always be answering my texts telling them how I got the answers to certain problems.  What do I do by now?  I feel like crap no matter what I pick.",

      "text": "I would say either ignore them or suggest to them either ask the professor or get a tutor either independently or through the school. I didn't understand orgo and got a personal tutor. I do the same for bio, but use either the TA's and/or the school's tutors.\n\nedit: groupme's are great when you just have a question or two that needs explained, but if you don't understand the whole chapter you need to get outside help. This also depends on the person. Some days I am able to give a whole tutoring session others I'm not.",
