As I was packing my things getting ready to leave tomorrow I started thinking of the time I've spent in school and one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I didn't make any effort to socialize and get to know people (especially girls).\n\nI didn't have fun or go to parties I just buried my head in my books for four years, before I consoled myself with the fact that these University years are temporary and it's worth sacrificing them for a brighter future. But then it occurred to me \"isn't everything in a way temporary\", there's no time or period in our lives that last forever, life itself doesn't last forever we're just left with memories and the older one gets the faster the years go by.\n\nThen I fantasize about becoming this rich famous person and as a result those who rejected me or treated me badly will regret their actions.Then I realized no one would really give a fuck, sure they will probably tell their friends they knew me but outside of that I will rarely come up in their mind and they will live their lives normally. \n\nTo make things worse I will never be in this kind of environment again with such a high density of young beautiful women I can easily talk to because outside of University it will get harder to meet and talk to new people. It will take some painful and deliberate effort to meet someone and one would probably have to compromise on their standards too because it will feel like you're racing against the clock.\n\nIt's not all bad though I'm on a 3.8 CGPA and I have some decent job offers waiting for me when I'm done with University. But I feel like no matter how successful I get in life it won't make up for the fact that I've missed out on so much in my University years. I also fear that going forward most relationships will be transactional as to what can I gain from this person. In personal relationships too in the sense that I'll probably be vetted whether I have a stable income before my personality comes into question. \n\nI'm not trying to make a point here, I'm not even sure of half of the things I've said, I'm just sad and confused. I have never really had any real life experience or had any sort of fun per say, I've always just been focused on school right from a young age living a sheltered life and I was hoping I could fix that in University but I'm almost done now. I'm scared of what's waiting for me out there. I honestly don't think I'm ready ..fuck I don't know.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\nThanks", "author": "Living_Wickihowla", "created": 1584713689, "retrieved": 1632802669, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 719, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g32ds0m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/flvpf0/reflecting_on_my_university_years_thanks_to_the/g32ds0m/", "text": "dont sweat it. most of your peers will be unemployed or never get real jobs. trust me man..i know it feels like you missed out but you dont want to be in your late 20s / early 30s working a dead end job", "author": "jewishsupremacist88", "created": 1598562734, "upvotes": 2}, "fl2ofhn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/flvpf0/reflecting_on_my_university_years_thanks_to_the/fl2ofhn/", "text": "Not the exact same, but kinda similar.

But, even then, i spent a lot of it holed up in my room alone, or regretting not doing things.\n\nMy advice? I guess, as hard as it may be, be happy for the experiences you have. If you look back at it and keep regretting it, you'll go crazy (iv'e gone slightly crazy). At the end of the day, college is just another part of your life, for better or worse. I think the main lesson learned is live your life fuller. You realize now how yes academics is important but a social life, parties (if youre into them) boyfriend/girlfriends, friends, just hanging out with friends are SO important and what you'll remember when you look back. Dont neglect work or studies, but if anything, put relationships first imo. Also, i saw someone mention doing a \"victory lap\" of an extra semester. Financially, it may be tough, and idk if i can recommend it. But, if you have the funds/are ok with it, i'd say go for it. You do only have these things (college) once. Once it's over, that book is shut.\n\nTLDR: don't waste it, live your life fully, focus on work and studies but make (imo) a bigger focus on relationships and memories.", "author": "Spader623", "created": 1584755888, "upvotes": 1}, "fl2njy7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/flvpf0/reflecting_on_my_university_years_thanks_to_the/fl2njy7/", "text": "I\u2019m in the same boat as you... kind of.

Sure, my grades weren\u2019t all A\u2019s, but I\u2019ve got some beautiful memories made. \n\nAfter a year in Uni back in 2016, I had to move to the US and get settled and work (to save up for college). This year, I transferred to a college and even though my grades are still important for me, I\u2019m trying my best to reach out to people and make more friends. :) one way I document my memories is by taking photos or videos of every hangout or place I visit. And then I make a montage of those and post in on youtube for future references. I feel like I tend to forget the good times and experiences, so those videos help me take a walk down the memory lane and help me remember that I, too, had some good experiences.\n\nI\u2019d say your worries are absolutely right and yes, you will regret not \u201cenjoying\u201d your time.

I'm just not smart enough (it feels like) to have a super active social life AND decent GPA at my school, and I think I'd regret not buckling down more to do my best academically. The grass is always greener I suppose, and balancing all these factors is far easier said than done.....can you slack on studying for that midterm to go to that party/social gathering?

But I think the most important thing to remember when intimidated by not knowing where to turn or what to do next, is to remember that NOONE ever knows what they are doing when they get to this point. We don\u2019t know what the future holds, but it can only get better from here. College is an amazing time, to be sure, and there are things about it that we won\u2019t have the opportunity to experience again; but we\u2019ll be out there in the real world, having real adventures and getting by. Thats all any of us can do.\n\nI absolutely feel you on the social thing. I\u2019ve been beyond socially awkward around girls my entire life, and was beginning to panic that I\u2019d never find anyone and would be alone forever. But then out of nowhere a girl I knew and talked to at work messaged me and we hit it off. Sadly this happened very recently (last week) and we only had a few days together before we were forced apart by this damn coronavirus, but it\u2019s never too late to meet someone. \n\nWe\u2019re all in this together, and in the words of OK Go this too shall pass.
