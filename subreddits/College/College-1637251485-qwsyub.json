  "title:": "What kind of job can I get with a BFA degree with a concentration in drawing & painting?",
  "text": "I hope this isn\u2019t a dumb question. I am a freshman in college and I\u2019m planning on applying to the BFA program next year in hopes of having my concentration in drawing and painting. I really want to pursue a job as a storyboard artist and even sequential arts but I\u2019m not sure I can do that as an art major and wanting to have that as my concentration. Or can I? Are there any other jobs available to me after college?\nThank you!!",

      "text": "Art and design major here (and coincidentally with the same ambitions as you!). Provided you have that type of work in your portfolio and have done some networking you should be fine. I know graphic design concentration people who do animation/story boarding. Concentrations (at least where I am) mean nothing apart from you took some extra classes and have a little more knowledge of that area in your major. For storyboarding the drawing will actually help quite a bit and the painting (especially digitally) could help you get some other jobs (background painter, illustration, etc). If you\u2019re worried about it you should talk to an advisor, and your school may even have a capstone dedicated to portfolio work.",

I have a friend that designs cabinetry for clients at a local business who has a BFA as well\n\nIf you want a more academic position or to work more directly with art in a museum or gallery you'll probably need to get your masters",
