  "text": "i havent partied since coming back to school, mostly because ive been busy but also because my one of my roommates isnt ready/comfortable w it. however a lot of my friends outside of my roommates are partying and ive been feeling so left out. all i do is work and school and clubs (which i do love and have friends in so no harm there) but rarely hang or go out. i just wanna know how other ppl are feeling who are in the same boat, bc the fomo is real for me rn and i feel so isolated like im not even a college student anymore. i also just miss partying ngl it was always super fun :(",
