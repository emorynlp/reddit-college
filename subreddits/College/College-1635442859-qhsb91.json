  "title:": "Double Major in Chemistry and Political Science?",
  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI have recently been debating a possible double major. My primary major is political science, but I have an aptitude for chemistry. In high school, I took Orgo 1 and excelled in it. I participated in many chemistry competitions and even participated in undergraduate chemistry research as a high schooler. I was originally planning on majoring in chemistry, but decided against it because I realized that I didn't enjoy it as much. Nonetheless, I'm currently enrolled in all humanities this semester and it definitely feels as if I'm missing an aspect of my life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I go back into chemistry? I was also planning on possibly completing the BS/MS Chemistry program at my school. After completing my MS in Chemistry, I will most likely pursue an MS in Political Science or another related field. Will completing an MS in Chemistry increase my chances of being accepted into a top master's program in Political Science?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: I'm a sophomore at a top 30 college",

      "text": "What career do you want out of poli sci? And what career do you want out of chemistry? Is there a way to merge the two fields? I ask cause these two are very different degrees, and have very different career prospects. I'm in engineering and thinking about adding public administration to my degree because I feel I can get decent STEM advancement in public policy. But my first passion lies in space sciences, so that's my main major.",

They are definitely 2 different degrees, but I feel like I'm interested in both. I do have to say that I probably enjoy my political science degree more than chemistry.",

It's fine to double major at the undergraduate level, but there is really no point in getting two masters. You would be wasting 2 years and a lot of money to get a second master degree that won't help your career much.\n\n>I want to become a policy analyst and influence public policy.
