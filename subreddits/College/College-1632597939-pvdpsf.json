Advice?", "text": "My professor gave me a 0 on an essay because I \u201cincorrectly cited\u201d a sentence essentially saying the idea wasn\u2019t my own. We turn in our essays in turnitin and it did not pick up that the sentence was plagiarized, yet my professor claims it was. I know for a fact that the sentence is my own and the software he uses to pick up plagiarism backs me up. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to belittle me because I am a first year student at a community college as previous students have said that he has a tendency to do that. (I should have looked at his ratemyprofessor before signing up so this is on me)\n\nI am not an argumentative person and I believe that my previous writing assignments\u2014if he bothered to read them\u2014prove that I am capable of coming up with my own ideas. I don\u2019t want to freeze up and let him walk all over me so I am asking for advice on what to do without coming off as impolite. Thank you in advance.\n\nUpdate: Meeting went really well. We had a conversation about various topics and he believed me. He said he was thrown off because in comparison to the essays of other students, this one stood out like a sore thumb. He finally read my discussion posts and other writing assignments and saw that I was consistent. I now have an A on the paper. I appreciate every comment that was left and I thank each and every one of you.", "author": "AtomicWrong", "created": 1632597939, "retrieved": 1632945967, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"he9nbx2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvdpsf/meeting_on_essay_plagiarism_with_my_professor/he9nbx2/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1632604758, "upvotes": 10}, "he9a4ri": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvdpsf/meeting_on_essay_plagiarism_with_my_professor/he9a4ri/", "text": "Stand your ground.
