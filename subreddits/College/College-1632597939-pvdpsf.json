  "title:": "Meeting on essay plagiarism with my professor. Advice?",
  "text": "My professor gave me a 0 on an essay because I \u201cincorrectly cited\u201d a sentence essentially saying the idea wasn\u2019t my own. We turn in our essays in turnitin and it did not pick up that the sentence was plagiarized, yet my professor claims it was. I know for a fact that the sentence is my own and the software he uses to pick up plagiarism backs me up. I have a feeling he\u2019s going to belittle me because I am a first year student at a community college as previous students have said that he has a tendency to do that. (I should have looked at his ratemyprofessor before signing up so this is on me)\n\nI am not an argumentative person and I believe that my previous writing assignments\u2014if he bothered to read them\u2014prove that I am capable of coming up with my own ideas. I don\u2019t want to freeze up and let him walk all over me so I am asking for advice on what to do without coming off as impolite. Thank you in advance.\n\nUpdate: Meeting went really well. We had a conversation about various topics and he believed me. He said he was thrown off because in comparison to the essays of other students, this one stood out like a sore thumb. He finally read my discussion posts and other writing assignments and saw that I was consistent. I now have an A on the paper. I appreciate every comment that was left and I thank each and every one of you.",

              "text": "You should meet with the professor with a more open mind and not be so confrontational and aggressive from the get go.\n\nAlso read what wobbletelescope  wrote\n\n\nThere isa good chance , if you have not already been reported, that your professor wants to remediate any of your problems and is not just out to get you.\n\nSo you should listen carefully to what they say the problems were and  how to fix them\n\nIf you double down and are unresponsive to any attempts to get you to see what is wrong , this massively increases the chances it will get reported.\n\nWhen you start threatening and posturing, then it does go further because I can no longer help you at the grass roots level.\n\nLike If I have an unofficial or semi official meet with you, it can stay there, under the radar.  If you take it to the chair, we are both obligated to report academic misconduct and now you have to deal with the integrity violation.\n\nIf you did commit a violation and you are also stropppy and deny it, the sanctions are typically worse because you plagiarized and then lied about it and demonstrated that remdiation would to be useful with you.\n\nSo that stand your ground thing and the take it straight to the president of the universe thing is terrible advice",
