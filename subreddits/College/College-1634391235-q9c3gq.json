  "text": "Currently retaking gen chem 1 and eng 1 cause I got C\u2019s in both of them. Trying to increase GPA (2.9 with 20-30ish credits). They are my lowest grades (among). I have also 2-3 other C\u2019s. Just had a mishap with my Eng cause I got a low essay score that dropped my grade 20% down to D+ from B+ already at mid semester. Chem is just hanging by a thread at a B- which is difficult for me to maintain. \n\nIt is uncertain whether my school\u2019s (a CC) retake policy accounts for all attempted courses and averages them or does grade replace. I just don\u2019t see the point in Eng anymore if I can barely even possibly achieve a B now in it after that.\n\nEDIT: My school\u2019s policy is that the latest retake you do is your new grade in that class.",
