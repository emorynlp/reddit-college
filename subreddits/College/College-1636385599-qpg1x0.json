  "text": "I have a question. I'm currently in my 2nd-year political science course. My parents and I already planned to enroll myself in law school right after finishing my four-year pre-law degree. They already prepared money to pay for my tuition fee (excluding the dorm, allowance, etc.). However, unfortunately, my mother was diagnosed with psoriasis, and the medical treatments are expensive. The creams, shampoo, soaps are costly, we are not rich, and my parents only relied on their salary for our daily expenses. I have my younger brother, too whose in high school.\n\nNow I immediately discard the idea to pursue law to help my family after two years. Do you perhaps know any jobs that have a decent salary for pol-sci graduates? I want to help my family as soon I graduate.\n\nOn another note, who got part-time jobs here while at the university? Can you recommend me somewhere I can apply? I can't apply myself as an ESL tutor since I'm not that fluent in english. Do you guys any know virtual jobs that only use mobile phones & laptops? Thank you.",

      "text": "A few things: \n\nFirst, have you actually spoken with your family about the financial situation and how it affects your ability to go to law school? This is not a decision you should make unilaterally, especially since it sounds like they\u2019ve saved up a very large sum of money. It may be that the financially best decision is for them to use a portion of those savings for her healthcare, have you take out some loans, and then use your much higher law starting salary to support the family and pay back the loans. \n\nIf it is the case that abandoning law school is the most financially reasonable situation, then political science graduates who prepare themselves well have a lot of options. Make sure you\u2019re getting internships in your ideal field of work; engaging in research or other academic extracurriculars; etc. \n\nYou can: work in a non-profit, do public policy analysis, work for the local/state/federal government, etc. Now, a lot of those unfortunately don\u2019t have extremely high starting salaries, but the good thing about political science is that the skills can be transferred very easily. Perhaps look into marketing/advertising. \n\nOn the note of part-time jobs in university, federal work-study is a great option if you\u2019re eligible. Easy work, the pay is higher than minimum wage, and you can usually sit around and do your homework for most of the time. Other than that, off-campus restaurant jobs (with tips) can sometimes be lucrative. The service sector is always hiring.",
