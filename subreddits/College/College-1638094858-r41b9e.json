  "text": "I know people have already complained about his but imma keep complaining because it is not fair to call it a break when there are assignments due. I regret not doing anything on thanksgiving and Friday because I wanted to take a break. But I have shit due on Sunday. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because professors get to have a break and not worry about anything. They can just chill and do their Black Friday shopping without worrying about work. They\u2019re not even obligated to answer emails on break.\n\nSo I think it should be a rule that no assignment should be assigned or due on the week of break. Talk about equality",

      "text": "I kind of agree, especially group projects should be avoided.\n\nBut on the flip side, I went to a school halfway across the country, so breaks were nice but it wasn't about going home and free food and spending time with siblings or seeing old friends. My school had a one day fall break and one day spring break and I was in a class with a bunch of freshman who were complaining about not having a longer break, and as a senior far from home the idea just didn't appeal to me. I came to school to learn, I get in the groove of doing my studies, regular assignments, working with my study group, and a break just throws everything off and makes it harder to get back into it.",
