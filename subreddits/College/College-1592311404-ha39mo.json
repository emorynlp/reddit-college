And yes, you probably have one that gets on their nerves, too, they just don\u2019t tell you. It could be something like they put their calls on speaker or never leave the dorm except for class. In my experience, I had a roommate who would always lock the door into our bedroom because she was scared we\u2019d get robbed. Our room was a suite with three rooms: the kitchen/living room and two bedrooms, and the front door. This got kind of annoying at times because I\u2019d always have to get my keys from off the counter after putting them down. And one morning, I was half asleep and needed to use the bathroom so I got locked out of my bedroom because I didn\u2019t realize she locked the door. This is coming from somebody with anxiety disorder who worries about safety to an ungodly degree, it was annoying, and our school is in a bad area, so you better believe it\u2019s well guarded. Because of this, there\u2019d be times when she\u2019d lock herself out and make me stop what I was doing on campus to go open the door, as you only got three free tries from security before they fined you. \n\nBut it\u2019s a small petty habit like that, who gives a shit? You\u2019re allowed to be annoyed but your roommates are going to have that.

From starting fights with us, to filming our friends to gossip about them later, to trying to meddle in our relationships, to keeping our apartment a disaster (I could go on) he was literally the only one causing any issues all year, and it dampened the whole experience. Finally a few months in (and in a much-needed RA meeting) he admitted he lied on the questionnaire about the fact that he's fine with sharing space and wound up living in the dorm that fits the most people per space on campus.
