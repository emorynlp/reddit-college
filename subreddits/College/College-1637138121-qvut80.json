  "text": "I'm having a hard time focusing at all in one of my classes. The professor annoys me (is passive-aggressive, doesn't wear a mask), she teaches a subject I don't like, is incredibly boring-- I feel like I learn nothing from the live sessions-- and assigns chapters of her own book to read (idk if this is common or not). But I don't want to fail, so how do I keep myself engaged in the learning material???\n\nAlso, 90% of her assignments are just entire books for us to read... am I supposed to read all of them??? She lists like five books a week with no particular chapter.",
