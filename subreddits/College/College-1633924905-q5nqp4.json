  "text": "Ive got a tough midterm coming up and all i cant think of is failing out of college. Ive never endured this much stress as of recently over anything in my life that i can remember right off. College is tough and ive just started and i just know the stress will break me one day. Every little thing nearly drives me to a full on panic attack and I know it is only a matter of time till i cave and give up. If this happens ill leave my parents with nothing but debt with nothing to show for it. My life will literlly crumble before me if im not careful and this makes me scared to do anything. People always say to learn from failure but in this case i may not get a chance to incorperate what ive learned anyways. Im terrified.",
