It's partly what drove me to decline my admissions at big 4 yr schools and go to community college because I had no idea what to do. As a plug for comm. college= it was 99.9% covered by my pell grant. I never had to pay out of pocket for tuition, and the only expenses I faced were textbooks that weren't covered by extra grant/scholarship money, and school supplies. Downside: I worked the entire three years I got my associates and lived with my parents. Now I'm a junior at a 4 yr like an actual student.\n\nLoans are probably the scariest, and once you start taking them out you'll see why people try to avoid taking out loans. However, they are completely necessary unless you have ~15k per semester to pay out of pocket (dependent on school). If you're taking out 30k per year for 4 years, that's over 120k in debt... for a bachelors. So that's when you start realizing how important aid and scholarships are in terms of your bill.\n\nYour bachelor's degree is the end of your undergraduate term. You achieve this by taking two years of consecutive lower level courses for your major (such as Eng101-104 for Eng majors), and then advanced 'upper classmen' courses in your junior/senior levels. Along with your core major classes, which you may take 1-3 courses per semester, you will also take your interdisciplinary classes. This allows you to take courses outside your Eng major, such as a programming class, and get credits, as you need 120 to graduate. They want you to be a well-rounded individual as well, so you're also require to take these gen eds.

I'd say you're already on the right track, just asking these questions. \n\n First, I'd say study for your ACT or SAT. Second, apply for whatever schools you want. Research them and visit them. Just fill in the boxes on the applications. Third, apply for FAFSA. At my university, they let me know what grant's and scholarships I was able to get. Others may disagree with me, but you dont need to know your major going in and your interests will most likely change as you take college courses. (Originally, I was going for teaching and I changed it to Cytotechnology this semester. It was a career I had no idea existed and had no idea how much I'd enjoy the classes). If you realize you want to take a different degree and your school doesn't have it, you could even change schools. My school even has a program where you build your own degree, with help from college advisors. You're first two years are going to be generic classes, so you have those first two years to decide. As you decide, you'll figure out if you need to continue onto a masters program depending on your career plan. Again, you dont need to know this right away. You could even decide youd rather go to a technical school after you start college, and that's fine. A lot of jobs will see those college credits and it can put you ahead of those who just have their technical certs. \n\nEvery college has it's own financial stuff, so you could even just go to a college you like or call, and theyll most likely have a place for perspective students with staff to answer your questions. Even if its questions regarding majors, careers, finance ect. You've got this.

I wish I started off undecided. I didn't really know what I wanted to do and I knew science was cool so I started down that track. Now I'm in my second year about to graduate (Dual Enrollment Credits) in a year and I don't like my major and I wish I had more of an exposure to other classes instead of just science. \n\nI recommend that you apply for scholarships from your college before you go there. Some scholarships are for incoming freshman (my college offers 30+ for incoming students) which is good. So when you apply before you actually get there, the money will be in your student account or will go to your bank account depending on where they will send the money. \n\nIf you're planning on getting your Master's I recommend you work for your university so they pay for your master's degree. Lots of colleges do this for master's and phD students, but you have to either teach/TA or work for a department in the school. I know lots of people and TA's who are doing this and I recommend this for you because who doesn't want to get their masters or phD for free (well in reference to your classes/tuition fees you still have to pay for textbooks, but $200 is better than $2000). \n\nStudent loans are typically deferred and you can pay them down while you are in school, but once you get out the banks come calling for you. I don't know if while they are deferred you get interest on them, but get a deferral plan if you can and pay some down on it while you are in school so you aren't struggling. \n\nIf you can I would recommend going to a college in state because the tuition is considerably lower. For instance the college I attend is free tuition because I qualified for a scholarship the state hands out fairly easily. All i have to do is pay for my fees which are about $1500 a semester, however comparing this to someone who goes out of state without a scholarship it's pretty nice. There are also some schools that will consider you instate if NO SCHOOL IN YOUR ENTIRE STATE has your intended major, but most schools instate do so I don't know. That's all I got. Hope that helps and enjoy college, it will be the most memorable time in your life hopefully... it is for me... I got involved on campus though so... that makes a huge difference.

For me, even after scholarships and my parents covering half of the tuition, I would have to pay 15k (Wanted to go to UIUC for in state but was rejected since cs is getting crazy competitive).\n\nOf those 15k, 5.5k would be from fafsa loan and other 9.5k would be from bank or credit union loan. The school Im planning to go to apparently has a great credit union. Still, I would have to pay 5.5~6.5 percent in interest. Thats about 580 dollars per yesr in interest for 9.5k loan. \n\nI have some ap and dual credits so I might be able to finish a semester faster, so my total loan would be 15k + 15k + 7.5 = 37.5k.

Thats 5k/year in savings. \n\n- If u can, start saving up for money. Get a job in the summer. Be financially literate. Read some books about personal finance, investing, business etc\n\n- Learn some side hustles. Since ur a cs major, look for local ppl wanting to make a website. I got paid some nice amount of money making a simple wordpress website. Did not have to write a single line of html css js. \n\n- Research scholarship opportunites. Start locally.

How many you apply to completely depends on where you live and how you did on your SATs. My very strong advice is to stay in-state, because out-of-state tuition is ridiculously expensive. \n\n3. Apply for the FAFSA. Do it around September or October of your senior year, whenever it opens up (it's first come, first served).This is where you will get your grants and loans. A grant is free money, a loan is money you have to pay back after you graduate.\n\n4. Look for scholarships. You probably think you don't qualify, but that's what I thought when applying for grants, and I did qualify. There aren't many opportunities in life where you're offered free money, but this is one of them.\n\nOther notes:\n\n* I love CS, but most people don't get their Masters. As I write this comment, my classmate next to me just told me she got hired as a software engineer (we're seniors). That's why. It's not really necessary, but hey, the tech industry changes so much that by the time you're a senior, it might be totally different. Just play it by ear.\n\n* Consider community college for your first 2 years. It is significantly cheaper and it's all the same in the end. It also gives you a chance to prove yourself in your GPA if your SATs come back and they aren't what you expected. The only downside is that you'll spend less time at university and it's less common that you'll join a fraternity, if that sort of thing interests you. \n\n", "author": "hatewrecked2", "created": 1549395259, "upvotes": 3}, "efte9f9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/anbv6u/how_does_college_work/efte9f9/", "text": "Nothing useful to add here, I'm just really happy to see I'm not the only one.

It might help you get a way better first job out of college, but IME, after your first job in CS, nobody cares where you went to school, nobody cares whether you have a Bachelor's or Master's.              \n              \nYour first job out of college you'll most likely get a whiteboard interview- they'll sit you down, give you a word problem, and you have to write out an algorithm in pseudo-code that solves the problem and matches whatever specifications they give (ie. \"this has to take less than linear time.\") Once you pass that, your foot's in the door and you can do basically whatever with a good recommendation from that first job. I know plenty of people who've gotten the interview even without a Bachelor's and gone on from there.           \n             \nIf you get well into CS though and find that you *really* enjoy the program, and you have the money to spare, then yeah go for a Master's. I don't think you should decide until you're in the 2nd or 3rd year of the program though; CS is definitely one of the most misunderstood majors. CS is about programming about as much as Astronomy is about telescopes. You gotta have big love for Computational Theory, processor architectures and abstract mathematics in general to go for the Master's.", "author": "TheGrimz", "created": 1549383486, "upvotes": 3}, "efsw257": {"link": "/r/college/comments/anbv6u/how_does_college_work/efsw257/", "text": "Go talk to your HS guidance counselor, they should be able to give you the complete hookup and give much more details specific to your situation than anyone here on reddit.  \n  In general, student loans are taken out by semester as needed, with the expectation that you will pay it back after your graduation. Usually you'll do something like pay the interest on your loan while in school, then have to start making the real payments a few months after graduation.  \n  If you miss a payment, you will be hunted and killed. /s Nah, some places have a one time forgiveness program, others don't. Worse case is your interest rate goes up a bit and your credit score takes it hit. Neither is very good, but you have an entire lifetime to make it up. Just do your best to make payments when required. Don't forget to budget to keep from coming up short every single month.   \n  Start applying for scholarships any time between now and until you graduate. All anyone can say is no. Your HS guidance should be a big help in finding scholarships as well as your adviser once you get into college. Some colleges even have a transfer adviser to help as well.  \n  I don't recommend shooting for the masters right out of the gate. Go and take a few classes first. Your masters can be completely unrelated to your bachelors, and you might find a different love along the way. Or you could get one semester in and realize that you hate CS and change majors - which is totally normal and OK.  \n  Scheduling in college is kind of up to you with respect to the times the school offers. You can go every day from 9 to 3 like HS, or do night class, or spread them out all day, or slam them all on Mondays and Wednesdays so you have Tuesday, and Thursday to Sunday off.", "author": "DaleGribble88", "created": 1549382432, "upvotes": 2}, "efspe1z": {"link": "/r/college/comments/anbv6u/how_does_college_work/efspe1z/", "text": "Student loans give you a set amount of money every semester based on the amount you qualify for after filling out FASFA. For scholarships check to see if your State has one based on your results in High School like HOPE in Georgia for example. For repayment typically you have a six month grace period after you graduate/ drop out before you have to start making payments. If you miss a payment there will probably be late fees and if you don't pay it for 270 days it goes into default. For a Master's Degree you can get loans but probably working for 4 years and then going would be a better option as you would have work experience already. Typically a grad student will be doing their own fair share of class work while also being a researcher or a TA for a class. It's also not unusual to see them teaching intro courses for Freshman.

I think you have a very good idea about what you want to do. I\u2019m on mobile, so sorry for bad formatting. Lets talk loans. The difference is price and financial aid. In order to get financial aid, you submit a fafsa. When you\u2019re admitted to the university you\u2019re going to, they will have a link you click to fafsa.gov. You sign up, do their fafsa form and bam, you\u2019re done with that. You do the fafsa once every semester. They will email you saying \u201chey we\u2019ll give you $5,000 for the year with barely any interest and you pay it back once you\u2019ve been completely done with your masters for 6 months out of school.\u201d financial aid is your best source in loans because it has a very low interest rate and they most likely have a 6 month grace period after you get your masters until you have to pay them back. This is usually the same with loans taken from a bank. If you take a loan from a bank, it\u2019s because tuition is too expensive to cover by only financial aid and your own money. You go to a bank website and apply for a loan, and you\u2019ll get it if you have a parent co-sign it, or if you have good credit. If you want to get good credit, apply for a credit card now, and then use it and pay it back ON TIME every month. Ask me if you have any other questions. Also, you take out the same kind of loans when you are completing your masters degree, although those classes are typically more expensive than undergrad, so you may end up taking out bigger loans. If you miss a payment on your loan, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re interest goes up or your co-signer has to help pay because they\u2019re responsible for it? I would assume the latter, the co-signer is responsible to pay if you had one. Not totally sure.\n\nNow scholarships, I unfortunately never did scholarships until now. Please do them! It\u2019s free money! Once you know what universities you\u2019re going to, you go to their website, click something along the lines of \u201cstudent\u201d then there should be a link that says \u201cscholarships\u201d if you can\u2019t find it, use the custom search bar. Then follow their instructions. That\u2019s about all I can help there.\n\nOnce you finish your bachelors, you will apply to the masters program in your field of computer science. They will admit x amount of students a semester. Assuming you are admitted, you will take classes harder than your undergrad classes. They are more expensive too. No differences in financial aid or loans from my knowledge. Just bigger to pay for the more expensive classes. You choose whether or not you want to study and have a job. If you can get a job with your bachelors degree, some companies will pay for your masters degree assuming they think you will stay with them. This might be rare though.\n\nYou had one more question about obtaining a bachelors. These programs work out as \u201cYou will do 120 total credits through your four years, and out of those 120, like 44 will be related to this bachelors degree\u201d a masters will be like \u201cthis is a 56 credit program completed in 2 years\u201d or something like that. You also have what\u2019s called \u201cgeneral education requirements\u201d this means you take classes like human geography, or intro to psychology, stuff that fulfills your requirements. They may be called \u201cEthical Citizenship\u201d and they\u2019ll have a list of classes you can take that will fulfill that requirement. It\u2019ll say something like take one or two of these classes to complete the Ethical Citizenship requirement.
