  "text": "So I have different opinions on the political spectrum and my teacher gives me a zero without any notes. I assume it\u2019s the political side I\u2019m taking, so I send a accusing email to her saying that\u2019s wrong. She replied that it\u2019s not because it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t publish it on blackboard. So she is going to talk to the department head soon. I apologize immediately and worried that something bad will happen and our relationship (teacher to student) will be ruined. How can I gain her trust and respect again. This is a mistake I\u2019ve made and I want to make it right.",

That's probably the best you can do. The relationship itself is, most likely, completely unsalvageable.",

That aside, this was a boneheaded and immature move. If you don't know why you got a particular grade, the adult, professional thing to do is *ask why,* not start lobbying accusations of misconduct. I cannot stress enough how bad of a move this was. \n\n>I apologize immediately and worried that something bad will happen and our relationship (teacher to student) will be ruined\n\nYour relationship with this professor is absolutely ruined. Depending on what you said in the email, there may very well be consequences with the department. You might be taken out of the class, or put on probation, made to attend professional conduct meetings, any number of consequences - it depends entirely on what your email looked like.",
