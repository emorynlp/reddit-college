  "text": "I\u2019ve never hosted a house party but now college has started and I got a place I want that shit to bounce and I want the music to be good.\n\nUnfortunately I haven\u2019t really kept up with the current trends and listened to what people are listening to now, since I mostly listen to frank ocean on my own time. I started going to parties and noticed it\u2019s a lot of trap and shit like that. I was indifferent to it but I still danced to it. \n\nI realized the stuff I\u2019d play at a party would likely be kind of outdated but you let me know what you think and what I should add.\n\nHere\u2019s the playlist so far:\n\nCollard Greens - SchoolBoyQ\n\nKush Coma - Danny Brown\n\nGloryUs - Chip Tha Ripper\n\nSend it up - Kanye West\n\nOne too many - Kaytranada\n\nOff the grid - Kanye\n\nWaves - Kanye\n\nDoses and Mimosas - cherub\n\nA mili - lil Wayne\n\nBackseat Freestyle - kdot\n\n\nIs it ass? What you think?",
