  "text": "I\u2019m outgoing and everyone is out partying. I\u2019m literally going alone to the parties tomorrow because no one wants to go with me. I have friends, but none of them check in on me or ask me to do anything. I always ask them how they are and if they want to eat. Is it too late to even find friends? Idk it really hurts at this point.",

Of course those friendships will be different from people you have only known for a short time. \n\nOne thing that helped me was to get involved in a club whose cause was important to me. It helped because I was focused on the issue and actively trying to make a difference \u2014 and I was surrounded by people with similar values. We bonded over shared activities, not just partying.",
