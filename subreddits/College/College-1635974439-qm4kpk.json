  "title:": "Admission for med school. I transferred classes from one school to another but have low gpa at new school.",
  "text": "Basically my question is that the classes I took at old school don\u2019t count towards gpa. So will my transcript have a gpa just from classes at my new school or will It include all classes regardless of where it came from when I apply to med school. Do I have to report the gpa? Or report on whatever is on my new school transcript. Worried since my gpa is low in my school but pretty good at my old school. How does this work?",

In addition, you must provide transcripts from each school you\u2019ve ever attended to AMCAS itself so they can verify that you indeed earned those grades. \n\nYour college GPA follows you around forever when it comes to US medical schools.",
