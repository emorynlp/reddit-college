  "text": "I\u2019m deep into my 3rd semester at a community college in California and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to pass my class. What are the consequences of dropping this late? \nSince I can\u2019t a W, what will appear on my transcript? \nHow will it affect my financial aid? Should I just take the D or F? \nAny feedback and opinions on what I should do are highly appreciated",

      "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure it will be a WF which is basically the same thing as an F. Pretty sure it won\u2019t hurt your GPA. But if you stick it through the semester, and get an F, that will hurt your GPA. With financial aid, you will have to talk to your school about it. If I was you, I would do the WF",

          "text": "There\u2019s a reason a withdraw date deadline exists. It depends on the school, but as a WF is like an F as you mentioned, it does negatively impact your GPA. \n\nDepending on the circumstance, OP is better off staying in the class and taking the L. Even reaching out to see if there\u2019s an opportunity to improve their grade, even slightly. Anything is better than a 0.",
