  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nMy college class (we are around 50) has all its classes together. Currently Covid is getting really bad where I live in Europe. Until Friday we only had 4 cases of Covid since the beginning of the academic year in October. Since then (as in in the past 2 days) we have gotten 9 new cases. The other 4 are out of quarantine. My college has this rule that all of our classes have a mandatory attendance. We have to wear N95 masks in class but it is still spreading like wildfire! They will not let us choose whether we attend the class in person or if we stay at home and follow the class via a livestream (which is what is done with the students in quarantine). \n\nMy question now is: How did your college/uni handle new cases? What do you think about our rules? What are the rules you have to follow because of Covid?",
