  "text": "So I am currently going to a local community college and would like too complete my associates there. I also on the other hand would like to get a completely separate degree. I work at starbucks and they offer free online college up to a bachelors from the University of Arizona. I was wondering if I went ahead and started that online college would I have to start over with all of the GEN ED or could my already earned credits be used at that college as well as the community college I am currently attending and I just do both. Thanks",
