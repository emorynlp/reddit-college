      "text": "The simple answer: no \n\n\nThe long answer for loan forgiveness: yes. \n\nThere are certain  programs that will pay off your student loans for you if you work with them for X amount of years but they will NEVER guarantee you a position. Your loans being paid off for you is only a conversation to be had once you are employed with the company/agency. The FBI for example will pay off your federal loans (60K cap) if you work there for 3 years.\n\nTo be frank: I would say 99% of companies do not care how much debt you compiled in order to land a job. Like another commenter said there are often choices like scholarships, grants and community college to lesser the amount.",
