According to my roommate (who is an RA), someone (who was an RA) in the past punched that hole due to stress and anger. She heard this from someone else. I tried to put in a maintenance request form through my dorm website. It is marked as complete but the hole is still in the wall. What do I do? Has this ever happen to anyone (and what did you do)?\n\nBTW: I put another maintenance request form for a shower issue a couple days later. It was fixed the next day.\n\nEdit:\nI put down that the walls might have asbestos even though I wasn't  sure about it.", "author": "Legolas0170", "created": 1632535022, "retrieved": 1632800347, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he8i6ep": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puxbqt/dorm_maintenance/he8i6ep/", "text": "Most educational institutions in North America will have a facilities department that will manage maintenance but their services are typically based on complaints from other staff and students.
