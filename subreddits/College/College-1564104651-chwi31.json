Your tutors/teachers are people not so different from yourself so if you enjoy their classes treat them as if it were you standing at the front of the room and don't be afraid to ask for advice as they were once in your position.\n2. People are shy and this shyness can lead to very quiet tutorials that are uncomfortable for everyone. Therefore, don't be afraid to speak up in class and ask questions even if it's scary at first as it will get the ball rolling and allow others to overcome the same fear.\n3. Attend all of your tutorials/classes and lectures! I don't care if it's easier to watch the recorded lectures in your own time because chances are that the time wont come. Attending tutorials is a great way to meet a variety of different people and find the ones you click with and they will keep you on track with your studies.\n4. Join a club or society you're interested in. This can help you meet people with common interests and find out what people like yourself do for fun.\n5. READ!! One of the best pieces of advice I have ever received was to read non-fiction books that interest me. Reading can really help with your writing and it also allows you to develop and critically reflect on yourself the world around you.\n6. Finally, I know it may be boring buuut... read the textbook. Although it may seem tempting to rely on the lectures for the course content there is only so much a powerpoint can educate. The earlier you push yourself to read the textbook, the easier assignments become and the faster you will be able to read.\n7. Finally, finally... read the referencing guide and practice correct referencing from your first assignment. It only gets easier and will save you from losing a lot of marks in the long term.\n\nFor the record, I'm only 20 and I still have much to learn but I  guarantee that this will make university/college a rewarding experience for you. I wish I had similar tips when I was new as it's been a bumpy road figuring it out for myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoodluck!!!", "author": "nickjcreed", "created": 1564317291, "upvotes": 1}, "ev34lq7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/chwi31/orientation_sucked/ev34lq7/", "text": "Orientation is just a show basically.

All y'all need to do with orientation is:\n\n1. Grin and bear it. I know it's stupid. There are a bunch of people in charge who have no idea what a good time looks like. Many of them are parents with kids 7 years younger than you, and they seem to think what their 11 year old finds fun is a good idea for you. Sound like what you experienced today? They do all this to make the main purpose (unsuccessfully) more palatable:\n\n2. Get what you need out of it. Walk around with your group and get acquainted with where you will be spending the next few years of your life. Ask questions when you can if you have them (and you should). Ask how long it takes to get from your first class to your second class on the other side of campus. Ask about what you need to know about parking your first few weeks (it will be terrible). Get familiar with how the rooms feel. Are they cold? Bring a hoodie your first day. Are they burning up? Still bring a hoodie, they may crank the AC. Ask the hours at the gym. If they don't mention a campus app, ask about it. \n\n3. Everyone was there today for #2. You are as likely to make awesome friends during orientation as you are in the line at a  Starbucks you visited once. It's possible, but unlikely. People are too focused on #2 and being forced to do #1.
