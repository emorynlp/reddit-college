  "title:": "Should I have a custom email signature as an undergrad?",
  "text": "I am in my 4th year of my undergrad, and going to be graduating with a bachelors in social work and communication studies. I\u2019ve been noticing multiple students with custom email signatures, which I have never thought of doing until now. \nI\u2019ve read that putting your bachelors degree in an email signature is unprofessional - but I have no idea what the proper signature would be. \nAn example of one of my peers\u2019 signatures I\u2019ve seen would be: \n\nJane Doe (she, her, hers)\nBachelor of Social Work (BSW)\nUniversity of Blank Class of 2022\nStudent Representative | Blank Association \njanedoe@blankuniversity.com\n\nIs this an acceptable signature to use? Should I even have a customized signature? I am going to be applying for internships and grad school soon, so I would love some feedback on this for insight in my future emails! Also, if it is proper to add your degree in a signature, how would I go about listing my BSW and BA? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "In general your email signature is there to let someone know how to contact you, or to whom they are talking (are you a sales rep from a publishing company or are you a chair in a similar department to me).  And helps people to address you properly in reply\n\nSo this should have your title (you don\u2019t have one because you havent graduated yet and a BSW isn\u2019t a title) and your contact info, your pronouns if you choose\n\nIt is not your resume\n\nIf you are emailing someone in your capacity as a student rep for X program, then you can include that in your signature.\n\nIf you are emailing a professor about a grade, or another school about transfer credits or whatever, it is kind of silly looking TBH.",
