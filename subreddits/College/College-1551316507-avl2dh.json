  "text": "Every semester is always the same for me. I start the semester off with an incredible amount of determination, swearing that I will be on top of all my work and such. Then, after a month or so, the laziness and procrastination kicks in, and I start falling off. Slowly, I start delaying my work and studying until the very last minute and find myself eventually being behind on the material for all of my classes. After that point I am just hoping that semester ends already, so I can get a fresh start and hope I'll be more studious next semester (hint: no I won't) . ",

I know some people will say just push through, but that can do a lot of damage to my mental health. Past couple year it's made depressed and mentally drained even after finals were over.

Productivity can be just as cyclical of a habit as laziness :) It always feels like a miracle when you get one step ahead of yourself. You can do it!!! :D",

You can get it done sooner, you're more relaxed while doing it, you can ask the professor when you're stuck (and they'll appreciate fielding questions when an assignment is new, rather than the day before it's due), and you can guarantee yourself a good grade. \n\nWhat I would say is that determination, inspiration, motivation -- these words mean nothing. It's nice to have motivation, but it won't last you 4 straight months. The only thing that ever matters in college is discipline. If you can work when you don't want to work and can manage your time accordingly, you'll go far in life. ",

Third, I started eating better and exercising more, which have helped me with my overall mental health too, which I think was a huge part of my procrastination problem.

I write this on my whiteboard weekly and this lets me physically see how much work I have to complete each day to stay on track. It usually turns out I have less work than I had imagined and the small chunks of work seem very doable.
