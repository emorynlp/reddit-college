  "text": "# My girlfriend and I live on campus. She is never able to spend anytime on campus because her family makes her go home all the time. She spend most every weekend and some week days at home to see her family. She goes back home because her family still expected her to do thing like take her younger sister to school, entertain her, watch the dog, and have dinner with her dad some nights among many many other things. All this seems to be effecting her social life, grades and health.  She is almost always tired and busy. She skip her morning classes a lot because she was busy catching up on things the night before that she missed because she was away with her family. Also for selfish reasons why I what her on campus more, I kinda want to see my girlfriend more. It make me sad to see her tired all and busy all the time. It also make me made that her family seems to guilt her into to doing it. Every time I say \"you should just say no I can't come home\", she say that \"she would feel guilty for saying no.\"  My question to you all is. Is it normal to go home so often even if she does not want too? Am I right for wanting her to spend more time on campus? If so, what can we do about it?",
