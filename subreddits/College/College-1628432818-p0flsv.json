      "text": "I am graduating from Penn State an entire year early this morning. Writing this right before I go to get ready. When Covid started I was only half way through my sophomore year, and it has been 1.5 years since I had an in person class. \n\nLast night I got to reminisce with my family, and we all got a chance to be upset. My Dad feels that I was robbed and I think I do too, but literally the only thing you can say is \"it is what it is.\" I got 2 years of an experience, which is more than some. Your college experience is once in a lifetime, yes, but it's also what you make of it. Some people who hated every single day of college graduate and move on to LOVE their jobs, have great families, or just find something else that satisfies what they need to be happy. Don't be discouraged, I don't regret graduating early- I'm excited to go out and find what makes me happy in life (or happier than sitting at a computer taking classes during Covid). If this experience is that important to you- take a pause. If you want to roll the dice and get started on life a little earlier- do it. Life will go on and the world will keep spinning. \n\nGood luck!",

A lot of other schools are opening back up this semester, but mine isn\u2019t. Apparently we can go back next semester not this one despite the vaccine being available. We were asked to take a survey, and I feel like the faculty/staff just don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to return to campus so us students just have to be really inconvenienced. I spoke to a couple of other students, and we all are annoyed about not being able to return to campus. Some of us don\u2019t have quiet environments, or dedicated space for studying so this is really frustrating. I guess I will have to work with what I have.",

To top it off, my school let up covid rules a bit for the summer, but then just changed back due to the variant.  It feels like this is just a waiting game that never ends.\n\nBut on the other hand, I don\u2019t know what else I would do because of safety restrictions.  I don\u2019t know where else I would live because I certainly don\u2019t want to go home.  Life is so short and if I took time off I couldn\u2019t do much of what I want to.  I couldn\u2019t travel, work a job I like (no degree yet,) be with friends, etc.\n\nIf I have to spend another year in this stupid waiting game, I guess I\u2019d rather it be with the few friends I do have, some sort of structure on my laptop, and a half assed college experience.  Unfortunately it feels like a losing game on both sides.",

While it was a relief in some ways, no commute, less scheduled class meetings, no downtown parking fees, I felt like you, that some of my experience was stolen from me. Many of my friends graduated, dropped out, or transferred, and I didn't get to say goodbye. Because of all the funky pandemic arrangements for the commencement ceremonies I only knew maybe one person that I walked in graduation with, and she wasn't even really my friend.\n\nI wouldn't blame you if you took some time off. Just remember if you've got student loans, you have to start paying them once you've been out of school for six months--so if you're in that boat, maybe just reduce your course load and knock out the online classes that'd probably be just as boring if you took them on campus.",

So much so that I had to write an appeal just to get my loans back because of my low SAP (Satisfactory Academic Progress). Right now my university is still saying in-person classes with masks which I'm fine with. However, there's nothing being said about what the university will do with the rising Covid numbers in Louisiana (I'm located in the southern-bayou region). I have a very strong feeling that a lot of universities are going to trap us into this semester. Face-to-face classes have been advertised heavily for this Fall 2021 semester so enrollment numbers have increased again. I think if my university does switch back to completely virtual like Spring 2020, they will do so after the 14th day of classes i.e. the last day we can full drop out without having to pay the fees for classes. They frankly just want their enrollment numbers up and more importantly our money. \n\nThis semester might really suck, but for those who are trying their hardest to muscle through it, I wish you the absolute best of luck.\n\nTL;DR... Take your time off. Go work and save up some money. Enjoy some adulthood. Colleges are probably pulling us back in to steal our money before we switch back to completely virtual.",

      "text": "I have earned roughly 75% of all my credits off campus. I live 2.5 hours away from my campus so I couldn\u2019t see anyone in person or participate in any major clubs. \n\nI really regret that I did not take a gap year. My college told us they would decide whether or not to have typical, normal in person classes less than two weeks before the semester began, after they had several months of deliberation to decide. Online classes only (for the first semester, didn\u2019t decide on the second semester until much later). I decided to save money and stay home. \n\nMy grades have dropped, my mental state is a mess, I\u2019ve lost sleep, all coursework has lost its importance, I haven\u2019t seen any of my friends in person, my eating habits are a mess, and I\u2019ve gained weight. However, the worst thing of all was that I have lost passion for my major (engineering), something I have wanted to do (and have worked to become) since I was 4 years old. \n\nIf the delta variant causes another year-long \u201ctwo-week\u201d lockdown I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do, I will be completely devastated. But I don\u2019t think I am capable of crying for myself. I think I\u2019ll want to demand a total refund for the year and take the gap year I need, but my school is greedy. \n\nWhen people decided that they would go home for COVID, my school didn\u2019t give refunds everyone was forced to go home. They didn\u2019t give students a financial break when they were forced home, in spite of the fact that many people\u2019s family\u2019s had lost their jobs and the fact that they no longer had to pay to maintain the campus as if students were still there. They laid off many workers. They charged full price for everything when students came back on campus despite the fact that many facilities, such as dining halls, were an understaffed shell of what they once were (with even worse food). They gave students no academic aid when we switched to zoom, in spite of the fact that teachers and students had never used that platform before. They gave no mental help despite the fact that many students were facing such great, incomparable adversities that came with love ones getting COVID, moving back to an overcrowded apartment, being in a place with no space to do your work, and honestly just existing with this change. All this in spite of the fact that my university can survive off of endowment alone. It makes me sick\n\nStudents tried their best. (Most) Teachers really tried. However, Universities never tried at all.",

The only problem with that is that it is 100% different for everyone. Saying you feel like you are missing it really just comes down to you feel like you can not do X. If that is networking, go out and network. If it's hands on class things, go do those things.\n\nI realize that it may not always be possible as situations change, but to make a statement with no actions behind it where one tried to find some way to learn hands on or network with local professionals or professors I feel like it comes down to not completely looking at the situation and making the best of it. Ofc there was really no info on the post anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all of this I also have to agree that again, one may not want to do any of that, but instead want what they imagined before. And yeah, that sucks. No way around it.\n\nBut, the point of thinking back to just sitting in a room and having it \"stolen\" from you I feel is a bit of an immature statement.\n\nNo one is keeping anyone hostage, and at least from my experience and what I have seen, there are still a lot of ways to get a lot of what was in college if not more. Just have to be willing to cold call/ meet people and feel awkward for a bit.\n\nI can agree with other facts that make online worse such as paying the same prices and stuff. But the points OP made I feel can be remedied by just having a bit of a go get spirit. (and stressing again that it can all depend on situation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd again, I want to stress that this could all depend on where OP is as I am looking at it from my locality and knowledge. For all I know OPs entire city is still fairly locked down, no campus visitation, and businesses are still all majorly closed or at home. In which case yeah, sucks a lot. If you really want the experience I would say wait until you can get it or move to a place that has it.",

I wanted it but I wasn't pushing for it, it was like I expected it to just be handed to me- like how things were done in high school. So my Dad was the one taking care of the financial aid application. Well, he forgot some documents and by the time it was brought to our attention, there wasn't enough time to have it properly processed with the correct documents- so I had to drop all my classes. \n\nI was definitely bummed out at the time but it worked out for me in the end though because I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to study. But having those years to experience working in the real world, getting to mature more by experiencing that reality, having time to find my interests and hobbies, has been so beneficial for me. Now I know generally what I want and have a purpose in what I'm studying. \n\nAnd not that I wouldn't have taken my studies serious before, but I definitely feel more motivated to take them seriously now since I do have that purpose. Whereas before, I was mostly looking forward to the parties and social aspects of college. Now I can see the benefits of having a higher education clearly which make me want to succeed. \n\nActually, I've found a lot of comfort in reading some articles online that discuss all the benefits of going back to college at an older age. It's all been a big motivator for me- you should look it up just to see where the people who go back to college later in life are coming from.",

Because you'll gain a ton of real life experience that you can utilize and apply to college whenever you go back. Plus you'll be making $$$! \n\nWith that being said, gap years aren't for everyone. My grandma was always telling me for the years I was out of school, \"the longer you stay out, the harder it is to go back.\" That's always a risk to take into consideration. I can personally say that this is somewhat true but if you're strongly motivated to get your degree, it really shouldn't affect you that much as long as you always have that long term goal in mind. \n\nBut I would seriously recommend you do some research to see all the potential benefits of taking a gap year. Maybe you could just plan on doing a gap semester to see how you like it before deciding to make it a full year. I think it's nice to have a break though- experience some other things and learn what life is actually like for the working class.",

Rewrite the points you're still having trouble remembering or understanding. Read those notes outloud.\n\nWash, rinse, repeat.\n\nThose practices are your bread and butter as they use at least three different kinds of memory. These things also help cement your understanding:\n\nExplain it to a friend or classmate.\n\nGet someone to quiz you.\n\nGet someone to debate with you.\n\nWatch YouTube videos about it.\n\nLook for other sources that explain things more simply than your required reading or your professor.\n\nSeek tutoring. Most campuses offer a free or low-cost option.\n\nPro-tips:\n\nTake the class online. You can Google test answers on your phone, use a calculator, etc. Proctoring for tests is a joke for most online classes.\n\nPay an English major to write the damn essay for you--or just to edit it.\n\nSparkNotes is your friend. EssayShark is a ripoff.\n\nIf you don't wanna read the book, watch the movie and look for online resources detailing the differences between the movie and the book, which is easy because nerds love complaining about this. You can also listen to an audiobook on 1.5x or even 2x speed if you're in a time crunch.\n\nPhotomath (FREE) and other apps can solve complex math problems and show you step-by-step how to get the correct answer. You won't learn anything if you let it do all the work for you and don't take the time to go through the steps of the problem, and it will bite you in the ass on test day.",

They help if you have a tendency to write long, complicated, rambling sentences or sentence fragments. They can also help you improve clarity and catch sentence structure errors that grammar apps often miss.\n\nIn the editing industry, copy/line editing is more expensive than proofreading, which is dirt cheap. Punctuation rules are more formulaic than sentence structure issues, which makes copy editing--and programming copy editing software--more complicated, time-consuming, and thus costly.\n\nI recommend spending the money on the extra features if you're writing your thesis, dissertation, or any writing you intend to publish, but not for your undergrad essays--unless you struggle with the issues above, in which case it's worth it.\n\nConfession: I pay for Hemingway and use it and Grammarly when editing for paying clients. Why make my job more complicated? I still read through the text to make sure I don't miss anything, of course, but it saves time and helps me avoid missing things by acting like a second set of eyes.",
