Your college experience is once in a lifetime, yes, but it's also what you make of it. Some people who hated every single day of college graduate and move on to LOVE their jobs, have great families, or just find something else that satisfies what they need to be happy. Don't be discouraged, I don't regret graduating early- I'm excited to go out and find what makes me happy in life (or happier than sitting at a computer taking classes during Covid). If this experience is that important to you- take a pause. If you want to roll the dice and get started on life a little earlier- do it.
