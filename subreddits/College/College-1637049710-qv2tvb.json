  "text": "What do you think about dating in different years? Such as a freshman and a senior? If it were you, would you continue to build the relationship or completely remove yourself from it (knowing that the senior will graduate, leaving the freshman)? Would you date them knowing the relationship will end at a certain date (expiration date)?",

I don\u2019t think you could even call it a relationship at that point because it\u2019s like dating to break up? Sort of phony imo. \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re in this situation or if it\u2019s just a hypothetical question but if you\u2019re morally able to have a fwb situation you should pursue that rather than starting an actual relationship because people can fall hard and it\u2019s so unnecessary to go through heartbreak you can avoid",
