  "text": "Both of these majors are not offered as a minor, and they're in the same school at my university. I can't decide between them. If anyone happens to have an opinion that'd be cool. (I'm also thinking about minoring in poli sci, Spanish, or both.)",

I'm a freshman so I do have plenty of time to explore more in-demand majors before going for the whole degree but honestly I can't think of what else I would do lol. But you're definitely right about what you're saying. If you have any ideas of stuff similar to any of the majors/minors/subjects I listed though feel free to toss them at me.",

              "text": "Remember you can always transfer for a different major. Don't limit yourself and do some research into different majors. Use other colleges, bigger colleges especially, websites and just go through their lists of majors and see if anything pops out. You don't actually have to go to those universities, just use the list as a resource for discovering majors. I was an urban planning major and am now a forestry major, two majors a lot of people don't even know exist.",

      "text": "This is completely dependent on your career interests. Journalism is great for developing your writing and people skills as a whole, but PR will teach you how to write for PR (pitches, press releases, etc) and how to develop campaigns.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure of which one you want to go into, it\u2019s usually easier for journalists to switch to PR than the opposite. In fact, many journalism majors I know have also gotten internships for social media and communications, but most PR people tend to stick to PR/comms/marketing.",
