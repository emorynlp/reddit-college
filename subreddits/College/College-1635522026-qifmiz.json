  "text": "Ive never been good at research but i have to for a speech im trying to write. I have to have 3 sources not sourced from the internet (database will work) and these are tricky. On top of that it is an argument speech and most things about my topic i have found are just analysis of it and facts. Im not good at using the college database to find scholarly sources and i have so much anxiety right now. Anytime i do try and search with it i get things that are not academic or mention my word i searched once and have nothing to do with it. Do you have any tips for using databases or any other places i can find scholarly sources.",
