  "text": "I just took my second midterm for calculus and I think I\u2019m going to fail. This is my 3rd time taking calculus (first two attempts were online) and I think I\u2019m going to fail. This time around I don\u2019t know what to do to improve. This professor has two midterms and a final. Each exam has 5-10 questions. I always feel like I have a good understanding until the test. I have a private tutor, I talk to both the professor and TA, I go to the math center on campus, watch organic chem tutor/khan academy videos, do all the homework and then some. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I changed my entire major so I wouldn\u2019t have to take calculus 2.",

I\u2019d go back and learn graphing, factoring, logs etc like the back of your hand. You can\u2019t afford to get lost in the algebraic weeds once you take higher level math or you\u2019ll lose sight of what you\u2019re actually trying to accomplish.",

Hes a pretty bright individual so, fuck calc. I\u2019m currently failing calc 1 also. Maybe I\u2019ll cheat the system somehow. idk. but again, fuck calc",

If I had to give some tips I would say\n\nFurther develop your visual understanding.\n\nMemorise how the exercises are often solved because sometimes they are standard. This will do if you're not going to do higher level maths.\n\nDo many practice problems on paper.\n\nYou're probably already doing those things, anyways, hope you are able to pass.",
