Correct. But now I have to read three more books and another assignment because of one \u201cfree\u201d day. Besides that the workload is crazy. Why do you assume we have so much more time ?? I\u2019m sitting in front of Zoom classes and then do assignments and then go to bed. Okay whatever it is what it is. But stop saying \u201cyou have more time because of Zoom classes\u201d. Nah.

Anti-cheating measures: In order to cut down on cheating, faculty have been encouraged to increase the number of small assignments, larger projects, and more comprehensive, open-book exams. This is largely coming from the administration.\n\n2.) Increased coursework:  Increased coursework, especially small stakes assignments, is a product of student complaints over exams and essays worth 30% or more. Students don't like being evaluated on the basis of a few major items, which makes it difficult to recover from a bad grade. This is mainly coming from student reviews.\n\n3.) The Challenges of Working from Home: Students are generally bad at managing their time/working from home, and what might normally take 90 minutes in person, takes much longer online. \n\nFor example, in a 90 minutes lecture, students are forced to pay attention and learn much more than when they multi-task and \"watch\" lectures at home. This causes them to have to re-watch content and eats up more time. Also, while I normally would give a pop quiz at the end of the lecture that students write and forget, when the same quiz is assigned online it becomes another item to worry about and complete later.", "author": "TheProfessorsCat", "created": 1622672929, "upvotes": 4}, "h0d9n9f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nqk28p/dear_professors_i_do_not_have_more_time_to_do/h0d9n9f/", "text": "My english professor said he was forced to give us work that equaled a certain amount of time minus the zoom class period.
