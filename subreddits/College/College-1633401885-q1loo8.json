  "title:": "Is dropping out of college a wasted opportunity?",
  "text": "I'm a Freshman at a well-known university in the U.S. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to attend here on what is basically a full ride. That being said, I think attending this school has definitely made me regret other opportunities that I could have taken when deciding what to do post-high school. Everyone at this school is practically a genius and I feel like I can't keep up with the workload without sacrificing my mental health. I failed my first Chemistry Midterm with a 52% and all my other classmates are complaining about their above 80 percent grades. I'm making my best effort to study but It's difficult to learn how to study effectively. Additionally, it doesn't help that the school culture here is so focused on studying 24/7, this makes me feel inclined to study all the time, but even the thought of studying makes me wanna put off this difficult task even more. \n\nEver since I've arrived here in August I've made very few friends. Although I've met a few people, I have little connection with them and it seems like most only brag about their accomplishments or the difficulty of the classes they're taking. I have thought about joining clubs, but with the stress of classes already on my shoulders, I don't think joining any is the best choice for me right now. \n\nI'm glad to be at the university as a first-generation student in order to make my parents proud, but I feel miserable here and was considering dropping out or transferring into a trade school or local university where I live. (Or taking a gap year). Considering the cost, I don't think it will be too much of a difference when dropping out. However, I will lose the opportunity to study at a great university with little to no debt. \n\nEvery day seems like I'm destined to fail here and I feel no motivation to do better. I'm only at this college to survive and hopefully get a piece of paper that allows me to be somewhat employable. Ever since I've been here, I've felt little joy and wish I should have thought about this college thing more carefully instead of being focused on what would please my parents. I want to tell them, but I have a feeling they'll say dropping out will be a wasted opportunity due to my lack of motivation. Has anyone felt similar or dealt with these thoughts before?",

      "text": "Many people on here would disagree, but I would recommend sticking with it and giving it a solid shot before giving up what appears to be a full ride scholarship.  If you don\u2019t like it after two semesters, then I would consider dropping out or transferring.  I promise everyone is in the same boat as you; I know I was my freshman year.  You don\u2019t have to study 24/7 to be successful, but college will test your boundaries with time management. I know it\u2019s hard now, but try to look ahead and ask yourself if your decision will get you where you want to be.\n\nI wish all the best for you!",

I guess I'd have to find a really good reason to take a gap year.",

I barely even processed that I\u2019m legit in college because it feels like we\u2019re just here and then people form their own communities like its not one school. Idk if you feel this or even are at the same place haha but just wanted to give my input. Nvm you\u2019re not at my uni. But best of luck to you!

However, I think switching to a local college may offer me to be in a less stressful/over competitive environment than I am in right now. I'm not saying the college I transfer to will be easier than the one I'm in now, but it will be a lot more manageable in terms of my mental health and the right amount of academic challenge. However, I'm judging a lot of these assumptions based on friends currently at that school. I would like to shadow or take a tour of what the campus culture is like before transferring. I think that was one of the mistakes I made when initially deciding on my college. I'm only attending my current school because they offered me the most money and I wanted the prestigious title (Which reflecting back seems really shallow.) Thank you for the comment!",
