  "text": "I'm newish to Reddit in general so forgive me if this isn't the place. I have to do a project about the spread of false news. Not sure if this is where I should be requesting a favor or if anyone can point me in the right direction. The first portion is easy.... Starting now, I need to time how fast it would take to receive 100 selfies (personal message is probably best but whatever works), your face can be blurred out but needs to show a human holding a piece of paper so it's clear that I'm not taking 100 photos of different pieces of paper myself, and all the paper needs to say is today's date and \"Hi Blake\" - which is me. Again, faces can be blurred out but I need to be able to show its not repeats of the same person lol. If this isn't the place, apologies in advance.\n\nThank you",
