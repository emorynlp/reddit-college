  "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore. I\u2019m in engineering school, which I knew was going to be an extreme amount of work, but I never imagined that I would struggle as much as I am now.\n\nI got a test grade back today and found that I got a 55. This was one I studied for as well, going over notes and doing the practice exam.\n\nIn another class, this one a programming class, I had a decently-weighted programming assignment due this past Friday, and had to turn it in with a 65 because I simply couldn\u2019t figure anything out to get higher than that.\n\nI was a consistent A student in high school, with the occasional B. While I wasn\u2019t expecting myself to maintain that level in college, I never would have imagined having to worry about whether or not I would pass my classes. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Am I not built for this, or is it just that I\u2019m overreacting (I\u2019ve had anxiety issues in the past)?",

      "text": "I'm a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering at a STEM majority university. Take what happened on the chin, but don't beat yourself more than you probably already have.\n\nEngineering is a hard field for a reason. You're being trained into a professional who needs to know what they're doing. Exams are going to be tough because you need to understand fully. Now that you know it is difficult, adapt to it. You probably have a general sense of the \"style\" of exams your professor(s) give, so study accordingly to it. Please ask your classmates (who are probably struggling as well) if you need help. Better yet, go to your professor or TA's office hours if you need help. Don't be afraid, it is your job to learn, and their job to teach.",

If you got distracted, and \u2018sorta\u2019 did the work: do you have a passion for the field, and harder work will result in better results (that you really want) ? Maybe it is for you, and you had a bad week (or month). Even the most kindly of internet strangers can\u2019t tell you the truth of this one; I wish you the best, though.",
