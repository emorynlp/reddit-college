Luckily, it was a false alarm. I decided to go to sleep at 3am because my earliest class is at 2pm. But apparently SOMONE didn't learn this lesson and THE GODDAMN ALARM WENT OFF AT 5:30AM!!! Needless to say, I'm tired at and am going to drink multiple cups of coffee today. So guys, please be safe. Or the alarms are faulty. Either way, fuck this shit\n\nEdit: It has come to my attention that vape doesn't always set off the alarms (it depends on which alarms your hall uses), so I'm sorry about this misinformation. In my hall, the fire alarms do react to the vapor, and I assumed that all do. But still, make sure you use your appliances RESPONSIBLY because you can ruin the night for everyone if you don't.", "author": "Isekai_Trash_uwu", "created": 1598270172, "retrieved": 1632802074, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1185, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g34c6mx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ifnjvk/for_the_love_of_everything_dont_vape_in_your_dorm/g34c6mx/", "text": " Thanks for sharing your experience.
