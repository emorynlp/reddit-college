  "text": "Today, our alarms went off at around 10:30pm and I thought it was just a drill until I saw the fire truck. Luckily, it was a false alarm. I decided to go to sleep at 3am because my earliest class is at 2pm. But apparently SOMONE didn't learn this lesson and THE GODDAMN ALARM WENT OFF AT 5:30AM!!! Needless to say, I'm tired at and am going to drink multiple cups of coffee today. So guys, please be safe. Or the alarms are faulty. Either way, fuck this shit\n\nEdit: It has come to my attention that vape doesn't always set off the alarms (it depends on which alarms your hall uses), so I'm sorry about this misinformation. In my hall, the fire alarms do react to the vapor, and I assumed that all do. But still, make sure you use your appliances RESPONSIBLY because you can ruin the night for everyone if you don't.",

An easy method to help you if you want to smoke or vape is to take a plastic bag and a clothes hanger and put the bag over the detector and then the hanger over the detector so it holds the bag in place.

I'm not sure exactly how these work, I just know it has something to do with the electrical current.\n\nThen you have photoelectric smoke detectors, which are used on like airplanes, for example. These don't actually detect smoke, they have a small light sensor, which can be interrupted by *any* particulates in the air, given enough density (so probably not dust, unless you're dusting for the first time in a decade, but yes it will vape clouds. It will detect particulate that we can't see, so it will absolutely detect particulate we can).\n\nThere are smoke detectors that use both as well, called dual detectors. \n\nI would *guess* most universities probably use the same ionization ones you would find in most housing complexes, which wouldn't detect vapor. but schools/RAs/whatever probably either a) assume it detects vapor as well, and pass that wrong info to students unknowingly or b) know that it doesn't but tell students that it does while hoping that most won't take the risk to find out because they don't want complaints when cloud chasers stink up a dorm with strawberry kiwi scent 24/7.\n\nFYI, I'm very pro vape, I vaped for several years and it has been a strong part of my livelihood for the last decade-ish... and I feel other pro vape people about to get mad at me for saying that it can stink up a dorm. Stealth vapes that are designed for higher nic strengths and smaller clouds won't, but yes, when you buy huge ass box mods and make the biggest clouds you can in an enclosed space for an extended period of time, it will eventually start to make it smell. It might be a more pleasant scent than cigarettes, but that doesn't make it non-existent.",
