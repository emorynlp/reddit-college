This spring I'm going to fly back east, get a rental car and hit up some amusment parks like Busch Gardens, Kings Dominion, Carrowinds. I might push that to the summer though depending on when the parks are open. I want to drive over to the Oregon coast again and check out some of the volcanoes over there too. But yeah, for the most part I just work more hours so I can continue to pay for school without debt.",

My former boss told me to call him two weeks before the current semester ends so that he can work me into the schedule for holidays shifts at the whiskey bar and restaurant i used to work at. I got along/ get along very well with management at the establishment. Minimum wage at the establishment is close to $15.50 / hour and the tips are pretty insane ($800-$1500 every two to three weeks when business is good).\n\nI am using much of what i made at my job toward tuition costs. It will be the same story for whatever money i make over the Christmas holiday. My tuition is $36,718/ year and it is broken down into three payments. My Dad and i have a deal worked out when it comes time to pay a tuition installment.",
