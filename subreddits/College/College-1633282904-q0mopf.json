  "text": "I dropped out of the same college twice. It's a top tier college but I hated it. \n\nThe first time I dropped out was because I was done with school, done with my course, I hated the uni, hated the cohort and it was a really passive aggressive way of rebelling against my parents. \n\nThe second time I dropped out was because I changed courses, but realized that we had to write essays in a certain way to obtain grades. That isn't the college education I imagined or signed up for. That is \\[insert a suitable word\\]. (Censorship?)\n\nA lot of people tell me I'm stupid or entitled for dropping out of a top college- I don't think it's that hard to get in because of the range of test scores. \n\nWas I being petty or dumb about it?",

      "text": "It\u2019s immature. You didn\u2019t appreciate what you had when there are tens of thousands of people who would love to be in your position. And you didn\u2019t drop out once but twice. Why would you screw yourself over to rebel against your parents when your an adult who can make there own decisions? That\u2019s not rebelling that\u2019s stupid. \n\nIf you were done with school and were tired of it then you take a break not throw it away. Or transfer to a different university and keep learning.  And to drop out because you dont like the way the course works? Believe it or not the world doesn\u2019t care what you like or don\u2019t like. Are you going To walk out of a job when they ask you to write professionally? Or are you going to quit a job when they have something that isn\u2019t catered to you?",

      "text": "To put it politely, yes, your decisions weren\u2019t the brightest reasons to drop out. You had the opportunity to get a good that millions are dying to get. And you gave it all up just to rebel against the system, and for what? \n\nIn the end, what benefit did you gain? Your first reason, fair enough. But dropping a second time just because you didn\u2019t like the work you had to do for a specific course? Couldn\u2019t you have just dropped that course alone or enrolled in another class? \n\nIt sounds like these decisions were made impulsively. If college isn\u2019t for you, fair enough. But you\u2019re going to have to mature a bit and learn to do things that you don\u2019t want to do because employers aren\u2019t going to put up with this sort of behavior.",

      "text": "Yes. It definitely seems entitled to drop out every time you have a tiny problem. The thing is, even if you graduate and get your dream job, there's gonna be *something* you don't like. That's part of adult life, and part of growing up is learning to pick your battles and deal with the little things.\n\n\nPlus, you're not achieving anything here. Your cohort and professors won't care if you drop out, other than the initial \"well that sucks, hope he's okay,\" so you're not hurting them. You're not changing the college's policies dropping out; if it's a solid program, they're getting money either way. Your parents may care, but they aren't the ones losing out on opportunities from *you* neglecting your professional development. Literally the *only one* you hurt here is yourself. If you don't think college is for you, that is what it is, but make that decision in an informed, mature way, not as some childish, pissy, ***misguided*** attempt to get back at someone else.",

It just sounds like you were never really into the idea of college and that\u2019s completely fine, but in this case where you\u2019re going back and dropping out again maybe not so much. Are some things that we have to do in college dumb? Absolutely. Do I wish that they\u2019d change things? Hell yeah. However, I think it\u2019s dumb to drop something at any really MINOR inconvenience, cause in reality and it\u2019s pessimistic but a realistic perspective, life sucks. Life is hard as fuck, but you can\u2019t just give up. If you spend a little time at it and then decide it\u2019s not for you or you can\u2019t stand it anymore then that\u2019s valid, at least you tried.",

I knew what colleges wanted me to write about and I wasn\u2019t about all that bullshit so I didn\u2019t do it. At the end, I am the one that lost. While you are not wrong that a lot of things about college are ridiculous, rebelling against it will only hurt you. Get your degree and move on",
