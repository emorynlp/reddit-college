  "text": "Hi all, essentially I am trying to get approval from my college to take calculus 1 next semester. For context, I have previously taken AP calculus 1 at my highschool and did well in the course. However I got a 2 on the AP test, so I\u2019m trying to redo the class to ensure I have a good foundation as I move in to higher level math courses. My school keeps saying that I need to have a 3 on the ap calc test in order to take the ap calc class. My understanding is that my highschool ap calc 1 and college calc 1 should be approximately the same, and that I should therefore be perfectly qualified to take calc 1 given that I am essentially retaking a class. Am I being unreasonable in wanting to take calculus 1? I have another meeting with my academic advisor tomorrow, so hopefully I can get approved for the course then. \n(I am unsure if this qualifies as \u201coverly specific\u201d in the rules. If so I apologize)",
