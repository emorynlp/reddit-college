This is a community college.\n\nedit: someone in the comments mentioned how vague this was so im just gonna add what i sent to them\n\nMy accounting instructor has been difficult with us, and when the class presented issues we had he blamed us for said issues. For example, he assigned chapter one homework, chapter one quiz, then the exam (on chapters one and two) and then chapter two homework, then the chapter two quiz. We expressed that this was not an effective way of learning. He again blamed us for having an issue with this. I am frustrated for my classmates and I because this is simply not working. I was hoping to be able to switch to another instructor or the class that does not meet with another instructor because I do not want to fail this class. I wish I could to spend all of my time trying to work on this class but Im taking seven other classes and this one is not working for me. With my ADHD, I cant learn by jumping around in lessons like taking the exam before learning the material. We had a long discussion in class but he did not record it. We do not feel that we got anywhere with this conversation. And it is not that we are not doing the work, we even have a study group.\nthis class is not his priority. He runs a small buisness so he \"doesnt have the time\".", "author": "fr8g_", "created": 1632267599, "retrieved": 1632800958, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hdswwns": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psv3au/professor/hdswwns/", "text": "If he's testing stuff that hasn't been taught yet and refusing to change that, you need to escalate this to the department head.", "author": "ResidentNo11", "created": 1632280944, "upvotes": 1}, "hds6ri0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psv3au/professor/hds6ri0/", "text": "This is vague.
