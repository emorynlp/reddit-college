  "text": "Hi everybody!\n\nI'm currently a first semester sophomore at William and Mary.  I know a long post would probably be annoying so I'm going to list reasons for staying or transferring below. I sent in my application for next semester at UVA. Feel free to comment your opinion on this and if you transferred I'd love to hear your story. \n\n**Questions for Transfer student:**\n\n\\- How did you know you wanted to Transfer?\n\n\\- Were you sure about transferring or on the fence?\n\n\\- What has your experience been moving to a new school kinda late?\n\n**My Situation:**\n\n\\- I study A LOT and have very little time to even work out, which is something I love to do\n\n\\-I'm not unhappy here but I'm not really happy either. I feel, at best, very lukewarm about being here.\n\n\\- I don't know if I want to go through being a new student again and having to make new friends\n\n\\- I'm gay (but can pass as straight) and there's literally nobody here that I have a crush on but UVA has hella heads there that are fine\n\n\\- I feel like I'll have a better balance of work and school, more time to explore myself and my interests\n\n\\- I genuinely don't know if this is a situation where \"the grass is greener on the other side\" and I'm simply romanticizing what could have been\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading and I would really, really appreciate any feedback or stories about your transfer experience, especially if you transferred to UVA or another big state school.",

              "text": "While history still requires a lot of memorization it\u2019s not as bad as stem. How many credit hours do you plan on taking/ are currently taking? The general rule of thumb is that for every credit hour you will spend about 3 hours a week studying or doing homework. If your taking 15 credits a semester (graduation in 4 years) you should spend around 45 hours a week studying. Ontop of that if your working 15-20 hours a week then you will have very little free time regardless of whatever college you go to.",
