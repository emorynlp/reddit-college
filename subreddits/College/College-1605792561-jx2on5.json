I also thought it would feel better to withdraw than to try and fail the courses. I actually ended up dropping out of the school entirely because I needed the time off, but I\u2019m graduating this semester in a new degree that I loved! After talking to your professors and seeing your options, make the decision that feels best for you. You\u2019re not alone and you\u2019re not a failure if you decide to withdraw  from any/all courses. You\u2019re doing your best with the time, resources, and mental energy you got.

I thought I could do it because that's what I would do if things were normal. During the first week (orientation, discussion of syllabus, etc) I realized I couldn't. I'm not depressed (well, I think I'm not) but it was so hard for me to handle all those classes and it was equally as hard to drop a few. I've never even thought of dropping a class before because I absolutely dread the idea of graduating a year late but I didn't take into account the situation that we're in now and the emotional and mental stress that the pandemic has given all of us. It took me a lot of crying, sleepless nights, talks with my mom, and emails with my professors before I decided to drop 2 classes. I wish I just didn't enroll this semester at all, though, because now (about 3 months in) my mental health is at its worst. I can't focus, I don't talk to anyone anymore, and I'm a bit behind on my requirements. I'm miserable but I'm also too scared to drop everything. \n\nSo please, prioritize yourself. I think it's better to finish a little bit later than have failing marks. And it's definitely way better than compromising your health. This is a tough time that we're all experiening so please don't be so hard on yourself, take it easy, and try not to worry about school for a while. I know that's easier said than done but I hope my (and other people's) words here can reassure you. Stay safe.",

I had to drop because I needed to focus on making money and because I was burning out HARD. Still not making enough to pay my bills so I have the added depression of halting my dreams of getting a degree and a career in my chosen field for what feels like nothing.\n\nNot to mention that I do terrible with online. I need a classroom environment, I cant study in my house or participate in zoom classes. It was a tough decision but at the same time it was easy to pinpoint what I needed to let go of in order to take care of my kids. Still fucking sucks though.",

When I complained to my DSS office I was just told to take it to the dean.",

After dropping one of my classes, I was able to manage my time and my other classes better and was less overwhelmed because i was less scattered. My grades in my other classes SIGNIFICANTLY improved as a result. However, I know it\u2019s late in the semester, so you may want to also consider if you would have enough time to bring grades up in classes that you don\u2019t drop. Also, withdrawing from the semester can be a better option than withdrawing from like half your classes when people are looking at your transcript in the future, as it\u2019s easier to argue that there were extenuating circumstances interfering with your ability to complete your classes if it\u2019s consistent through ALL your classes that semester, as opposed to the circumstances ~somehow only affecting some classes but not the others~\n\nEdit: I have also retroactively withdrawn from a semester (wiping the grades a few years AFTER I completed the semester due to extenuating circumstances during that semester). This would have been approximately equivalent to medically withdrawing from the semester during the semester (or withdrawing for other reasons), but it can be much harder to get approved as it is retroactive.",
