There are other things that make up the class grade.\n\nWould more assignments in the hw category increase the grade even though you have a 100% in the category?\n\nAlso does the assignment point value matter or just the percentage?",

      "text": "Nope, that's the whole point of weighing every category. You could have a thousand hw assignments and have 100% in all of them, but at the end it would only account for 10% of the final grade. The only advantage of having more hw assignments though is that you have some wiggle room for weak grades in that category",
