STEM majors require some honest to goodness dedication to see through till the end and it's only going to get worse as the semesters progress.\n\nI'm not one of those people that thinks you need to LOVE your major, but you should at the bare minimum not hate it, especially if it's on the more difficult side (Like CS)",

The secret of the outside world is that there are plenty of jobs that pay very well that are just looking for a science adjacent degree. \n\nI've seen so many good job offers just say something like requires a bachelor in physics, mathematics, computer science or engineering in general.",
