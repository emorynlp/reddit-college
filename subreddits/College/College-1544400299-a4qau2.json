As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling? There's just a lot going on in life right now and so much different things to think about it and I just wonder how people balance it or maintain a balanced mindset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this isn't the right place to post this I just want to know how other people feel in their college experiences in their own lives and interacting with others.", "author": "saltyman420", "created": 1544400299, "retrieved": 1632947948, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 634, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"ecpp9sn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a4qau2/why_does_it_seem_like_so_many_people_are_so/ecpp9sn/", "text": "\"I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.\"\n\nTrust me when it comes to shit like insecurities and issues, everyones got em, people are just really good at hiding them.

I\u2019m working on my master\u2019s in college counseling and student development.\n\nAnyways! Research shows that college-aged students are the most prone to anxiety, depression, and many other mental health issues. Reasoning for this comes from a ton of different factors including environmental, biological, and genetic traits. A sedentary lifestyle contributes to an increase in depressive symptoms. Frequent social media usage has been shown to increase symptoms of depression, decrease one\u2019s self-confidence, and heighten feelings of insecurity. Familial pressures and issues with money and tuition leads to all sorts of mental health issues. \n\nAnother piece of research I found states that depressed students are subconsciously attracted towards those who also show signs of depression, which I find interesting. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s important and wonderful that you\u2019re doing your job to remove the stigma surrounding depression and anxiety among your friend group. Opening up those conversations with those around you can potentially lead to saving someone\u2019s life if they are suicidal. However, it\u2019s important to seek out counseling resources on or off campus if you feel you anxiety, depression, or other issues are starting to affect your every day life.

Anxiety and depression (in that order) are the most common mental illnesses. The prevalence of mental illness has shot up on college campuses recently. Anecdotally, my mom is a counselor at a college, and her average daily number of appointments has more than doubled since she started her job 15 years ago; data-wise, there was a 62.9% increase in the number of mental health appointments made at college campuses across all of America *between 2015 and 2017 alone*, with only a 26.9% increase in available clinicians. Now, some of that can be attributed to the decrease in stigma. Appointments are increasing simply because people who may not have sought help a few years ago are now. But that doesn\u2019t seem to account for all of such a huge increase. \n\nYou\u2019re right, everyone *is* anxious and depressed. More so even than just a couple years ago. And those of us in education and mental health fields find the data is moving too quickly for us to pinpoint why, or how we can help. It\u2019s really hard to help, especially, when the increasing need outpaces our budgets. We need more counselors and more campus programs for coping. But we can\u2019t just increase a department budget by 63% in the blink of an eye, unfortunately.\n\nEdit - source: My mother is the director at a college mental health center.

This is the minimum, you honestly should have a good relationship with at least a few professors so they can go to bat for you.\n\nAll of this sounds obvious but it is a **ton** of work and there are few obvious ways around it.

Even if you get all of your work done that is due tomorrow, there's still that exam in two days, that paper due at the end of the week, the major project due at the end of the term. Add extracurriculars and work on top of it, and even if you stick to a strict schedule, it's never over, and there's always more you feel like you can be doing. It drains you emotionally, and makes it hard for you to find time for self care. And the situation I'm describing is one without any extra stressors added on, like interpersonal problems, mental health issues, or excessive struggling in one or more courses. \n\nWhen you're working, assuming that you don't take work home, then the stress is not constant. You know when you have to work, you know for how long, and you know that you don't have to take it home with you. And you know that all of the time outside of your work hours is your own time. Assuming you don't have any major issues on top of that, then it's a lot easier to handle the stress and anxiety and depression.
