  "text": "Hello everyone, hope you are all having a fun finals week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have made a discovery lately that has made me think quite a bit.  As I have become a bit more comfortable with my own insecurities and tried to talk to others it seems like a lot of my friends and people I know are terribly anxious inside and are overwhelmed by many things in our current society but NOBODY will talk about it. It seems like most people I end up talking to feel extremely insecure and overwhelmed with college life and people but everybody just puts on a facade and pretend it's okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is natural and nobody want's to look weak and maybe I am a bit naive here but it's a bit saddening to know that many people around me are just as anxious or stressed as me. Maybe it's just me and my upbringing but at my college I am curious where the realness is? I literally don't even understand people anymore and I am unsure if people are just so different and absorbed into their own world or if people actually feel like I do but don't want to admit it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to understand things and not be so hard on myself in these times and I can't tell if it's just a personal problem due to my lack of experience or if everybody is kind of struggling? There's just a lot going on in life right now and so much different things to think about it and I just wonder how people balance it or maintain a balanced mindset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this isn't the right place to post this I just want to know how other people feel in their college experiences in their own lives and interacting with others.",

Everyone in college experiences some sort of adversity, and some sort of mental hardship along the way, if not then they've never tried something new.  ",

The worse thing than being depressed is telling someone and they take it lightly. \nCollege does breed a lot of stress. One day, I'm confident with the materials and the next day, I feel lost again. Not to mention those extracurricular activities or those part-time jobs that they are doing, and I'm still sitting at home struggling with my homework. I feel incompetent, but I've learned to do things at my own pace now. Because I'll get there eventually. Realizing something I want to do and set myself to achieving it motivates me a lot. ",

They had a great deal living with a family member for cheap, but now they need to move out. They need to get their own place, but will be living at poverty levels. My brother who is in full-time school is talking about picking up extra shifts, but I was worried that too much work could conflct with school. I moved home to go back to college, but still work about 24hrs a week or more. I know people my age who work multiple jobs and barely make it. The stress is real. The anxiety that I could fail a class or lose my money is horrifying.   \n\n\nIMO life is very hard for many unskilled workers trying to go to school or work their way up to skilled work with higher wages.  Feels like a trap. Once im out of college will I even be able to get a job with no real experience?  The path to a livable wage is hard and I think many feel like it's so out of reach for them.  \n\n\nIm 25, but might be years away from making even slightly a livable wage and that doesnt feel good.",

I\u2019m working on my master\u2019s in college counseling and student development.\n\nAnyways! Research shows that college-aged students are the most prone to anxiety, depression, and many other mental health issues. Reasoning for this comes from a ton of different factors including environmental, biological, and genetic traits. A sedentary lifestyle contributes to an increase in depressive symptoms. Frequent social media usage has been shown to increase symptoms of depression, decrease one\u2019s self-confidence, and heighten feelings of insecurity. Familial pressures and issues with money and tuition leads to all sorts of mental health issues. \n\nAnother piece of research I found states that depressed students are subconsciously attracted towards those who also show signs of depression, which I find interesting. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s important and wonderful that you\u2019re doing your job to remove the stigma surrounding depression and anxiety among your friend group. Opening up those conversations with those around you can potentially lead to saving someone\u2019s life if they are suicidal. However, it\u2019s important to seek out counseling resources on or off campus if you feel you anxiety, depression, or other issues are starting to affect your every day life. Most on campus counseling services are free of charge as far as I know.\n\nI\u2019m here if anyone needs to talk! Working with college students is my passion, and I have my own personal history with mental health issues. Stay Alive!",

But, it\u2019s definitely more intense now. I\u2019m much more stressed because now I know that college classes are seriously counting towards my career, and the grades I get matter much more than in high school. I also don\u2019t want to disappoint my family and friends. My family is counting on me to be the first person to get an actual degree in our family. I also want to have a successful future in which I love what I do, and I don\u2019t wanna fuck it up. I wanna be a veterinarian, and it\u2019s a whole lot of schooling and going into debt. I have to have pretty damn good grades to get into a veterinarian school. \n\nSorry if it seems like I ranted in this comment. I am so stressed lol. I hope that, whoever reads this, you do great on your finals and you have a much less stressful week. Good luck, everybody.

The only way I would be happy is if the whole thing collapsed and we were to rebuild it without any of our mistakes that make it so horrible in the first place. I feel as if today\u2019s society is too big therfore it lacks a feeling of connection with our community. I wish it we lived in the simpler times. This whole paragraph sounds naive to any reader. The only thing that is certain is that I am not happy with our world today. I feel like technology has actually separated us. Our futures aren\u2019t secure. Our economy heavily relies on oil. Climate change is making our future more uncertain. I want to change the world into what I want, something that will make it better for everyone, but its so overwhelming that the only thing I can think of are drastic measures. I\u2019m unhappy with the global leadership (or lack thereof). I\u2019m unhappy with our environment. I\u2019m unhappy with our economy, where people slave away their time that they could be spending with their families. Life can be better, but it isn\u2019t, and thats what makes me sad. I want the future for humanity to be full of promise, all I see is demise. We are sinking and we haven\u2019t even noticed.",

      "text": "Honestly, those of us working in the higher education field and those working in mental health are trying to figure out the *why*; but you\u2019re certainly not incorrect in recognizing that everyone seems to be anxious and depressed. Anxiety and depression (in that order) are the most common mental illnesses. The prevalence of mental illness has shot up on college campuses recently. Anecdotally, my mom is a counselor at a college, and her average daily number of appointments has more than doubled since she started her job 15 years ago; data-wise, there was a 62.9% increase in the number of mental health appointments made at college campuses across all of America *between 2015 and 2017 alone*, with only a 26.9% increase in available clinicians. Now, some of that can be attributed to the decrease in stigma. Appointments are increasing simply because people who may not have sought help a few years ago are now. But that doesn\u2019t seem to account for all of such a huge increase. \n\nYou\u2019re right, everyone *is* anxious and depressed. More so even than just a couple years ago. And those of us in education and mental health fields find the data is moving too quickly for us to pinpoint why, or how we can help. It\u2019s really hard to help, especially, when the increasing need outpaces our budgets. We need more counselors and more campus programs for coping. But we can\u2019t just increase a department budget by 63% in the blink of an eye, unfortunately.\n\nEdit - source: My mother is the director at a college mental health center. I myself work in higher education and am also working on a Master\u2019s in higher ed administration. I just gave a presentation in class about mental health issues on campuses a couple weeks ago. I can link the source for my percentages if anyone is interested when I\u2019m not using mobile.",

              "text": "There are a number of possible reasons, and it\u2019s probably a combination of factors.\n\nFirst, as I mentioned, my mom always likes to tell people that some of the change is positive. Stigma reduction means more students are seeking help, and that increases the statistics, but they were always there, just uncounted. Stigma reduction also means that more kids are getting diagnosed and treated in high school. In the past, these students would not have had the tools to be successful enough in high school to get into college. They can get into college now. That\u2019s great news.\n\nBut, of course, some of it\u2019s bad news, too. I\u2019ve seen some hypotheses as to what may be happening. A big one is technology and social media. Cyberbullying is one part of it. The bigger problem, though, seems to be social media giving young people a skewed perception of others\u2019 lives and what their lives should look like. People overwhelmingly only share the most positive life events on their social media. So as you scroll through, it just looks like everyone is accomplishing more than you and having a better time than you are. This makes people feel inadequate, anxious that they\u2019re doing something wrong, and depressed that things aren\u2019t going that well for them. In reality, we just don\u2019t see the messy parts of people\u2019s lives on social media. (I know I sound old blaming it on that damn social media all the kids are into, but I graduated high school in 2010, so I caught some of this, too.)\n\nAnother issue is that kids are not coming to college emotionally prepared. Schools are focusing more on academic preparedness for college than ever, leaving less time for life skills. Teens are less independent and more reliant on parents than in previous generations. Many leave their parents only to discover they\u2019re not emotionally prepared to do things on their own. This creates anxiety.\n\nPersonally, I would also like to see some research, if any is available, on the link between various types of high-stakes/high-consequence situations and students\u2019 mental health. When I was in high school, Ohio had one graduation test that you took in 10th grade, which meant you had two additional years to pass it if you didn\u2019t the first time. Now, though, you have to pass subject matter exit exams and earn at least 18 points on these exams to pass or something. There are a few alternatives, but the state legislature eliminated a few of the simpler ones out of nowhere this year, and now 30% of seniors at the nearby high school, including honors students with high GPAs, are in danger of not graduating this year. I can\u2019t imagine the anxiety that produces. Also, I\u2019ve heard that after something like 3 absences from school in this district, your parents have to come talk with a truancy officer, even if those were all excused absences with a doctor\u2019s note. But also, other aspects of life are higher stakes, too. Both my parents have stories of being underage teens drinking while driving, and the cop just telling them to dump out their beer and go home, or we\u2019ll call your parents. Meanwhile, my younger brother was drinking underage in college and walked to a nearby pizza place to pick up the pizza he and his friends had ordered. The pizza place called the police on him for suspected public intoxication, he got arrested, spent the night in jail, ended up with underage drinking and public intoxication on his record. My parents got a lawyer to help him get it expunged from his record because the consequence of such a record is no one hiring him after he finishes college.\n\nParents drink underage while driving = \u201cgo home, kid.\u201d\n\nOur generation(s) make the responsible choice to walk a couple blocks while drunk instead of driving = possibly no job after graduation. \n\nEverything is higher stakes. Everything has exaggerated consequences that didn\u2019t exist just a couple decades ago. We\u2019re raising kids afraid of making mistakes, which is a recipe for anxiety and depression. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my rant on the matter.  ",

Reject the well-trodden path, admit that we have no idea what the fuck is going on here, that specific claims to the purpose of life are likely bullshit, and that most jobs are not fulfilling. Along with this comes a struggle for identity and purpose, which will involve depression, anxiety, and potentially suicide. Keep fighting for a purpose that may never come, but hopefully will; and accept the great risk that is inherent to this path.",

If you want a good life nowadays as a young adult, either you **need** to know someone that can hook you up with a decent or better career, *or*, you just can't fuck up as in you need to get a good degree, need to get at least a 3.0 gpa, and **need** solid internships or experience. This is the minimum, you honestly should have a good relationship with at least a few professors so they can go to bat for you.\n\nAll of this sounds obvious but it is a **ton** of work and there are few obvious ways around it. I know extremely talented, smart, and hard-working people that simply can't find good employment or opportunity out of college.\n\nI can't help but look at the status quo and the overall state of many people I know and how it's naturally going to become more difficult over time and think \"something going to have to give\", society can't expect absolutely everyone to be overachievers, lord knows there are way more smart-hard working people graduating college than there ever has been but there simply aren't enough jobs for all these qualified candidates.\n\nSo, hopelessness is why root as to why everyone is somewhat stressed in my opinion.",

In my experience that is not the case. People are competing for fewer jobs that will support a family in the current economy. There are many more jobs that do NOT pay to support even one person adequately.   \n\n\nYou might say that having a family is a luxury, and that may be true. The birthrate in the US is plummeting. This is an example of millennials seeing the writing on the wall and not having children until they are financially ready-- if ever. We are making these difficult decisions that it doesn't seem our parents had to, because our opportunities differ. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is anecdotal, but the white collar workers in my office who have been there for twenty-thirty years constantly complain about how hard our work has gotten, how stressed they are, how fast the production pace is. How everything has changed in the last 5-10 years and become terrible-- with evidence to back it up in the form of citing policy changes. Meanwhile, I'm thinking about how much better it is to work where I am than the grueling and degrading life I had as a part-time server for two years (!) after I got my  B.S. in a STEM field. ",

I feel like it's so common to talk about it that it's not even that unique anymore, but maybe this is my own biased experiences. \n\nCollege just breeds endless stress. Think about it. Even if you get all of your work done that is due tomorrow, there's still that exam in two days, that paper due at the end of the week, the major project due at the end of the term. Add extracurriculars and work on top of it, and even if you stick to a strict schedule, it's never over, and there's always more you feel like you can be doing. It drains you emotionally, and makes it hard for you to find time for self care. And the situation I'm describing is one without any extra stressors added on, like interpersonal problems, mental health issues, or excessive struggling in one or more courses. \n\nWhen you're working, assuming that you don't take work home, then the stress is not constant. You know when you have to work, you know for how long, and you know that you don't have to take it home with you. And you know that all of the time outside of your work hours is your own time. Assuming you don't have any major issues on top of that, then it's a lot easier to handle the stress and anxiety and depression. At least personally, when I was working internships, my mental health flourished compared to when I was in class. ",

Things like participation trophies to avoid emotional pain and never letting kids get hurt to avoid physical pain have snowballed into an enormous number of people who are ill-prepared to handle the stress associated with University.\n\nAll that said, I have no idea if that's true or not and haven't seen any research discussing it one way or the other. Just hearsay from someone who does know that field intimately. Is be interested to hear back from the community on whether they feel this is true or not. They say the current generation of parents is doing a much better job of preparing their children. \n\nThere is also the issue of NCLB and similar policies impacting the preparedness of students getting into college. Entrance standards have decreased as well. This means that a larger number of students are going to college who are going to struggle significantly with college level coursework.

Very young children (under 2 years old) will start to show embarrassment when they make mistakes; it's something hardwired in the brain that helps with social cohesion. I mean, how do you think you \"just know\" when you've said something cringey? You didn't really learn that, just like you didn't really learn language or how to walk - it was already there. \n\nLacking that awareness and ability to feel embarrassed would make you developmentally delayed at best, and seriously cognitively disabled at worst. People on the Autism spectrum have incredible difficulty in picking up the non-verbal cues during socialisation that they've done something \"wrong\", so they don't feel embarrassed at the right time, and then go on to make the same social faux pas again and again. They must be taught by a professional to recognise the signs, and even then, it's not innate. Autism is a condition that affects brain development, and it'll never be totally \"natural\" to them. \n\nIt's an automatic human response in a typically-developing person. It doesn't matter how much you \"force-feed tolerance\" (whatever the fuck that means), people feel a little bit embarrassed when they make mistakes in the presence of other people. ",

Yes, every normal person will experience the full human range of emotions, but due to this extreme push for tolerance, they can either ignore the meaning behind those feelings (like shame) because people accept them anyways and they end up confused and depressed and anxious because they know something is wrong but are being told they're normal. Or they don't want to bring anything up out of fear of losing their social status, whatever that may be, because even with all the tolerance preaching, people still feel different or not good enough, etc sometimes. So they get depressed and anxious about it and hide it, rather than risk being intolerant of someone else who feels the same. I may not be wording this right, and it is a confusing double standard type thing, but it's real.",

I have a few advisees that literally fail everything every semester and keep going at it. And there are SO many more of them than most students realize. Especially at community colleges and regional state schools. I also think it's unethical for schools to take students with a 13 ACT expecting them to succeed, yet, that's where we are.",

My brother is a mechanic, and worked automotive for about 20 years, but got out of it to work in repair and maintenance of industrial cleaning equipment last year. He goes into factories, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, etc... and apparently they are ALL always looking for good employees. They have a huge issue with hiring reliable people who can pass a drug test. He never had a hard time finding work as a mechanic, but now that he's working closely with the manufacturing industry, he is seeing that there is a huge number of unclaimed jobs for people willing to do them there also. Driving large trucks, construction, manufacturing, repair work, etc... all need people, none of them are glamorous, but they generally pay decent (far better than retail or food service). The problem is many people want a white collar job and won't even consider these other careers even though they pay well and have benefits.   \n\nAs far as why people with degrees can't get \"good\" jobs, I really think it's because there are simply too many people getting degrees compared to the number of jobs for people with those degrees.

It started back in the 90's telling everyone they had to go to college or they would be a failure, which is when I was coming up so I got that too.  \n\nIt's doing a terrible disservice to the education in this country though. Let me give you some VERY typical examples of how this is such a terrible way to approach careers:\n\n1. Susan hated school in K-12 and always just got by. She is told she needs college. She wants to be a doctor. She comes from a working class family that can't afford to send her to college, so in her quest to be a doctor, she takes the ACT, gets a comprehensive score of less than 20, and comes to college on loans. She flunks every major class her first 2 years until the school kicks her out. At this point, she owes about $400/month in student loan payments, and is in no better position to pay them off than when she was 16 working at Subway.\n\n2. Randy likes school but mostly for the social aspects. He gets student loans and pledges his first semester. His grades quickly tank as he dives headfirst into the social side of university. His professors email him but he never answers them. He's kicked out after one semester and is now ineligible for future student loans due to his professors reporting him as a \"no attendance\" student. \n\n3. Megan came to college though she didn't care much for school. She wants to study music, and always liked being in the school choir. She majors in vocal performance, and takes 5 years to get her bachelor's degree. Some of it was scholarships, some was loans. She was great at singing but music theory she had to retake a few times, and she struggled with her required math and science courses. She has graduated with $40K in debt, a 2.7 GPA, and a major in singing. She works at the local gas station and owes $500 of her $1,400 monthly salary in loans. She lives in a flat with 5 other people.\n\nIf I told you how many literal hundreds of students I've seen that fall into 1 or 2 or 3 above, you would cry. These people NEVER should have gone to college at all and would actually be much better off financially if they hadn't. I've had much more success in students who join the military first, or students that are top students from high school anyway. There is an issue with grade inflation right now, but I highly suspect a lot of it is because we are having to dumb down the material for a classroom half full of mediocre students. ",

I work with many colleagues from other countries as a professor. I teach a lot of students from different countries. It's not like I'm not familiar with this issue; especially in the sciences we tend to get a lot people from India, China, and Korea. I've never met a single one that couldn't put together English sentences in a cohesive, coherent way. It's usually the accent that trips people up. \n\nThe good thing about accents is that you can learn to understand them with practice, but frustrated students often don't want to bother with it, and (not accusing anyone here) I've seen a lot of very poor students use their professor's accent as an excuse as to why they are failing.

And for certification courses in education, you need a B- or better per course. If you go on academic probation, you can\u2019t take any education courses, so it takes you 4.5 - 5 years to graduate as a result, since certain classes are only offered at certain points of the year. That almost happened to me and I spent a week panicking, crying, binging and migraing because of it. At least until the EOF Director said it was cool if I got lower than a 3.0 since I already had a 3.8 from summer classes, so a 2.6 would just give me a 3.2. \n\nAt my school it\u2019s 2.0 for most majors, and you have to get a C or better in your major courses (not pre-requisites) since it\u2019s a catholic school, and most of what I learned I know from high school.

It's just how the system is set up and how it's evolved over the decades.\n\nSo people tend to keep their difficulties and anxiousness  to themselves in fear of showing weakness. It's a sad fact of the educational life.\n\nOne of the ways (which I personally picked up) is to use the 'whatever the fuck' mindset, of just going through it all without too much thought and worry. Usually you'll end up passing and saving yourself a lot of unneeded stress (which can be extremely harmful to your physical and mental health), but the downside is you wont come out with nearly as much knowledge, so it's pretty much a waste of money/time at that point.\n\nJust my 2c.",

It's just hard to vocalize when you're feeling bad/stressed/etc at the right time.\n\nLast year my best friend came out to me after a party we hosted that he was suicidal and contemplated killing himself because of stress and a bad relationship. I had no idea he was feeling that way until he told me, and am thankful that he did tell me. \n\nI even have a hard time opening up to people, but if one of my friends asked me how I was really doing at a good time to do so, I would open up completely.

They\u2019re in most college towns because the food insecurity rate is so high. They have food!!\n\n- resource centers (women\u2019s RC, etc) may also have free food/snacks. They are called resource centers for a reason and they tend to keep stuff around.\n\n- events are always on campus, so it is possible to get lunch at a seminar, or something similar, nearly every day of the week. If you check Facebook there will usually be SOMETHING. Or ask around, see what others go to.\n\nAgain, sorry if this is advice already heard, but I figured it\u2019s better to over-inform than to under-inform.",
