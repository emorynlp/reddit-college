My boss sells communications bundles and sorts to companies. I do all the admin work like preparing meetings, scheduling meetings, preparing the proposals, etc. And I make 4 figures a month. I can't tell you an exact number because it's comission based so it's different every month but it goes between 1000\u20ac and 1500\u20ac. Minimum wage in my country is 665\u20ac. And then I have night time classes in college. Even though it's part-time, it's not 20 hours a week, it's more than that, but it's definitely not 40. It's not a hard job, it's confusing in the beggining but then you get the hang of it. I don't really have a schedule, I can work whenever I want and wherever I want (even pre-pandemic this was an at home job) so it's perfect for us students. It's very hard to find jobs like this though, I definitely hit the jackpot here.\n\nI also used to be a realtor but that wasn't working out, I wasn't make any sales.\n\nI should also mention that my degree is related to admin work so it definitely helped in getting this job but I'm only now going to my second year so I doubt I got the job solely based on that.", "author": "Imaginary_Ad7841", "created": 1632613509, "upvotes": 1}, "hea4fso": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhe5q/college_students_of_reddit_where_do_you_work_and/hea4fso/", "text": "Dunkin, 16 an hour.
