  "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is specific to my college but when I took both my English classes they required a 92% to get an A and all the other letter grades were higher too but every other class was 90% (English is arguable one of the hardest GE subjects already don\u2019t know why want to make it harder). Does anyone know what makes English classes special?",
