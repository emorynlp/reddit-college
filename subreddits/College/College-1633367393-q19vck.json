      "text": "All classes that require thought beyond regurgitation will lead to a contrast between those with \"average\" intelligence and those with \"gifted\" intelligence. However, some classes will *necessitate* high intelligence more than others.\n\nI agree with other posts on this thread that math and philosophy are the real big ones when it comes to requiring high intelligence. I'm a grad student, and right now I'm involved in research in a math department at an R1 school and if I want to be real these people on this particular project stand out as \"different\" intellectually. It's kind of like if you took a random sample of people from MENSA, except these people are smarter and more well adjusted (except for me-- I'm a fuck up lol).\n\nI jumped into my current field from a completely different discipline that is not known for requiring brains (education), and at minimum there is a culture shift. Brains help a ton no matter what academic field you get into but you don't *need* brains to succeed in education. If you want to make ground-breaking contributions to the field of math, then yeah, some level of \"giftedness\" is probably required. \n\nThere's a reality, too, that there are different levels of \"average\" and different levels of \"gifted\" and it's also hardly a one-dimensional thing so your mileage may vary.",

Even if you not \u201cgifted\u201d, most can master all the classes offered in the University system. \n\nWhat you do with that knowledge also contributes to a gifted vs regular person. \n\nIf two people master the same concepts but one can revolutionize with that knowledge, then they may be \u201cgifted\u201d, compared to their peers.",

I have a shitty memory but great abstract reasoning skills so I seem to do better relative to my peers in the classes that are supposedly \"harder.\" I'm pretty sure it's because of a concussion I had some years ago. Otherwise I'd be all around \"gifted\" but a hitting your head is not a good thing for intelligence-- I'd recommend against it, lol.\n\nCognition isn't a simple one-dimensional thing, although we think of it that way sometimes because it can be useful, but it's also important to take it with an adequate grain of salt. These conversations about giftedness fascinate me because I'm such an outlier in that what \"normal\" people find hard I find easy and what \"normal\" people find \"easy\" I find hard (it's sometimes called being \"twice exceptional\"). There's huge variation in the nature of human cognition, and there's no reason not to embrace it.\n\nI think it's important to try to not put yourself in a box by telling yourself you're \"not smart.\" Realistically, we all have strengths and weaknesses, so if you're not good at abstract thinking it's not the end of the world. Clearly if you passed calc 1 and 2 with ease you're good at *something*, so you should try to pin down what that \"something\" is and use it to your advantage.",
