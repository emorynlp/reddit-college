  "text": "I will be making podcasts for each of my classes through Anchor, with each episode lasting for up to 20 minutes. It will be a summary of what is covered in the day's lecture and will include some of my examples and my attempts of proving every formula being used in the class. Some may include case studies or demonstrations.\n\nThese are released in conjunction to my 3-5 minute songs which help you remember the important points in every topic.\n\nThis means that I need to be fully focused in each lecture, with phone off, being totally silent and all minds on the content. These podcasts will help literally everyone taking my classes. Even if they missed a class due to some incident, they are still able to catch up through my podcasts! A focused 90 minutes helps a ton of people! A win win situation for me as I can remember the content even better by teaching others!\n\nIn addition, some content may also be presented onboard some particular train or bus services, if they are understandable by the general public. They will happen on two train lines and around 5-6 bus routes. This can also help me polish my presentation skills.",
