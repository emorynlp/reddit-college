Knowing this has changed my life. When I stopped reading physical things and focused all my attention on listening and working through examples, I learn 500% faster. This has manifested as paying close attention in lectures and then applying myself to the learning process of homework exercises. When I came to something I didn't know that I couldn't get from my notes, there was almost always an explanation on youtube, or the internet somewhere.\n\nAs I get further and further along with my college career, this becomes a less and less reliable strategy. Does anyone have advice on how I can continue learning in a way that I'm successful when youtube and chegg or whatever don't have the answers? This is especially problematic for reading (and understanding) scientific papers.", "author": "shockwave6969", "created": 1632769700, "retrieved": 1632800174, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
