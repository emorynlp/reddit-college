  "text": "I took a gap year to try get into the program that I have always dreamed of. I also planned to work on some back up options , travel a bit, basically work on myself. But because of the pandemic I couldn't do all that and ended up just focusing on getting in that program. I failed miserably. I feel like I wasted an entire year for nothing. Not only did I not achieve my main goal , I didn't do anything significant this whole year. Even though I have decided on what to do next and am ready to start all over.... I sometimes go back to thinking...I'm a faliure... I feel like I'm stuck... I find myself feeling jealous of friends who are already in college, studying what they want to...and I hate that I feel this way. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I could really use some advice..",

      "text": "I too failed very hard to get into my dream program, and I\u2019ve also planned out things and moved on/etc. I also didn\u2019t do much the past year ish after I got rejected\u2026 and I have times where I am jealous of my friends who are in the program and feel like my skills are inadequate. \n\nI think imposter syndrome might be the best way to describe how I feel it. I\u2019m not sure what your dream program was, but realizing the different paths I can take outside of the program helped me get over it. This and seeing my other rejected peers\u2019 amazing work. This might sound a bit dumb, but I also realized I do not need some school/review board\u2019s approval to excel in what I do. I think getting into hobbies outside of whatever your academic focus is can help a lot too. I\u2019m in graphic design so a lot of skills just come with time and experience.",

Try to compare yourself to you last self rather than others. If you out in genuine effort to make things better than eventually things will get better. I didn't have the typical college experience and it got me down for a long time but once I changed my focus and started to work hard towards what I wanted, things got so much better.",

You're not a failure, but you did lose your dream, your goal, your plan, the idea of how you're life was supposed to go. That's a huge loss. Grieve it like any other loss. Allow yourself space to grieve, to feel these huge emotions. They'll pass easier if you know why they're there and allow them to pass through. After grieving I went on to my backup plans like you have. I made it into my program the next year and now I'm done with that PhD. Honestly, it turned out way better than I could've imagined, but totally different. Grieve, feel, it'll make it easier to move on and embrace the next thing.",
