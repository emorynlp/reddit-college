  "text": "As of 26/11/21, I've missed half of my lectures during the first semester of my first year at university. The semester isn't over yet but I understand that I've created a terrible habit for myself due to my own laziness and that my low attendance is no one else's fault but mine. I want to break this habit and begin attending or trying to attend 100% of my lectures for the rest of my semesters and years at university starting now.\n\nDo you have any advice or tips on how I can fix this?",

      "text": "One thing to keep an eye on: if you start attending regularly now and still get disappointing results this term, it'd be natural to return to bad habits in the next term. Don't. This term is probably already a lost cause, but you'll surprised what you can do with good habits through an entire term.",
