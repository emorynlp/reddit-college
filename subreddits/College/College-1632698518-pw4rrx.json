It is our first semester and I have failing score on most of my subject. We already have our prelims and and I failed two subjects, one major subject. I know that this course is hard but I think it\u2019s not all about the class, I think my terror prof added to this problem. I\u2019m really studying hard but the requirements are just unreasonable. Now I want to quit the course, maybe because I don\u2019t see myself doing this anymore and it really messing my mental health already. I need advise on what to do. Do I need to shift course?which I wanted to do or drop/withdraw subjects (please enlighten me i\u2019m not familiar with this terms). Plus it is possible to shift course after one semester? cause I don\u2019t want to waste money and time with this course. Thank u in advance for the advices!!!", "author": "Equivalent-Stable311", "created": 1632698518, "retrieved": 1632800222, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"heer356": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw4rrx/i_need_help_i_want_to_quit_my_course/heer356/", "text": "Reach out to your academic advisor.
