  "text": "Long story short, I'm concerned about my future. My life just took a 360 this year where I lost my job, had an accident, I'm getting low grades/difficult to concentrate and I just want to just be happy again. I switched from Japanese to a linguistics course but now I'm better at journalism. I want a degree but I'm just concerned with the way my future is heading. I know I'm young but feel like my hope is lost. I'm trying to do the work, I'm trying to get employment but I feel like my efforts are fading.",

Things are changing really fast right now for everyone and it's likely it will be dramatically different for humanity in 15 years. But there is no point in fretting about it. We'll do what we have to do to survive. My daughter is six, how do you think I feel about the way the world is going for her? It makes me feel really scared sometimes, but then I realize that humans have been on Earth for 10,000 years, and we always find a way to adapt. Things might get uncomfortable soon, but we just have to keep fighting, and the strongest and smartest will do the best. So stay strong. Turn around and get back off of the path of fear.",

With the covid, finding a job is not easy, so for now I'm just taking my drivers license and with the immense time I have I try to learn different things(for example I learn a little about Javascript, psychology, body language and among other things) but I still feel scared and often think that if I don't find a job I will \"waste\" this year or I think that if I don't go to college I will not be successful. Im also looking for alternatives to college and I'm also seing if I can go to college later in life(like 24/25 years old) so that I can explore more the world and myself and then \"settle down\", but, like I said, I'm scarred that things don't go as plan and I ended up failing in life. So don't worry you re not alone.",

Final advice if you have time with loved ones, appreciate it. If you\u2019re scared think of what your grateful for, and solidly plan and research what u think you want to do based off reality, fulfillment, job prospects, and also mental health",

Separate the emotional from the practical by doing the following:\n\n1) Practically speaking, you should choose a course and stick with it. You\u2019re admittedly emotional right now, and it may be tempting to try to find a \u201cpassion course\u201d to stimulate some positive feelings. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. Many people who\u2019ve felt this way have tried that strategy. You\u2019re likely to find that it doesn\u2019t work, and actually leads to feeling worse because then you feel like you\u2019re not making progress. Instead, just stick to a course and complete it. In the long-run that will work out better.\n\n2) In terms of emotional processing during a general funk, I\u2019ve got to recommend pursuing therapy. It might be tough to find someone in private practice right now with the pandemic and having lost your job. But try to check around your area. See if there are any spaces where people who feel this way are able to speak. A lot of support groups are zooming these days. And many therapists are doing zoom as well if that option works for you. The most important thing emotionally is to find a space dedicated to processing the way you feel. Feelings are serious business and you deserve to feel good about your life. So give it a chance.\n\nI hope everything works out for you and that you start feeling better soon.",

I tried very hard NOT to define myself by my major and I picked a major (statistics) where I can apply it, and the skills I've learned, to many different careers.\n\nSo I guess a better way to say it is don't take labels too seriously. You can become a journalist with a law degree if you want.",

      "text": "Im from the US, but I think alot of uni students right now are experiencing an existential crisis of sorts. With COVID and our whole college careers being forced to a computer screen, alot of us are isolated and alone and this only makes it worse. I\u2019ve always considered myself to have really good mental health, but this year, I\u2019ve been so depressed due to school and being forced back home with my parents (which isn\u2019t the best environment for me). There are days where I literally can\u2019t get out of bed. Like you, I\u2019m so scared for the future, because right now, it seems like there is none. Im so sorry for what you\u2019re going through, but just know you aren\u2019t alone and we\u2019ll all get through this.<3",
