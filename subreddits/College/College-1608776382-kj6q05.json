You\u2019re definitely not alone. I\u2019ve gone through some rough patches. If you\u2019re interest, here\u2019s my advice. Separate the emotional from the practical by doing the following:\n\n1) Practically speaking, you should choose a course and stick with it. You\u2019re admittedly emotional right now, and it may be tempting to try to find a \u201cpassion course\u201d to stimulate some positive feelings. Don\u2019t feel bad about it. Many people who\u2019ve felt this way have tried that strategy. You\u2019re likely to find that it doesn\u2019t work, and actually leads to feeling worse because then you feel like you\u2019re not making progress. Instead, just stick to a course and complete it. In the long-run that will work out better.\n\n2) In terms of emotional processing during a general funk, I\u2019ve got to recommend pursuing therapy. It might be tough to find someone in private practice right now with the pandemic and having lost your job. But try to check around your area. See if there are any spaces where people who feel this way are able to speak. A lot of support groups are zooming these days. And many therapists are doing zoom as well if that option works for you. The most important thing emotionally is to find a space dedicated to processing the way you feel. Feelings are serious business and you deserve to feel good about your life. So give it a chance.\n\nI hope everything works out for you and that you start feeling better soon.", "author": "quincy103", "created": 1608824855, "upvotes": 2}, "ggwikg3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kj6q05/anyone_else_feel_like_they_are_just_failing_and/ggwikg3/", "text": "It may seem bad now, but that\u2019s only because you\u2019ve been falling for so long you\u2019ve been staring at the ground.
