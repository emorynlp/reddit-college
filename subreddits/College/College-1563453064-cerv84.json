My internship this summer has shown me that's the case as of right now.\n\nI don't go to college anymore to learn and understand things, because so much more emphasis is put on short-term understanding for a grade rather than long-term understanding and application for a career. Its just frustrating and disheartening in a way. There are definitely parts of attending university that I find really rewarding and great like social circles and the ability to pursue whatever you want in life, but at its core it should be about education, and it doesn't feel like it is.", "author": "Caruryn", "created": 1563453064, "retrieved": 1632947219, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1398, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ew3gknx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cerv84/does_anyone_else_feel_like_college_is_a_means_to/ew3gknx/", "text": "Lol the best part of college is definitely the social part", "author": "blueeyedbeauty123", "created": 1565077809, "upvotes": 1}, "euc2swi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cerv84/does_anyone_else_feel_like_college_is_a_means_to/euc2swi/", "text": "Caveat: I'm an historian and waaaaay to the left of those \"liberal professors\" TPUSA warns you about, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nBasically, college is fucked up because the ways we think about values and economics and knowledge are fucked up. Most occupations should initially be taught by a combination of on-the-job training and a couple of years (at most) of specialized classes. The idea that a four-year degree is a ticket to an upper-middle class consumer lifestyle is an historical artifact that wasn't particularly true in the 1950s (at least not if you were black, brown, or female) and is even less true now as the few continue to draw all wealth to themselves while we careen onward into social, political, and ecological dystopia. \n\nBut, that's what we've got right now, so what do you do with it? If you really are just being taught to the test without being taught how to *create knowledge*--to know fundamental principles, assess situations and needs, and learn and create the knowledge necessary for you to respond to them--then you're not being well served by your classes. The information you learn in your classes is likely to be outdated soon after you leave school. You have to be trained how to teach yourself; you have to be able to create knowledge. In its own way, enabling you to gain that creative skill is what college was meant to do; outside of a few knowledge-based professional degrees (law, medicine) it was never meant to be vocational training. \n\nThe good news is that being in school gives you access to concentrated resources that make it possible to do this for yourself. You can do that in large part by using your classes, even the most boring ones (like history), as platforms for mastering techniques you need to research, write, and present your ideas. Learning is a disciplined practice; where most \"self-taught\" people fail is that they follow nothing but their own interests and end up doing nothing but collecting trivia.

After all, college is not a trade school; it is not supposed to teach you practice. Instead, the purpose of college is to teach you theory - the eternal first principles from which practice is built from. With this in mind, it becomes clear that you shouldn't expect the things you learn in college to be directly applicable to your job. Most entry level jobs just use existing practices developed by others; it isn't until you enter the upper levels of the technical career ladder or get a research job that you start developing new practices. Until then, the theory simply remains in the back of your mind guiding your choices of which practice to use. \n\nAs for your comment about short-term understanding for a grade, I've found that college's emphasis on a few key exams instead of high school's daily daily grades actually promotes learning for long term understanding.

I thought \u201cI\u2019m ready to learn something new :)\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t get what you mean by grades and understanding. In my opinion, those two concepts are linked. The more you understand the content, the higher your grade will be. Maybe if you goof around the whole quarter and spend the last week cramming for the final, then perhaps you might get a good grade but lack understanding?
