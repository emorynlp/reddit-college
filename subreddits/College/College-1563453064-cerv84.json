  "text": "Going into my Junior year and I've found that my love of learning from high school is all but gone. College just doesn't feel like \"school\" anymore, but more a means to get a degree and then get a job from it. Yes, I love my major and I am very excited to get a career in it, but I also feel like most of what I am learning will end up being useless for whatever job I end up in. My internship this summer has shown me that's the case as of right now.\n\nI don't go to college anymore to learn and understand things, because so much more emphasis is put on short-term understanding for a grade rather than long-term understanding and application for a career. Its just frustrating and disheartening in a way. There are definitely parts of attending university that I find really rewarding and great like social circles and the ability to pursue whatever you want in life, but at its core it should be about education, and it doesn't feel like it is.",

      "text": "Caveat: I'm an historian and waaaaay to the left of those \"liberal professors\" TPUSA warns you about, so take this with a grain of salt.\n\nBasically, college is fucked up because the ways we think about values and economics and knowledge are fucked up. Most occupations should initially be taught by a combination of on-the-job training and a couple of years (at most) of specialized classes. The idea that a four-year degree is a ticket to an upper-middle class consumer lifestyle is an historical artifact that wasn't particularly true in the 1950s (at least not if you were black, brown, or female) and is even less true now as the few continue to draw all wealth to themselves while we careen onward into social, political, and ecological dystopia. \n\nBut, that's what we've got right now, so what do you do with it? If you really are just being taught to the test without being taught how to *create knowledge*--to know fundamental principles, assess situations and needs, and learn and create the knowledge necessary for you to respond to them--then you're not being well served by your classes. The information you learn in your classes is likely to be outdated soon after you leave school. You have to be trained how to teach yourself; you have to be able to create knowledge. In its own way, enabling you to gain that creative skill is what college was meant to do; outside of a few knowledge-based professional degrees (law, medicine) it was never meant to be vocational training. \n\nThe good news is that being in school gives you access to concentrated resources that make it possible to do this for yourself. You can do that in large part by using your classes, even the most boring ones (like history), as platforms for mastering techniques you need to research, write, and present your ideas. Learning is a disciplined practice; where most \"self-taught\" people fail is that they follow nothing but their own interests and end up doing nothing but collecting trivia. For one look at what the general goal of self-education should be, see William Perry's [Scheme of Intellectual and Ethical Development](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/perry.positions.html).\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like the crux of your complaint is that what you are learning right now is not directly applicable to whatever job you end up in. \n\nIf this is the case, might I suggest you view college through a different lens than the job training mindset? After all, college is not a trade school; it is not supposed to teach you practice. Instead, the purpose of college is to teach you theory - the eternal first principles from which practice is built from. With this in mind, it becomes clear that you shouldn't expect the things you learn in college to be directly applicable to your job. Most entry level jobs just use existing practices developed by others; it isn't until you enter the upper levels of the technical career ladder or get a research job that you start developing new practices. Until then, the theory simply remains in the back of your mind guiding your choices of which practice to use. \n\nAs for your comment about short-term understanding for a grade, I've found that college's emphasis on a few key exams instead of high school's daily daily grades actually promotes learning for long term understanding. Perhaps my experience is different from most people's, but I found that by approaching a class with the mindset that I'm here to learn as much as possible, the grades simply take care of themselves.",

It is frustrating to spend an awful lot of money on something that a university says will be useful to my overall education and then see that turn into nothing. But, I also don't know when it will come up in the future so it may be unfair to jump to that conclusion. As for looking at things in a different lens, that's a far better mindset to have, I'll agree to that. Maybe its something that I can try out more to make the experience more positive for me.\n\nI'll also agree with you that college is more theory based, which while in theory (hehe) makes sense, its not the way that every single student learns best. If one of classes decides to load heavy on theory, but basically so zilch on application, its so hard for me to understand the concepts as well as I could. I do see however its at that point that I should pursue learning the content in an applied way and go to office hours, talk to my prof, etc.\n\nYour insights are valid and good.

For me, high school felt like a means to an end... you have to get good grades and do well just \"because\" (or to get into college, but I wasn't about that then). But college so far has been a great. I love learning for the sake of learning, I love how flexible a lot of it is, and I love discovering the connections between various topics. In a way, I've begun to weave a narrative of intersectional ecology and biology throughout my course selection. The workload is more reasonable than high school, or at least there's far less busywork. I don't really think about it being only a means to an end, because I love what I'm doing now so much. \n\nI guess because I've found ways to relate all the disparate things I \"have to\" do, it feels less like a set of requirements and more like a journey. That said, I'm saying all of this as someone who intends to progress into research and I might still have some stars in my eyes. I hope you can find more satisfaction from the rest of your time at college.",

A book excerpt was posted on r/philosophy [here](https://www.zedbooks.net/blog/posts/free-time-pressures-employability-refusal-work/) and provides insight from a couple philosophers dating as far back as the early 20th century. \n\nPeople may feel negatively towards this but I\u2019m pursuing a degree in philosophy as well as minor degrees in Anthropology and Marketing; I personally feel that my courses and endeavors in philosophy has truly been for it in itself and, as such, has afforded me immense fulfillment, but like you I\u2019m doing a summer internship which has been the polar opposite and is draining me physically and mentally. \n\nI\u2019ve no words of advice unfortunately, as I myself am facing similar difficulties.

Like hobbies, etc., or rather what actually is my major?\n\nUsually I do my best to study outside of my room in the presence of other people but in a quiet environment. I've tried so many different combinations to see what works but so little does. Textbooks can be good but boring, videos often can't keep me hooked cause my attention span is so short, so I usually end up reading through in class or posted notes. Also, working out practice problems in groups, using general online resources and articles, etc.\n\nNow that I think about it, it could also be a case of I can't pin down a way that 100% works for me when it comes to studying.

Because there is no such thing as long-term understanding in careers unless you are in research! Business and the nature of jobs change to rapidly and randomly that you can't learn long term stuff in a single class. Long term learnings come from your ability to look between all the different classes you take and draw connections between them to create a system of relationships and learning that you can successfully navigate in the future to solve new unique problems.",

It puts me in a position to be very successful and make my life what I want of it, all depending on how hard I individually work. I know that not all of it is useless, and a lot of it is pertinent and helps me to understand the world and my career a little bit better.\n\nBut, the process I personally go through in learning and succeeding in many of the courses I do isn't fulfilling. It isn't fun, or engaging, or even entertaining in anyway. Sometimes, and it heavily depends on the professor, its just painful. Right now I'm retaking a course from the Spring with a new professor and I LOVE IT, not because of the material, but because the way the class and content is structured makes so much sense for me as an individual. Its impossible to do that for every course despite having more freedom on college than in highschool.\n\nI suppose a way to reword my post, at least the text, would be more that modern day academia kind of forces to be college a means to an end, and not an education. Professors can make or break courses and material that you are supposed to love and be interested in. Also, there is so much pressure to do everything while also studying, keeping up your mental health, having a social circle, and maintaining enough time to take care of yourself. I know its not impossible, plenty of people have done it. It just frustrates me to no end that the environment in which I am learning has in a way ruined my love and pursuit of knowledge.

But when you actually get a job you will probably look back on college and remember that it primarily was a time of learning and education because once you get out in the real world you won't really have an opportunity to devote most of your days to learning something new even if you are stressed and burnt out at the moment about making grades. Your primary function will be as the cog in the machine that is your company repetitively doing the same tasks again and again. So enjoy it while you can.",

The thing with an undergrad these days is that it's generally just teaching you the basic skills and methods in that field, and if you never actually put them to use, you don't realize what you actually *have* picked up long-term. Grad school is useful not only because most places require graduate degrees these days, but also because it forces you to use them, and suddenly you realize how much you actually *did* learn.\n\nHowever, the way you speak about university is how I felt about community college. I felt differently about university, but that's because I was studying my passion by that point and everything was exciting to me, even the things that stressed me out -- my Master's degree was a whole circle of stress and excitement.

I will concede that those who attend top tier private and public Universities and decide to major in business have great odds of landing a good job but the reality is that most business grads coming out of university programs are pretty mediocre. Countless studies have been done highlighting how vocation based majors after graduation possess the same base level knowledge  than when they started compared to their peers so I do believe I am justified in observing that a business degree really isn\u2019t a credible representation of a college graduate( omitting top tier public and private institutions).",
