I'm sure I've said this once here on Reddit already, but I'll say it again: alcohol is not a requirement to have a good time. You don't need to drink to have fun in college. This is coming from someone who likes to drink and socially drinks in college. Don't let yourself feel pressured just because other people drink.",
