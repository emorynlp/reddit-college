  "text": "(idk if this is the right sub)\nOk so when I was in hs freshman and sophomore year I didn\u2019t get exactly get the best grades, I wasn\u2019t horrible but they weren\u2019t as good as I wanted them to be. (Jr & Sr yr we\u2019re a lot better) but my point is that when I started college I always feel so worried about my grades and always have those thoughts abt my past in hs and how I didn\u2019t get the best grades and I\u2019m worried I might continue to get bad grades again. Ik I shouldn\u2019t let my past define my future but it\u2019s just kind of hard to not think about it. Like I used to not do well in math in hs and so far in college I\u2019m doing good in it but I\u2019m still always worried I\u2019m gonna fall back into doing bad again. Same thing with my personality, I\u2019ve been kind of shy in hs and now in college I\u2019m a bit more open than before but sometimes I think about how I was always quiet in hs and dong want to continue being quiet in college yk. How can I overcome these thoughts and move on from the past?",

      "text": "just don't think about it too much. Think about the future and what you can and will do. Nobody has to know you were the shy person in HS, you can be whoever you want to be in college. It sounds like you've at least started changing so just keep rolling with it, you'll be fine.",
