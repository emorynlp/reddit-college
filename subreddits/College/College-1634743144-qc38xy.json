  "title:": "How to not feel like a loser after I've come back to university with 23 years old?",
  "text": "I don't care because I'm just here to get my degree so I can get a better job but at the same I kinda do care. And also I came back after I \"froze\" my registration and went to work. So I have a few disciplines already done, with a few more left so I am in a situation where I don't belong in any \"year\", everyone already is an a group they don't really want to meet new people. \n\nBut I'm sure they look at my age or the year of my registration and think \"yikes she's still here? What a loser, I hope I don't end up like her\" \n\nBah I shouldn't care but I also can't stop feeling like a loser whenever I'm in class. Studying at home is so peaceful and I enjoy it so much, I'm also in my comfort zone with my boyfriend. But then I go to class and it's warzone of emotions. Once I left the building just feeling like crying.",

I definitely understand that you may feel out of place when around younger/conventional-age students, but you need to remember that you are there with life experience they don't have. You know what you want out of university, and it sounds like your studies themselves are successful. As a prof, I really value students like you, who've had some time to really consider what they want out of the experience. So often it leads to really strong engagement and performance.",
