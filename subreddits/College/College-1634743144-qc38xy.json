  "title:": "How to not feel like a loser after I've come back to university with 23 years old?",
  "text": "I don't care because I'm just here to get my degree so I can get a better job but at the same I kinda do care. And also I came back after I \"froze\" my registration and went to work. So I have a few disciplines already done, with a few more left so I am in a situation where I don't belong in any \"year\", everyone already is an a group they don't really want to meet new people. \n\nBut I'm sure they look at my age or the year of my registration and think \"yikes she's still here? What a loser, I hope I don't end up like her\" \n\nBah I shouldn't care but I also can't stop feeling like a loser whenever I'm in class. Studying at home is so peaceful and I enjoy it so much, I'm also in my comfort zone with my boyfriend. But then I go to class and it's warzone of emotions. Once I left the building just feeling like crying.",
