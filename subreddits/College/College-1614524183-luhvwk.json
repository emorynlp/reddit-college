At the age of 16 I decided that I wanted to be a forensic pathologist, forensics, death, crime, investigation are honestly the only thing I've ever been interested in. And then, I began dabbling in drugs. I got my first felony at twenty (2003), for .02 grams of heroin. I didn't fully understand the law at the time and I spent the next year and a half, after being released from a 9 month incarceration, trying to figure out how to expunge the felony and if I would ever be able to get licensed to practice medicine of any kind... What I found sunk me. I relapsed. I was arrested in 2007 while I was pregnant, and not using drugs, because there was a spoon in my daughter's father's truck and a needle under a tree in front of us at a park- while we were talking about HIM sobering up and sitting in his truck. I fought it, but I was eventually convicted in 2010. I had been sober six months ago that time as well. In 2012 I finally decided that I needed to get my life together -for good- whether I was going to be a felon for the rest of my life or not, and just accept that I would probably never be able to hold a degree that I would be able to use, or that would bring me any type of joy in life. I got sober, and began going back to school, and I was just going to major in engineering. I absolutely love school and it was important for my self care. In 2018 Ohio changed their laws, I literally cried tears of joy for a week. A year later, in the summer of 2019 (one month after I celebrated seven years of sobriety), I expunged all five of the charges on my record, including the three felonies. I still get discouraged sometimes because I know that depending on what type of background check is being performed, they are still able to be found, and I know there will be times that I will need to disclose them. Anyhoo, I am back on track for a degree in forensic science!  THANK YOU so much for sharing. I love reading the comments and remembering that I am not alone. Keep your head up.
