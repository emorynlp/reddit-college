  "text": "Does anybody have any advice into how to smooth the transition back into college classes. I just started classes two weeks ago as a non-traditional student and I am having a really hard time adjusting to being back in school. I have been able to keep up with the work though and I have made it to all the classes that are being held remotely  but mentally I feel awful.",

Writing has personally made me feel a bit slow since it\u2019s been several years since I\u2019ve written a paper, and even back then I wasn\u2019t a great student in high school.",

It\u2019s really hard to get ahead because it feels like I get no days off and I hardly have time to study outside of doing the assignments and readings. I try to plan times to get ahead during \u201ceasy\u201d weeks based on the syllabus though. During your work using the pomos technique can really help efficiency and give you much needed breaks",
