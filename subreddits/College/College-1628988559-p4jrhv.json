You could say something to someone, who knows if the outcome will be so beneficial. If it's an option, think of finishing the degree somewhere else. Where I'm from, the education system is unfairly structured around grades, but we do have advanced methods and knowledgeable staff. For computer science some places develop custom tester programs to give an initial grade based on compilation time, runtime, outputs and other programmable stuff. In more advanced courses the professors do a manual check to grade for more advanced efficiency and proper code usage. Could be that this course is just introductory and the professor doesn't think it's too important but then why give passing grades to poor work. Not saying your work is poor, you seem like you know your stuff. But ask the classmates that turned in garbage work and see what they got, that could give you an idea.\n\nIf leaving is not an option, then just go with it and if the stuff interests you, keep learning on your own and discover new challenges.
