  "text": "I'm a freshman and started my first year in college online due to covid. I took too many classes that I could handle and tried to drop one or two. Fast forward to midterms and I'm checking my classes I realized that I had never dropped one class. I have a 0 and missed my midterm for the class, I'm past the drop out period. Is there anything I can do to get a passing grade for the class?",

I know my school allows students who forgot to drop a class and/or never attended to withdraw if their petition to do so is accepted.",
