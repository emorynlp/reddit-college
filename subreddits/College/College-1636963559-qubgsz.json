  "text": "i\u2019m a 20 yr old currently in my second year at a community college. i\u2019m studying artificial intelligence because i thought it was something i was interested in, but it\u2019s boring and i\u2019m not learning shit because it\u2019s so hard to keep my attention on something i\u2019m not interested in. i don\u2019t want to do something like that for the rest of my life. i\u2019m not the type of person that can sit in front of a desk for 40 hours a week. i want to travel and have fun (corny, i know) which is why i think being a pilot is the career for me. but it\u2019s really expensive to even start that career path. what should i do?",

      "text": "Ultimately it\u2019s up to you to decide what you want to do. Practically speaking, you can take a career assessment test and explore other majors. The benefit of community college is that you can transfer your credits to a 4-year and change your major. Also do extensive research into piloting. Attend a class, speak to professors and students.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t have any helpful knowledge with becoming a pilot, sorry! However, if you aren\u2019t entirely set on becoming a pilot, there are some other careers that involve traveling. Have you heard of becoming an exploration geologist(Along with other Geology careers)? You can travel to many different countries looking for gold, oil, gas, etc. Being an Anthropologist, Archeologist, Truck Driver, Traveling Nurse, Working on a cruise ship/Cargo Ship, or a Private Security Contractor are definitely a couple careers that involve traveling. Do any of these interest you? Try to figure out common likes/dislikes on the careers mentioned and see if they match up with your interest in being a pilot in case it doesn\u2019t work out or you change your mind you can have some backup options.",

Yet I\u2019m majoring in CS to slave away art a 9 to 5.\n\nI recommend you still get a degree. While not all jobs require it, many jobs listings these days will require a BS for pilots. You can also work to save up some money to attend flight school.",
