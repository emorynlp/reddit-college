I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q2rwox/witness_cheating_on_exam/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and made me want to ask this. i understand you are their to focus on your own degree but what if their score can hurt you ? my class grades matter for the school/program i need to get into, what if the person who cheated gets a better grade then me so now they enter the program i wanted ? it can hurt me/ my chances of getting in along with others who are trying HARD. isn\u2019t more embarrassing to cheat then to just report them? i don\u2019t want to be THAT person on campus but i also want the best future i can get for my self.",

But you will have much to show because you are putting in the work and learning the material. They may have good grades but they will lack the skills and knowledge that it takes to succeed in that program. You on the other hand will have everything that the cheater lacks. And admissions panelists can spot a bullshitter from a mile away. Let the cheater learn the hard way.",

I doubt it will affect you as much as you think practically.",
