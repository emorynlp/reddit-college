My high school experience wasn\u2019t the best because I felt terribly lonely all the time. I hardly had any friends, never went to parties or just out with anyone, didn\u2019t have a boyfriend(still haven\u2019t had one) and being introverted didn\u2019t help the situation either. I missed out on a ton of things and memories because of my self esteem issues and introvertedness. I graduated with one friend I thought would be my life friend but that didn\u2019t work out and I now keep in contact with no one from high school. \n\nCommunity college was pretty much the same situation. The first 2 semesters were great though. I met a lot of cool people but those friendships never lasted. The last 2 semesters I felt just as lonely as I did in high school. \n\nFast forward to now, after me transferring to my university and doing all online classes for the past 2 semesters, I still feel like the same person I was in high school. I will say that I\u2019ve changed a lot mentally and physically however. I gained a lot more confidence, came out of my shell a little, and my mindset isn\u2019t the same. But after scrolling through Instagram and stalking the pages of my former classmates, seeing them doing great things, having fun with friends, getting married, having kids etc. I can\u2019t help but feel like I haven\u2019t changed at all these past 3 years. \n\nI haven\u2019t made any amazing memories or experienced anything spectacular and I can\u2019t help but feel sad because of it. I have only one person I can call my friend. I\u2019m 21 and I feel like I should\u2019ve done more. \n\nI guess I\u2019m saying all of this to say, does anyone feel the same or went through something similar that can share their piece of advice? It sucks feeling like your youth is being wasted away.\n\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t expect this to get as much attention as it did, but thank you all so much for the advice. It\u2019s comforting in a way to realize just how many people can relate to my situation because it makes me feel a little less alone.", "author": "sunshinexxxo16", "created": 1617065841, "retrieved": 1632802001, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1411, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gt3arpa": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gt3arpa/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1617322484, "upvotes": 1}, "gszqt87": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gszqt87/", "text": "'We shouldn't compare ourself to others'", "author": "ahmeds123456789", "created": 1617248348, "upvotes": 1}, "gsw8a9d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gsw8a9d/", "text": "Get off instagram/Facebt/Twitter bc your just seeing a highlight reel if the \"good times\" it's all fake", "author": "hasrocks1", "created": 1617178451, "upvotes": 1}, "gsw0uh4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gsw0uh4/", "text": "For what it's worth, you're not alone man.

I just wanted to give you a couple of things to think about when you start to think that you aren't enough:\n\n1. when people post on social media platforms, they don't post a ton of pictures of what went wrong that day.  You are looking at an idealized version of life.  People are vacationing, celebrating, going, doing, they never post a picture of themselves crying their eyes out because just one more thing went wrong than they could take. They never tell you that they are $50K in debt and about to lose their job. They never post that their rich exec husband cheats with just about every woman out there.  NEVER use social media as a measure of your standing and certainly don't use it to judge your own value.\n2. Life isn't a race and there is only one prize given at the end of life and that is death.

The young guy paused for just a second and then asked the guy, what made him work so hard and the old guy responded, \"so I could retire to a life on the beach to enjoy the years I have left with my family.\"  (Different paths can lead to the same exact place, pick the right one for you)", "author": "GradResearchAsst52", "created": 1617119007, "upvotes": 2}, "gst6txn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gst6txn/", "text": "damn, too relatable. really blows being a college transfer student rn lol i\u2019m lowkey dreading living on campus next semester and want to try to get out of it. i\u2019m past the whole \u201ccollege experience\u201d thing at this point\n\nalso friendly reminder that instagram and most other social media platforms are nothing but a highlight reel. i had to remove myself from a lot of social media over the last few years because i would get jealous everytime i saw my friends having amazing times at their universities while i was suffering at community college lmao. don\u2019t get too worked up on what you see on social media i feel like at this point it\u2019s there to make you feel shitty :)", "author": "SirManPony", "created": 1617118584, "upvotes": 1}, "gst5lqq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gst5lqq/", "text": "Your former classmates are getting **married** *and* have **kids** at *21?!?!?*\nUhhh, you're a lot better off than them in the long run, trust me", "author": "OtakuTwink", "created": 1617118039, "upvotes": 3}, "gst5jx4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gst5jx4/", "text": "I felt this way a lot too.

Honestly, I think it's so common at our age to feel this way. Social media doesn't help as we have the tendency to compare our lives with others.. Remember though, those people experiencing \"great things\" may have struggles or feel the same way as you behind the scenes!\n\nUniversity is really where you make your lifelong friends. Right now covid is getting in the way, but I truly believe that when things go back to normal you'll make friends in class. I really recommend joining a club. Clubs I've been a part of have more of a family-type feel, and I think it's easier to make friends there as, depending on the club, it's more of a social enviornment.\n\nAlso. I recommend looking into befriender organisations, where you can find others who feel the same way as you. Maybe if you make a friend that way you can experience cool things together!\n\nLastly, I think you should write yourself a list. On this list, write down all the things you want to experience. What things make you jealous of old classmates? What would your ideal life look like right now? What are the experiences you feel you have missed out on? Etc. When you look at this list, can you see anything that you can do by yourself? Like you could maybe travel alone to see some amazing things. You could do something a little crazy like bungee jumping or skydiving. Want to do something meaningful? You could do some volunteering (good for making friends too). Want to experience some dating? Try a dating site (stay safe though!). \n\nI know in the moment it's so easy to get wrapped up in feeling like your youth is slipping away, but please remember that there are very few things that you're too old to do.

Your youth youth is spent in school, you dont have time to live really until youre done with school, and then you work a lot, im not going to tell you that everything will just magically get better. But ive found as my 20s progress that for one, even at 25 and approaching 30 in the proffesional settings you're still viewed as a kid in a lot of ways, because these old timers really have left their youth behind and it feels like youth and time for life and fun are slipping away like sand through your fingers but you have, like someone said above, a full decade of life to experiment and enjoy before the grown up world REALLY expects you to have your shit together.  A boss of mine once told me \"your 20s are for figuring out what you want to do, your 30s are for mastering it.\" So this big \"future\"(TM) that youre told to go to college for and begin at 23 with a bachelors degree is actually the life you'll hit in your 40s by that logic. And as for wanderlust and FOMO its always important to remember that social media especially travel and instagram is, by design, highlighting all the best moments with none of the bad. In my early twenties (22-23) i had a nice job, in an office, i got vacation days and weekends off. I spent a lot of my weekends going to shows and used my vacation time to go to EDC (EDM music festival in Vegas, you probably know that lol but maybe not). It was a very instagramable period of my life, and i do look back on it with a lot of fondess. But the things that wouldn't have made the instagram feed were romantic turmoil, medium coke addiction as well as the beginnings of alcoholisn, and a whole lot of stress and housing insecurity. Life sucks, but its also wonderful. 2 things that i would want to stress and really have you take away are:\n\nComparing your life to others, especially those seen only through the lens of social media, is only going to upset you. Its your life, and arbitrary comparisons to others wont make you feel any better only worse. When you see someone struggling in life i bet you don't think \"man, thank god i havent fucked everything up like that loser\" so why do you treat yourself like that loser for not have X experience?\n\nAnd\n\nThere is no ticking clock, joy and experience and fufillment dont care if you're 19 or 32. Obviously if you want to be a solo free climber that climbs mount Everest in only jean shorts with a single water bottle for supplies then your better off doing it at 20 than 60. But barring extreme athletic achievements i promise seeing tokyo or rome or whatever is just as amazing at 30 as at 20. In fact your appteciation for life and travel will only grow. Thats why you never see 50 year old jake pauls being absolute asses in foreign contries.\n\nTo wrap it all up, when i was 23, and in the best shape of my life, traveling to places to take in once in a life time musical and memorable experiences. I was tormenting myself trying to be what i thought this girl would like, avoiding some of the issues i had with myself with drugs and alcohol, working in a stressful job that i felt the need to go beyond my own abilitys to achieve even 'adequate' performance. And living on a couch, with no savings and no vehicle. Now at 26 i have my car, with decent milage and only a few years old. Im self employeed, running a kitchen for a private club essentially a small business owner and sooo much less stressed than i was as an admin assistant for a now defunct business. Ive lived in the same apartment with my gf and roommate for 2.5 years, my gf that i first met just months after finally completely severing all ties with the girl i chased and tortured myself over for a year in a half. I work a lot, but i enjoy simply going to a park or nature perserve and being among the trees as i do going to florida and spending a week on the beach. I work a lot, and yet i enjoy my day and my pay more than i did when i had a strict 9-5 and went on lavish trips to instragramable destinations. I found love by taking up a part time second job at a restaurant as a cook, with the bartender. And i found my current job by starting as a part time cook at a pool hall at just the right moment, and then answering when opportunity knocked. \n\nA lot of things in life happen solely for pure blind luck, but that doesnt mean that only a lucky few get the rewards. Luck is the result of being in the right place at the right time, every opportunity will be seized by SOMEONE so to find the opportunities you want all you have to do is be honest with yourself and self aware of your abilities and desires, and work toward them until an opportunity arrives. And you do that your whole life and then you die. Thats not a cynical or nilhistic statement just just true, so why spend time wishing things were different or being envious of others supposed achievements Just do you, you'll find happiness and fulfilment in one place or another, but it wont be in someone else's adventures becayse they're not you.", "author": "Interesting_Bonus_67", "created": 1617086655, "upvotes": 3}, "gsrx4tg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gsrx4tg/", "text": "There\u2019s an inherent bias in what is shown on Instagram.

The pandemic has hindered many aspects of social life. This may sound very cliche, but you are super young! Many people report finding more meaningful friendships and relationships in their late 20s and 30s. I find that working on oneself is a wonderful way to attract to your life the things you want and always remember that nobody\u2019s lives are as picture perfect as they look on social media.", "author": "lealacademics", "created": 1617067827, "upvotes": 437}, "gsr5d67": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mg461c/im_21_and_i_feel_like_im_wasting_my_youth/gsr5d67/", "text": "I\u2019m 23 and just finishing my first year at college. I talk to maybe 3 people from high school and one of them I met a month ago in college. I got friends who have kids, engaged/married, take exotic trips, finished university. Meanwhile I live in my moms basement never really had a relationship either. \n\nYour time will come. The friends from high school a lot of them were friends solely because you saw eachother everyday. And honestly it\u2019s a part of life that doesn\u2019t really go away. \n\nOnce you start going to your uni in-person things will change. It\u2019s a whole other beast of its own. Lol. We\u2019re in some really hard times right now and it\u2019s even harder with school being online. It\u2019s okay to not be okay sometimes. \n\nKeep your chin up.

Adult friendships are often based more on common interests than \"convenience\" friendships like people form in elementary-high school. So when you get the opportunity, join clubs. Start volunteering. Go out to the places where you'll meet people who like the same things you do. Whether that be concerts, festivals, even the Renaissance Faire or something lol. The reason friendships like you described don't really last long is because the only thing y'all might have in common is you both have the same class but beyond that, what else do you guys have in common? Probably no serious shared interests. \n\nFind the people who are passionate about what you're passionate about.", "author": null, "created": 1617066244, "upvotes": 36}}}
