  "text": "Anyone working on a group project right now? They\u2019ve always been extremely painful for me. The tools suck, everything is scattered, people are lazy. How do you currently deal with it? My friend and I are working on a project to try to make them easier. Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in chatting with us about your experience.",

      "text": "A course I took last Spring semester was basically one long group project and yeah, I hated it. It wasn't the laziness so much as power trips. I was paired with two alpha types who thought they were in charge. Turns out they were both terrible at writing, grammar and proofreading, so my role devolved to turing their pretentious, poorly written crap into something of academic caliber. Total misery.",
