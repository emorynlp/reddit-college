I cannot speak on how every professor adapted to it, but I had one that would repeat \u201cI am not your tech support\u201d when we informed her how she fucked her canvas page so bad we couldn\u2019t submit anything. Others would cancel zoom class because they were busy, etc. a funny story is how an older professor known for being eccentric left a few bongs in view during a zoom class. Another would drink cocktails on camera.\n\nThe worse part is how the school rearranged the semester. Instead of taking 4 classes at once, we took 2 at once over 7 weeks, then switching to the other 2 classes at midterms. No real explanation as to why, no real explanation as to what they hoped to accomplish with this, they just sort of did it. I\u2019ve spoken to a lot of people about this change, and no one, from faculty to students, seemed to benefit from it. A truly baffling decision.\n\nThe school was incredibly opaque when it came to telling students about COVID cases on campus. We were given numbers like \u201cif 5% of the student body gets it, we\u2019re all going home\u201d, and curiously enough, when cases were rising steadily and it seemed like we\u2019d hit the mark any day, the campus would stop communicating new cases. \n\nI\u2019m looking to transfer.", "author": "Hopefulaccount7987", "created": 1632203108, "upvotes": 2}, "hdnwusf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/przh7n/how_did_your_college_react_to_covid/hdnwusf/", "text": "My college adapted to online fairly quickly, but it was fairly obvious that a lot of the professors were still in an in person mindset, so a lot of the material ended up not transitioning over well into online classes.. physics lab last semester online was a complete mess.", "author": "YouBoreMeHard", "created": 1632186769, "upvotes": 2}, "hdm5uqs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/przh7n/how_did_your_college_react_to_covid/hdm5uqs/", "text": "In my opinion, really well. They adapted to online really smoothly as most of the school already used canvas for everything and the lectures/quizzes were the only ones that were in person. That was easy to switch to online with meetings and online quizzes. There was tons of support from the school and made arrangements for students in need of food and got enough donations to offer gift cards instead of a food box. They also rented out laptops and hotspots for those in need of one, which is huge for a community college. They\u2019ve also been using their grants and given them as money rather than other things because they already have tons of resources to help students in place. They know that students are going to be struggling with money more than anything. They also made their empty parking lots into a county testing site as well as a vaccination site. Even when numbers started going down, they kept live classes to maybe a 20% and that\u2019s mostly to sciences or things with labs and more difficult classes that students were doing poorly online with. Most continue to be online and some of the programs they did start because of covid they\u2019re planning to keep on", "author": "3lbowMacar0ni", "created": 1632159305, "upvotes": 3}}}
