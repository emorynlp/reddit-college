When I try to perfect things, my professors get pissed because \"it's late\". Like yeah, asshole, I'm the one paying for my education here.

Fill the rubric out like it's a worksheet, very minimally using bullets and main ideas. Throw in the link to resources you got that info from right after the info if it's an assignment where you need to have citations. Do this step as soon as you can after the assignment is assigned, and let it be quick and dirty - no formatting just vomit all the important things down. Now you know you haven't missed any main parts of the assignment because you worked directly from the rubric so that's problem 1 solved.\n\nThen come back sometime later (but not too long that you don't have a clear memory of everything in the outline. Fort short assignments you can do this all at once but for like 5-7 page papers I usually break this up into two different days) and open an empty word doc in a separate tab. Put in your title/name formatting and all your headers, then using your rubric outline as a guide just write the whole thing out. Since you've already got everything important on that doc it should flow really easily. Every time you hit a reference throw it in your references section. Read through it once or maybe twice at the end just to check for flow/grammar and you're done. \n\nIf it's a really important assignment or a term paper I might then use the written out doc as a guide to write a new final draft doc. The key is always starting a new draft in a new file instead of picking apart and moving around stuff all within one doc that gets messy and makes it easier to lose your focus. Split-screen the reference draft with the new file so you can see them both at the same time and just go full-speed ahead.\n\nI used to spend forever nitpicking and procrastinating on my assignments but this revolutionized my efficiency. Remember, the goal of assignments isn't to make something perfect, nothing is ever perfect, it's to display that you're learning and synthesizing new information and you're able to communicate that information to others.", "author": "Contntlbreakfst", "created": 1632757349, "upvotes": 2}, "heh43fb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw4ah4/im_taking_too_long_on_homework_and_assignments/heh43fb/", "text": "I have a moderate case of unmedicated ADHD (though I'm looking into meds after these comments). \n\nI've had to do stuff to focus like the Pomodoro method: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro\\_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)\n\nI also have to use a timer on my favorite distraction sites (like reddit)... so I only get like an hour total of distractions for the day then the browser won't load those sites anymore. \n\nThere are a load of chrome extensions for these methods if you use chrome. \n\nI also had to accept good enough, and fight that perfectionism urge. Points deducted is better than a zero for being late.  \"Just get it done and MOVE ON\" is my internal dialogue on work-heavy days. \n\nOH, and caffeine helps ADHD's to focus more than getting us wound up (YMMV) just give a good ol' giant cup of coffee a try and see if it helps. \n\nSpeaking of which, back to work!
