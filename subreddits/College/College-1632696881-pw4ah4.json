  "text": "This has become a serious hell for me. I've got ADHD, and while I do receive accommodations, it's been a pain in the fucking ass trying to catch up with deadlines. A simple 1 hour long assignment takes me at least 5 hours to finish. I can't help that I'm either a perfectionist or I don't effort in at all. If I leave it at \"good enough\", I get deducted points because I \"missed\" something. When I try to perfect things, my professors get pissed because \"it's late\". Like yeah, asshole, I'm the one paying for my education here. I waste entire days on an assignment that's due by the end of the day, and have zero time to study for the upcoming midterm tomorrow. \n\nHow tf does anyone manage this shit?",

      "text": "I had the same problem as an undergrad and now that I'm a TA I have good advice about this for assignments that are essay/text-based and it works for longer discussion board posts, too. \n\nFor any assignment that has a rubric, copy-paste the rubric/instructions into Word or w/e processer you use. Fill the rubric out like it's a worksheet, very minimally using bullets and main ideas. Throw in the link to resources you got that info from right after the info if it's an assignment where you need to have citations. Do this step as soon as you can after the assignment is assigned, and let it be quick and dirty - no formatting just vomit all the important things down. Now you know you haven't missed any main parts of the assignment because you worked directly from the rubric so that's problem 1 solved.\n\nThen come back sometime later (but not too long that you don't have a clear memory of everything in the outline. Fort short assignments you can do this all at once but for like 5-7 page papers I usually break this up into two different days) and open an empty word doc in a separate tab. Put in your title/name formatting and all your headers, then using your rubric outline as a guide just write the whole thing out. Since you've already got everything important on that doc it should flow really easily. Every time you hit a reference throw it in your references section. Read through it once or maybe twice at the end just to check for flow/grammar and you're done. \n\nIf it's a really important assignment or a term paper I might then use the written out doc as a guide to write a new final draft doc. The key is always starting a new draft in a new file instead of picking apart and moving around stuff all within one doc that gets messy and makes it easier to lose your focus. Split-screen the reference draft with the new file so you can see them both at the same time and just go full-speed ahead.\n\nI used to spend forever nitpicking and procrastinating on my assignments but this revolutionized my efficiency. Remember, the goal of assignments isn't to make something perfect, nothing is ever perfect, it's to display that you're learning and synthesizing new information and you're able to communicate that information to others.",

      "text": "I have a moderate case of unmedicated ADHD (though I'm looking into meds after these comments). \n\nI've had to do stuff to focus like the Pomodoro method: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro\\_Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)\n\nI also have to use a timer on my favorite distraction sites (like reddit)... so I only get like an hour total of distractions for the day then the browser won't load those sites anymore. \n\nThere are a load of chrome extensions for these methods if you use chrome. \n\nI also had to accept good enough, and fight that perfectionism urge. Points deducted is better than a zero for being late.  \"Just get it done and MOVE ON\" is my internal dialogue on work-heavy days. \n\nOH, and caffeine helps ADHD's to focus more than getting us wound up (YMMV) just give a good ol' giant cup of coffee a try and see if it helps. \n\nSpeaking of which, back to work! Good luck!!",

It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student. The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/college/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)",

I would read a short sentence, forget what I read and then reread it about 100 times and still didn\u2019t comprehend it. Understanding simple instructions was like me solving a Rubik\u2019s cube lmao. \n\nBut once I got diagnosed and medicated my life literally changed, it was like my brain was blind and I put glasses on them and I could finally understand everything and stay on task. At the moment I have a 4.0 GPA in college and I\u2019m in the honors society working towards the dental field. I strongly recommend you find any doctor that has good reviews and ask anyone in your area who has ADHD if they can tell you the doctor that diagnosed them, because being medicated really changes your life entirely.",

It took her an extra year to graduate, but she did not take summer courses which was an option if she wanted to do it. She kept saying how helpful it was to just have less work overall- she could do better in the classes she was taking because she had less on her plate, while still managing self-care and college fun. She also was getting way better sleep and her quality of life just increased overall because of it.",

The meds help a ton but I also recognize that university is just pretty much a 24/7 job for someone with ADHD, at least someone like me. At least the meds stave away the depression that can come from not being able to get anything done.",

However, I feel more optimistic whenever I'm on my ADHD medication. I don't feel as paralyzed as when I'm not on it, if that makes sense. I manage to get stuff done as long as I do my part of the work as my medication does.",

I was prescribed generic adderall from my freshman to sophomore year of high school at it helped a lot but I was able to come off adderall junior year and I haven\u2019t used it since. TLDR:Medication helps but self discipline is important for eventually coming of medication. I wish you the best of luck bro",

Then, you look at it and ask yourself what it all means, and go back to the top and type an intro paragraph. \n\nA lot of people take a backwards approach to their assignments... they try to start typing the paper first and then try to meet requirements as they go along.  The better way is to write a paper \"from the inside out\" - you get all the info you need (from class readings or articles you find on the school library database) and paste it all into the document first.  Then, put it in a good sequence, write some paragraph topic sentences so it all makes sense, and at the end you write the intro and the conclusion.",

I found this thread because I just turned in an assignment late tonight and I\u2019m annoyed with myself over the whole thing. It should\u2019ve taken someone an hour & a half maybe three hours tops to finish this assignment. I spent 9 hours on it, 1pm to 1am with a 3 hour class in between. I sat there and worked on it the whole time, I wasn\u2019t distracted or anything! I don\u2019t understand where the time goes when I\u2019m working on something like that. Oh and I\u2019m already medicated. So I\u2019m just the sloooooowest I guess. I can\u2019t offer any help, I just wanted you to know you\u2019re not alone. Just keep moving steady on!",
