      "text": "The day to day jobs of both those careers are likely quite different, so look into what your life will be like after you graduate. They don't seem like very similar careers (to me, at least) so you'll probably find that if you look more into the \"day to day life\" of each of these careers, you'll be more likely to lean one way or the other.",

Med Assistant has various work hours poss 7 days/week and Accounting mainly 8-5pm M-F except in tax season which are long hours. I\u2019d pick what you think you\u2019d enjoy what you do the most and find interesting. Good luck!",

I started my own business from nothing and now I set my own hours and I don't have to worry about driving somewhere to pretend to give a shit about someone else's mission and goals",
