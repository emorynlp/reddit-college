  "text": "I'm into my 6th week of the semester, and one of  my classes that I have twice a week has been canceled 5 times.  The professor has uploaded 1 zoom lecture to make up for everything, that only goes over one part of the class.   Nobody knows what we're doing, and the professor insists that we should all know everything, and that our struggling is on us.  I already have 1 W (I'm a sophomore) and I don't want to drop this class.  But, this is unfair and I know it's going to end badly.  This professor has already been reprimanded by the head of the dept, but is still not holding class or providing adequate amounts of info for her class to pass.  Nobody in my class knows what were doing, because out of the 12 times we should've had this class, we've been in here 5 times.  2 have been \"exam review\" despite us not knowing what is on the exam, and one of them was the intro to class.  We've had 3 in person lectures and 1 zoom.  This isn't enough for us to know anything.  What should I do?  I don't want another W but this is completely unfair and out of my control.",

Their time is occupied by fundraising, political lobbying, and strategic planning regarding the long-term health of the institution.  \n\n2) There is an academic chain of command, and it should be followed.  Faculty report to their chair/head, department chairs/heads report to their Dean, Deans report to the Provost, and the Provost reports to the President.  The Provost is not a well-understood position for many students, but think of them as the \"top boss\" on campus when it comes to any and all academic matters.  They try not to get involved in day-to-day matters, but their office will get involved if you have followed the proper chain of command and still have a legitimate complaint.  If you went right from a Dean to a President, and IF the president even replied at all, the first thing they would do is refer you back to the Provost.",

OP needs an advisor/advocate within the faculty -- someone who knows the system but isn't involved in _this_ process. Hopefully they already have someone they trust. But tenured faculty known for student advocacy or a previous head of the department in question can often be a path to good answers about what to do next in that dept/school's context. \n\nI suggest that too because heads and deans are  constantly dealing with, just, so much. The student is not going to be kept in the loop without someone who's already plugged in.",

If she takes the criticism badly, then go with a couple other students to the Dean and negotiate erasing the W from everyone\u2019s records.

Follow it. Read the readings then start googling or YouTubing the topics. If the book has review questions at the end of sections, make sure you can answer those questions. \n\n2) do you know anyone that has that class with a different teacher? Offer to buy them dinner to catch you up. \n\n3) start a study group with your classmates. Make each person responsible for learning one section well enough to help the others. \n\n4) google your homework questions. Someone took this class when the teacher was having a better year and posted their flash cards online. Word for word. Find them. \n\nY\u2019all, this should not happen, you\u2019re paying good money. That said, the world is not fair and sometimes you\u2019ve got to be self sufficient. You\u2019re going to have jobs where your trainer sucks or you don\u2019t have a dedicated trainer. You\u2019re going to have situations in life that nobody prepared you for. And you are adults now. I\u2019m sorry, but we are no longer guaranteed to be spoon fed anything. \n\nOn the upside, you live in a time where absolutely everything is posted online, so if you develop your Google-fu, you never have to depend on a single person for information again. \n\nSource:  went to school in my 30s, had a couple teachers like this (though not quite as bad). Had to figure it out, but already had adult skills. You can do this.\n\nP.S.  there\u2019s a solid chance this teacher is dealing with terrible times. Maybe they have a sick family member they have to help. Maybe they got the \u201clong covid\u201d where they still can\u2019t function normally six months later.
