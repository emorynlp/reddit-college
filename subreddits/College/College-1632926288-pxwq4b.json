The professor has uploaded 1 zoom lecture to make up for everything, that only goes over one part of the class.   Nobody knows what we're doing, and the professor insists that we should all know everything, and that our struggling is on us.  I already have 1 W (I'm a sophomore) and I don't want to drop this class.  But, this is unfair and I know it's going to end badly.  This professor has already been reprimanded by the head of the dept, but is still not holding class or providing adequate amounts of info for her class to pass.  Nobody in my class knows what were doing, because out of the 12 times we should've had this class, we've been in here 5 times.  2 have been \"exam review\" despite us not knowing what is on the exam, and one of them was the intro to class.  We've had 3 in person lectures and 1 zoom.  This isn't enough for us to know anything.  What should I do?  I don't want another W but this is completely unfair and out of my control.", "author": "omegagoblin", "created": 1632926288, "retrieved": 1632945349, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"herhf7i": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxwq4b/professor_has_canceled_class_5_times_and_keeps/herhf7i/", "text": "Aside from the obvious advice of continuing to follow up with the department head, if you're truly intent on trying to pass under the circumstances, check if there are any textbook chapters to read or ask students from past semesters if they recorded any of their lectures. \n\nBut if the withdrawal deadline comes up and nothing has been fixed, I'd drop the class.", "author": "Nihil_esque", "created": 1632945236, "upvotes": 1}, "herczcc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxwq4b/professor_has_canceled_class_5_times_and_keeps/herczcc/", "text": "Dang what's the topic?
