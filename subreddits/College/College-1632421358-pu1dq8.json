Did you do that? A tip I got in my class is if you use any information that requires specific knowledge not commonly known, you need to cite where you got the information. Like if you have a source talking about 90 percent of whatever thing does someone. You shouldn't include the specific 90 percent detail without citing your source, because you had to have gotten 90 percent from somewhere.", "author": "CityLightsWriter", "created": 1632424799, "upvotes": 3}}}
