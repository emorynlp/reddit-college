And I\u2019m sure that number has risen as the length of the quarantine has extended.

Depending on your degree, look up some local businesses that feature what you do and reach out. If we\u2019re still in quarantine you can ask for a zoom call\u2014then talk to them about how they got their job, what their career path looked like, what are the best aspects of the job, etc. Or, if things have started to open you can ask to shadow for a day. Not only does this give you information and experience, but this is a fantastic way to network. Down the road, should that business need another employee and you apply-your name would stick out to them because of their interactions with you. And, if you keep in contact with them, they may even help so far as recommending positions in other businesses or areas.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in working a temporary essential position if income is needed, either.
