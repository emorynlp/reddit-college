Also, Unemployment is at an all time high.\nDoes anyone have any data to support my argument to my parents?\n\n\nEDIT:I am attempting to transfer to another school in the fall,\nSummer school at my community college is full for the class i need to take\nI already have a job(but cant go due to it being a fitness center position)\nI am an International Relations Major\nAlso sorry for the big spelling mistake, I go to fast when I type",

I have been doing unpaid internships on my time off from school with not even an offer at a job in the future. I literally spent 5 days a week from 8-3 at an internship last summer and maybe 2-3 days a week this past school year and the director didn't even offer me a paid position while two other people got hired (I have more experience than them). The job market for academics is tough honestly and right now is the worst time to look for a job. Or an internship cuz everything is pretty much closed indefinitely but try asking professors for remote/online opportunities because they might know.",

The reason internships aren't hiring is because recruiting season is over. I would encourage you to do summer courses or work on some projects this Summer.

I did the same thing in early March and visited with one of my school\u2019s career advisors whose specialty is in the job search category. At that time (only two weeks into quarantine) she had reported that about 50% of the students who had received internships had actually had them rescinded. And I\u2019m sure that number has risen as the length of the quarantine has extended. She also noted that many employers had entered into a hiring freeze\u2014where the positions will stay open, and they\u2019ll take applicants, but they won\u2019t follow up with them until they know how this is all going to blow over.\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t crazy\u2014jobs aren\u2019t hiring for many positions, especially low level where the need for training is high. And if you did get an internship, it likely wouldn\u2019t have the value you\u2019d be interested in. There are other options, however, to get some experience in the midst of this craziness. Depending on your degree, look up some local businesses that feature what you do and reach out. If we\u2019re still in quarantine you can ask for a zoom call\u2014then talk to them about how they got their job, what their career path looked like, what are the best aspects of the job, etc. Or, if things have started to open you can ask to shadow for a day. Not only does this give you information and experience, but this is a fantastic way to network. Down the road, should that business need another employee and you apply-your name would stick out to them because of their interactions with you. And, if you keep in contact with them, they may even help so far as recommending positions in other businesses or areas.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no shame in working a temporary essential position if income is needed, either. It doesn\u2019t negate the opportunity to learn. Right now everyone is working with what\u2019s been dealt to them. Some of the cards suck, true, but we\u2019ll get through it.",

You should be able to see if your college/program has a career counseling center online as well as the contact info and from there you can explain you\u2019re an incoming transfer.\n\nIn my experience there\u2019s always an extra push to help incoming transfer students as they don\u2019t have the same setup to help them as a freshman coming on campus do. You can also ask if there are any mentoring programs available on campus and how to get involved with those. Especially if their program includes alumni rather than just peer mentoring\u2014that\u2019s another great opportunity to network and learn at the same time.",

                      "text": "Actually even if you haven\u2019t been accepted they might still help. The career center at my college does a kind of counseling for potential students too, so they\u2019re used to working with people who haven\u2019t been accepted. I also think it\u2019s important to remember why someone would pick to work as a career counselor at a college\u2014odds are they\u2019re doing it because they want to help, so you reaching out, even before acceptance, is a good sign to them and they\u2019ll likely want to help.\n\n\nI also understand if that seems really stressful to do, too. Sometimes we feel like we have to \u2018earn\u2019 others help\u2014either by being admitted to a school, working with someone, or providing some other form of compensation. But in my experience people often want to help because the payout they receive is seeing you succeed. \n\n\nI\u2019m also happy to help with any resume, cover letter, application forms, etc if you\u2019d like. You can always PM me. I\u2019ve done a lot in the career development aspect and I have a good network for job questions, too\u2014so if you do need help on a specific topic I can try and answer that for you or touch base with my network. \n\n\nWhat degree program are you hoping to enter into?",
