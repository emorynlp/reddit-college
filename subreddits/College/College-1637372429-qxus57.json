  "text": "For context, I\u2019m a freshman at a stem heavy T20. \nI know I haven\u2019t gotten lazier. I still put in so many hours studying for tests (my last exam I studied for 20+ hours), yet I can\u2019t ever get above a B in any of my stem class exams. Even my language class, which is like my forte (my professor even said I have a \u201cgift\u201d for languages, always got 99-100 in HS), I\u2019m just barely at an A. I seriously don\u2019t get how all these people graduate with 4.0 GPAs.",

      "text": "B\u2019s get degrees. You\u2019re going to drive yourself crazy if you chase high school grades in college. \n\nI\u2019m convinced people who have 4.0\u2019s in college must study every second of the day. (Which go ahead and do that if that\u2019s your goal but I think most people would agree is not worth it to put in so much time). Just do what you can and get through college. Nobody is going to care about what grade you got in your language class as long as you get that degree.",

      "text": "it's because of rigor. if you attended some community college or university with an 85% admit rate, you would probably still be getting 99-100 in every class. at those schools they have to make the classes easier or else entire classes will fail and the graduation rate would be in the gutter.\n\nrigor is good. it means your grade represents the highest academic achievement. if you have easy math test, the best student and average student will both have high grades on easy test. But on harder test, the best student will have high grade on hard test.\n\nBad students like easier classes because they think it helps them blend in with good students. Good students like harder classes because they can better showcase their academic achievement and learn the concepts more in depth. Of course this doesn't mean you should settle for B grade, your current feeling is *ambition*, a good thing.",
