But just hear me out. \n\nAs far back as I can remember I\u2019ve hated school. Even in 1st, 2nd, 3rd grade, when school is still fun to a lot of kids I couldn\u2019t stand to be there. This feeling carried on into middle school when I basically refused to do any hw and into high school where I reluctantly decided to start getting good grades. \n\nThat being said I love to learn, my brain is just an information sponge. Especially if it\u2019s a area I\u2019m interested in or want to excel at. And I\u2019m not lazy, I spent my summer working at McDonald\u2019s and lifeguarding and got another job at a boat rental place as soon as the pool season ended. \n\nI just can\u2019t stand the school environment, I wake up early in the morning driving to school, not being able to find parking, being hungry asf and in desperate need of caffeine cuz I didn\u2019t have time to eat. Then sitting in a classroom taking notes listening to teachers lecture for hours. Then I have to go home study, finish assignments and wake up to do the same thing the next day. It probably would be better if I made some friends, but I\u2019m kinda having a hard time with that. I\u2019m a very quiet kinda shy person, but I\u2019ve always been able to find people I click with. \n\nIm majoring in Marketing and it might just be that this major isn\u2019t for me. My real passion is music and I love to play guitar and write and record songs. I would I switch to something thats more in that ballpark, but the thing is my parents would be pissed. They already aren\u2019t happy that I\u2019m majoring in marketing and would rather me go into premed or engineering. On top of that they are paying for my tuition so it wouldn\u2019t really be fair to take their money and use it to major in something that wouldn\u2019t be able to get me a job and would make me a disappointment in there eyes. \n\nHere\u2019s where dropping out comes in. I truly and whole heartedly want to pursue music, and I know I can learn all the skills I need for this online and much cheaper than college. If I had the balls I\u2019d just drop out now but I\u2019m afraid of disappointing my parents and being screwed financially for the rest of my life.", "author": "Shmamp34", "created": 1632251740, "retrieved": 1632800937, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hdse3nz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psps1o/i_want_to_drop_out/hdse3nz/", "text": "become a welder", "author": "censqred", "created": 1632271667, "upvotes": 0}, "hdrdpvv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psps1o/i_want_to_drop_out/hdrdpvv/", "text": "First, if you want to pursue music, that usually equates to a career in retail sales or coffeeshop management. Are you going to have a better income/less discomfort with or without a degree? Degree. Does it matter what it's in? No. If you give up music when you are married with two kids, what's going to give you more freedom, music degree (selling after school lessons) or  any kind of marketing degree(9-5 job)? Ok, will your marketing degree give you more flexibility in music? You bet- you can market your band/etc as part of the team. Which costs more - music (loans) or marketing (parents)? I'd suck it up and get the marketing degree while taking performance lessons as part of my course load. At least let your parents pay to make you a better musician while you are jumping through their hoop!", "author": "CindsSurprise", "created": 1632255173, "upvotes": 3}, "hdr9r2h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psps1o/i_want_to_drop_out/hdr9r2h/", "text": "I would try to switch majors, or possibly transfer to a college that has a good music department or dedicated to music like Berklee.
