  "text": "I've been interested in science fields, but honestly I'm not sure I have what it takes despite how much I love learning in that field.\n\nI used to be a straight A student, but I'm dropping down to C's and B's lately, and it'll probably only get worse.\n\nEven if I scrape through college, nobody is going to want to hire a C scientist or researcher, so I'm not sure it's even worth it anymore.",

But if you look at different reddit posts you can see that having lots of research experience in undergrad can help offset your grades, since for grad school many people want to see research experience (and from what I understand industry likes it as well since you will gain lots of lab experience.)",
