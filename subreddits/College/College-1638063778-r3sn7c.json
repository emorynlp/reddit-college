  "text": "Hello!  I am currently planning on graduating from college in the spring of 2022 and feel super stressed about being able to find a job.  I think it's too early to start applying jobs right now, but finding a job is pretty much all I can think about.  I am also concerned about being able to find a job because I want to be able to live on my own after I move out, which would cost \\~$1,000 a month for just rent, so I need a job that pays decently well.  Anyone else feel this way or able to relate at all?",

If so, you could start by applying at those organizations.\r  \n\r  \nIf your school hosts career fairs, you should attend those and begin networking. Create a LinkedIn account and let people know you're looking to start work in a few months. It's not unusual for organizations to extend job offers to seniors a few months before graduation.",

Pretty much all the work I've done in the past has been outside, however, I don't really like working outside and I want to work an indoor/office job in the future.  I will attend the career fair in the spring that my school holds, but I've gone in the past and they haven't been too helpful tbh.  Hopefully it will be this year.",

I would maybe just focus on places where the companies come to you (career fairs, info sessions) for now and move to online stuff in February. But my experience with engineering, was that the most competitive companies start handing out offers in October or November.\n\nI don't mean to stress you out though, most of my friends found jobs in the spring, but it's never to early to start.",

There\u2019s virtually no market for undergrads because there\u2019s less openings than there even are graduate degree holders.\n\nYou need to start applying now. Do like 5 apps a day. You have a very, very upward climb as a bio or psych grad unless you get lucky. Start now.",

PhD is better, but it\u2019s still depressing considering how much time they spend in school to still make less than a starting engineer with their BS. \n\nYour only real paths are to go to med school or grad school, and we all know med school is not only impossible to get into, but is also just hard as shit.\n\nPlease go ahead and fact check me too.
