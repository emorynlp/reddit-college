  "text": "I technically made the dean's list this semester with a GPA of 3.55. I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of 2.98, it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.\n\nThis sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.\n2. ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop 5-8% points to score an A.\n3. Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)\n4. ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***\n5. ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.\n6. ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.\n7. ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!\n\nI am not going to lie it is a lot of hard work (especially with the fun new challenge of COVID-19 this semester) but just remember most college courses (at least at the undergraduate level) are designed so that the average student can succeed.",

      "text": "This is really great advice. I teach undergrad students and when students are on the bubble at the end of the semester, I always ask myself \"Did they ever come to office hours? Did they participate? Did they submit their assignments on time?\"\n\nAlso, I always post rubrics for my assignments. I put a lot of thought into how I structure my assignments and what I want students to learn from them. The rubric is essentially a cheat sheet for students that tells them what to pay attention to, which skills are important, etc. I can tell which students look at them and make sure they check the boxes. Those students always do well... because they followed the rubric. Even if a student falls somewhat short, they get more points for trying then students who don't follow the rubric at all.",

      "text": "Some really good tips here. After failing out of college few years back, I had a GPA of 1.92 (by getting mostly  C's& F's) and before going  back to school  this semester.  I found this reddit group and used some these tips like the one you offer here.  And  I made my first A's in years. \n\nI alsoreally recommend is doing the extra credit no matter what. Even if you can't complete it but if you can do some of it and turn it in. It helps. I had an 86 in Accounting and did a few extra credits assignments that the professor offered and it got me to 91. \n\nSo I went from a 1.92 to a 2.25, just taking two classes this semester. If I stay on track, I should be at a 3.4 by graduation.  \n\nOn that note, know yourself and how many classes you can handle.  If you are working like me it might be better to take less classes. Although, there are some people like my sister that can handle a full time schedule while working, but I just  can't. So just know yourself. \n\nSome college homework sites like Cengage will offer guided learning (with the homework program you paid for)  and some universities offer virtual tutors to check essays or discussions. USE ALL OF THEM. It really will help.\n\nKnowing when to quit. This helps when you are studying for long periods of time and if you aren't learning anymore and if you're tired, it's not going to help your grades much if you are tired. I used the Pomodoro Method  (I played games during my break) and was able to study for longer stretches of time. I personally recommend Forest app. But it still helps knowing when to say that you are done for the day.   \n\nAll  the other tips on this comment section are pretty good good too. Especially, the one about working hard at the beginning of the semester. \n\nWhile I wish I had used these tips sooner, it's better late than never. \n\nCongrats to anyone who graduated and everyone else hope you have a good next semester!",

      "text": "Here's the biggest tip I can offer: make sure you get all of the free/easy points -- we design our syllabus around them.\nLet me explain:\n\nThere are generally two competing concerns when evaluating students. Should we be grading for mastery of content? or should we be grading for effort and improvement? Ultimately, both matter, so on any syllabus there are assignments that are meant to gauge mastery and assignments meant to reward effort. Mastery assignments will often be labs, exams, or major essays. Because we want to prepare students for the real world, these are going to graded by a high standard that tells students what the real benchmark for excellence is; i.e. the grading will be hard. \n\nBut we also want students to be rewarded for their hard work and determination, and we realize that not everyone comes from the same high schools with the same degree of preparedness. For this reason, there are parts of the syllabus designed to reward effort. These are usually attendance, participation, small quizzes, and low-stakes assignments. These are all graded easily.\n\nTogether, these assignments let professors have it both ways. We can grade you harshly on certain assignments to show you what is essential for mastery of content, but we can also reward you for effort and still allow you to finish with a decent grade because of the easier assignments. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? -- to prevent you from making the same mistake as many students who assume that the small, easy assignments are not worth doing. They lose the free participation/low-stakes assignment points, thinking that they will simply do very well on the larger, mastery based assignments. And then they are shocked when they get their grades back on the major assignments and see that the standard for grading these assignments is high, that they couldn't get an 'A,' and that now their final grade is going to be a 'B,' or even a 'C' because they skipped the easy work.\n\ntl;dr  Get all of the easy points on the syllabus. They are designed to mitigate the tougher grading on major assignments.",

And students get it for free, each week, and they know their teaching team is reasonably competent. I usually spend my office hours checking emails or working on my PhD because no one ever shows.",

For instance, if you know you have a few difficult classes next semester (especially useful for STEM), summer/winter break is a fantastic time to reach out to the professor and get the textbook name and chapters that will be covered; then start reading ahead and solving problems. This not only puts a lasting impression of you as a student on your soon to be professor, but can actually make challenging classes feel really easy!",

When I decided to go back years later at a community college I had to get it up to a 3.0 so I could transfer to University. Took 3 semesters of getting straight As. Was pretty tough but I did it and now I'm transferring to University in the fall!",

I was terrified of my advsior at the time and it took me about a year to get up the guts and make an appointment to go back to college. It's taken a LOT of grinding to get my 1.2 GPA at the beginning of last fall to the solid 2.5 it is now. I cried happy tears this morning when I logged into mycampus and saw the good grades I got from grinding. SO worth it. I've got a year left of college (graduating next summer and getting my graphic design certificate next spring, woo!). It was extremely hard to push myself from a 1.2 and over the next year I want to get my GPA up even higher.  \n\nI'm excited for you to be transferring to university in the fall! You did a lot of work and you definitely deserve it after that pitfall.",

Its way better to have breathing room during the stressful part of the course instead of during the easy beginning assignments.",
