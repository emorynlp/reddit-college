I know for some it may not too high, but as someone who made a post at the end of last semester how to increase my pithy GPA of 2.98, it has been a good reminder that grades are not an accurate reflection of your self-worth.\n\nThis sub has helped me in the past, so I decided to make a post giving some personal suggestions and reflecting on some of the study habits that I adopted this semester.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. ***Make a planner or calendar*** with all the due dates from the syllabus. Update this as changes arise. I also make a breakdown of grades for each course.\n2. ***Grind to score well in your first midterm or major assignments.*** They cover the basic topics in the course that later material builds on. My personal opinion is that it sets the expectations for both how you and the professor believe you are going to perform in the course. Furthermore, they are usually comparatively easier & therefore important for courses in which you can only drop 5-8% points to score an A.\n3. Be that kid that ***speaks up in class***. Clearing up doubts as they arise is very important. You will not remember to look it up later. This will help the professor remember who you are (hint: professors like students that are interested in what they teach!)\n4. ***Do the readings when they are assigned.***\n5. ***Review what you do after each class***. Summarise by writing down notes or typing out the important points that you have learned in class (each time) using your own notes, lecture slides, book, handouts, and readings.\n6. ***Go to*** ***office hours,*** and not just before the exams. Office hours are for you to make use of. Ask your silly questions (if you still too shy to ask in a lecture setting) or ask for clarification on what the assignments are. Very important as soon as you feel like you are struggling. t is as simple as saying, that you feel like you are struggling or not doing well you had hoped.\n7. ***Exploit the rubric***. For a majority of the assignments professors layout word-to-word an outline of what they expect from you in the rubric. Follow it!!\n\nI am not going to lie it is a lot of hard work (especially with the fun new challenge of COVID-19 this semester) but just remember most college courses (at least at the undergraduate level) are designed so that the average student can succeed.", "author": "QuickObject", "created": 1589996198, "retrieved": 1632947221, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1391, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"frccho3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gnfv1w/tips_on_how_to_raise_your_gpa_as_an_average/frccho3/", "text": "You made Deans List with a 3.55?

The rubric is essentially a cheat sheet for students that tells them what to pay attention to, which skills are important, etc. I can tell which students look at them and make sure they check the boxes.

After failing out of college few years back, I had a GPA of 1.92 (by getting mostly  C's& F's) and before going  back to school  this semester.  I found this reddit group and used some these tips like the one you offer here.  And  I made my first A's in years. \n\nI alsoreally recommend is doing the extra credit no matter what. Even if you can't complete it but if you can do some of it and turn it in. It helps. I had an 86 in Accounting and did a few extra credits assignments that the professor offered and it got me to 91. \n\nSo I went from a 1.92 to a 2.25, just taking two classes this semester. If I stay on track, I should be at a 3.4 by graduation.  \n\nOn that note, know yourself and how many classes you can handle.  If you are working like me it might be better to take less classes. Although, there are some people like my sister that can handle a full time schedule while working, but I just  can't. So just know yourself. \n\nSome college homework sites like Cengage will offer guided learning (with the homework program you paid for)  and some universities offer virtual tutors to check essays or discussions. USE ALL OF THEM. It really will help.\n\nKnowing when to quit. This helps when you are studying for long periods of time and if you aren't learning anymore and if you're tired, it's not going to help your grades much if you are tired. I used the Pomodoro Method  (I played games during my break) and was able to study for longer stretches of time. I personally recommend Forest app. But it still helps knowing when to say that you are done for the day.   \n\nAll  the other tips on this comment section are pretty good good too. Especially, the one about working hard at the beginning of the semester. \n\nWhile I wish I had used these tips sooner, it's better late than never. \n\nCongrats to anyone who graduated and everyone else hope you have a good next semester!", "author": null, "created": 1590033213, "upvotes": 4}, "frb5acj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gnfv1w/tips_on_how_to_raise_your_gpa_as_an_average/frb5acj/", "text": "I\u2019m currently in Maymester class so this motivated me to get ahead in class because I wanna get it over with", "author": "MysticKnight2110", "created": 1590033097, "upvotes": 2}, "frb0vbr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gnfv1w/tips_on_how_to_raise_your_gpa_as_an_average/frb0vbr/", "text": "So common sense.", "author": "crystalliite", "created": 1590030276, "upvotes": 0}, "frawvhl": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gnfv1w/tips_on_how_to_raise_your_gpa_as_an_average/frawvhl/", "text": "As a sophomore I had a 2.4 and I just graduated with a 3.22.

Should we be grading for mastery of content? or should we be grading for effort and improvement? Ultimately, both matter, so on any syllabus there are assignments that are meant to gauge mastery and assignments meant to reward effort. Mastery assignments will often be labs, exams, or major essays. Because we want to prepare students for the real world, these are going to graded by a high standard that tells students what the real benchmark for excellence is; i.e. the grading will be hard. \n\nBut we also want students to be rewarded for their hard work and determination, and we realize that not everyone comes from the same high schools with the same degree of preparedness. For this reason, there are parts of the syllabus designed to reward effort. These are usually attendance, participation, small quizzes, and low-stakes assignments. These are all graded easily.\n\nTogether, these assignments let professors have it both ways. We can grade you harshly on certain assignments to show you what is essential for mastery of content, but we can also reward you for effort and still allow you to finish with a decent grade because of the easier assignments. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? -- to prevent you from making the same mistake as many students who assume that the small, easy assignments are not worth doing. They lose the free participation/low-stakes assignment points, thinking that they will simply do very well on the larger, mastery based assignments. And then they are shocked when they get their grades back on the major assignments and see that the standard for grading these assignments is high, that they couldn't get an 'A,' and that now their final grade is going to be a 'B,' or even a 'C' because they skipped the easy work.\n\ntl;dr  Get all of the easy points on the syllabus.
