  "text": "Hey there. I'm doing a Computer Science transfer degree in CT. I'm on course to graduate except for one math class. The way my transfer degree works is that I have to take certain classes to reach the required 63 credits to graduate.  \nMy advisor screwed me over by telling me that I should take a prereq class (College Alg & Trig), when I insisted I knew the material, and that I'd be behind a class when the correct path is Precalc, then Calc I, then Calc II, then Discrete Math.  \nThus, I took College Alg - Precalc - and now as a Sophomore in his first semester I'm doing Calc I.   \nBesides this one math class, I'm passing all my other classes and I'm on track to complete those parts of the degree -- I strictly need to catch up on this one course so I can be entirely on track for Spring Graduation.  \nWinter and Spring semester opens for registration in two weeks.   \nI'm worried that I may have to take Calc II AND Discrete Math in the Spring Semester if the Winter Calc II class is cancelled or isn't listed as a Winter Class I can take. Another worry is, would I be able to graduate in Spring if I had to take Discrete Math in Summer if I only got to take Calc II in Spring?  \nAsking for advice here. I already have a meeting setup with my good, CS advisor who knows what she's talking about, but what would you do in my situation?   \nI plan on transferring to a local State School in Fall 2022.",

Depending on your school\u2019s policy, you may not be able to take Calc II and Discreet Mathematics at the same time if Calc II is a prerequisite for the class. \n\nI\u2019m currently a CS major at my CC too, and won\u2019t be able to take Discrete until I do Calc III.",

So much money saved, even though this is a slight obstacle, I'm glad I went here out of HS instead of straight to a 4 year.",

              "text": "If it makes you feel any better, although I've never taken discrete II I googled some syllabi and am familiar with most if not all topics covered in most discrete II courses (I'm a grad student in statistics with a background in math) and I'm not seeing topics that I would think would require a calc II background.\n\nMore math background is always going to be a helpful thing, but even the name of the course implies calculus isn't needed-- calculus generally involves the study of continuous objects, whereas the word \"discrete\" literally means non-continuous.",

      "text": "1) Taking Calc II and discrete at the same time is much easier than calc II during a shortened semester.\n\n2) You typically don't need to have an associates degree in order to transfer. You probably could have transferred last semester if you wanted to. It's just that most transfer agreements *guarantee* that you can transfer after the associates, given minimum GPA (and possibly other requirements) are met. But those schools aren't necessarily going to reject you just for not having the associates.\n\nIn other words, you're probably good. However, if you're worried, you should contact admissions at the school you plan on transferring to. They'll be able to fill you in. Realistically, your worst case scenario is that you end up taking one of those math classes at your new school after you transfer, which again won't be the end of the world.",

          "text": "Thanks so much. I think my best course of action would be taking Calc II and Discrete in Spring then.  \nMy schedule this spring is gonna be *loaded*: Calc II, Discrete, Digital Electronics, PHP, Personal Finance, and an Oral Communication class. Thankfully PHP, Pers Finance, & Oral Comms should be easy.   \nI realized I don't *need* an Associates to transfer, it's just my goal and how my Transfer Degree works for my CC to the State School I want to go to in CT, also I'd like to have that guarantee haha.  \nI'm meeting with an advisor this tuesday, I'll have to explain the whole situation. Thanks.",
