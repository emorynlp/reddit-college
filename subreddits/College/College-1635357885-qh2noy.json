  "text": "I've been sick for the last couple of weeks (I was exposed to covid), and my professor is aware of this. The last email I got from him was about two weeks ago, where he told me to remind him to send whatever info I'll miss in class. I'd email him after the class period on the same day (it's a morning class). However, he hasn't responded to any of them for the last two weeks. I have no idea how to make up my missing work, and I also missed a test date as well (I don't know if I can make it up, since you can only make up tests if there's an emergency and you notify your prof the day before the test).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anything I can do?\n\n\nEDIT: it\u2019s been resolved",
