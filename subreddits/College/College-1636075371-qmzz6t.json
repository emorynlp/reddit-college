  "text": "So I'm in my fourth year of college and I have no idea what to do\n\nI came into my college undeclared. After dealing with depression and not knowing what I want to do, I got disqualified and ended up returning home. Then I took some classes at my local community college for a couple of years and came back to my original university this semester through appeal after missing the on campus lifestyle.\n\nI want to have biology as my major but I'm fucked. Asides from my GPA being too low to transfer into the biology major, I also risk disqualification AGAIN because I'm not doing well in my core subjects. I've been very terrible at math and algebra since middle school but the average system allowed me to keep progressing until university level despite always doing poor in those subjects. Now I'm this deep in, and I lack the math skills necessary to do well and earn credits for subjects like chemistry and physics. I wish I wouldve just been held back until I got the skills necessary to actually do well in college.\n\nMy advisor is telling me to consider switching my major to something else but I literally don't have any other interests. Any advice?",

      "text": "Well. Why do you want to go into biology? Are you pre-med, pre-pt, pre-pa etc? There are other medical jobs that most don\u2019t consider that still allow you to implement science. Medical Lab Science is one I don\u2019t hear people having too often but it has great job outlook. Radiology & ultrasound technician are two year associate degrees. \n\nIf you want to do something more intense you could consider switching to something like environmental science? \n\nI guess the best way I could help is by knowing why you want to stay in bio and what you were planning on doing with the degree.",

There\u2019s english majors that go to PA school all the time, you just have to do well on the PA-CAT. \n\nMy concern for you would be that since you are struggling pretty bad in the core classes right now it would be hard to jump into the application part of PA school. I don\u2019t want to discourage you at all, I just want to be honest. PA school has also gotten REALLY competitive in the last couple years, so a high GPA is pretty important for program acceptance.",
