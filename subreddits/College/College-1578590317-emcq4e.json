Some of them even give birth under stairs, in the basement of buildings or even inside the classroom (one day we found a mother squirrel with her babies in one of the 5th floor's classrooms). They''re quite diverse, and they have their own personality, it's fun to watch those guys while relaxing in your faculty's food court/green areas.",

The characteristic feature of this species is that they have 3 strips on their back and they run very very fast. They also have less bushy tail usually a gradient of black, brown and white.\n\nThe two outer stripes run from the forelegs to the hind legs only. It has a creamy-white belly and a tail covered with interspersed, long, black and white hair. The ears are small and triangular. Juvenile squirrels have significantly lighter coloration, which gets progressively darker as they age.\u00a0Albinism\u00a0is rare, but exists in this species. Their eyes are a bit dark maroonish and like beads.\n\nThey survive on fruits and nuts basically.\n\nThat's all I know about the squirrels in my University.",
