  "text": "It was so, so difficult to find friend groups this year, and I lived off campus so I feel extra lonesome. I see everyone posting recaps of their freshman years, and they\u2019re partying and having fun and hanging out with friends till 3am, and it sucks knowing I didn\u2019t experience that. I tried my hardest to keep everyone around me safe, so I avoided parties and large gatherings, and seeing everyone around me throwing Covid precautions out the window makes me feel like I just wasted an entire year. Anyone else feeling like this? Any advice? Anyone just want to throw a pity party in the replies? lmao",

I\u2019m glad I had one normal semester but I\u2019ve had not much to build upon this year. I was super lonely my freshman year and it was normal for the time I was there, so I can\u2019t imagine how you all feel as freshmen during covid. It slowly gets a little better each year you have so much time left. We can get through it. I feel like my year was wasted lowkey too:( but there is a time for everything",

Freshman year in general is stressful because it's a massive life change for most people... New place, first time living on their own, getting adjusted to the differences between high school and college, loneliness before meeting classmates and friends.\n\nGive yourself some credit. This first year of college? Always hard. But adding covid? Even worse. So don't feel super pressured to make a bunch of friends. I know, it's hard and lonely right now. But a senior once told me three years ago that you will find your people, and you will. This fall should begin to restore some normality and you'll have your chance.\n\nHang in there until then! You're doing great!",

I feel so bad because pretty much I had the chance to make friends last year, but I didn't. I felt so lonely this year\n\nLuckily, I plan on returning back to campus for the next school year.

Theater director got laid off -because why would a theater department be active during a pandemic- A fantastic professor who had creative teaching for in person classes just had to shift back to quizzes since we couldn't do our usual stuff. There was a group English project that we had no presentation for because the person who wanted to do the topic, didn't follow up on anything and went to the beach/gym instead of worked with us. \n\nThe only thing that got me through were people who I knew from that first semester. This is where the positivity comes in for ya. When classes return to in person, you'll see lots of people in your major just sorta doing their thing and learning right? Well, when you notice a person from a class (or classes) then just make an effort to talk to them. The familiarity of \"Hey, you're in Philosophy 106 right?\" will make it easier to talk. By the end of the first semester there was a group of about 20 different people all coming in and out of classes hanging out and becoming friends. I think even better news is, because of all of this online garbage, there's gonna be a lot more interaction overall.",
