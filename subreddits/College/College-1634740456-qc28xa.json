  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore in community college, in july 2022 I suppose to transfer to one state college in Florida but my parents are leaving the US to go Europe because our visa it about to expire and my dad company didn\u2019t wanted to sponsor us anymore, so they have to choice but to leave. However, I think I can apply for F1 visa because I\u2019m still enrolled in my college.\nI don\u2019t know if I should finish my AA and transfer and then apply for F1 or should I switch to AS get F1 and get a job becauseI have an acquaintance that offered me a job, so they can sponsor any working visa\nOr should I just leave US and go live with my parents in Europe and study all over again there?\nI\u2019m very sad to leave because I really love US\nOr any of you have other suggestions?",
