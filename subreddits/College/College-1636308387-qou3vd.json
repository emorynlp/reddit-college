  "text": "Hello you wonderful humans. \nFinals are starting up in about a month from now. I\u2019m hoping for suggestions on the best way to study directly from a text book. My one class has had zero assignments. It\u2019s strictly textbook readings with a couple midterms here and there. I\u2019m wanting to pull up my grade with this last exam, but having just a text book to go off of has proven to be a weakness of mine. If anyone has any advice, I\u2019d appreciate it a lot. \nThank you and have a wonderful Sunday :)",
