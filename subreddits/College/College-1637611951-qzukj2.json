  "title:": "Thinking about returning to school - Low GPA when I left",
  "text": "Long story short, I went to college without knowing what I wanted to do.  Spent time going from class to class, feeling like nothing really scratched the itch.  Did a lot of things I shouldn't have done in terms of skipping classe/overall just being bad at the academic process.  Eventually I just picked Communications so I could graduate and get out of school to explore the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast Forward 5/6 years and I've decided that I want to return to school, I want to learn something specific (Accounting) and I know what I want to do.  Is it better for me to return to the school I graduated at previously and attempt to earn my Masters in the field I desire or would it better to get a BA in the same study?   \n\n\nIs it better to return to the school I graduated from or would it better to start over at a new school?  Maybe even a community college?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice is welcome.  Thank you.",

      "text": "Jobs rarely look at your GPA once you graduated, so if you can it would be better to continue and get a masters in your respective field. With that being said, if your GPA is low you\u2019re going to have a very hard time being accepted into a Masters program. What I would suggest is to apply to the masters program you want to go into and if you get denied from it you can either restart your BA or retake some of the classes you did poorly in to try and increase your GPA. Goodluck!",
