  "title:": "What exactly is Federal Work Study? (and some more financial aid questions)",
  "text": "Hello! I'm going back to university for this Spring 2022 semester after a couple years away and now that I'm a bit older and more independent, I've become intimately more involved in the whole college process - the biggest part of which, of course, is finances.\n\nI'm quite lucky in that my university offers substantial financial aid and I don't have a lot of worries about graduating with a crippling amount of debt. Between the Federal Pell Grant and my university's need based financial aid program, my tuition is entirely covered with a bit of change to spare. However, as I'm planning on living off campus, I'm still left with the daily expenses of affording to pay rent, utilities, and college related expenses which, of course, adds up fast. I've been offered Federal work-study assistance and I'm wondering exactly how that works. Is there any benefit to accepting this aid offer? It's for roughly $2000. I have experience working in the restaurant industry as a server, which is what I'm just considering doing, which can pay easily pay over $25/hour. The schedules tend to be quite flexible too, as it's a popular choice for servers and the need for servers are primarily centered around the weekends. Would there be any advantage of working a work-study job at my area's current minimum wage of $15/hr? And what exactly is a work-study grant of $2000 anyway? Does it mean that I'm awarded up to an extra $2000 on top of the $2000 I earn with a work-study position, or does it just mean that up to $2000 that I earn with a work-study position is applied to my financial aid and anything left (after which I'm not eligible for a work-study position(?)) is what I can take home? I did some research online and it seems to imply that the latter is the case, which makes me wonder if there really is any benefit of going the work-study route when I can make substantially more just working a normal job, with the added benefit of being able to work consistently the same job throughout the summer after my university shuts its doors and I'd have to find another summer work-study position. If anyone could please clear this up for me, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nI also do have a second question - I'm turning 24 quite soon and I've read on the FAFSA website that at the age of 24, I'm considered independent for financial aid purposes and I won't have to input my parents financial information. My parents are immigrants and have worked for decades in minimum wage jobs, but they've finally worked themselves up to being able to make a decent income. I'm afraid that this will affect my financial aid award, especially because at my current age, their financial support will be limited, unless what I'm assuming is true - that from 24 onward, only my finances will be taken into account.",

      "text": "The work-study grant is basically money pre-allocated and only paid to you if you get a work-study eligible campus job. Basically the school would be paying you from that work-study money. Typically you\u2019d be getting paid the minimum wage in your area. Work study jobs are usually flexible and allow you to schedule work around school. \n\nYes, when you turn 24, for FAFSA purposes, you are considered independent and only your financial info is taken into account. If you are low income, this means you\u2019ll probably get a larger financial aid package.",
