  "title:": "I have FOMO from not partying, am I really missing out?",
  "text": "This is my first year on campus (I\u2019m a sophomore) and it sucks to see everyone out partying, clubbing, hanging out with their friends, getting drunk and high and I just go home on weekends because I\u2019m not really the type to party but want to experience what it\u2019s like at least once in college. I\u2019m introverted and only have like 4 friends who don\u2019t party or anything so that means I have to party alone. Sometimes I avoid watching other people\u2019s Snapchat stories of them partying while I\u2019m at home being bored out of my mind. Sometimes I consider just moving off campus to avoid campus life and to avoid the FOMO feeling of seeing everyone on campus have fun while I\u2019m basically stuck. Sorry if I sound like a \u201cpick me girl\u201d but am I missing out on anything?",

      "text": "Parties are only worth it or fun if you go with your friends. Of course you would meet some new people but they\u2019re honestly fleeting usually. There is always a time for partying after you graduate and turn 21. Even though I went to a few frat parties, I found hitting up the bars for drinks after work to be immensely more satisfying as someone who likes to go out. I don\u2019t really like house parties because I like to go out and do stuff and I hate cleaning up after etc. But I did like going to the club to dance and the bar to sit and hang out with my friends or coworkers. And this is stuff you can do into your 20s and 30s.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that you shouldn\u2019t be worried about missing out so much because there\u2019s tons of time to still do these things. Also it gives you the time to meet people who want to go out and explore with you or who can show you the ropes. The only thing that is college specific is frat parties and they\u2019re honestly really obnoxious.",
