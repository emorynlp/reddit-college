  "text": "I am 19 years old girl (will be 20 in 2 months). Right now I am pursuing BDS from government college. I want to move out from home. My parents are good and supportive but we have so many conflicts. I feel I am ruining my relationship with my parents and don't respect them enough. I am so self-centered and keep hurting them. Also I think that if I move out I will be more serious for my career as I will have to pay my rent. I can ask my parents to support me for one month and search internships to earn some money. Shall I move out?",
