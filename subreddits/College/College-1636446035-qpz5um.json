      "text": "Have your Dad suggest a similar project for your skill level and work on that yourself if you feel you missed out. \n\nHim walking you through the logic is a great thing, that's the important bit to learn, but yeah does suck you don't feel you learnt it. Take a breather. Work on yourself and your confidence. Give yourself some distance from this I suck mental loop before deciding to change anything drastic.\n\nHonestly, probably find a therapist and work on this. And maybe consider dropping to less classes next semester if you need more space to get back to normal. \n\nIt's been a stressful, shitty time.",
