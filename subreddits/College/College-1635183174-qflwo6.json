  "text": "So i think i'm experiencing some kind of burnout. I'm currently in my final year of college and i don't have any problems in my classes, everything is fine in that regard. I also work part-time.  The thing is, that besides studying, working and going out to drink, i don't do anything else. I used to have all kinds of hobbies and generally enjoy trying new things, but in the last few years or so, my life became kinda stale. I simply lost the energy to do things, because there rarely is any free time and even when there is, i usually just do some more college work or sleep... I used to work out as well, but lately i only do it once or twice a week at most, because i'm lazy. It got a bit worse this year, since it's the final year in college, there is even more stuff to do that is related to studying. I'm studying automotive engineering and i also work on my own car and motorcycle, but even those things have become boring as well, i only do necessary maintenance now. Is this only a temporary thing and it'll pass eventually after i finish college ? Tell me people of reddit, does it get better once you're out of this hellhole called college life? :D",

      "text": "Sure, it can get better. Assuming you find a decent job after college, and have normal working hours, you'll have your evenings and weekends free to do whatever you want, and you'll have enough money to engage in new hobbies, travel, and meet up with friends for movies/ dinner/ drinks/ golf/ yoga/ whatever you're into. \n\nI had a blast in my early twenties after graduating from college. I worked at a company where there was a cohort of other 22 and 23 year old new hires, and we all hung out together on the weekends. I met the person I would eventually marry and we went on a bunch of really fun vacations together. \n\nI enjoyed my college years, but those years after college were perhaps even better because I had money and my weekends were entirely free.",

I don\u2019t worry about getting fired or screwing up in some huge way that will meaningfully impact future career opportunities. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are some professions which are more stressful, but I have a pretty ordinary desk job and am pretty competent at my core job responsibilities. There just isn\u2019t that much to feel stressed about.",
