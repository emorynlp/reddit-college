  "text": "So i think i'm experiencing some kind of burnout. I'm currently in my final year of college and i don't have any problems in my classes, everything is fine in that regard. I also work part-time.  The thing is, that besides studying, working and going out to drink, i don't do anything else. I used to have all kinds of hobbies and generally enjoy trying new things, but in the last few years or so, my life became kinda stale. I simply lost the energy to do things, because there rarely is any free time and even when there is, i usually just do some more college work or sleep... I used to work out as well, but lately i only do it once or twice a week at most, because i'm lazy. It got a bit worse this year, since it's the final year in college, there is even more stuff to do that is related to studying. I'm studying automotive engineering and i also work on my own car and motorcycle, but even those things have become boring as well, i only do necessary maintenance now. Is this only a temporary thing and it'll pass eventually after i finish college ? Tell me people of reddit, does it get better once you're out of this hellhole called college life? :D",
