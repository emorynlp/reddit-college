      "text": "If you can afford it, the iPad Pro is really nice when paired with the pencil for note taking.  However, for student purposes, the Air would be just fine.  I personally really like the 120hz display on the pro, but if you don't care about that, go for the Air.  For me, the 10 or 11 inch is the perfect size.  The 12 inch one is too big imo.",
