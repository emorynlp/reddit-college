  "text": "This isn\u2019t the first time I haven\u2019t gone, but it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t go. I spent the night coughing so the reasoning is that I\u2019m not sure it would be good to go, but I still can\u2019t help but feel guilt? Like, I\u2019m paying tuition for this, so it feels like I should go even though I\u2019m sick. Any advice?",

Ya, it's probably better if you go, and if tests are based on unrecorded lectures, you should make every effort to be there.  But if you know the material or the prof is reading the book to you and you are nailing the tests/quizzes/assignments without attending, why sweat it?",

If your lecturer records the lectures and they're available online, just watch those. Don't bother actually going. If they don't record though and you have to be there, well just don't go when you're sick and don't feel guilty about it because you show up every other time.",
