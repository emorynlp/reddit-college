  "text": "This is specific to Redditors who are currently living or have lived in the past, in university dorms/hostels on campus.\n\nDo you have any system(s) in your university campus to reserve spaces or facilities for designated time periods? Please do describe the process and your experience with it.\n\nFor example, some universities have a system to reserve seats in their library/reading room for specific time slots. You may include any campus facility like libraries, sports, restaurants, laundry, counseling, etc.\n\nP.S.: I am a design undergrad and this is for my final-year design project research.",
