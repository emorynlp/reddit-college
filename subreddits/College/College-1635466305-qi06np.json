  "text": "We have access to resources now that anyone can lean anything at the touch of a finger. University, of course, still has its uses. I've recently discovered I can even look up full courses from Universities and view hours of videos and read notes for courses I haven't even taken yet.   \n\n\nDoes everyone realize how many resources they actually have? I honestly didn't know I could look up classes from Universities and study the material as if I was in the class. It's done under some free license or something so it's not like I'm cheating the system. But are there any other powerful resources like this?",
