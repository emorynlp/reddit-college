  "text": "I'm pretty much set on starting college in the spring. I love absolutely everything about the school im planning on attending and i can't wait to go but I'm extremely worried that i will fail and end up wasting thousands of dollars. \n\nIn high school i failed or nearly failed multiple classes and barely did any of my homework on time. The only classes i did good in were electives. I dont know if the reason i was bombing so many classes was because i am genuinely not good at school or if i was incorrectly placed in honors/AP classes.\n\nI want to go to college and study but i don't think i'm mature enough or have the self discipline to do the work. I've taken two cc classes and i did really well in one but absolutely BOMBED the other. I'm talking about not one hw assignment turned in and i failed almost every test. \n\nWhat do you guys recommend me doing? I've considered doing a few years at cc but my situation at home is very toxic and going to college is the only way my parents will let me move out (barely).",

      "text": "The biggest predictor of success in college, in my opinion, is 100% discipline. If you don't have discipline, you will not succeed. \n\nIn college, you absolutely must complete every assignment. Missing assignments not only affects your grade, but ultimately will leave you behind since you missed that content. Since this *is* Reddit, I'm sure somebody will tell you that's not the case. Doing 100% of the assignments will really put you in the best position to get good grades. \n\nOnce again, the discipline to study is incredibly important. If you can't get yourself to start studying at least a few days in advance, that's not going to go well. Studying only the night before is a problem and it's terribly ineffective. \n\nI really believe that discipline is a greater predictor of success than intelligence. A stupid person with great discipline will pass while an intelligent person without any will definitely fail. \n\n***YOU'RE*** in charge of your education, nobody else is. Even in the case of bad professors, it's still up to you to pass. If they've ever had a class before, people have passed it which means there's really no excuse not to. \n\nIn your case where you know that maybe your discipline needs work, I would HIGHLY suggest taking a gap year or two. Go work for a few years. Develop your discipline then come back to college. Going to college with a good discipline skill set literally makes it cake. If you're diligent enough to stay ahead, it's so much easier.",

      "text": "It sucks, but you\u2019ve really got a couple of main options.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t naturally organized (you and me), it takes a lot of practice to make a calendar and adhere to it, color code your class work, and stuff like that.\n\nThe only way you\u2019ll get through college successfully without wasting your money is by learning how to plan ahead. \n\nPut reminders in your phone. Block out times during your day totally devoted to schoolwork, rather than just by the assignment. Treat this time like work: there is nothing but schoolwork here. That way you also don\u2019t feel stuck with a TON of schoolwork with no free time.\n\nCheck your email every time you eat, and then some.\n\nGet a file cabinet with dividers and place your work in them by class.\n\nFigure out what study strategies work best for you.\n\nStart your work as early as possible. I recommend having personal deadlines a couple of days before assignments are due. \n\nYou\u2019re going to have to study a lot, but college for me has been much easier than high school because I\u2019m paying so much (I have an incentive) and the teachers are just better.\n\nOtherwise, college just isn\u2019t for everybody. I\u2019m a senior in college now and I\u2019m still not sure that it\u2019s for me, but I\u2019m sticking with it because I\u2019m so close to the end.\n\nThere are trades and vocations that people make a really good living in. They can also be really fulfilling!",

I hate hard schedules but they do make life a lot easier sometimes. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to know exactly what you want to do when you\u2019re just 17/18! You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about it, even if your parents seem to.",

              "text": "As another note on finding what you might want to do, you can try a lot of different things at home or in your town. There are low-level office jobs that will tell you if you want to work at a desk all day. There are municipal jobs that will show you if you have any interest in small government work.\n\nAlso, take some time to really look into yourself and think about what kind of person you are, and what jobs you think would be best for that person.\n\nGet out there and discover for yourself!",

      "text": "OK 1st off let me tell you this I have quite a few friends that struggled in high school that are thriving in college academically and socially. Let me tell you right now college is a completely different anima different animal then high school. \nYou aren't expected to follow that regimented pattern that's school's demand. College academically is more intense but at the same time much more liberating.\n\nI'm a 4th year and a stem major so let me pass on at least my recommendations to you from me learning from my own experience and mistakes hopefully this will at least give you a starting point if it has at a hot fault helpful.\n1st off I would buy a very large calendar like one that is giant that you can stick on a wall that you you can like tape or something there or stick it on your desk something you will look at everyday and actually acknowledge acknowledge exists and that you will make yourself read. And I'm talking like a physical giant paper calendar something that you have to look at not a phone alarm or something because you can ignore those very easily Write down your assignments when papers are due literally everything you will get a syllabus at the start of every class like the 1st day take that syllabus go to the calendar and write everything down by a punch buy a bunch of different colored pens and designate one color for each class I know that sounds a little ridiculous but trust me it's helpful if you need to force yourself to have motivation.\n\nYour 1st term in class/college is the term you learn how to study for a college class so maybe take some of the easier classes that 1st term and maybe one hard class learn how to study Flash flashcards review reading the chapter reading the notes from powerpoint to wherever the professor posts go to class as much as you can avoid 8 AM classes anything before like 930 is probably best at least for your 1st term in college also just remember you are walking in with a Flash slate. Cleansely academically and nothing that happened in high school matters as soon as you're on a college campus your academic record is the same as anyone else Z anyone else 0 at the moment you have to work at it and your grades are a reflection of the effort you put in in college so I would also recommend perhaps finding a tutor for any courses that you know you will struggle with and found a study group or join the study group as soon as classes start says start that way you have people to study with and if you have issues you have people to ask for help in addition to all of this you are basically building a social network from scratch when you go to college unless you're in your Hometown which is unlikely so join clubs talked to people and have fun",

      "text": "Well you know your main weakness so thats a start, you just have to force yourself to improve on your lack of discipline. If you had bad grades in high school and bombed one of your classes in Community College it will be hard to get accepted since you turn in both transcripts. You should probably just stay in CC until you complete it, that way it will give you time to mature and you will have a much higher chance at getting accepted to University when you complete your Associates. \n\nIt sucks having to deal with parents etc. but its much worse long term to take on $10k+ of debt and dropping out going to University when you aren't mentally ready.",
