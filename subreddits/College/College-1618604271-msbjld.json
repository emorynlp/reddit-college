Do a time audit for everything you are spending time on in your life. Work, school, family time, health, daily commute, etc. You may realize that you are trying to allocate more time than you actually have in a day. Seriously consider if the places you are spending the most time actually deserve the time you are giving them. Separate in class time, hw/quiz/assignment time, and study time. Make sure that you are dedicating some time to studying every day so you dont forget what you went over in class.\n2. If you are doing a bunch of extracurriculars, consider just focusing on the most important one until you can steady your academics.\n3. Get enough sleep, exercise, eat healthy, and stay hydrated. Sound body, sound mind. \n4. Explore different note taking and study methods. I realized that taking notes DURING class time was more distracting for me than helpful so I just listened, asked and answered questions during class and used outside class time (before the class) to skim over the slides or book and bullet point the most important concepts and equations. Try a study method for a week or two and see how well it works for you, if it doesnt, change it. \n5. Try to find an external source of information that works for you. You professors teaching style might not work for you.

You might have already been told this, but if not I want to bring it up first because it is crucial for me. If one class is 3 credits, you should be spending around 9 hours every week during that class. Additionally, one of the things that\u2019s helped me is first taking notes from all of the lectures and readings, and then a few days later go back and annotate the notes so that you can ask questions about things you don\u2019t understand or things you want to know more about. After this, go find some sources that answer your questions and add those in to your original notes. One thing that helps me to retain information is to process it in a visual way. Every week I pick one small topic from each class and make the information into a mind map or chart. I save all of these in a binder and it has been LIFE CHANGING. Finally, if you\u2019re just starting your degree program it\u2019s okay to not know everything!

Try to highlight things that make a good short summary of the main topic and make annotations of any questions or things that were confusing. Try to also memorize any key vocab words that are bolded or the topic. This will promote active recall in class and is better in terms of memorizing things. I also like to pretend to teach lessons on the topic after the class or I start flashcards that minute and put them in piles of I know and I don't know. I also write all I know about a topic. So if I have to knoe about the kreb cycle I'll write down everything I know and compare it to my notes. Then I'll add anything I missed or cross out anything I got wrong. If it's a lot of things I'll try to even condense it then into a paragraph or a few sentences.", "author": "noelblossom", "created": 1618604914, "upvotes": 34}}}
