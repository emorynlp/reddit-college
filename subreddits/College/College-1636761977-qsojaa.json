  "text": "I have a professor who has said a lot of distasteful things, the least stupid of which is referring to a colleague as a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d. I\u2019m going to submit a complaint after my final grade is given and the semester has officially ended, but is there a possibility that she can go back and fail me for it?",

      "text": "This would be pretty rare, and dumb on the professors part. I guess \u201canything is possible\u201d, but I would highly doubt it. If you truly have reason to believe the professor would do this, just document everything - the final grade, your grades on all assignments, etc. - before the complaint so if they do change it you can seriously question it.\n\nAfter final grades are submitted it\u2019s typically not simple to change a grade, the professor would have to submit an official request for a grade change which usually requires an explanation.",

      "text": "Well there is some nuance to this.\n\nGenerally they are able to correct their own grading if they see an error. The term hasn't ended too so they don't need to go through any formal process.\n\nThe question is if you can convince someone that your remark is more likely than not the reason for him reviewing your grades again. Did he do this within a close amount of time after hearing the remark? Retaliation isn't okay but it's not always easy to prove. It's like employment discrimination where sometimes the evidence isn't overtly there and they will make up a different reason why they did it (i.e. not hire someone based on race and just say it was because of poor interview skills).\n\nYou can appeal this. But your professor is likely going to have their own story, accurate or not, so you need to be descriptive about the events/timeline in the appeal and make an objective case on why there is a good chance he retaliated.",
