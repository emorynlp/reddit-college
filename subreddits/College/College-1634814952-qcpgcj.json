  "title:": "Dropping My Classes, Leaving College",
  "text": "I enjoy where I attend and the class work is nothing to hard for my capabilities, but majority of my classes assignments are late and my mental health keeps getting worse (never had anything late in previous schooling this isn\u2019t like me). If I drop my classes and withdrawal from this semester, pay off my classes, would I be able to attend the same college later on and for the same degree? This is my dream school and degree but I went through some major things and with my mental health (brain fog, always tired, unable to retain information, etc.) deteriorating I have not been able to retain any information. I wish to re-attend in the near-ish future after I work on my issues (medical help) and get into a more comfortable position in my life I just want to make sure I am able to go back or if it\u2019ll be an automatic deny. Theoretically I may be able to pass the classes if I get all my late work done but the classes would feel like a waste since I have been floating by in them and have not read any course material despite these classes being important to my major. \nThank you for your time reading.",

      "text": "It's possible. I withdrew from the university fall 2020 and I got accepted again. I'm back this semester. I withdrew before the census date though so there were no consequences. You'll probably have a lot of Ws on your record. I'd talk to someone about this first.",

      "text": "I would say that it depends on the severity of your health issues. I actually dropped out of college for mental health reasons and later came back to finish my degree. I was doing very, very poorly despite having the ability to get straight A's. I also had a full semester's worth of grades removed from my college transcripts as well. I think that you need to talk to people at your college and make an informed decision. Talk to a counselor, and whomever else may be of help. At my college, there is a whole department, called the center for student success, that helped me along in this process. Just make sure that you talk to people and really see what your options are. Also, try to gain some understanding of how your experiences may be similar or dissimilar to that of your classmates and friends. A counselor would really help with that since people are not always willing to talk openly about their struggles or failures, and I would imagine that this would be especially true at more competitive colleges.\n\nOn another note, I think that this semester is extremely taxing. I have also felt many of the same issues of fatigue, brain fog, and an inability to retain information throughout this semester. It hurts to know that I am capable of so much more, yet I am struggling to do well. From my experiences talking to other students and faculty I know that a ton of people are in the same boat as you and me. I wish I knew the causes of this, but I don't. Some part of me wants to say that this semester is serving as an adjustment period of sorts after taking a full year of classes online. I was thinking about this the other day, and I realized that despite my expectations that everything would return to normal, the fact of the matter is that this is a very strange semester and I will require some time to recover from the stress of online classes and all of the other negative emotions that were rampant throughout the last two online semesters. \n\nI wish you the best, and I hope that you feel better :)\n\np.s. I only slept about 4 hours last night so there may be some grammatical errors lol",

      "text": "You can always return to school at any time. Take care of your health and return once you feel better and are ready to handle the coursework. The universities aren't disappearing anytime soon.\n\nOne option you can do is talk to your professors and advisors about getting in incompletes which will allow you to have more time to finish your course work.\n\nBest of luck.",
