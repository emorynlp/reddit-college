  "text": "Freshman here. I was doing laundry and this group of guys were being absolute madlads in the hallway, so I was chuckling as I went to go drop off my load. They noticed I was laughing so they asked me my name and asked if they could see my dorm. They were following me so I was like well, I guess I'll let them in. They looked around, complimented some of the stuff I had up in my room, and showed the room off to some girls they were facetiming. They didn't seem malicious or anything, but I am just cringing cause I had literally just cleaned my dorm room and there was still some personal stuff strewn about. Has anything like this ever happened to you?",
