Math, Reading and Writing. I only passed writing and failed the other two. Its stupid because if you fail you have to take remedial classes and its a waste of money for classes you receive no credit for. Like why are you letting some exam that I took as a 16 yr old affect my college classes? \n\nI overthink. What if i\u2019m too stressed? What if it gets in the way of my job? I need the money.

I lived in a rural town about a 45 minute drive from my college, living at home, working full time at McDonald\u2019s exactly like what you\u2019re describing. Here are some bullet points I\u2019d really recommend that worked for me:\n\n-\tDon\u2019t be afraid to go down on hours. I don\u2019t know how your McDonald\u2019s is but at mine you only needed to average 15 hours a week to qualify for the Archways scholarship.\n-\tit\u2019s fine to take the remedial classes. College isn\u2019t a race, even though everyone is going to make you feel like it is.\n-\tIt\u2019s okay to take less credits. You\u2019ll hear about people taking 15 or 18+ credits a semester, that doesn\u2019t have to be you. Just 9 or 12 credits is fine to help with the load.\n-\tDo not be afraid to eventually quit McDonalds. I understand that job can be a surprising amount of stress and can leave you exhausted. Keep the job in the beginning while the classes are easy but if you need to consider switching to an on-campus job that\u2019s more flexible with your schedule and less exhausting. You\u2019re commuting anyway, might as well make money while you\u2019re in that town.\n\nIn the end I really want you to understand you can and should go at your own pace. That was a huge hurdle for me because I felt like I was slacking/falling behind/etc but all I did was push myself too hard for too long. You\u2019ll get a better quality education and feel happier/healthier if you just take a breath and slow down. A good medium of 12 credits and 20-30 hours a week can put you on the path to graduating without much debt (if any at all) and less stress than trying to smash together 15+ credits and 40 hours.", "author": null, "created": 1592023179, "upvotes": 2}, "funm10c": {"link": "/r/college/comments/h7ideg/i_just_graduated_from_high_school_im_barely/funm10c/", "text": "Hi! I saw this post and being a college adviser, I wanted to give you some recommendations! \n\nSo to begin, you want to make sure some administrative work is completed this month! Here are some tasks to focus on:\n-send in your final high school transcript to your CC\n-set up your CC student portal \n-finalize any financial aid you may have been given\n-schedule orientation \n-take placement tests if needed\n\nEnrolling in college can be a lot of paper work and most of it is pretty easy BUT very forgettable. So it\u2019s good to get it out of the way ASAP.\n\nYou bring up very valid concerns about work and school, and just general college anxieties. It\u2019s important to recognize that while it will be challenging and stressful at times, it is doable! As a college student, you have to become an advocate for yourself and ask questions. You don\u2019t need to develop relationships with every adult on campus but having one solid person you can go to will go a long way. \n\nIn terms of your specific work question, I recommend getting in touch with an academic adviser. In my experience, CC will make you meet with one at orientation. If that\u2019s not the case, then you should contact admissions (email is fine) and ask who can help you plan your schedule. Once you get connected with an adviser, bring up your work schedule and figure out a plan to balance school and work! \n\nIn case you don\u2019t know this, in college you typically take 15 credits a semester. So that is normally 4-5 classes. A typical schedule looks like 3 classes on MWF, and 2 classes on T/R (R means Thursday). Freshman fall is usually just gen Ed\u2019s and remedial courses (if needed). As someone else mentioned, if you plan to transfer to a 4 year school, once you get in touch with an adviser, ask about \u201ctransfer agreements\u201d. It might be easier to transfer to some schools if theirs is an agreement, and they might be able to show you exactly what classes to take at the CC so it will transfer to a 4 year school. \n\nHopefully that answered some of your questions and feel free to reach out with any other questions! I currently advise 200 students who will be attending college in the fall and they also have these exact questions so you are not alone and you are on the right path!", "author": "hcwhitma", "created": 1592007533, "upvotes": 2}, "fumyiiu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/h7ideg/i_just_graduated_from_high_school_im_barely/fumyiiu/", "text": "Make an appointment (or walk-in) at the advising office. An advisor will have you in and out the door in no time with a concrete plan. You'll have to take certain classes, and those classes will be offered at certain times per quarter. \n\nA few examples are: \nEnglish 101, DAILY 8:30am - 9:20am\n- This means you'll be in class every day during that time. \n\nMath 094, Hybrid, MW 12:15pm - 1:20pm\n- Hybrid means the class is partially online, meaning you'll have to be in class on Monday and Wednesday but the rest of the work can be done remotely. \n\nAccounting 121, REMOTE/ONLINE/ARRANGED\nThis means your coursework will be fully online. You'll still have deadlines every week and have to participate, but on your own time and whenever. \n\n*ZOOM classes ARE held at specific times, and are not the same as an online class. You'll have to be present at the time, on Zoom. My college is entirely remote through Fall quarter so we are offered Zoom classes in lieu of in person classes. \n\nNot every class is offered every quarter. Only a few classes you'll need for your program will be offered, and sometimes you'll struggle to find the right classes that fit with your work schedule. These quarters it would beneficial to do class online if possible. \n\nPro tip: College isn't as hard as people tell you. Get that idea out of your head and take your work as it is. I struggled so much my first couple quarters because I put so much unnecessary pressure on myself. \n\nPro tip 2: Your college will have tons of services available to you, use them if you need them and even if you don't. Apply for scholarships, join clubs, and utilize services and resources. My school has a food pantry, bus vouchers, store vouchers to use for books. If you ever feel backed into a corner, just talk to someone. They are there to help you and have tons of ways to do so that most people don't even realize. We have a counseling center with free mental health services, a women's center with free services for women, veterans center with free services for veterans. See what your school has to offer and use all the things you can. I wish I had done this, that's what those programs are there for, and I struggled a bit at the beginning when I really didn't need to. \n\nAlso, every school has a payment plan so get on that for tuition. \n\nOh, and in my state, every credit after 10 credits is half price. This means you can take 1 credit classes for only $50. My school has sports classes, yoga, fitness, dance, music, and art classes all for 1 or 2 credits.

Keep both work and school in mind, but try and plan out classes first, if you can. You might be able to take online classes too, one of my friends does that at UH VICTORIA. I would only reccomend doing online, if the format works for you and you can keep your self accountable.\n\nAlso, once you get settled in on school stuff, look at scholarship opportunities. They give out scholarships for many different things, like just being tall! \n\nAnother tidbit is to wait until class starts to see if you really need your textbook.

Here are some thoughts on this:\n\n1. Consider starting small. Instead of signing up for a full load, sign up for a class or two and see how it goes (or whatever the minimum is for financial aid, if you are using that).\n2. Developmental classes are ideally there to keep you from failing the required classes and then having to retake them. If you think that you genuinely have improved since you took the class in the subject area, consider talking to someone in advising about if there are other options or other tests you can take to place at this point.\n3. Any progress is better than no progress. Even if you just take a couple of developmental classes in the Fall (so that you don't overload yourself), you'll be further towards your goal than if you took nothing. If you keep doing a little at a time, you'll have graduated before you know it.\n4. And finally, for mental health. You'll want to ask at your CC, but many schools actually provide resources and counselors! So, you may have more mental health resources available to you than if you weren't in school. In general, students who make use of the services offered (tutoring, counseling, etc) do better and are more likely to finish.

Figure out your college major and plan for obtaining your associates degree for transfer to a 4 year. \n\nIf you are undecided, try knocking out some of your gen-ed requirements in your first semester. My community college lists a detailed pathway for each major on their website, providing a scheduled class plan for each semester. If you still need help figuring out which classes to take, please visit your college\u2019s counseling department. Make an appointment ASAP; they are always busy. \n\n2. Keep your registration date in mind. \n\nNormally when you apply, they give you a registration date. This date and time is when you register for classes, so have your class schedule ready before then. Some colleges let you register online or in person, but I suggest doing it online because it was faster for me imo. Remember seats fill up fast, and you really don\u2019t want to be on a waitlist. \n\nThe college will also have a class list available before registration stating all the classes and the professors who will be teaching for those classes. Use rate my professor to avoid getting shitty professors. This part will be vital to your success in that class, so please plan  your class schedule ahead. \n\n3. Find programs to join. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if your college is doing in person lectures (my college will only being holding online lectures due to COVID), but normally there is a specific date for something called club rush. Club rush is just like how it is in the name lol, they pretty much set a date and time where you can sign up for different clubs. \n\nSince my CC isn\u2019t really having any club rush, I decided to join a few programs. It still may not be late for you to do too. I joined the honors program, which is pretty much like the college version of AP classes. Taking honors classes shows that you can handle the rigor of universities, and looks good to universities you want to transfer to. They also provide you with many transfer resources as well as research opportunities to showcase your abilities as a scholar. Some universities might even have agreements with your college\u2019s honors program that allows for priority consideration for transferring to their university. \n\nSome other programs that you might be interested in are Puente, UMOJA, Student Exchange Program, Student Body, etc. \n\nThey might even have work programs that can set you up with a job at the college. This is easier bc after work you can go straight to class or vise versa. Normally these jobs include working at the front office or maybe working the lunch line. These programs normally can promise you a guaranteed set of hours you can work for the week. \n\n4. Buy/Rent Used Textbooks\n\nCollege textbooks can be expensive. When you get your class syllabus, it has the name of the textbook you need for the class. You can buy off of used bookstore sites (Amazon, thriftbooks, etc.) or you can buy from people who have already taken the class before. If you look up your college on Facebook, you may find that some students may have created Facebook groups to sell their old books to new students taking the class. You can also try checking out the textbook from your college library. Normally these are gone pretty fast, but it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\n5. Sucking up to Professors through Office Hours (especially for the LORs lmao)\n\nAlways try to be in good kahoots with your professor. Professors have so many students, so they may not even know your name. Always try to drop a \u201cGood morning\u201d here or a \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d there. \nIn addition, professors love when students attend their office hours, especially when you seem to have a strong interest in their subject. Office Hours is always good too if you need help in a subject. But anyways, if you are good to your professor, it may be helpful in getting LORs (letters of recommendation) especially if your transferring to a more prestigious school. \n\n6. Invest in a IPad for Better Notes\n\nI hate carrying ten notebooks for each subject. Buying an ipad with the Apple Pencil was one of the best things I have done for my notes. Two great apps for taking notes are good notes and notability. These apps provide many features to make note taking more efficient. There\u2019s videos all over yt explaining the features of these apps so you might wanna check those out. \n\n7. CLEP Exams Can Save You Time & $$$\n\nCLEP test stands for College-Level Examination Program. Instead of taking a class for a whole semester you can have the option to test out of it. A CLEP is a test that measures how much you know about certain academic subjects. You can earn college credits by getting a qualifying score on their CLEPs. This is a great way to test out of some of your gen-ed and save some money. Tests and testing site fees would normally be like around $200, but with modern states it can be free. Modern States is a website that offers free exam prep and even pays for your exam and fees! You can also find other exam prep online for free as well. \n\nThousands of colleges and universities accept CLEP test scores (which are administered by the College Board). Most likely your community college will accept it, but they normally cap out around 30isb credits. In addition, make sure the university your transferring to can accept it too. \n\n\nAnd thats about it! This took me a while to type out, so I really hope it helps. Anyways, good luck on your college journey :)", "author": null, "created": 1591978878, "upvotes": 2}, "fulyg42": {"link": "/r/college/comments/h7ideg/i_just_graduated_from_high_school_im_barely/fulyg42/", "text": "Most colleges will waive the TSI requirement for a high enough SAT/ACT score - check their website for that policy.

If you can't pass high school Math and basic Reading exams; remedial classes are the least of your worries.  You need to toss Biology and Chemistry right out the window.  I was an honors & AP English, Biology, and History high school student.  However, very weak in Math.  I started out in pre-Nursing and it kicked my butt for my first degree (graduated with Mortuary Science instead), then tried Biology for my second (graduated with a BS in Business).  The level of Math they both require and high school Biology/Anatomy knowledge is insane.\n\nYou may not like remedial classes, but they are necessary if you can't grasp the material quick enough, have testing anxiety, or feel you didn't have the best instruction in high school.  I'm glad I was encouraged to take them in Math because it provided the foundation I needed to get up to speed.

I also didn't take SAT or anything, so maybe that has to do with it. You should check in with the counselors to see if you can do anything like that.\n\nI'll be honest with you, your first semester might be rough. And I mean it *might* be, which doesn't mean it will be the case for you. This is just coming from my personal experience. The structure is so different from high school. In high school, I was one of those students that just floated by with good grades in a few classes but very average in all others. With that attitude in CC, I failed all of my classes. And I mean literally failed. I didn't know what I wanted to major in, and treated classes like something I could put minimal effort into and still do okay. Don't fall into this trap! The next semester I pulled myself together and managed to raise my GPA by a whole lot, but that first semester was a wake-up call. It can be tempting to put things off or skip a few classes, but make sure you put as much effort as you can into your school work. \n\nIn terms of your mental health, please look out for yourself and notice how you're feeling. College can be a little overwhelming, but it's often completely do-able. Do you enjoy school in general? Studying could be something that can help you de-stress, as weird as it sounds. And build a network of people who will support you and talk with you when you need it. If you end up needing a professional (which I did throughout my whole college career), seek them out. There's absolutely nothing wrong with seeing a therapist. They might even have school therapists in your CC that could help.\n\nHave you looked into financial aid? That might help a lot with making college more affordable and allowing you to work less to adjust to your school schedule.\n\nI swear I'm not trying to freak you out! I think you've got this a lot more than you think you do. When you start to overthink, just take a step back and think of the reality of it instead of all the problems you think you'll face. And once you start school, you can adapt to your new life as a college student since you'll know how your experience will really be.

You could make significantly more working in a sit-down restaurant as a food runner or busser maybe, where you'd get tipped out.

Some employers care more for experienced candidates than your academic background to say the least.\n\nIts great to see you have an idea of what major you will purse, but the question is how will the job market be by the time you graduate? Both of the subjects you mentioned are very difficult in academia, lots of HW, and have few positions in the job market to begin with. You'll be competing against the other hundreds of students with the same major(s) for a handful of jobs. Im not saying dont do it, im saying think about it carefully. It sounds like you are in a rush by the many questions you asked and you won't have a good time in college by doing that. May continue working so you can have some money on the side. START INVESTING FOR GODS SAKE, start small though ($100). That way you can see how the market works and how you make money from investing. \n\nFor the most part, you should try to answer your own questions. You sounds too stress by your own words but I can't be the judge of that. It will get in the way of your job but still doable, hopefully your employer is willing to work with your school schedule. Mental health? What is that? Any subject in STEM has a lot of HW so there's that. \n\nAnd you answered your own question about why you had to take those dumb tests in the beginning. Its because many students forget what they have learned in HS and will have a BAD time if they were just placed at college level courses. In california, at least where i live, they passed a bill that allows students to place into college level courses and many struggled to keep up. Especially in mathematics and so they dropped the classes and had to start relearning fundamentals again. \n\nI swear, we need to change how schooling is done. Its so inefficient.
