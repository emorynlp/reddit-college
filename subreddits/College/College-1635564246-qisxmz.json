  "text": "Which classes from high school do you feel best prepared you for college?  I've heard AP English because writing is so important in college, for pretty much all your classes save math or science courses.  \n\nWhat do you wish you did differently in HS knowing what you know now in college?  How would you have spent your summers different?",

      "text": "What I wish I did differently in high school? \n\nI wish I didn\u2019t stress so much about getting into a good college. I wish I took more time to do things I enjoyed. I wish I set boundaries. I wish I cut toxic people out of my life sooner. I wish I took more fun electives. \n\nThe whole concept of taking as many AP classes as you can is so much more trouble than it actually ends up being worth when those credits are on your transcript. Go to the website of the college you want to go to and see what the AP classes you\u2019re thinking of taking count for, and then see if those classes count towards your major or gen eds or just see what they count for if anything and if it\u2019ll be useful before you decide to take it. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to get into a prestigious college then course rigor is also a factor to consider.",

My guidance counselor told me I would never get into a college.\nThat happened to be false as community colleges are pretty accepting. I'm getting all A's in my ASL class and have an a in English comp. Of course my learning disability is mostly in math, I should have taken more math in high school. However I haven't needed it in life.",
