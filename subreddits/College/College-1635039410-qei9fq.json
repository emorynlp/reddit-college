  "text": "My roommate and I get along fairly well. The only problem is that our room is pretty small, and she brought a lot more stuff with her to college than I did. She takes up a lot more of the space in our room, and I feel like I'm just shoved into the corner. She has a big pile of random stuff like extra pillows, boxes, and Walmart bags right next to our door. I want to ask her to organize some of it or maybe take some of it home since she doesn't use most of it. The problem is it's on her side of the room, not mine and it's not really in my way. It just annoys me to see a big pile of her stuff in the middle of the room, meanwhile I try to keep my stuff on my side so it's not in her way. How can I politely ask her to clean it?",
