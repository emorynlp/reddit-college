I just started a new job and have $700 to my name with my monthly expenses being around $500.\nMy laptop browser is notorious for not responding with just 3 tabs up, usually my citation generator, the article I'm referencing and my school system page. I'm at a loss. I have people I could borrow money from too, but I worry about paying it back",

Try to strengthen your budget more so you have better options. Most importantly, don't buy lousy equipment out of desperation - you'll pay it a lot and will find yourself in a similar situation sooner rather than later.\n\nAlso, you could try loaning a laptop from a friend or family for a few weeks until you save more money for a new one.",
