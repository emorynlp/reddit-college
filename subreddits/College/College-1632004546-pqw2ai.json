I looked into whether or not something similar was happening where I attend and that is not happening. How do these kind of letters start and how how/could I start such a thing. (Personally I want are university implement at least a soft mandate, so that woukd mean people could opt out of attending unvaccinated getting the vaccine if they present a new nagitive covid test on a weekly bases and continue get tested weekly.)", "author": "JGhero689", "created": 1632004546, "retrieved": 1632801531, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdef9rr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqw2ai/how_do_petition_letters_get_started/hdef9rr/", "text": "Go to your student government and present your idea to them.
