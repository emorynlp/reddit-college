      "text": "/r/college isn't exactly a \"Help me sort my life out...\" community.  \n\n> still lived with parents  \n\nNot relevant to the discussion.  \n\n> college is 20 minute drive from home  \n\nNot relevant to the discussion.  \n\n\n> current major is biochemistry picked it mostly 'cuz my folks kinda pressured me to go into pharmacy or physical therapy (or literally any stem field as long as it makes good money)  \n\nOk, if you don't want to be in biochem, what do you want to be in?  \n\nDo you understand the career outcomes from that degree track?  \n\nCan you explain the career options to your parents as part of a sales pitch for why you should switch?  \n\n\n> Was very depressed 1st semester  \n\nOk. What are you doing to address your depression.  \nIt's highly unlikely to just magically go away, and it will continue to negatively impact everything else we might discuss.  \n\nSo, what are you going to do about it?  \n\nYour school has counselors.  \nIf you have medical insurance, counseling is usually covered by insurance.  \n\nIt can be surprising how much you can accomplish with 4 therapy sessions and a prescription for anti-depressants.  \n\n\n> Study habits are shit and always have been shit  \n\nYour college has a tutoring center. Ask what they can do to help you learn how to study effectively.  \n\n> Taking those same classes for the third time and I'm already doing bad a month into the semester.  \n\nYour college has tutoring resources available to assist you. Make effective use of support resources.  \n\n\n> I don't find myself as interested in pharmacy as I used to  \n\nTake action. Stop the self-loathing or whatever.  \nWhat degree do you want to be in?  \nWhy do you want to be in that degree?  \nWhat are the career outcomes from that degree?  \nWhat do you need to do to switch majors?  \nWhat else, in addition to completing the degree, do you need to do to be well-prepared for the career destinations you see yourself in?  \n\nYour parents don't necessarily want you to become a pharmacist. It's just a convenient name for what they KNOW to be a successful career.  \n\nGather the information necessary to prove to yourself and to them that whatever you have in mind can also be a successful career.  \n\n> Feel shitty now because if I switch majors and/ or have to drop any classes again I'll be a year behind  \n\nOne extra semester is a small price to pay to be in a career path that you actually enjoy and can thrive in.  \nIf you enjoy what you do, it's easier to continue to study it and get better at it, which leads to faster progression & promotion.  \n\n> I don't really care about graduating late but my folks going to be happy about that  \n\nShow them that this is all part of a plan for your success.  \nShow them that you really have thought this through and gathered data and have FACTS to support this plan.  \n\n> \"Your cousins are working in a pharmacy throughout the week and are still doing well. Why aren't you?\"  \n\nNot relevant to the discussion.  \n\n> Gets gas-lit by mom into giving up on considering switching to CS or IT, only for her to act like she would be okay with me switching after I stay with biochemistry  \n\nStop rambling all over the place. It's difficult to follow.  \n\nDo you want to switch to CS or IT, or is your mother pushing you in that direction / suggesting it as a direction?  \n\n> Is there any hope for me?  \n\n#YES!  \n\n> Is it even worthwhile for me to try to stay on this path when it has not only proven to be difficult for me but trying to do it as hurt my gpa  \n\nI would not continue to follow a path towards a career I didn't want.  \nBut ultimately, this is your decision to make.  \n\n> I've never quite known what I wanted to do in life and I wish I were as ambitious as others  \n\nAgain, /r/college isn't exactly a career-planning community, but it's hard to tell you what degree to switch to if you don't know what career you want.  \n\n\n> I've always been Interested in thr tech field bit I fear it's too late for me to try now  \n\nIt is NOT too late to change majors or switch to a new career path.  \nI'm not going to lie and tell you it will be a super-easy cakewalk.  \nBut it's not too late to switch to what you want.  \n\nIf you want to pursue a career in technology that's definitely something we can talk about, but /r/ITCareerQuestions  might be the better community to have that conversation in.  \n\nWe see discussion threads in there from graduates all the time who have tried to make their degree & original career plan fork for years ask us how to get into technology.  \n\nYou are a 20 year old college student asking for career & educational guidance.  \nThat is a much easier conversation than a 38 year old with a spouse and two kids asking how to switch careers out of accounting and get into IT without losing their level of income, since they are the sole provider for the family.  \n\nTHAT is a tricky conversation to assist with.",
