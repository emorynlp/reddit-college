  "text": "Basically I'm chronically Ill and last week I had a family event that kinda triggered a lot of stress and boom, several conditions went off at once. I asked for an extension on my test, and I got one, for tomorrow.\n\nBUUUT I'm still sick as hell ( lost like 12 pounds in the past week, probably dehydration along with not eating)\n\nI would tell them about my chronic issues, but I have had experiences where they literally hated me for that.\n\nFor context, I am a part time student ( due to health).",

      "text": "Just explain it to them. In high school pre calc,\nI had COVID (with asthma), was off my arthritis medication, had severe constipation and a lodged kidney stone. I got that same extension and just couldn\u2019t work on anything bc I was so sick. I had already had my exam rescheduled by the school but I was doing an EC assignment for a harsh teacher. I wrote a sob email and even attached my hospital discharge papers \ud83d\ude39 it feels stupid, but all you can do is try. She felt so bad, she extended it. I finished it and then the school waived my exam \ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f obviously your exam probably won\u2019t be waived, but literally just try. You\u2019ll never know how sympathetic a teacher is feeling. Also, note that if you\u2019ve asked for accommodations/stated you\u2019re disabled, that will help a lot.",
