Basically I'm currently sort of panicking because my previous plans for college have fallen through. The main two possibilities I'm considering are either:\n\n* Attend 2 years of a community college (I would need to move/live on campus)\n* Try to go straight for a 4 year college (Still need to move/live on campus)\n\nMy biggest fear with going to a community college is that... I want the social aspect of schooling. I want clubs and classmates I can actually befriend who are my age, not 30-40 year olds that I feel like just aren't really my peers. And I don't want an experience that lacks the social groups aspect because, if nothing else, it's going to make me really depressed and my education will suffer. \n\nSo, the short question is: Can I have a normal college social life by attending a community college? Specifically, I'm looking at schools in the Seattle area (Shoreline, Central Seattle Community, North Seattle Community, etc.) Or am I just going to waste 2 years trying to muddle through my classes alone?", "author": "CPUGamer101", "created": 1632440106, "retrieved": 1632800744, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"he5x43d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu7j3r/is_community_college_at_all_like_normal_college/he5x43d/", "text": "CC is much much better.

A lot of CCs aren\u2019t residential, I don\u2019t even know if all of them have dorms (mine had housing that was basically just apartments under their name, it wasn\u2019t really traditional dorms). Class sizes may also be different depending on where you go. If you\u2019re willing to sacrifice that social aspect for cheaper schooling for 2 years and a bit of a jumpstart when you get to a 4-year I\u2019d say do it, but go into it knowing you\u2019d like to transfer later (I did it kinda spontaneously and it\u2019s fucked me over a little).\n\nI\u2019m currently in New Student Week at my regular 4-year and it feels very different.
