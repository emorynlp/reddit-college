  "text": "Greetings everyone, my name's Danil (Dan), and I'm currently a sophomore, attending a two-year degree program at SUNY Morrisville; my major is computer information systems (IT) with a minor in cybersecurity. I'm curious and want to find out if there happens to be anyone in this subreddit that would be interested in forming a study group for those in that same field; I feel this will greatly improve productivity and applied learning, through team building and chemistry.\n\nThis means we can ask each other questions and make use of our own feats and prowess to complement one another's work and make it a work-friendly environment. I was also thinking we can establish possible meetups through one of three platforms: Discord, Skype, and Zoom. My preferred meetup times are as follows:\n\nMonday & Wednesday: 2:00 pm - 9:00 pm\n\nTuesday & Thursday: 2:00 pm - 11:00 pm\n\nWeekends: After 8:00 am\n\nIf you agree to these hours and would like to be a part of the study group that I have planned, do let me know through dms and I'll be glad to invite you.",
