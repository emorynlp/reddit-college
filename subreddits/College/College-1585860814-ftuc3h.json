  "title:": "Does anyone else get headaches from staring at a computer screen to long? How do you combat this?",
  "text": "I'm taking 19 credit hours currently which is an okay work load for me, however since everything has been moved online due to covid-19 I have been suffering from headaches due to my lectures being on zoom as well as the majority of my homework. \n\nAfter sitting through online lectures all morning and on some days throughout the afternoon I have a hard time doing my homework afterwards because my head is already killing me. Is there any way to prevent this from happening? I want to do my homework but I've been putting it off because the eye strain and headaches are driving me nuts. I have been able to do the homework that's on paper but otherwise I'm worthless right now.\n\nEDIT: I did not expect this post to blow up this much. Thanks y'all for the advice I will definitely put it to good use, and Hopefully it will help out others who have encountered similar issues during these tough times. Best of luck!",

Excel on a laptop screen usually hurt my eyes). you can honestly find really decent ~24\" ones for 80-100 dollars. I would get a 1080p monitor. 720p makes the text too blurry imo",

I find a privacy screen filter (they are a bit pricey on Amazon) also help me at work to reduce eyestrain.\n6. Avoid using cellphones as much possible (because of the small screen real estate)\n7.
