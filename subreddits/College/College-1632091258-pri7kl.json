I thought I'd share this quick tip on how to manage them, using only materials you probably have on hand.\n\nPut a half lemon (or other old fruit) into a pint glass. Put aluminum foil over the top. Poke 5 holes in the aluminum foil using a toothpick (or something similar in size). The holes shouldn't bee too close to the edge of the glass - keep em central.\n\nFruit flies can get in but mostly can't figure out how to get out. When it get full of fruit flies, just take the glass outside and remove the foil. Let the flies fly away.  Repeat as needed.\n\nOriginally learned this with a plastic half gallon. It had one of those plastic pour spouts that comes with the handle (that you normally remove immediately). The night after a house party, a nearly empty whiskey handle was filled with fruit flies.", "author": "Agreeable_Kangaroo_8", "created": 1632091258, "retrieved": 1632801399, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hdka1hj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pri7kl/fruit_fly_life_hack/hdka1hj/", "text": "Also apple cider vinegar with dish soap works very well", "author": "genericusername_____", "created": 1632120042, "upvotes": 2}}}
