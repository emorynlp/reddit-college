  "text": "I live off campus and my club meets in student housing. I don't own a car so my dad drove me there. But my dad entered the building with me to see where the club is at. I feel really weirded out because I think student housing doesn't allow parents to entire. The door is locked but students came out and my dad and I went in. I think I have to scan my student ID but wasn't able to since someone from the inside opened the door. \n\nMy dad left after finding the room the club is held in. Also the club is dungeons and dragons and they play in rooms in the housing. I kinda wish they played on the actual campus and classrooms. But the room have a super long table so dnd is played there.",

      "text": "Housing is normally reserved for residents and guests. In the modern day, pretty much anyone can count as a 'guest' - including your Dad - and the locks only really exist to prevent strangers from just wandering in.\n\nIn terms of housing vs. 'actual campus', this is probably just logistics. It's normally a hassle for students to reserve classrooms and meeting rooms in academic buildings - they almost certainly need a faculty sponsor (who themselves will have to jump some through hoops) to facilitate it. In contrast, reserving a room in a residence is often as simple as just informing people you'll be using the room.",
