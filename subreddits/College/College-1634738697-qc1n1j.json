  "text": "So I am pursuing a Bachelor's of science in early childhood education. I went to a technical college while I was in high school and have completed my CORE classes. This semester I registered for classes at a private college for classes to get my associates in early childhood education. The advisors at this school told me that this was the way to begin my education.  \nBecause the school is private, I didn't get enough financial aid to cover the full cost so I began looking at other options, more specifically the university in town where I would have gone to begin my bachelor's program. I spoke with someone from the university and she had me send over my transcript from the technical school I attended. She says I have enough credit hours to begin my program could just begin my bachelor's program at the University, if I get accepted. \n\nI just finished my third day of class at the private college, last day to drop is tomorrow, so I walked in and just..dropped all my classes and returned my books. Just like that. It was such a big decision to make at the moment. But I feel as though I would've wasted a year getting an associates degree I didn't even need. Did I do the right thing? \ud83d\ude2c",
