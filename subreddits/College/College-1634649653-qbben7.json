  "text": "So I've always wanted to take a course in quantitative research methods. My major (rhetoric/composition) requires a qualitative research class, but since that class doesn't teach anything quantitative, I got permission to take a quantitative research class in the communications department.\n\nThe problem is, taking it would mean I'd be taking two fast-track 7.5-week classes at the same time. I'm a working grad student with a full-time job. This semester, I'm also taking two 7.5 week classes simultaneously, it means I'm working from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day, and it's really depressing. I don't want to keep that up, but I don't want to lose my only opportunity to take this class -- it's the last elective I'm allowed to take before graduating. But the alternative is that I could take two 7.5 week classes one after the other -- I'm not very interested in the second course, but my mental health would vastly improve.",

      "text": "You know your breaking point and mental toughness more than we do. \n\nI'm also a full time worker and just finished taking way too many classes over the summer. They weren't even particularly difficult classes. Just the compressed courses which turned what would usually be a reasonable workload into me hating my life, being depressed, questioning if this was worth it. Missing out on family time. Really just a whole summer wasted feeling miserable with little joy, and then only because by wife and daughter.\n\nHow much do you have left? The only way I did it was because I finish in December. It's difficult to just grin and bear it for a couple months, but it might help you in the long run.",
