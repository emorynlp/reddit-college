  "title:": "Homesick for the first time as a junior",
  "text": "For some background - my freshman year (2019) my parents lived in Asia while I came to college in the US, and I was super worried about being homesick but never was. I threw myself into life here, made amazing friends, took on new activities, loved the freedom, did well academically, etc. Then right at the beginning of the pandemic they moved to the US too (for reasons unrelated to me). This September, they moved back to Asia.\n\nHere's where things start to go south. We're back to 12 hours time difference, and what's more, I haven't been back there since 2019, so while they now regularly meet-up with my grandparents, cousins, family-friends etc (not to mention they again live with my dog, who I haven't seen in two years - but that's a whole different story), I'm here in my college town barely getting to talk to them, and completely walled off from everyone and everything going on there. Don't get me wrong, I still love my college-life, if anything it has only gotten better since freshman year, and I have a lot going on and going for me here. I have no desire to permanently move back, ever. But lately I wake up every day wishing I could just hop on a flight and go see them, see my dog, and everyone else I care about, just one time. My college friends went back to their homes for fall break, will go again for thanksgiving, and I can't go home till December. Sometimes it physically hurts with how much I just want to see my family right now. I feel like even one weekend would help, but of course that's logistically impossible due to the distance and costs. It's only been a month since I last saw them, i've gone up to four months without seeing them before multiple times, and never felt this way. I'll go home in December for two weeks, which I'm very very excited for, but until then I just feel shitty and I feel like it's preventing me from fully enjoying all the things I want to enjoy here during the semester. Anyone know of tips and ways to deal with this (assuming going home before December is not an option)?",
