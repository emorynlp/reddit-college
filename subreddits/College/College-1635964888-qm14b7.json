      "text": "It was a lot but I got through it. The biggest thing is to keep on top of things and finish assignments as early as possible to keep work from stacking up. \n\nI would usually spend a couple hours each evening either on an assignment/reading/reviewing and then Saturdays were my main study days. My friends and I would open and close the library on a normal Saturday \ud83d\ude02 (like 11am-6pm). I would try to catch up on work from the previous week and make a plan for the upcoming week. \n\nIt also helps to break bigger projects into smaller pieces and crossing things off a to do list is a good motivator.",
