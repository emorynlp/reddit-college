As we all know, online courses have been a mess this semester. In particular my chemistry class has been hell. Our average test scores are 20%-30%. I usually get lower, and chemistry has never been my strong suit. \n\nSince this is reddit, im not going to lie. On our 3rd exam last week I was having trouble with a few questions. Our tests are technically open note, but I went to the one place that is usually off limits: chegg. I searched some questions and some people had clearly copied and pasted the exam questions to chegg, and received answers. To my credit I did look at the explanation of questions and figured out how the answer became to be, but ultimately I did see the answer and therefore put that answer into my exam. \n\nYesterday my professor sent an email about how people posted the exam questions on chegg and how my schools Dean Of Students would be contacting chegg to request who posted the questions AND who accessed the questions. He mentioned how the penalties will be lesser if those who cheated came forward on their own. So I did. \n\nBecause I came forward and its my first offense, my punishments include a 0 on the exam, have to take an online academic integrity course, and get an official report filed at the Dean of Students just to have it on record in case I offend again. The real part that sucks? I work within the Dean of students which makes this 10x more embarrassing. Im pretty sure nothing will happen to my employment, but there's still a worry in the back of my mind. \n\nI never thought about using chegg to be honest. All of my roommates use it even on exams and a lot of other people in my class cheated on this exam as well. Its so common I didn't think anything would happen. But it did and its my mistake and I take the consequences. \n\nBasically. I want this to be a warning. I've learned a huge lesson, and I deactivated my chegg account. Id rather get a C in the class vs getting suspended from my university. Even though my punishments can be seen as mild, it certainly wasn't worth it.\n\nEdit: there are people calling me dumb and an idiot in the comments because they believe my professor tricked us into confessing. I dont know exactly what to believe, because on cheggs policy they say they can and will give out extensive information on who accessed certain questions, meanwhile threads on r/professor say differently. The point is no matter if I was baited or not, I learned my lesson from looking at chegg and won't be doing it again. I find it takes my integrity to admit mistakes then try to get away with everything. Sometimes its just better to receive the necessary punishment and learn for the future.\n\nAlso, everyone is asking why on earth id use my real name on my account. I did so because I truly didn't start my chegg account to cheat, and when I looked at questions during the exam I wasn't even thinking about it because its so common to use chegg. Yes it would have been smarter to not use my name, but understand that I didn't start my chegg account with the direct attention to cheat.", "author": "morfoodie", "created": 1606235453, "retrieved": 1632801937, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1671, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gdghetr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/k089ay/heres_what_might_happen_to_you_if_you_get_caught/gdghetr/", "text": "Thank you for sharing your experience.

But eventually he accepted their complains about *him* not being clear enough and that the works have similarities because.... well what do you expect when *you're* the one providing the same essay topics to everyone?\n\nYes, the professor is the one who assignment each student what their essay is gonna be about. The students didn't get to pick their topics. Yes, these topics were recycled - it's a class of like fucking over 50 people. OF COURSE some of the final works are gonna look the same! Not to mention the students had to it in groups, so like... I didn't hear the professor's side of it, but what gives??\n\nLike it was so ridiculous, to the point that if the some students even tired to just *help* one another, like beta-reading, fixing error, rephrasing, grammar, etc, they could get suspected for copying.\n\nI'm taking this course this year, with another class of students but the same professor.
