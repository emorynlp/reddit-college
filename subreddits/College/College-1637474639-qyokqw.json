  "text": " All i do is study, and take classes , talk to randome fake friends and go to gym and roam around. I am in college and i am so bored. I want adventure and glamour in my life. Idk what to do. I dont have any friends. Im a gypsy who just roams around talking to people, stays in apartement. Studies, goes to gym. Where is the glamour, the fun, the chaos... where? Im a freshman and no one ever invites me out. Whenever i try to go out i find people im not interested in. Idk what the fuck should i do, i try to join clubs on campus but they  catch no interest in my eyes. /im not interested. Idk WHERE IS THE GLAMOUR/THAT FUN CHAOS ?. I listen to stories about people's exes and i am like damn i wish my life was like that(cool friends). I know alot of cool people. Its not like i dont know them. But they arent my friends. Its like i meet with them. Have a cool talk then they are gone *woosh*. I dont see them. They dont invite me out. Then when i see their instagram pics where they hang out with their friends im like what? I never got invited to a party and i dont have a car since i am half american and half Asian / pakistani ( i was born in USA but moved to pakistan , now i am back IN USA  all by myself) I am american national. But where is that glampur i always imagined before moving here? I try being fake... very loud and funny but still people just give me attention for an hour and i give them attention but then they are gone and life is back to boring when i go to my apartements on campus. No one ever texts me first too. And its been 3 months.... still no best friends, no glamour.. what activities?clubs? There are alot but idk i just cant seem to find interest since i know people will leave me. I do go to sports matches in my campus but later the glamour is gone. Like what is wrong with me? Or with people ? I want friends who i can hang out with. All the time. Call them and just share everything with them. And they trust and share everything with me. They invite me and i invite them so i could experience a true college life . I do text them but they are always busy ( hanging out with friends) lol . While ignoring me.",
