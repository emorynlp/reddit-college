      "text": "In engineering, minors are just a few extra classes, so it doesnt hurt. However, you could use the spare time to do a few projects and build up your resume that way. Depending onyour degree, side projects can make or break your recruitment as it gives companies a good look at your handiwork.",

      "text": "Minors with requirements that are already classes you have to take aren't worth it. For example I knew someone who was majoring in data analysis and wanted to minor in statistics. Half the statistics requirements were already required by their major. Also data analysis kinda implies you've learned stats already. I'm not sure what classes engineering requires but try comparing the classes and see if the minor overlaps a lot.",

      "text": "computer science or math for engineering\n\nI got messed up with departments in college and have a BA in history (should have been minor because I liked the subject) minors in business and computers since (should be computer BA and maybe something in business/econ house etc).\n\nI basically turned it into I do document research in history so genealogy or history of your house stuff. Computer science and business is Lowkey business auditing (post bacc cpa license) in data science. \n\nMy first job post grad was scanning and databasing photos for a library. go figure. so to be a masters in library science is like a semester different in computer science wheel house. History, is another story (to advance my job), my phd is easy but I would not in my specific circumstance gain anything more than paper. I am a document researcher writing books in colonial history and I will be affiliated with the places who would want me with a phd and I am not interested in being  a professor (go knock yourself out if you want to phd in history).",

Learning something extra (not just having it written on your degree) can make you stand out when you get a job after graduating. Instead of being just another engineer in a pool of applicants, if you also minored in something else related to it, it makes you stand out with extra knowledge.",
