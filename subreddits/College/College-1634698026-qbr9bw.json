  "text": "i (17) am a freshman and i guess you could say i\u2019ve been having some trouble. i wouldn\u2019t say im homesick\u2026 im super close in proximity to my home and i don\u2019t have any urge to visit unless it\u2019s for major holidays. i also keep in touch with my family and friends and my brother lives in the same city as i do currently. \n\ni\u2019ve struggled with this a bit in high school but lately i\u2019ve been so anxious and just have been feeling blah. i\u2019ve been having panic attacks several times a day, my chest constantly hurts, i\u2019ve been crying a bunch, and i just feel empty. \n\ni\u2019ve also made some friends and i like spending time w them but i haven\u2019t really found people i\u2019ve connected with much. i also really like my roommate and we get along very well. i\u2019m good at making conversation i guess but it\u2019s just been so hard to even open my mouth some days.\n\ni\u2019m doing everything i can to get through the day and do well in my classes even tho that\u2019s the last thing i want to do. my education is super important tho so i\u2019m not planning on giving up on that. also im not necessarily struggling in school either and for one of the classes i\u2019ve been having trouble in, i\u2019ve been attending office hours etc. \n\nso i\u2019m not really sure what the issue is?? i\u2019ve just been feeling horrible and i don\u2019t know how to fix it. i set up an appointment at the mental health center so i\u2019m praying that goes well but yeah :( does anyone have some advice?",
