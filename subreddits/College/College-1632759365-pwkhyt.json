I enjoy the classes but some of them just don\u2019t interest me and I feel like changing my major might open more opportunities for me. I want to have a writing job once I\u2019ve graduated and I feel changing my major will open more opportunities for that field. I\u2019ve been thinking of changing specifically to the philosophy major due to me liking to critically think and read the different theories people have. Overall haven\u2019t made a final decision but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now.", "author": "JustARedditor31502", "created": 1632759365, "retrieved": 1632945565, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"hehldgw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwkhyt/thinking_of_a_major_change/hehldgw/", "text": "Fellow comm major here (my school specifically takes a social science approach.

I started off in CS and IT before one of my CS professors introduced me to comms and I fell in love with it. \n\nI hate to hit you with the \u201cthere\u2019s no real good answer\u201d schtick but it applies pretty heavily here.", "author": "JewlianM", "created": 1632760236, "upvotes": 1}}}
