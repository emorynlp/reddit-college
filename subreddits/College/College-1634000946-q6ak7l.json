      "text": "Find the reason why and take your ass to the library. You are going to need to be FASCINATED with everything you are learning. Take a 5 min break each hour and dont forget to drink water and eat food. \n\nRead everything and take notes. Review your old material when the new material doesn't make sense. Save an hour or two after the day and go wild with entertainment, minus drinking or whatever may impede you waking up early tomorrow. Take an hour after lunch to walk around. Write things down in lectures.\n\nYou are studious, a mean learning machine. Picture this as a montage like in dr. Strange.\n\nMake sure you get 8hrs of sleep and eat decent. Make sure you eat healthy carbs as the brain needs those (they love glucose ive learned in biochem). Wake up and tell yourself 3 things you are thankful for, say thanks during every meal. Keep positive, and stay away from distractions you are studying cause you like it, not because you have to.  Maybe chew nicotine gum only while you study, youll get cravings to study. \n\nTALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS literally visit their office hours and just go over what you are going over.\n\nSOURCE: been a student for 6 years and now I work 3 jobs, take care of family, and have 15 Credit hours.",

      "text": "I would start by calculating out how many assignments are left per class and then calculate the minimum score you will need on those assignments to pass. \n\nThen compare your old test/assignment grades and see how many more points you will need. Make sure you're being realistic with your goals (ex: it is likely you will not be able to get a 100 on an exam at this point in the semester. That's okay.) \n\nI would reach out to your professors ASAP. Tell them you really want to pass their classes, and ask them for extra credit opportunities or studying tips. Have you been regularly attending class, submitting assignments, and showing effort?\n\nDoes your college have an academic resoucres center or a peer tutoring center? Are there resources on campus that could help you?\n\nClearly something you are currently doing is not working. Reflect on that (realistically!) and think about what needs to change. Are you studying often? Are you studying successfully? Are you studying with distractions?\n\nFinally, make sure you are studying effectively. Look up retrieval practice, bloom's taxonomy, and the study cycle. I work for my college's academic resources center and have one on one meetings with students about adjusting their study strategies for success. You are welcome to private message me if you want to talk more about study tips and time management or I can elaborate more in this comment thread!",
