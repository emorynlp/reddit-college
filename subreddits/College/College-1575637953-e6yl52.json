I have unfortunately fucked up this semester and I\u2019m reaping the consequences. I have trouble sleeping and I think I\u2019m developing anxiety. I just want to know if you\u2019re in a similar situation and if we can confide in each other about our problems",

Had to take a 20% late penalty on an assignment I didn't think would take so long to complete. Feeling doubtful for Monday's exam too only because our prof penalizes out the ass for small errors. I've been doing 4-6hrs of sleep for like the past 2 months because of work/gaming/NBA/Netflix and try to catch up by sleeping on the way to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can only do my best and try not to overstress. I actually really enjoy the program I'm in, but my study habits and discipline are still as shit as they were in high school. I'm an instant gratification > long term reward person.  \n\n\nGood luck to you and hope you can recover.",

The crazy thing was that the solution was easy: Study efficiently and do your homework. That\u2019s it. The reason why people don\u2019t follow that advice is becuase of overconfidence or knowing that risk vs. reward was not an issue. Why? Becuase In the end, we won\u2019t die and life will continue. \n\nI dropped out this semester and realized that I needed more discipline and rediscover the drive and motivation I used to have during my first two years of university. You may need to take a break as well for a semester and recollect your thoughts and accept where you are. Who cares if you\u2019re failing? It doesn\u2019t make you stupider, it doesn\u2019t kill you, it doesn\u2019t drain the fun from you. Sure, the repercussions are dreadful such as repayments and such, but my guy you are fine! I promise! \n\nI won\u2019t say you got this, because in reality you probably really don\u2019t lol. But I can say that you\u2019ll get there soon :)\n\nEDIT: if you are studying and really failing, that\u2019s ok too. If you got the right amount of drive to reach your aspirations then you won\u2019t ever have to worry!",

If you take care of your body (eat right, sleep right, play right) your body will take care of you. Sounds stupid but it definitely works. \n\nI\u2019d get into detail about how to take care of yourself, but my lady is hurrying me up to catch a wedding. \nTake away: TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY, MIND, AND SOUL. and you\u2019ll be set to chase your aspirations. \n\nBest.",

I\u2019ve always made excuses of not having time to go to the gym but I\u2019ve realized that I DO have time. I also don\u2019t usually eat healthy at all, but I know that feeding your body correctly can develop the brain better.

I'm 21 and I just started as a freshman (technically junior transfer but I will be spending 4 years here) at a 4 year university this fall. I've been going to a community college trying to figure out what I wanted to do since I was 18 years old. I've lost countless scholarships from failing classes. Thought I was never good enough for college. So many things. But what I've finally come to realize is, life isnt a race. LIFE ISN'T A RACE. The end goal is to be happy and reach your goals. There's no time restriction on that. If you fail a class you fail a class, it sucks but really it's just a chance to try again, do better and learn more. I'm taking calculus 2 for the third time next semester and I still have no idea what the hell is happening in this class.",

I missed so much material that there's no way I could catch up.\n\nI'm doing fine in the business classes (my other major) that I'm taking and am planning on actually passing those with an A or B since they are the standard lecture + midterm/final + 1 or 2 projects.\n\nI've resigned myself to failing the bible classes, I'm transferring back home (the current school is about 3 hours away from home), changing my major to computer sci, and basically restarting. Hopefully everything works out, and when I send my final transcripts for this semester to the new school they just accept them, I don't feel like having to explain myself to the admissions councilor. \n\n(1 semester sophomore)",

You need to sit down and think about what you plan on doing in your future. Not just how your gonna improve next quarter, but also perhaps what you plan on doing if this college or this major (or college at all) isn't meant for you. After doing this I've felt much better.

      "text": "I am an undergrad Applied Math major with a long history of failing college courses.  The following is not for the faint of heart:\n\nSo I am currently attending university which I transferred to back in 2017 from community college.  At community college, I failed a lot of courses on the order of 7-9 fails (long story short, I wasn't motivated to do well in school at the time and I also have depression/anxiety which causes me to skip class when I can't even get myself out of bed).  So now at university, I've already failed 4 classes (retook for better grade) during a really bad semester where depression/anxiety was at a high.  However, considering all the other classes I've passed these past almost 3 years, I consider that as an accomplishment.  Fast-forward to this semester.  I am currently taking 4 upper division math courses (NOT EASY AT ALL) which are all tail-end courses of this major.  I decided this semester that I would focus my free time (e.g. weekends) on job searching and improving my skills for the job I want to have.  Since my school's program doesn't really emphasize strong programming skills, I have to practice A LOT outside of school.  So, I made the conscious decision to prioritize developing my programming skills and job search (which involved long hours of editing my resume/writing cover letters) over one of my classes which is the toughest class I am currently taking.  I am FAILING this class and I just bombed the final for this class yesterday.  However for my other 3 classes, I'm acing them all.  Overall, I'm pretty depressed/angry about this semester because my choice to focus on finding work at the sacrifice of my grades  didn't work out.  The interviews I got did not make it past the phone interview.  Its very frustrating.  Anyways, next semester is my last semester before I graduate.  I already anticipate that I will have to register for this class again (which is fine because originally, I only planned to take 3 classes next semester).",

In those semesters, I wouldn't attend class, I would miss assignments, and generally was not organized at all. I would just avoid school work at all costs and procrastinate like crazy. I don't think I was ever depressed or had much anxiety I would just avoid, avoid, avoid. I would go out or watch a movie with friends to stop thinking about school and it really worked. I wouldn't feel stressed I would just never do any work and not even think about it. Obviously once exams came I was so unprepared, I would tell myself \"this is the week to catchup\", \"you got this\" but because of my habit of huge procrastination I never really studied much and failed the classes. Over the past summer while I was back home I did some therapy which definitely helped a bit, but because my therapist was back home I didn't continue through the school year. The first half of my current semester was okay but I really fell off in the last month. My first exam is tomorrow, I really don't feel prepared and here I am on reddit. I don't know what to do, I really don't want to fail courses I am retaking but I don't know if I can pull it together. The weight of school that I have been avoiding for months is suddenly all on top of me and I feel really gross and regretful.",

I'm in my third year now and I took my first final of the semester, I am pretty sure I did terrible on it and my grade might not be high enough because I need a C or higher since its a pre-req. GPA wise this will probably be my lowest semester yet, looking at somewhere between 2.9-3.2.\n\nSome reason though I feel numb, like if this was earlier in the year or last semester I'd be really disappointed in myself and down in the dumps. During the final today I just took a few seconds to close my eyes and I was just like \"yup\". Cause theres nothing I can do, it is what it is in the moment- I legit tried my best and in the end I still wasn't able to do well and that is such a shitty feeling. \n\nI still have a week left before break and I still feel like I am dragging through, just trying to finish and go on break so I can have a mental break from all of this even if it is just temporarily. \n\nSome weeks are better than others, but I am trying to get better. Better at not procrastinating and actually giving it my all like I use to, but it takes time. I guess the longer I spend in college the more tired I get of this endless cycle of work over and over again- but I want to finish and graduate even if the process sucks total ass.",

My self confidence is non existent, I'm constantly anxious when thinking or talking about school, and I need to deal with self deprecation and self harm tendencies I've had since I was a kid. It's taken me way too long to realize that what I am is not normal for anyone. I wanted to think I force myself to be \"normal,\" go to school, bite the bullet, get good grades, be social. \n\nThe only thing I've gotten out of it is more harm to myself, constant stream of breakdowns, and I make everyone around me feel awful because of it. And I don't want to do the self-diagnosis stuff, but I really do think I have some form depression or anxiety that needs to be dealt with by the aid of a therapist (I went to the system they have at my school but all they did was put me in an echo chamber with no help, and when I did have a session with a psychiatrist near the end of the spring semester he just prescribed me antidepressants on the first session and stated \"I don't want you being depressed anymore\", and even then he never spoke to me again over the summer).\n\nBut taking this leave is scarier just because I don't know what I'm gonna do during and after it. It really does feel my world is at an end but I'm only 19 it shouldn't be. these bad grades are gonna plague me for the rest of my academic career, all because I pushed myself into a field I didn't like anymore, and because I didn't acknowledge I needed a break. \n\nAnd I've ruined my life because of it",

I think it will be really helpful to read that whenever you're in need of some motivation.\n\nNow onto my thoughts.\n\nYour life isn't ruined. I totally get feeling anxious and depressed about uncertainty. I've dealt with several bouts of severe, life-crippling depression as well.  They were the worst times of my life. However, leaving school will provide clarity and motivation. It will give you time to heal and learn about yourself: you can find what makes you tick, what brings you un/happiness, how to you dig yourself out of a self-destructive state, etc...I've been where you are now on multiple levels, I know how it feels, and I am truly sympathetic.  But if you work really hard on taking care of and improving yourself, I promise you will find your way. Almost no one walks the path they initially planned for themselves. You absolutely CAN come back from this, and emerge stronger and better than ever. I'm just a bit older than you. I was around your age when I left school. And believe me, it looks (and feels) great to go from Fs to As when you go back. Employers will certainly appreciate the determination, persistence, and self-awareness it took for you to recognize that you needed to take time away from school and come back with a running start.\n\nTrust me. Things seem uncertain right now, but as long as you are focused on learning and growth (and I don't mean that solely regarding academics), you'll find your way. If you want to talk more - because everything about you and what you're going through sounds so similar to me - my PMs are open. Anxiety & depression are no joke. Take care of that first and everything else will follow. While you are on your leave, **stay productive**.  Purpose and productiveness really does help with the depression when it's something you truly want to do. Pick up a new hobby. Focus on having non-zero days.

      "text": "Hi! Been there. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\n1. Go to whatever office helps students: student life, student services, counseling office, student retention, every college has something and they all call it something different, but it\u2019s the office that helps students Going Through Shit. If I\u2019m doubt just ask your professor \u201cmy life is a train wreck, what office do I talk to about getting help\u201d. Most of the people who work in that office were once in the same position as you, so just go in and start talking. They will connect you with resources and then help you figure out what you\u2019re academic options are.\n\n2. Determine if this is a one semester issue or a long term issue. If it\u2019s one semester, it\u2019s really not that big a deal. If it\u2019s a long term issue, then you need to decide if you can cope with it better next semester or need to leave and come back later. I tried the former and ended up doing the latter, and after 10 years in the workforce I\u2019m back in college. There\u2019s absolutely no shame in deciding college isn\u2019t right for you at this time, but also remember that if you were accepted to the college you ARE smart enough, you just need support to keep your life from sharting all over tour academic experience. I made my decision before option 1 even existed, and I don\u2019t think any student should withdraw without checking in with the student support offices at least once.\n\n3. Remember that in the work force, no one cares about or even knows what your grades were. They care about your skills and what you can/can\u2019t do... so the question you need to be asking yourself is \u201ccan I do what this class is teaching me to do\u201d and not \u201cwhat will my grade be\u201d. If so, carry on knowing that the C is just a C. If not, then drop it and retake it later for your own good. If you\u2019re going to retake, just stick out the class as long as you can, because you\u2019ll get more out of it the second time through.",

The commute is about an hour on a good day, and some days i just wasn't feeling motivated to take the train for 2-3 hours EVERY DAY for a 1.25 hour class. Or on Fridays, my hell day, I had class at from 9:30-12:15 and a HUGE gap until my lab around 6, I think. I started just coming for lab, since I had already taken chemistry in high school and could afford not coming to class everyday for things I learned from sophomore to senior year. \n\nOn top of that, I went to a music festival at the end of September. A fence/barrier fell and people at the front thought it was a gun shot. Had about 1k people running at me. Almost got trampled that day. Couldn't sleep for at least a month after that. By the time I realized I had insomnia and that's what triggered it, it was past midterms, I had skipped a good chunk of my classes and if I even went to them, there was a good chance I fell asleep. By the end of it, I just said fuck it. Tried to get some work in at the end, but I had already resigned myself to knowing I was going to fail. It was a lot to handle. Spring semester wasn't that great either. I'm much better now though!",

I finally got on antidepressants and antianxiety drugs. But my friend convinced me to work hard and see if I can pull off Cs in all 3 of these classes. If I can't then I will withdraw (hopefully they allow me) it is the last day of classes, I have 2 finals next week and my PI and postdoc are putting serious fucking pressure on me right now since I am their \"alpha undergrad\". I took 2 days off work in the lab this week to catch up on the insane amount of hw I have. Instead I slept in 13 hours both days, ate icecream, and played overwatch and halo. I am just so so burned out. But the new meds take the edge off so I don't panic or cry as much. This is my 4th year of college. If I get my shit together I may graduate on Dec 2021 or May 2022. But I hit loan capacity and either have to depend on 3rd party loans or get married so I can be a dependent and take out more federal loans. I have a group meeting in 30 minutes. I don't have as much data as my PI would like. I am so so so tired. The only salvation I have this semester is xbox, my adorable pet snake, and the weekends I spend at my boyfriends house. Despite both my grandparents and his grandparents pushing at us to get pregnant already. Ahhhh. Sorry, you asked for feelings and I gave a novel sized rambling rant. Oops\n\nUgh, but despite how work, school, and debt are crushing me I can't drop out. I haven't put myself into 30k debt for nothing",

For example, at my school, there is a unit cap for how many classes you can retake for a better grade where it will actually replace the grade.  After you pass that cap, retaking a class for a better grade just results in the school taking the average of your original grade and the retaken course grade.",

      "text": "I started Uni when I was 17. There was a lot going on. Academically, I wasn\u2019t really ready for college. I was smart but I learned basically nothing at my crappy HS. Mentally, I wasn\u2019t ready for college. I was about to find out how little I would take care of myself without parents and social pressure. \n\nIt was pretty much a disaster. I lived in the dorms for 4 years and I took 13-18 credits all 8 semesters. I think I passed like maaaaybe 35 credits worth of general education classes in that time. \n\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to go to class most days, and even during the semesters I did go to class, doing hours of homework seemed impossible. I would change my mind every few months about what exactly the grand-purpose of my life was, so even though it\u2019s best to just pick a decent program and stick with it, I was constantly changing my mind and losing motivation. I have some pretty gross/hilarious depression stories from that period of time but they probably aren\u2019t good for this sub lol.\n\nTurned out that I\u2019m Bipolar II and ADD, so knowing that has made a huge difference. \n\nI\u2019m now 26. If I had done everything perfectly when I was 17 with a bunch of scholarships and AP credits I could have a fucking PhD by now. I felt extremely awful about it for a long time. I was smart. I cared about the things I enjoyed studying. \n\nBut feeling awful doesn\u2019t really help. I did a lot of the growing up I didn\u2019t get to do between 12-18 in the time since I dropped out. I leveled out a little and got help. I figured out what I really liked to do, and had to be brutally honest with myself about what level of career attainment was realistic. Not because I can\u2019t do it- I still believe I can do anything. But what will I actually enjoy doing enough for it to be sustainable? Working shitty jobs gave me a lot of perspective on money and job satisfaction. \n\nSo now I\u2019m 26, with a 1.67 GPA and a boatload of debt. Only around 16% of bipolar people who start college finish it. I\u2019m going to be one of the ones who does. \n\nIt\u2019s mostly just stubbornness now, but I also realized that I needed a degree to do what I really want to do. If it was just about a good job, I would 100% go into trades!! Going back to school with my tail between my legs worried about being old and being a failure...I needn\u2019t have worried. My peers are great and I\u2019ve had multiple TAs and profs put my mind at ease about my record. The head of the lab I volunteer in (gpa too low for a student job, gah!) says straight A students make her suspicious: she worries that they care about the lab as a resume item and not because they are passionate. \n\nWill I need to work hard to get my GPA up for grad school? Yes. \nDo I feel judged by the vast majority of my profs? No.\n\n\nTake a break if you need to. If you can\u2019t because of aid take a semester of classes you will like enough that you\u2019ll go-even if they aren\u2019t really degree classes. Even if you don\u2019t think you have major issues, talk to a therapist. \nDon\u2019t forget resources on campus. Disabilities services on my campus does incredible work for students who screw up a few semesters due to mental illness and stress. \n\nI feel terrible for most of the young people on here who are worried constantly about perfect test scores and what looks good on a resume etc etc. I know some of y\u2019all are trying to get into really competitive grad schools...but hinging my self-worth on my academic performance was the biggest, most destructive mistake of my life. Even when it\u2019s time for a career, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met very many people who are career-obsessed who are even remotely happy. College is a means to an end, don\u2019t let it eat your soul.",

      "text": "Been in that situation. As someone who's been academically dismissed, clawed my way out of academic probation, and is now about a week from graduating, there are probably a few things I can say worth hearing. \n\n1) Don't quit just because it's hard. If it's a \"hard\" degree, there's a good chance it's one worth having. Map out the steps you have to take to get back after it, and take it one step at a time. Don't worry about whether or not it's your passion. There are gonna be dreary dog days where you're buried in notes/homework feeling anything but passion.  \n\n2) Use this Xmas break as an opportunity to possibly even get ahead of whatever it is you gotta take next semester. These days you can easily figure out the types of material you're likely to deal with in future coursework. And there's online videos and tutorials for days on all types of stuff. It puts you in the habit of getting ahead of things. Some people will go as far as to map out how poorly they can afford to do on the final to still get an A or B. Never tried that myself but it's a much better strategy than calculating how well you need to do on the final just to make a C.\n\n3) If you find yourself in a procrastinator funk, go listen to a motivational podcast or something. It sounds cheesy, but it can really help. Jocko Willink is my personal favorite. Sometimes all you need is an auditory ass-kicking to snap you out of it.",

              "text": "My experience, there's a few factors to consider. Obviously retaking a class means you're paying for it again. Typically financial aid covers that. However, some states have a certain number of times you can retake before you're paying extra per credit hour. Had to deal with this once on a 3-peat, wasn't particularly proud of it. \n\nSometimes there's also a max credit hour limit. My case because of hours attempted that either didn't transfer or apply to my major from years ago, in combination with some retakes, earlier this year I had to sign a contract to graduate on a set path. Or I would lose my financial aid. At this point I was close enough to graduation that I was done screwing around anyway. \n\nWithdrawal, from what I hear, is not always an immediate impact on financial aid. But I think it really depends on certain factors. At the end of the day, delays like this will always cost you more down the road. I've already accepted the fact that I could have had less student debt. But my situation is very manageable, not the case for everyone. There are a ton of payment plans that work for most budgets, at least on federal student loans. Now if you're staring down six figures in debt and 30K salary, you're gonna be living off rice and beans for awhile.",

These events affected me and my academic performance greatly. At first I did not want to admit this to myself and just kept going, but eventually i broke down. I failed more classes than i was allowed to and had to delay my graduation. I felt very lost and like i had failed miserably. It took me a while to understand that sometimes it's okay to take a step back when you're overwhelmed. You're in college! You are supposed to fail and learn and get to know yourself! Maybe you've taken on a classload that's too heavy or maybe this major just isn't for you. And that's all okay because you have time to figure it out. I know nowadays pressure on students is HIGH, you have to have a job, be social, work out, be part of a club/committee and then there is also student debt.  I know it feels like sometimes failing a test is the end of the world, but it isn't.  \n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is actually this: it's okay to take a step back and it will al work out in the end :)",

You can't calculate work done with varying forces without integrating. Even fundamental concepts such as force itself makes so much more sense in the context of calculus:\n\ni.e. Force is the time derivative of momentum (p), since p=m\\*v and the derivative of momentum dp/dt = d(m\\*v)/dt and mass is a constant so it is unaffected by the power rule so it becomes m\\*(dv/dt) and the derivative of velocity is acceleration leaving you with F=m\\*a. So force is the change in momentum over an infinitesimally small amount of time.\n\nIn my Physics I class, the first 5 weeks covered calculus-based vector kinematics, projectile motion, circular motion, free-fall, Newton's laws of motion, Forces, springs, tension, work, energy, W.E.T., C.O.M. & momentum, collisions, and fluid mechanics.\n\nThe remaining 5 weeks (trimester system) covered Einstein's Special Relativity (Lorenz transformations, time dilation, simultaneity, Twin Paradox, etc...), Elementary Quantum Mechanics (blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, electron spin, Heisenberg uncertainty principle, Schrodinger Equation & and bound-state solutions, Infinite square wells, harmonic oscillators, electron spin & Quantum numbers, the various kinds of total angular momentum within atoms, etc...), other related topics in Atomic Physics (such as hydrogen spectroscopy), Nuclear Physics (radioactivity, nuclear structure and energy, fission & fusion, stellar nucleosynthesis, etc...) and Cosmology (Constant expansion, dark matter & energy, etc...)\n\nSo I'm wondering this: how did your Physics I compare? I'm feeling like we were pushed much harder based on what you told me. For me Physics I was the hardest class I had taken at the time. It felt like I took a saw to my skull, opened it up, jammed a ridiculous amount of material into my head, and put my skull back on and someone tried to sit on it to keep it shut.",

And was able to work my way up to the dean's list for 4 continuous semesters. I struggled last semester quite a bit which I lost my spot, but I'm one semester away from graduating and I'm not too worried anymore about my academic history. \n\nYou'll be fine, just take what happened as a reminder that something needs to change in the future.",

I personally use flashcards which has really worked for me (senior in science, tutor, 3.8gpa). There are other tactics others prefer. Just make sure what you do has science behind it (and yes, there are studies about studying).\n\nIf you don't correct, this won't go away. I have seen freshman not be able to come back because they didn't learn and didn't change. Don't be like this. Just because this is a common issue, doesn't mean it's not an issue.
