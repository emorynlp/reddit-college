The following is not for the faint of heart:\n\nSo I am currently attending university which I transferred to back in 2017 from community college.  At community college, I failed a lot of courses on the order of 7-9 fails (long story short, I wasn't motivated to do well in school at the time and I also have depression/anxiety which causes me to skip class when I can't even get myself out of bed).  So now at university, I've already failed 4 classes (retook for better grade) during a really bad semester where depression/anxiety was at a high.  However, considering all the other classes I've passed these past almost 3 years, I consider that as an accomplishment.  Fast-forward to this semester.  I am currently taking 4 upper division math courses (NOT EASY AT ALL) which are all tail-end courses of this major.  I decided this semester that I would focus my free time (e.g. weekends) on job searching and improving my skills for the job I want to have.  Since my school's program doesn't really emphasize strong programming skills, I have to practice A LOT outside of school.  So, I made the conscious decision to prioritize developing my programming skills and job search (which involved long hours of editing my resume/writing cover letters) over one of my classes which is the toughest class I am currently taking.  I am FAILING this class and I just bombed the final for this class yesterday.  However for my other 3 classes, I'm acing them all.  Overall, I'm pretty depressed/angry about this semester because my choice to focus on finding work at the sacrifice of my grades  didn't work out.  The interviews I got did not make it past the phone interview.  Its very frustrating.  Anyways, next semester is my last semester before I graduate.

If I\u2019m doubt just ask your professor \u201cmy life is a train wreck, what office do I talk to about getting help\u201d.

They will connect you with resources and then help you figure out what you\u2019re academic options are.\n\n2. Determine if this is a one semester issue or a long term issue. If it\u2019s one semester, it\u2019s really not that big a deal. If it\u2019s a long term issue, then you need to decide if you can cope with it better next semester or need to leave and come back later. I tried the former and ended up doing the latter, and after 10 years in the workforce I\u2019m back in college. There\u2019s absolutely no shame in deciding college isn\u2019t right for you at this time, but also remember that if you were accepted to the college you ARE smart enough, you just need support to keep your life from sharting all over tour academic experience. I made my decision before option 1 even existed, and I don\u2019t think any student should withdraw without checking in with the student support offices at least once.\n\n3. Remember that in the work force, no one cares about or even knows what your grades were. They care about your skills and what you can/can\u2019t do... so the question you need to be asking yourself is \u201ccan I do what this class is teaching me to do\u201d and not \u201cwhat will my grade be\u201d.

There was a lot going on. Academically, I wasn\u2019t really ready for college. I was smart but I learned basically nothing at my crappy HS. Mentally, I wasn\u2019t ready for college. I was about to find out how little I would take care of myself without parents and social pressure. \n\nIt was pretty much a disaster. I lived in the dorms for 4 years and I took 13-18 credits all 8 semesters. I think I passed like maaaaybe 35 credits worth of general education classes in that time. \n\nI couldn\u2019t bring myself to go to class most days, and even during the semesters I did go to class, doing hours of homework seemed impossible. I would change my mind every few months about what exactly the grand-purpose of my life was, so even though it\u2019s best to just pick a decent program and stick with it, I was constantly changing my mind and losing motivation. I have some pretty gross/hilarious depression stories from that period of time but they probably aren\u2019t good for this sub lol.\n\nTurned out that I\u2019m Bipolar II and ADD, so knowing that has made a huge difference. \n\nI\u2019m now 26. If I had done everything perfectly when I was 17 with a bunch of scholarships and AP credits I could have a fucking PhD by now. I felt extremely awful about it for a long time. I was smart. I cared about the things I enjoyed studying. \n\nBut feeling awful doesn\u2019t really help. I did a lot of the growing up I didn\u2019t get to do between 12-18 in the time since I dropped out. I leveled out a little and got help. I figured out what I really liked to do, and had to be brutally honest with myself about what level of career attainment was realistic. Not because I can\u2019t do it- I still believe I can do anything. But what will I actually enjoy doing enough for it to be sustainable? Working shitty jobs gave me a lot of perspective on money and job satisfaction. \n\nSo now I\u2019m 26, with a 1.67 GPA and a boatload of debt. Only around 16% of bipolar people who start college finish it. I\u2019m going to be one of the ones who does. \n\nIt\u2019s mostly just stubbornness now, but I also realized that I needed a degree to do what I really want to do. If it was just about a good job, I would 100% go into trades!! Going back to school with my tail between my legs worried about being old and being a failure...I needn\u2019t have worried. My peers are great and I\u2019ve had multiple TAs and profs put my mind at ease about my record. The head of the lab I volunteer in (gpa too low for a student job, gah!) says straight A students make her suspicious: she worries that they care about the lab as a resume item and not because they are passionate. \n\nWill I need to work hard to get my GPA up for grad school? Yes. \nDo I feel judged by the vast majority of my profs? No.\n\n\nTake a break if you need to. If you can\u2019t because of aid take a semester of classes you will like enough that you\u2019ll go-even if they aren\u2019t really degree classes. Even if you don\u2019t think you have major issues, talk to a therapist. \nDon\u2019t forget resources on campus.

As someone who's been academically dismissed, clawed my way out of academic probation, and is now about a week from graduating, there are probably a few things I can say worth hearing. \n\n1) Don't quit just because it's hard. If it's a \"hard\" degree, there's a good chance it's one worth having. Map out the steps you have to take to get back after it, and take it one step at a time. Don't worry about whether or not it's your passion. There are gonna be dreary dog days where you're buried in notes/homework feeling anything but passion.  \n\n2) Use this Xmas break as an opportunity to possibly even get ahead of whatever it is you gotta take next semester. These days you can easily figure out the types of material you're likely to deal with in future coursework. And there's online videos and tutorials for days on all types of stuff. It puts you in the habit of getting ahead of things. Some people will go as far as to map out how poorly they can afford to do on the final to still get an A or B. Never tried that myself but it's a much better strategy than calculating how well you need to do on the final just to make a C.\n\n3) If you find yourself in a procrastinator funk, go listen to a motivational podcast or something.
