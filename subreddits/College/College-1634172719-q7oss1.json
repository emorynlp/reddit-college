      "text": "Well for me, I normally read my draft, throw it out, go to sleep, then wake up and make a better draft. Somehow, I write better on every subsequent attempt. \n\nHowever, in terms of revising an essay without rewriting it, I suggest a partner willing to read your essay for their thoughts on it, their suggestions, and then writing with that in mind.",

I also type fast and love writing, but this is only for more \"fun\" or non-sciency type of essays; for a research paper on say hydroelectrodynamic particles, with multiple layers of citations being strewn through, I am going back and dotting all the i's.\n\nIt depends on what I am writing for, really. If I need to communicate an idea in a dry manner, how I write it beyond how clear my messages are to the viewer are irrelevant.",
