  "text": "I\u2019m basically just asking for your opinion, I\u2019m a computer engineer freshman while I\u2019m above average I just don\u2019t really feel it. There\u2019s no passion or anything, maybe because my parents just told me to go to college so I choose computer engineering just to stop the constant nagging. Currently I\u2019m really into business and creating 3D designs, drawing and stuff. So I was wondering if I do switch any course suggestions?",
