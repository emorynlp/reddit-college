I can assure you even of the people sitting in those groups a good portion of them feel like they aren't friends with those people and feel out of place. \n\nYou're not alone in your loneliness and there are a bunch of people who feel like they can't meet anyone either. It's just about figuring out who that is- or just finding someone who you can vaguely relate to. \n\nFind someone you have a class with and be friendly to them- they will probably reciprocate. If they don't you can move on because you wouldn't want to be friends with them regardless. \n\nAsk someone from a class if they want to grab lunch to talk about the class work- there's nothing like bonding over stuff you find out while trying to do homework/study. If they don't want to study together ask someone else in your class. \n\nIf you see one of your classmates outside of the class you should start a conversation about class- then move on from there if they seem cool. \n\nPretty much everyone wants more friends and a lot of people have no idea how to make friends when they don't have the exact same schedule as someone else for thirty-five hours a week. You are not alone and you can figure it out- just remember most people are having a lot  more problems than they want you to think- you're doing great dude. \n\nThe first bit of college was super scary for me (I was younger than everyone and super awkward) but I realized pretty much everyone feels that way and if you can project enough confidence it will be fine. Just start talking to people, it can be about literally anything you can identify as a common factor. Class is usually the easiest thing to start with but if you can find a second thing you're golden.

I didn't lie. I only said what I meant lol. I also eavesdropping a little, the jeans comment was in reply to someone saying same to someone else to their friend. \n\nEvery time I chatted someone, I introduced whomever friend I had just made, and made sure to show interest also in whoever they were with. I asked names over and over. Because if I see them later, I want to yell \"hey julie!\" Even if Julie and I have 0 shared interest because Julie might be hanging out w/Sam someday when I yell, \"hey Julie\" and Sam will be like \"oh I met her at x but we don't really talk because she y major\" but Sam says hi to me in class someday after she switches to y major... its never quite so smooth but you get it. Just be interested. Be nice. Have open body language.\n\nSo I went and changed :) and then went a slip and slide and no one was there, ezxpt 3 girls and I was hesitant to go alone. They said openly they'd wait for me. Then I met EVERYONE in their dorm including a mass communication major I had nothing on common with. We just chilled because of proximity and that guy runs DND. \n\nSo. You have to kind of, turn it on.\n\nI also recommend clubs, outdoor activities, student engagement and or intramural sports.
