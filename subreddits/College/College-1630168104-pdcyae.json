Try to become friends with your roommate, hang out in public spaces in your dorm so you can try to meet your neighbors, and go to programming and events that the school and organizations put on to meet new people while having fun.\n\nEven though I still haven\u2019t really made friends with anyone beyond my roommate, it\u2019s those early impressions that count and taking the initiative to try elsewhere will go a long way.",

I joined a club and within a month I had a whole new friend group of people to spend time with and eat with. Most colleges have a rather extensive set of clubs to cover a lot of various interests.",

I\u2019m in my 3rd year of a 4 year Bachelors (not sure what that is in America) and I would say that I\u2019m very happy with where I am when it comes to friends in college, but on day one, I sat alone, I was petrified of introducing myself to anyone. On our first break I was sitting alone in our canteen watching other students mingling when I seen 3 guys round a 4 seater table, I was so scared, but I repeated it over in my head that I wanted to sit down with them, and counted down from 10, I introduced myself and met 3 of my best friends in the entire world, guys that I would do anything for. Sometimes, all it takes is one awkward hey and the rest becomes history.\n\nBest of luck in your search!!",

Anyways, during my first semester I had a lounge I was able to eat in and made tons of friends. I could make my food and had access to a fridge and microwave, it was great! However, my college took away these resources due to the pandemic. Can't eat indoors anywhere unless you buy the cafeteria food. I now eat alone in my car every day, and I hate it. I hate eating in a car all crammed up without a table. I hate eating without friends and not having conversations. Most of my friends from the lounge have since graduated and all I know is that it feels impossible to make new friends. I'm also fairly active and involved. I just don't know how to maintain friendships outside of my activities. I can only imagine this is even worse for the younger students who feel lonely.",

I met a few people but definitely wouldnt want to share a meal or hang out after class tbh. My roommate was kind enough to keep inviting me places but you\u2019d most likely find me studying in the classroom within my dorm. One day I was up studying late in said classroom and was approached by 2 girls, 1 guy. Not even sure exactly what was said but we kicked it off from there.\n\nFast forward, I transferred back in-state during the pandemic and am commuting so I\u2019m very much of in the no friends category again lol It doesnt help that Im a super senior and anyone I know that attended my now current school just graduated this past May. Now my plan is to study in the quad twice a week and attend any back to school events on those days. Hopefully this works haha Not sure if you\u2019re commuting or living on campus but my advice is give people the chance to approach you. Keep attending events even if they\u2019re not necessarily meant for \u201cmeeting people\u201d. You\u2019ll also eventually meet people you don\u2019t mesh with and thats fine. Don\u2019t force it, don\u2019t rush it, and it\u2019ll work itself out.",

Its obviously different in high school but after that you wouldn't always be with someone all the time. Its difficult to grasp this but it is how it is. And that is not always because you are lonely or dont have any friends. It can be because you want alone time, schedules don't line up anymore and you just have other stuff to do. I go to places to eat all the time. Well not like fancy restaurants but places like Chipotle and what not. Its a useful skill to be enough by yourself and enjoy your own company. And like some other people said no one gives a shit if someone is eating alone or not. And the people who do they are not worth caring about",

I can assure you even of the people sitting in those groups a good portion of them feel like they aren't friends with those people and feel out of place. \n\nYou're not alone in your loneliness and there are a bunch of people who feel like they can't meet anyone either. It's just about figuring out who that is- or just finding someone who you can vaguely relate to. \n\nFind someone you have a class with and be friendly to them- they will probably reciprocate. If they don't you can move on because you wouldn't want to be friends with them regardless. \n\nAsk someone from a class if they want to grab lunch to talk about the class work- there's nothing like bonding over stuff you find out while trying to do homework/study. If they don't want to study together ask someone else in your class. \n\nIf you see one of your classmates outside of the class you should start a conversation about class- then move on from there if they seem cool. \n\nPretty much everyone wants more friends and a lot of people have no idea how to make friends when they don't have the exact same schedule as someone else for thirty-five hours a week. You are not alone and you can figure it out- just remember most people are having a lot  more problems than they want you to think- you're doing great dude. \n\nThe first bit of college was super scary for me (I was younger than everyone and super awkward) but I realized pretty much everyone feels that way and if you can project enough confidence it will be fine. Just start talking to people, it can be about literally anything you can identify as a common factor. Class is usually the easiest thing to start with but if you can find a second thing you're golden. You're going to figure stuff out but until then remember no one else really knows what they're doing either.",

Here is how it went.\n\nFound actives online, signed up for contact tracing, committed to going.\n\nWent to event and chatted with people in line. This is like, commentary or complimentary or observation. \"Omg, im so glad I didn't wear jeans\" \"oh I wish I'd thought of that\" \"I love your x\"  I (as a woman) complimented about 15 swimsuits yesterday. I didn't lie. I only said what I meant lol. I also eavesdropping a little, the jeans comment was in reply to someone saying same to someone else to their friend. \n\nEvery time I chatted someone, I introduced whomever friend I had just made, and made sure to show interest also in whoever they were with. I asked names over and over. Because if I see them later, I want to yell \"hey julie!\" Even if Julie and I have 0 shared interest because Julie might be hanging out w/Sam someday when I yell, \"hey Julie\" and Sam will be like \"oh I met her at x but we don't really talk because she y major\" but Sam says hi to me in class someday after she switches to y major... its never quite so smooth but you get it. Just be interested. Be nice. Have open body language.\n\nSo I went and changed :) and then went a slip and slide and no one was there, ezxpt 3 girls and I was hesitant to go alone. They said openly they'd wait for me. Then I met EVERYONE in their dorm including a mass communication major I had nothing on common with. We just chilled because of proximity and that guy runs DND. \n\nSo. You have to kind of, turn it on.\n\nI also recommend clubs, outdoor activities, student engagement and or intramural sports. But what gets you friends is that you keep going consistently.\n\nAlso. I AM AN INTROVERT. this is not meant to be advice from someone with no problems making friends.",

Then join the conversation :) obviously use your better judgment... when all else fails, its college... \"whats your major?!\" \"What kind!?\"(for biologists, engineers, economists, nurses, social work) or \"what do you want to do with that\" or \"how did you get into that\" \"why did you pick that!?\" \n\nYou don't have to get a snap. Some people keep hanging out with you, some people you circle back to. \n\nLet's see, one guy asked to tag along to food, while we were waiting in line (because he wasn't my friend till a second location, now that we've identified \"our\" his and my group is going...) we were talking in line about dnd, and I said, \"im looking for a new group to join\" (he has an out because I didn't say your group, I said a group) then I was invited and we traded snaps. \n\nAnother was this guy, who handed me this girl on a silver platter because she was from my hometown, I got his snap to send him an article about \"tracter DRM\" (he was an engineering major, and im bio, but the middle ground is ag because hes a farm kid...) and hometown girl had to get my snap because I found out she lost her voice at a roller blading rink and I was like \"omg, you HAVE to let me know next time you're going\"(less awkward inviting myself to a 20person roller rink than a 5 person dnd...) \n\nSo basically find common ground and name it. And that's a good time to introduce yourself. \"Oh im btb by the way\" or \"I didn't catch your name!\" Don't have common ground? Keep asking questions(like 3-5 lol, people love talking about themselves) but move on to others, in a non-dismissive way. And never be afraid to stick people together, like I did with random people, and like that guy did for me. Don't be super attached to the snap, I only got one from a group of three, but the 2 others got my snap from her. But even if you get 0, you can find people again on campus. Then be like \"dang you were fun to talk to! I can't believe I didn't give you my snap(get your snap)\n\nAlso, I keep saying snap. Im actually a texter... but this is 2021 and its WAAAAAAY easier to get a snap BUT YOU DONT HAVE TO BE INVESTED IN THAT. JUST HAVE FUN HANGING OUT! the whole time I was thinking, if I made no friends I still had fun with xa and y and talking to people. Even people I will NEVER see again lol.",

Join as many that pop out at you and go to their first meeting to check out the clubs and people there, then figure out if you want to keep going",
