  "text": "Like the title says I'm way behind in all my classes 3 classes. One an 8 week second time taking two 16 weeks and I'm taking out loans and rent+ bills+ tuition. I don't know why. Lately it's like the days just pass by and by I don't really think of myself much as a student anymore and am just drifting through. School matters to me, the cost of the classes matter to me. Education matters getting a job that works matters even if I become self employed.\nBefore I wanted to be a chemist and get my degree and so I was counting the credits and stuff and I failed a few classes in stem so I changed this semester to non stem requirements that I still needed to fill. I've become interested in learning what I'm learning to apply it to the real world in maybe an own business idea I could come up with. I have a little site where I reflect. I mean the past year in school and out it's been different than before for me when I started out I had this vigor like those people who play in the nfl going for the prize go go go and I did. Now it's sort of shifting my priorities really discovering myself in life and my place in it. And what\n I'm going to do with the chapters I need to read and the papers I need to write. I know that going to school not for the degree is really expensive because there is always the library. Speaking of which I used to go to and I used to read now not anymore. It's all kind of been slow lately. I don't know why I mention this. I mean I wouldn't say I'm in a rut like in a miserable place because outside of college things haven't been that bad. And I mean I haven't been to a therapist but my mental health has been better and I feel more with myself despite not doing to well in school. I don't know what to think of it. I was pressuring myself a lot before to pass do well in school I mean I felt pretty alone even amongst my teachers and classmates now I'm pretty numb and emotionally distant from that. It's sort of good in a sense I guess because I was being too hard on myself. I try my best. I care to learn. I know what they teach in school isn't the meaning of life and neither is a job or a house or that other stuff they try to sell everybody. Of course I still like college student on a resume or employed I go to college with the idea to not be homeless I just like having a home like most what everybody does as well and electricity water that's nice too. A decent job that I don't hate an that doesn't screw me over and exhaust me as well in exchange. Maybe this is good an epiphany I don't know. A part of my life a transformation in the way I see things I don't know. I hope it all turns out for the better because I mean I don't know about next semester next year I don't even have the time to think about next week or the paper due tomorrow. I don't know what to call it procrastination. Disorganization. Hormones I mean in college it had been a rollercoaster. I just hope that whatever job I take after college and even my time in college it's not a rollercoaster spinning and spinning.",
