  "text": "I need to drop out so I can work and make more money (living expenses + school + more) because right now I barely even have time to do homework/projects and it has affected my GPA negatively.\nI've extended my community college career for 5 years now, taking my time, and my GPA isn't doing so well. \nIf I drop out, and come back, can I re-apply with my bad GPA?",

      "text": "I'm so sorry for my earlier comment, I'm no longer under the influence. So what I would suggest is talking to both your lecturers to see if they can offer any leniency for late assignments or if they can offer extra assistance and your boss to see if you can find a way to make sure you get assignments and needed study done without losing too much income or work hours. But if worse comes to worse, you can always drop out and try again when you're not financially stable.",
