  "text": "And how do you get started when you want to start college? I took a GAP year, I\u2019m currently 18 years old. I have never really liked school so I am worried about going into something I won\u2019t end up enjoying. But I\u2019m also so tired of having no direction or structure in my life. I want to move on and start making money that can sustain me. You know? How did you figure out which major was best for you ?",

      "text": "I\u2019m studying French and Spanish education, and I had always wanted to be a teacher but I never really \u201cclicked\u201d with a subject until I started French my senior year of high school. I was also a super shy kid so I thought that I just didn\u2019t have what it took to be a teacher, so I chose a STEM major. I got to college and got more confidence, and I would try to speedrun through my work so I could get back to learning French. After my first semester I realized that I could be a teacher and that I love languages, so here I am. I started Spanish this semester and I love it so far. It sounds stupid, but the idea of teaching children a new language makes me feel so excited for my future. And I think that\u2019s the feeling you should get when you know what you should study.",

      "text": "Honestly as soon as I graduated high school,I got a part time job and went to college. I didn\u2019t have any idea what I wanted to do. So I decided to go to community college and just get my associates. I took some 101 classes for different majors and eventually took a year off. You won\u2019t know what you want to do in life unless you experience life. So have fun but don\u2019t get stuck in the cycle of working. Now I\u2019m not going to bore you with my life story. I would definitely suggest reading books on things you find interesting. What kind of hobbies do you have ? Do you like to work with your hands ? Do you like science? Eliminate what you don\u2019t want to do and just kinda go from there.",
