  "text": "Both me and my bff that I\u2019ve known for more than a decade recently started college. The thing is, it\u2019s not the same college. I knew that it would be hard bc I had her all my life and now that she\u2019s not around to go to parties with me and introduce me to new people, I don\u2019t know what to do. I am not a socially awkward person but I don\u2019t really make the first move on someone.. like ever... (INFP here) \n\nI\u2019m feeling emotionally unstable and people around here are SO rude like tf? They\u2019re not even friendly, even if I was able to make the first move (like go say \u2018hi\u2019) no one is willing to be someone\u2019s friend. \n\nI\u2019m seriously doubting my decision to go to college. I feel so lonely and my roommates are longtime BFFs. I feel so left out and I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re friendly either. I moved to another city ONLY for this college and it feels like I\u2019m drowning right now. Is there a way to meet NICE people? I\u2019ve never been this alone and if I meet some nice people, I\u2019m willing to go talk to them first.",
