      "text": "I'm a professional scientist, and I love my career in STEM.  However, I can absolutely assure you that you do not need a STEM degree or a STEM job to have a fulfilling career or make decent money.  There are thousands of jobs out there that have nothing to do with STEM, so if you're not actually interested in STEM subjects, then find a different path in life.  STEM material and STEM degrees are challenging on their own, but they'll be doubly challenging for someone who isn't really interested in the material.\n\nGood luck.",
