My advice was not to focus on the grades as much as the overall learning experience, and other important aspects of college, which often get overlooked from a usefulness perspective. These aspects include networking, learning outside of the classroom, exposing yourself to new things, and keeping ones life balances, and trying to keep oneself healthy, both in body and spirit.\n\n## First off:\n\nBalance is important to maintaining a healthy life and maximum productivity. The amount of stuff you get done is not based purely on the amount of time in which you attempt to be productive. Procrastination is often a result of emotional stress and anxiety, and not laziness. Telling yourself to \"just do something\" will not make it easier to be productive towards a particular goal.\n\nThis guide aims to give you advice on how to effectively manage your college experience.\n\n## Time Management\n\nTime management is an essential part of being productive. You don't need to account for every second of every minute, but you need to create a schedule that works for you. Attempt to find the worse uses of your time, and eliminate them form your habits.\n\nUse time between classes wisely.\n\nTry to track time and figure out where it goes.\n\n## The Big Five\n\nI like to think of \"the big five\" them as MEDSS \"meds\" with two s's. The big five are meditation, exercise, diet, sleep, and social (activity). Incorporating these into your life on a regular basis will vastly improve it. There may not be any magic pill, but these things will improve your life likely more than any medication will (with some notable exceptions if you are gravely sick). \"The Big Five\" also\n\n### Meditation\n\nMeditation can be easily started with an app such as headspace, or insight timer (I believe there are many others, these are just the ones that I happen to use). Only takes 10-20 minutes a day, and you will see real improvements in your life.\n\n### Exercise\n\nExercise should be done at least 3x a week, and can be in very many forms. You can do strength training, yoga, cardio (running, rowing, stair stepping, HIIT), climbing, team sports, and many other things. I personally do strength training with some cardio thrown in (not as often as I should with the cardio, but I'm working on it). **Remember, an exercise activity you will do is more important than something that is ideal for maximum health, that you never do.**\n\nI believe that strength and cardiovascular training should be included in everyones workout routine. I personally started strength training with Stronglifts 5x5, and I highly recommend it as something that is simple and easy to get started with. Starting strength is another good option. Please note: you _need_ to use proper form, or you will end up injuring yourself over the long run, I suggest watching the Stronglift's videos and reading the articles on form, and getting a knowledgable friend to check your form. (this does not take much time, just an hour or two, and you don't have to do it all at once)\n\nYou can avoid injuries by starting light and working on your form as you add on weight. If you follow Stronglifts you shouldn't have an issue. I did it for 2 years and was previously totally untrained (no previous lifting experience). With 3x a week I made some serious progress. Additionally, strength training will increase the amount of muscle on your body, while decreasing the amount of fat (depending on your diet), so you'll look *hotter*.\n\n### Diet\n\nI am no expert on diet, and there are many debates over what is healthy, mainly make sure to limit your caloric intake (so that you don't gain weight), and to lose weight if you are overweight. I recommend looking into fasting, as it seems to be a useful tool if used properly. HOWEVER PLEASE TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR, AND NOTE THAT FASTING CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS ON HOW YOU SHOULD BE DOSING MEDICATIONS.\n\nI also suggest focusing on eating foods with less added sugar, making sure you get your proper daily intake of nutrition. If you want to lose weight, cutting out any beverage that is not water can make a huge difference. Additionally, eating foods that fill you up can help you eat less, since you will be satiated.\n\nNote: if you start lifting, make sure you eat enough, otherwise it will stunt your progress\n\n### Sleep\n\nSleep is something that very many people vastly overlook. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night is essential for your physical health, emotional wellbeing, and especially for your productivity. Productivity is not a function of hours in times some constant is equal to productivity. Productivity has many factors including your state of mind, how clear your head is, are you actually able to sit down and work to get started. You may gain 2 hours in the day by sleeping 6 hours a night, or gain 4 hours by sleeping 4 hours a night, but you will murder your productivity and health not only in the long run, but in the short run.\n\nTwo weeks of getting 6 hours a night is like having a 0.08% BAC, the legal limit. Also staying up for 18 hours consecutively produces similar effects. Sleeping less may be okay for one night at a time, but if you do it every night, you will be less productive, despite having more hours to work.\n\nA very small percentage of the population can manage getting by with less than 7-8 hours, but they are a tiny minority. About 1-5% of the population, I forget the exact statistic. YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT IN THAT GROUP.\n\nCollege kids, and people in general like to brag about how little sleep they get. Don't be like them, get a healthy amount of sleep. You'll come out ahead in the long run.\n\nSleep is especially important the nights before exams.\n\nAdditionally, try to go to bed at the same time, and wake up at the same time every morning, including weekends.\n\nNo blue light before bed, preferably no screens at all. Try reading a book. :)\n\n### Social (activity)\n\nBelieve it or not social activity is important to good health. I happened to ignore this for many years, because I tend to isolate myself when I am busy and stressed, and figure I can get more done by staying in my room for days at a time. Social interaction during the day is good, but taking time to get away from your room/routine also does good, especially if you can go to a game night, or concert, or whatever with friends. I don't know exactly what the research says about frequency, but I'd suggest trying to do something at least once a week for a couple of hours. By this, I mean do something outside of normal mingling and gossiping at your workplace, before and after classes, etc.\n\nSocial accountability is another powerful tool that will help you. If you can get your friends to be disappointed in you when you don't study properly, or do something you're supposed to do, like exercise, it will be a massive deterrent against doing things poorly. Additionally, finding an exercise buddy can be useful to help you blow off steam, and to encourage you to exercise when you don't want to.\n\nA large part of college is the developing of social relationships, even though you may not be told this going in. Take time to date, meet new people, join clubs, try new things. You will likely not have many of the same opportunities again\n\nDon't hang out with people who are going to get you to do stupid things, and who don't have any ambitions, they _will_ drag you down with them. It doesn't matter if they are good people at heart.\n\nOn the flip side, if you hang out with hardworking and successful people, they will encourage you to work harder, and you'll see what helps them succeed. After college they'll be helpful to help you network.\n\nI seriously regret not spending more time with people in college, my mental health would've been better, and I would have likely had better grades as a result, hell maybe even a girlfriend, or some fun stories to tell.\n\n### Dating\n\n**_Never again in life will you be surrounded by so many attractive peers, who are generally open to  many with high ambition. Make use of this opportunity._**\n\nHowever, keep in a mind, a good relationship may improve your life a little bit, but a bad one will make it much worse, in other words, get out of bad relationships as fast as you can, and preferably stay away from toxic individuals.\n\n## Grades\n\nMy original response was to someone who asked about getting a 4.0 in college. My response was, don't focus on an arbitrary target, so much as making sure you use your time wisely. If you are trying to get into medical/law/dental or other professional schools, or into graduate school, having a good GPA is important. However, there are things to consider about GPA.\n\nSay getting a 2.5 GPA takes 10 hours a week of studying, 3.0 takes 15 hours a week, 3.5 takes 25 hours a week, and a 3.75 takes 40 a week, and maybe a 4.0 takes 50 hours a week. Diminishing returns start to kick in heavily. What if you spent that time doing research, or interning, or in clubs and activities that help you build your network. Hell, maybe you could start your own company. Outside of getting into graduate school or a professional program, your GPA won't really matter past your first job. That being said, I'd shoot for at least a 3.0-3.5. (these numbers are 100% made up, find the balance that works for you and your goals)\n\nFind the balance between schoolwork and research, internships, and clubs or other activities. The balance point will be different for everyone.\n\nYour connections, will matter for the rest of your life, as your friends start to move from company to company, and as some of them climb corporate ladders and start their own companies. These connections will get you farther than an extra .25 on your GPA ever would.\n\n**Do not beat yourself up over bad grades**, if you do this you will increase your chances of developing depression. Focus on managing your time effectively. If you manage your time effectively and do not receive the grades you want, it sucks, but it's okay. You can only do so much, and if you are making the most of your time you should be proud of yourself. Continual improvement is more important than perfection. Consistency is also very good.\n\nConsider trying to develop good relationships with a handful of professors who you will use as references for jobs, recommendation letters, etc. It is especially useful if you do research or other non-coursework related activities with them, as they will get to see more of who you really are, and your work ethics.\n\n### Studying\n\nThere are effective, and ineffective ways to study and complete coursework. Start off by _going to class_, it'll really make a difference even if you don't think you're learning much. Go and take notes by hand. Taking notes by hand is the most effective way to make sure you're internalizing the information from the lectures.Additionally, ask questions in class, and go to office hours, it doesn't matter if you feel like an idiot, your understanding of the course material is more important than what your classmates think. Most of the time other people in the class have the same question. If you're too afraid to ask during class, go to office hours (this is also a good chance to develop a relationship with professors).\n\nReading the textbook can be useful for some classes, but not so much for others.\n\nDo homework. Homework gives you practice, and practice makes you better at remembering material, and using complex problem solving abilities. The more you develop problem solving abilities, the easier any question will become.\n\n[This video] is a good source for evidence based studying techniques.\n\nMy advice is to trying and make connections between all the concepts in your mind, and how they relate, this will enable you to remember things you forget through related information, or may make you able to reconstruct a piece of information from other pieces of information. This technique has been useful to me many times. People often waste lots of time using rote memorization, but if a question on an exam is slightly different than something they expect, they'll be totally lost, whereas someone who understands the concepts well can adjust quickly, and digest the information.\n\nI did disproportionately well on many exams despite my sometimes lackluster performance on homework. I believe it was due to my focusing on understanding of concepts, and not memorizing problem solutions.**Dumb songs, acronyms and other mnemonic techniques will make things easier to remember, even if they sound stupid.**\n\nOn exams I start at the beginning, and when I get stuck on a question, I stop and move on to the next one, often times a solution to something I was previously stuck on will come to me eventually. It is also good to look at all the questions on an exam before starting so you think about them in the back of your head. I don't know if this is pseudoscience, but it works well for me.\n\nStudy over weeks, don't cram the night before an exam. Also, make sure you get plenty of sleep the night before an exam, it doesn't matter how much you studied if your brain is functioning at 25% capacity because you didn't sleep before the exam. Get 8 hours.If you're interested in learning to master your memory, check out \"Moonwalking with Einstein\". Anyone can train their memory to memorize lots of things quickly, which can be useful for some classes (and less useful for concept based classes). However, this will take time. I have not tried practicing the techniques, but it is an interesting and worthwhile read.\n\nI suggest figuring out every class you want and are required to take, and make a timeline of when you'll be taking them. Maybe you'll see if you can dual degree or double major, it's much easier to do now than in a few years. Classes will get harder (probably).\n\nYou might consider taking a few classes in different disciplines in order to make sure you want to stay in your major, it'll make switching easier if you have a few classes done.\n\nOr, consider doubling down and finishing your classes a year early so you can graduate, or maybe start taking graduate classes and do lots of research.\n\nTake breaks from homework and spread out assignments, sometimes going to bed and then looking at the assignment in the morning will make a difference. Try to do them as soon as they are assigned (assuming you have been taught all you need to do them). This gives you more time to reach out to professors and TA's, and time to put them away when you get stuck.\n\n", "author": "MusicPi", "created": 1548095392, "retrieved": 1632802711, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 664, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"eomh3oy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/aid1k6/a_guide_to_life_in_college_long_post/eomh3oy/", "text": " \n\nI\u2019d like to share **5 tips that have helped me survive my college years**.\n\nHere are five tips that helped me survive my college years.\n\n*1.* ***Do not be afraid to ask for help***\n\nAsk professors and undergraduates about academic affairs or organizational issues. If you are interested in scientific and social life or want to learn more about college events and extracurricular activities, just ask about it. Same goes for school projects; if you have troubles with assignments, it\u2019s better to ask your professor for guidelines. You\u2019re not a robot \u2014 don\u2019t expect to be able to learn everything at once.\n\n*2.* ***Be open to new skills and knowledge*** \n\nDancing, movie, reading, or a drama club? No one knows where you will find yourself. Your college provides you with various opportunities to express yourself. Also, don\u2019t forget about self-developing. For example, you can apply for the Coursera Courses scholarship and get some funds to gain new skills or improve the ones you have already (see [https://www.apacitationgenerator.com/scholarship](https://www.apacitationgenerator.com/scholarship)).\n\n*3.* ***Be proactive*** \n\nTake notes during lectures, participate in various college events, and study interesting subjects in depth. In college and university, you should be prepared to work hard \u2014 your academic success depends on your diligence and attention. Try not to skip classes and submit papers on time.\n\n*4.* ***Make new friends***\n\nEspecially with students who you have the same classes with and sophomores. You will have to communicate with many of them during the next several years, prepare for exams together, work in groups, etc. College is where you can find a friend for life! Also, make sure you know the full names of all your professors and other college staff.\n\n*5.* ***Take college life easy***\n\nYou are a human being, not a machine, so don\u2019t forget to give yourself some time to relax and don\u2019t stress out about every little thing. Remember that no one will expel you if you forget that book at home. Stop worrying over everything, and even if there are difficulties, deal with them step by step.

If they go well, you may have a guaranteed job after graduating, and having them makes it much easier to find jobs in general, regardless of your GPA. Being able to perform on a job means more to employers than grades.\n\n### Clubs\n\nThere are tons and tons of clubs on college campus (depending on your school), join some. Try something new that makes you uncomfortable, it could end up changing your life. Lots of people make lots of friends through clubs, and many find SO's. If you want to start your own club, it's probably not hard.\n\nJust because you join a club doesn't mean you have to go to it forever. Try some things out, see what you like, and what sticks.\n\n### Research\n\nThe earlier you get involved with research the better time you will have applying to graduate schools. Get involved freshman year if possible. It doesn't matter if you don't know anything, the whole point of research is learning. Most of the knowledge you need for a particular lab will not be taught in class anyways.\n\n## Student Debt\n\nSomething that is often overlooked by individuals until it is too late and will effect your for often times a decade or more, is student debt. People think that they shouldn't worry, because of how important college is, and how it's supposed to be some of the best years of your life, but do you want to be paying for that for the next 10 years, for four years of fun? Some debt is essentially unavoidable going into college, but make sure that you will have the means to pay it when you graduate.\n\nA good rule of thumb is don't take out more in loans than you plan to make in your first year post graduation.\n\n## Psychiatric health\n\nMany people find themselves depressed, or anxious during college. Many bright individuals who never struggled in school before have undiagnosed mental conditions that slipped under the radar (e.g. ADHD, depression, anxiety), because they were able to make up for it with intelligence.  If you find yourself struggling during college, reach out and get an evaluation, or therapy. You don't have to go forever, just try to meet with someone who can potentially help you greatly. Don't be ashamed, no one is ashamed when they go to the doctor with a broken leg.\n\nSome mental conditions only tend to reveal themselves in your early 20's, or under stress.\n\n## Suffering and Sacrifices\n\nMany people will brag about the sacrifices they have made to find success. Ignore that, and focus on building a healthy balanced lifestyle. Everyone ends up dead, life is about the journey, not the destination. Make sure you have enough resources to fulfill your needs, but making sure you have a balanced life will enable you to have plenty of resources, while having a fulfilling life.\n\n**Don't spend too much time comparing yourself to others, everyone has their limits, their priorities etc, focus on completing goals so you'll leave college happy with how you did, and _what_ you did.**\n\nBy now, through reading this post, you should realize all the things mentioned above should enable you to maximize your outcomes in college, with many points covered applying to life in general.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nFigure out the possibilities for what you want to do, and try to design life around them. If you want to go to medical school, have a backup plan. Just studying biology may leave you with a degree that is hard to find a job for. A better option may be to study engineering, physics, or chemistry. Try to differentiate yourself from the normal applicant.\n\n\n\n  ", "author": "MusicPi", "created": 1548095433, "upvotes": 102}}}
