  "text": "I\u2019ve been home an entire week for the Thanksgiving break and I\u2019m very much looking forward to being back on campus tomorrow. I feel bad saying so because I get along well with my mom, but it\u2019s my dad who\u2019s the problem and completely spoils things. Case in point: in my seven days here he\u2019s had 3 different outbursts. I won\u2019t get into the details of each, but I will discuss the most recent one so you have an understanding of what I\u2019m going through. We were joking around making this silly gesture originally used in a movie. We\u2019ve done this a few times before, so I thought nothing of it. All of a sudden, he said I wasn\u2019t doing this gesture correctly and tried to correct me, which didn\u2019t go well because I genuinely didn\u2019t get how my version of the gesture differed from his. This went on for a while - me frustrated and him silently judging me for how pathetic I am. Finally, he had enough and yelled that I\u2019m just like my autistic brother (which is true, my brother does have autism) in that I can\u2019t do a simple hand-eye coordination task. He also insulted my mom and said the three of us are all autistic and are the reason why he\u2019s always been unhappy, among a variety of other insults.\n\nWhen I\u2019m with him, I never know what could provoke his outbursts since they come out of the blue. One moment we can be having a great conversation, and the next my self-esteem is shattered from his remarks. Even if he\u2019s not having an outburst, he\u2019s annoyed that I don\u2019t talk to him enough or share everything I\u2019m up to on a given day. I therefore feel like I can never truly please him. \n\nWhen I\u2019m in college, on the other hand, I feel much better about myself and can go the day without worrying about getting him mad. I also think I am a better version of myself there, while being at home makes me revert to my immature childhood self. Not everyone likes me in college, but it\u2019s fine because they\u2019re just strangers. It hurts much more when someone in your immediate family acts so hurtful. It\u2019s also hard because my roommate loves her family and expects me to feel the same. She was saying before we left for break how she loves going home for the holidays to see her family, and I just had to smile and nod because she\u2019d never understand what it\u2019s like to have a parent like my dad. And although my house is objectively better than my dorm in that I have my own room & bathroom, more space, the ability to go downstairs whenever I want to get food instead of going to the dining hall outside, and so on, I guess those perks don\u2019t really matter at the end of the day if you feel don\u2019t good on the inside. I\u2019d rather be happy in less-than-ideal living conditions than be sad in good living conditions.\n\nTLDR: I am looking forward to going back to college after being home a week for thanksgiving because my dad is an abusive asshole. My house is technically nicer than the dorm, but I still prefer dorm life because it makes me not feel like a piece of shit.",

      "text": "In some ways I can relate. In college you have more control over who you interact with and how you spend your time. If someone\u2019s being a jerk you have no obligation to stick around. At home you can feel stuck. I think that focusing on what you have to look forward to at school is a good thing to do. When I\u2019m at home I spend time with friends and find reasons to leave the house and that makes it better. One day you won\u2019t have to go back for holidays if you don\u2019t want to and you\u2019ll have more control over your life. Right now is a tough time but fortunately you\u2019re on your path toward more independence. \nIt is good that you can recognize the qualities in your family members that you respect and ones you really don\u2019t. It will help you choose wisely one day if you decide to have your own family and you won\u2019t repeat the cycle. I can tell that you are a thoughtful and kind person who has a good amount of self-awareness. Those a qualities that anyone would want to have in a friend or SO.\nIt is funny because I read your post and I could have written the same thing, truly. The content isn\u2019t exactly the same but the format and detail you added are things I\u2019ve thought and considered too. I don\u2019t really relate to people who are super close to their families either and in some ways it feels bad that I can\u2019t have that too. \nI\u2019ve started writing in a journal and that has helped me a lot.",

I still have problems going on with being accused of cheating and some late work that make school not very fun, but my second phone that I am able to use to talk to my grandparents and uncle can't come home with me so I'm excited to have that again.",
