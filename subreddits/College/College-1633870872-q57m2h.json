  "title:": "What are the cons of dropping this class right around midterms?",
  "text": "I have a bachelors in IT. Been considering doing data analytics or web dev for a bit and decided to take a course at at Community College. Its over SAS. Not very relevant and I'm missing being able to focus on learning using online resources. This class is taking up all my time I'd otherwise be using The Odin Project or learning SQL on my own. I kind of want to drop it. But ofcourse no refund at this point. It just feels like its putting my life on hold.   \n\n\nBut at the same time Im worried about this would look like on my records if I went back again and if I should finish what I started. I just dont see this class being helpful to me. Its not towards any degree Im needing or wanting.   \n\n\nI have a BS degree and this class was just a \"test\" to see if maybe community college classes would be helpful. And honestly I think online self-learning material fits my lifestyle better  \n\n\nThoughts? bad Idea to drop this??",
