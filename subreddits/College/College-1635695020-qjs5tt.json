  "text": "So for my media class I have to film a music video. Said video HAS to include and only include footage of a person lip syncing and with some form of narrative (which still involves a person). This requires having atleast one friend or family member to star in it whilst you film, you can have as many people to help out with it as you like. \n\nPeople with big friendship groups can have 5 actors or 5 people filming, I however have one problem. I have no friends or family to help me. So somehow I have to star and in and film this video all by myself. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to do it with a tripod multiple times but something always goes wrong such as it starts raining or my camera dies or it was out of focus the entire time. I\u2019m so upset that I don\u2019t have anyone to help and I\u2019m really stressed about my grade, as everyone else has finished theirs and I have nothing. \n\nAny advice on what I can do here ?",

If you film in increments instead of doing one take hopefully you\u2019ll be able to view the footage and see if you need to re-film that section. Maybe when you i submit the video you can write a note to your professor explaining your situation and say you tried your best with the resources you had. Good luck !",

This could be humorous, or you could make it into a meta narrative about how you're your own worst enemy but ultimately you have to learn to work with yourself, kind of energy. If you just need someone to help you film, idk, a tripod? Maybe you film this entire video in front of a mirror and the background progressively deteriorates but you don't notice because you're too focused on your reflection or something.\n\nIf you haven't seen this YouTuber, Brian David Gilbert often edits himself multiple times in one scene or implies that he's in multiple places at once, which grows more unsettling throughout the video. (MacDoesIt is another YouTuber that does this style frequently but it's pure comedy) It's definitely some higher level editing, but possible.\n\n[BDG- Earn 20k a month by being your own boss!](https://youtu.be/wbfu39l0kxg)",

Don't be afraid to talk to People if you need to get a project done you gotta figure out a way to do it and that usually involves getting other people from campus who yes you may not know to help you Out so send an email 2 classes old To your class as a whole maybe email the professor asking",

If your school or town has a subreddit, that\u2019s a good starting point. Post there that you\u2019re looking for someone for your project and you\u2019ll likely find some generous volunteers. \n\nIf that\u2019s not an option, can you message or email your classmates to ask for a volunteer? Many course sites have an option to message your classmates taking the same course. \n\nIf the due date is within the next couple days, then other comments have given great tips on filming yourself. In filmmaking, it often requires many takes to get the result you want. Even very polished videos have tons of poor footage that you never see. Be patient with yourself. You\u2019re still learning. \n\nThe last thing I\u2019d add is that if you have aspirations to work in media, you\u2019ll want to work on your skill of being more forward and adventurous to find performers. On future projects, try to give yourself enough time for casting and ask your professors and classmates for tips.  It takes practice!",

I didn\u2019t want to ask my friends to lipsync to a song they probably didn\u2019t know so I decided to do it myself. I made sure the camera screen was facing me so I could see whether or not it was in focus, and filmed in parts. My final was essentially cutting the video together and editing it. Actually, I did basically every video in that class on my own. Yes, it\u2019s harder but it\u2019s not impossible.",
