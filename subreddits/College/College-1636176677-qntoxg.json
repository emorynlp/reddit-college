      "text": "Depends. I knew some people who partied basically every night, went out with people regularly, and rarely attended classes. At the other extreme, I saw hermits who didn't even come out of their dorms unless absolutely necessary (this was during lockdown; most classes were virtual). But then again, there were plenty of people somewhere in between these two. Everyone seemed to be happy doing their own thing. \n\nPersonally, I found having a few close friends really helped, so my suggestion would be to socialize enough to have at least two or three people you can really count on, and vice versa. If you have a hobby or an activity you are passionate about, find a club related to it in your college and join it. You'll find a lot of like-minded people there to hang out with, without the pressure and psychological demand of having to pretend to belong. \n\nBeyond that, how much you socialize is really your preference; nobody will judge you for it.",

He helped with a ton of stuff and name dropping him by the recruiters helped too. Even far off friends you dont talk to regularly but are on good terms with will help you in the future for job stuff.",

However, since I'm a Junior, I'm taking mostly my major classes, so a lot of my classmates are the same each class. I have made \"friendships\" with them, but really only talk to them before, during, and after class. It's more like an acquaintance, but definitely fills my social meter enough. Also, I've connected with most of them on LinkedIn, so the networking aspect is definitely there.",

No one can answer this question for you.\n\nSome people have incredible social experiences in college that are really not possible at any other time in life, and are a big part of why they went to college.\n\nSome people don't care at all and just buckle down for four years, or only see old friends from before college.\n\nMost people are somewhere in the middle.\n\nDon't be one of those phony assholes who only makes friends for networking purposes.",

Feeling extremely low, I started ghosting all the mutual friends we had. Eventually, I lost everyone. I became so mentally scarred that I wanted to drop out or change my college or at least change the department. My parents being super strict weren't ready to listen. So I pretty much got stuck in here. In conclusion, the first year was pretty much traumatic, when I look back at it now.",
