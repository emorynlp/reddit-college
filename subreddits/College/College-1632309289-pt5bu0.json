Esp because you don't want to get to your last semester and realize a course you need to graduate isn't running that semester. Senior year you'll be busy with job hunting and probably a capstone and other stuff. Highly recommend using your winters or summers to take a class or two, better than sticking too many in a fall or spring semester. Most importantly make a plan for every year and talk to your advisor asap. They'll have a lot of valuable info that we can't help with bc it's specific to your school", "author": "Maleficent_Unit_7928", "created": 1632749391, "upvotes": 1}, "hdu1c1e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt5bu0/how_to_distribute_courseload/hdu1c1e/", "text": "Take some classes over the summer/winter if you can.
