  "text": "I have several friends in college, but none of them texted me or I did not text them during lockdown. I still talk to my middle school and high school friends, but when it comes to college, it sucks. The college started a week ago after lockdown. It's been 2 years in college and this time I also wanted to communicate with them on social media but heck no, they couldn't care less. It feels like at college we HAVE to be together because we don't want to be lonely and that's it. I think we won't ever talk once after we graduate. I wonder if I am the only one. Or, maybe I care too much and value people who are not worth it. What do you think?",

I'm almost 31 and I know it sounds cliche, but some friendships don't last, but that's OKAY.\n\nI've cycled through about 5 or 6 different groups of friends in the last 5 years. Some for stupid reasons. Some for reasons beyond my control. People change their minds about life, get married, get divorced, move away, grow apart.\n\nIt's really just part of life. I always tell myself \"Even if we drift apart, I want them to look back on me fondly\" \n\nSomething like \"this one girl I went to school with blah blah blah\"\n\nJust inflict positivity, and let life take it from there\n\nEdit: I'm fortunate to have 2 people still in my life who have been there for everything. But if someone isn't there for you, don't take it personally. You won't have the same friend group in 5 years or 10 years.",
