The only thing I enjoy is my minor but at this point I can\u2019t change majors. College is hard and especially for us with learning disabilities going from Covid Online School and losing every studying habit I have and cheating on everything because no one cared to back in person and I don\u2019t know a single thing from my prerequisites. All I can say is you got this, use your resources and find help before you did a deeper hole. People want to help you just have to ask.\n\n\nI BELIEVE IN YOU!!",

      "text": "Well, from experience, I can tell you that college without ADHD literally feels the exact same. ADHD isn't the problem here, college is. I'm sure ADHD doesn't help but what you've said is the 100% normal college experience.\n\nCollege is new to you. It's not going to make sense yet. You're adjusting from High School and now you're in something completely new. It'll take time to get used to it. \n\nYour study habits probably need to change. Not getting things done on time is a surefire way to kill your GPA. Start making a calendar or something and move up all your due dates a few days so you can actually stay ahead.  Staying ahead will reduce overall stress too. It's crazy how much stress comes from those assignments nagging at you to get finished. \n\nTrust me, because I'm an internet stranger with unknown intent, that getting ahead and staying diligent improves the experience ten-fold. Mental health issues subside and academic drive becomes a little clearer.",
