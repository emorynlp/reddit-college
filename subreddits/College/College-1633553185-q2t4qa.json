  "text": "I feel like I go to my lecture classes just for the sake of going to them. So it doesn't seem like I \"wasted my money\". But I can't actually learn in lecture. I do 90% of the work myself for lecture classes. So should I just study instead of going to class?",

      "text": "I definitely understand what that feels like.\n\nI would try to meet with your lecture professor first and discuss with them how you are feeling and see if there\u2019s something they can do to help you learn better while in class. If it turns out that you think that studying on your own is the better choice then go for it. \n\nI was in a similar situation a few semesters ago because I just wasn\u2019t understanding what was going on in lecture and I wasn\u2019t connecting with the professor in class because of the large number of students. After meeting with him during office hours we started looking into how I learn best and he was able to help me out.",
