  "text": "Alright so I have an exam for a business class this week and I'm kind of nervous about it. My professor tells us that anything from the lectures & book can be on it. For the last exam I would skim over the book chapters, lectures and my notes then go back and read through all of it after a break, alternate between those 2 methods and i ended up with a 66 \ud83d\udc80 I feel like whenever I have a class w/ no study guide where they just say anything from anywhere can end up on the test my brain ends up absorbing info that never ends up on the test and I don't remember stuff that actually appears.  If anyone has any tips to manage this it would be greatly appreciated",

      "text": "I actually just had an exam that was like that. Pretty much anything from the book or lectures could have been on the exam. What I noticed with my exam, is that if you had a good understanding of the main concepts, you could make educated guesses on things you didn\u2019t quite know what the answer was. I managed to get an A when I thought I was going to be lucky if I even got a C because I didn\u2019t know half of the answers.",

      "text": "It\u2019s great that you are putting in the effort to do your readings and take notes. However, you want to combine your notes with active recall. You will not be able to perform well on exams if you only review or re-read your notes. You need to learn from your notes and readings and create questions for yourself and answer them without your resources. This way you are applying your knowledge. \n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)",
