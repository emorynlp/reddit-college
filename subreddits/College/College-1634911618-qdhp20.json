  "text": "I\u2019m 25 and I live in the dorms on my college campus. This is something that I knew would be challenging but because I have some severe anxiety and 2 invisible chronic illnesses, living in dorms was the best option for me to transition from living at home.\n\nAfter 8 weeks of being here I am feeling extremely lonely and isolated. Being 6-7 years older than the youngest students is hard. My floor is mostly freshman and sophomores. I am a junior. \n\nI\u2019m the age of a graduate student but don\u2019t really relate to them because I\u2019m in undergrad. And I\u2019m too old to relate to the undergrad students because I graduated high school almost a decade ago. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to find things in common with them, it\u2019s just that the opportunities have not yet presented themselves. I\u2019m not opposed to having a younger friend - my best friend for years was 6 years younger than me. \n\nI am really struggling and would appreciate any advice on how to make some friends here. I live in a residential college program but that hasn\u2019t been going very well. There are some drama things that are just too stressful for me to handle so I\u2019ve not been involving myself in that end of things.",
