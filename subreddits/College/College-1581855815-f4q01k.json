We hit it off really well and were good friends. Both of our sleep schedules lined up and it was really easy to talk to her. A few weeks in, though, she deferred for the semester. \n\nI was assigned a new roommate (RM) a few weeks later, but we have nothing in common. She likes to go to bed before 10 PM and wake up at 7 AM to exercise, and I go to bed at 2 AM and wake up at 10 AM for my classes. She's also a really light sleeper, so even when I enter and get ready for bed as quietly as possible, she still wakes up a little bit. RM already wears ear plugs and an eye mask to bed. Sometimes I ask her if I'm being too noisy, and she says that I'm fine, but she'll also shade me and can get passive aggressive. \n\nA few days ago, I set an alarm for 7 AM since I had to go to an event for a program I was in, and RM yelled at me. She was like, \"OP just get up because its not fair that I have to wake up to YOUR alarm.\" I was really surprised because she yelled at me the minute I opened my eyes, and it wasn't what I was expecting as soon as I woke up. I was also a little confused because I know RM usually wakes up at that time so I didn't think it was a problem because it'd be like we were waking up at the same time. RM also never let on or mentioned that this was a problem before so it kind of came out of nowhere. She was very harsh, so I avoided being in the room for the rest of the week. I did set my alarms later and more quieter though, and RM seemed to be fine. \n\nHowever, I'm in the process of pledging, and I had to wake up at 3 AM for a pledge activity. I connected my phone to earbuds so that I would be the only one hearing it, and I turned down the volume and put my phone right next to my head so that it wouldn't wake her up. It still woke RM up though, and she yelled at me again. Once again, she was really harsh, and I feel really bad, but I don't know what to do. I'm a deep sleeper so it takes a few alarms to wake me up. I usually don't wake up to her alarms, and if I do, then I fall back asleep right away.\n\nI'm not really sure how to handle the situation. I looked it up, and if I put my phone under my pillow, it increases my chances of getting brain cancer. Plugging in earbuds/Airpods didn't seem to work either. I also don't really feel comfortable talking to or being around my roommate right now. I don't think I would feel as uncomfortable if she just talked to me in a civil way, but her screaming at me is off-putting to say the least.

For real. I had to share a room for the first time this past fall with someone who had different sleep schedule; actually, it was a quad, so three people. \n\nFirst of all, get a silent alarm. I use an Apple Watch, but you can use a Fitbit or a dedicated silent alarm. It will violently vibrate you awake. Since it\u2019s on your arm and not a hard surface, though, she shouldn\u2019t be able to hear it. You can also try setting a series of silent alarms and ONE out-loud alarm that would wake you up out of a lighter sleep. \n\nSecond, talk to her about a white noise machine for while she\u2019s sleeping. I now live at home in a house with thin walls and two brothers who have to be awake at 5 AM. The only thing that keeps me from wanting to scream when they slam around at 5 AM is white noise covering most of it up. The thing about it is I KNOW they have to be awake; I\u2019m not mad that they\u2019re awake, I\u2019m mad that they\u2019re waking me up. It\u2019s not my fault or theirs that I\u2019m a light sleeper, but they do need to be reasonably quiet and I got a white noise machine to make it more effective. That being said, she has a really consistent, healthy sleep schedule that she\u2019s informed you about. It\u2019s very possible that YOU aren\u2019t being as quiet as you think; even if she has earplugs and a sleep mask, have you thought about actually getting READY for bed in the bathroom? About maybe keeping your night routine stuff together so you can quietly grab it and head to another room?\n\nI get why she\u2019s mad, honestly. You guys should try to talk about it, though I can imagine she won\u2019t be very responsive. She probably hasn\u2019t slept right since living with you and you don\u2019t seem to care. To be frank, you aren\u2019t compromising right now, which is a big part of sharing a room; you\u2019re ignoring her needs and going about your day. You\u2019re a deep sleeper. I assume that means her alarms don\u2019t bother you. If I were her, every time someone woke me up I\u2019d need probably 30 minutes to get back to sleep, if not more. She\u2019s probably frustrated because she didn\u2019t want to inconvenience you by saying that you\u2019re incredibly loud, especially because she moved in to your room; it\u2019s both of your rooms now, but she\u2019s the new one, and that probably came with some weird feelings. Add on to that a break where she COULD sleep, she probably feels awful again from a lack of sleep. \n\nRooming together requires compromise but, as someone who needs a certain amount of sleep on a consistent schedule to combat medical issues, you can\u2019t compromise on sleep; you compromise by working around it. She got a sleep mask and earplugs. You get a silent alarm and try a white noise machine. \n\nI\u2019d say don\u2019t come at it on a defensive way. I\u2019d recommend saying, \u201cHey, this is both of our room, and I think we need to talk about the sleep stuff.\u201d Explain that you\u2019re trying to be quiet but feel like you\u2019re not doing well enough and waking her up, say you\u2019re going to try a silent alarm, say you thought maybe a white noise machine could help drown out some small noises.\u201d Ask if there\u2019s anything else you can do. Keep in mind that, right or wrong, she\u2019s been sacrificing being able to sleep to try to avoid arguing with you about it and to let you live your life. Also keep in mind that most people with rigid sleep schedules have them for a reason- and they need probably them, either because of their intensive workout schedule or because some do genuinely need more sleep than others. \n\nThe other layer to this is you might just not be compatible as roommates. I\u2019d look into switching now, other solutions if you can\u2019t do that. I actually highly recommend a silent alarm no matter what- I find it easier to wake up too than a loud one. \n\nTLDR: She shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you but you\u2019re not compromising. Either compromise or leave, stop long-term torturing her by keeping her from getting enough sleep.", "author": "emf729", "created": 1581873483, "upvotes": 2}, "fhtd80h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/f4q01k/how_to_deal_with_roommate_with_opposite_sleep/fhtd80h/", "text": "In terms of being uncomfortable around the roommate, I would have this conversation with the RA as a mediator. \n\nIn terms of what she can do: wear earplugs AND consider investing in something like this: [https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Eye-Headphones-Joseche-Microphone/dp/B07F59HQRC?ref\\_=fsclp\\_pl\\_dp\\_1](https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Eye-Headphones-Joseche-Microphone/dp/B07F59HQRC?ref_=fsclp_pl_dp_1) They are easy to sleep in and your roommate can use a free white noise app on her phone. This will block out a lot of noise and light and make it easier for her to sleep. \n\nYou should also be aware that getting up at 3am is not at all a normal sleep schedule. Yes, you are pledging, and yes, Frats/Sororities do stupid crap that like all the time, but, still. Multiple alarms going off at 3am is really not OK if the roommate is not OK with it. It seems like she's a really light sleeper, so even if you've got an alarm going through your headphones it's waking her up. And, I mean, 3am is NOT a normal hour to be waking up, and it's not like you're doing it for work or something. \n\nIt also sounds like your alarm was going off a lot of times before you woke up to it in the instance when you were getting up at 7am, which is also super-annoying. \n\nI would consider investing in a Fitbit or something with a vibrating band alarm and see if that's enough to get you awake. \n\nIn terms of her, she needs to chill out a bit (and I think adding white noise will help her not hear you), but it also sounds like you need to find a way to wake up without a ton of loud alarms/wake up without making use of snooze. If this is not possible, then it's time to think about switching roommates. \n\nBut, I mean, yeah, you seems to be a deep sleeper with a non-diurnal schedule while she's a light sleeper with a diurnal schedule. It is likely that the RA is going to be more on your roommate's side where quiet hours are concerned. Are there other places you can go in the building after 10pm when she's asleep? Like, say, a lounge? If you took your pajamas with you and your computer and set up in the lounge for those hours, she could sleep and you could just go change in the bathroom and go back in when you were ready to go to sleep. \n\nIs there anybody else in your building who is pledging? Can you do a brief roommate swap where the pledgers share a room so the non-pledgers don't have to deal with 3am alarms? \n\nI would definitely not room with this person next year, though.

I am a teacher and have to get up before 7am everyday. He however can choose when he starts his workday and can even work from home if he wants. So he is at an advantage here, but it's always me who ends up feeling guilty when he is cranky in the evening and says he couldn't get work done because he wouldn't fall back asleep after my alarm went off (he typically needs at least 9 hours of sleep to be rested while I can work with 7). He never yells at me, but I can just sense that he's tense when he wakes up because of my alarms - sometimes he sighs deeply and rolls over to the other side and puts the blanket over his head. I try to be accomodating, so I put all my clothes and items I need for the next day in the living room before going to bed. I never let my alarm ring more than once and sometimes if I happen to accidentally wake before if goes off, I turn it off and silently climb out of bed when it's time.\n\nI realize I am maybe doing too much and he could be more understanding - same goes about you and your roommate. However, if you don't have an option to rent a room by yourself or to tell her to move elsewhere, I'd sit down with her for an honest discussion of what could be a good solution. (I used to live in a dorm for 5 years and had all sorts of roommates so I guess I have very thick skin about all this lol)\n\nOne of the best arrangements we had for a while was my electronic watch. I got it on AliExpress for 5 euros, just hooked it up with an app on my phone and put my alarms in there. Then a gentle, but for me noticeable enough vibration on my wrist woke me up and he didn't even flutter an eyelash because he didn't hear anything. The vibration on my wrist was also a lot less annoying than music blasting in my ear. Unfortunately the electronic watch/ wristband broke some time ago, but I'm looking into getting a new one. If this is something that could suit you, I recommend trying it out.

I sleep with a sound machine, earplugs, blankets over my head, and sleep meds, and I still can and will get woken up by an inconsiderate/unknowing roommate. See if you can do a roommate change, or at least be a bit more considerate/acknowledge the importance of her sleep. Like, get ready for bed at 10pm or something, or take your stuff out of the room. Tell your roommate that you have to get up at a certain time so that she isn't startled awake by your alarms. (Because being startled awake by someone else's alarm is an absolutely shitty way to wake up.)

She needs to discuss this with you in a mature way, but since you *know* she's going to wake up to your alarm, it's also your responsibility to warn her that you're going to set multiple alarms for 3am.\n\nSetting multiple alarms that you don't plan to get up to is a dick move when you share a room with someone else regardless, *especially* if they're noise alarms. We're primed to wake up to noise, hence why smoke alarms emit a very loud noise. I really recommend you look into other kinds of alarms, e.g. vibrating alarms in watches and wristbands. \n\nWhen it comes to sleep, she kinda wins on this one because she has a \"normal\" sleep schedule *and* she wakes up more easily so an RA is unlikely to take your side. Look at it this way: you always interrupt her sleep and she practically never interrupts yours.
