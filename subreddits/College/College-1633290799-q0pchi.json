  "text": "This will be a long one, folks, hold tight, or just don't read.\n\nIn my class, we have these discussion posts every week through Blackboard because of online school. The first week we had to watch a 9/11 documentary (it had no dialogue it was just a compilation of videos of the towers throughout the day) and I got a point taken off for not citing timestamps in the video. The second week there were multiple questions, one stating \u201cChapter 1 discusses a few theorists on crime victims, which one do you subscribe to the most and why?\u201d I then looked at the textbook, chose a THEORIST (which is presumed to be a person), and then explained why I was most compelled by the theory they were associated with, along with adding components of the theory that brought me to my decision. I got a point taken off because he was \u201clooking for me to define a theory you chose\u201d (his exact words from his comment) and I got another point taken off for my responses not being 5 sentences \u201cas stated in the syllabus\u201d (also quoting his exact words in the comment to me). I emailed him about the first point he took off because he never asked to define the theory, just to pick a theorist we chose and why. I told him essentially what I just typed above and added that he was not very clear in what he expected of us from that question and I know other students wrote it the way I did as well. His response to me was,\n\n\u201cIn your reply to the question you need to argue in detail. Your argument would include components of the theory you chose as to why it is superior - in detail. Your reply needed more.\u201d\n\nOK. Whatever. I dropped it and moved on. Have it your way then. However, I was looking at the syllabus this past week to see when our first exam was and I figured I would look at where he wrote in the syllabus that he wanted our responses to be a specific length and there was nothing. I\u2019ve read it over multiple times now and had my boyfriend read it over as well and there is nothing stated in there saying that he wants our responses to be a certain length, the only thing that would indicate a certain \u201clength\u201d is that he stated that the discussion posts are essay questions, and nothing else.\n\nSo now I am pretty frustrated and I want to email him again about it because I could have an A in his class right now but he has been taking points off that I think are unnecessary and unfair at this point. This was 3 weeks ago now, though, so I do not know if it is worth bringing up because I have made the corrections he wanted and have been getting full credit, but I know there are still students who are getting points taken off for this when they shouldn\u2019t be. I think it is extremely unprofessional to just be making up rules as you go along grading. In my email, I would say:\n\n\u201cHi Professor,\n\nI was looking at the syllabus to see the date of our first exam and was looking over other sections of the syllabus as well, and noticed that there is no part of the syllabus that states that you want our discussion posts to be five sentences in length, just that they are essay questions. I know the points that were deducted off of my score were a few weeks ago now and I have since then adjusted my discussion posts, but there is no part of the syllabus that would have indicated to me that I was doing anything wrong regarding the length of my responses.\"\n\nI really do not know how to continue this email because I would like to bring up that it is concerning to me that these deductions are now coming without a source backing it up to justify it and that I am not as concerned about my grade anymore (because I have the time and points to bring it back up to an A) as I am for other students and future assignments regarding deductions that are seemingly unfair. Any help would be appreciated.",

If you named a theorist but didn't elaborate what they claimed, you have not completed the assignment to his satisfaction.  Likewise, I'm not sure four or fewer sentences constitutes an \"essay,\" as it is very difficult to say anything of substance in a response of that length.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to want to have a conversation about expectations, but this is an office hours conversation, not an email one.\n\nFinally, you don't start with an \"A\" and have points \"taken away.\"  Your professor's feedback seems consistent in that your work doesn't reach the standard of an \"A\" in his class, so I would encourage you to approach this conversation as advice for ways to bring your work to an \"A,\" not to contest the \"points he took from you.\"\n\nAlso, ignore all of the inevitable student responses telling you email the Dean about this violation of your human rights, because they are wrong and dumb.",

As in, if he reconsidered the deduction for making a mistake in his critique, it would be the difference between an \u201cA\u201d and a \u201cB\u201d for me. \nSecondly, the \u201csubstance of his critique\u201d was not given until after I emailed him for not clarifying\u2014 I did elaborate on what the question asked me which is why I emailed him. The question asked about \u201ctheorists,\u201d a person, not to \u201cdefine a theory,\u201d which is what he apparently wanted after the fact. \nI get having another professors back, but if all you are on here to do is shit on students who have actual issues (like your comments seem to show), maybe this isn\u2019t the career for you. Not every student is grasping at loose ends or trying to manipulate professors into getting the grade they want.

I encouraged you to speak to this professor directly, and gave you advice on how to go about it.  If your strategy here is some kind of a \"gotcha\" to have him restore points to you that you think were unfairly taken away from the \"A\" you feel entitled to, I think you are going to be unsuccessful.  \n\nI've given you good advice, in a very neutral tone, and your response is a tantrum.  \"You should find another career!!!!\" is this sub's go-to when students don't like responses from professors.  Is it possible you're not ready for college, if you can't wrap your mind around the idea that an essay is more than several sentences, and that you have to clarify what you're referring to in an essay response?",

It\u2019s entirely a semantic issue if the professor is taking points away when he is citing his own syllabus for the deduction and that information cannot be found there. \n\nOP provided info on what was needed for the theorist question. If it does not say to elaborate on their theories then OP shouldn\u2019t have points deducted. As for sentences OP said there wasn\u2019t anything in the syllabus stating it as a requirement, so why deduct points? Also you can make perfectly fine and sophisticated responses with 3-4 sentences.\n\nProfessors are, supposedly, highly qualified for their role. They are responsible for holding professional and consistent standards for students. They need to and should state everything they expect and require. If not then yes, they should be reported for an unorganized and unprofessional environment for their students. \n\nAs I can see from your post and comment history, you target students and are very negative towards them in general. You\u2019re putting yourself in a position where you cannot see issues from the scope of the people you teach. You should be ashamed of the way you speak in this profession. \n\nI suppose some students can certainly be wrong and dumb, but professors can be too! \n\nAlso, checkout your rate my professor and tell me how that\u2019s doing. \ud83d\ude09",

Again, you're also stuck on the misbelief that professors \"take points away\" rather than assigning grades on the basis of what the student submits.\n\nI'm not addressing the rest of your post because it's childish and not relevant to this conversation.",

Is it your opinion that professors are \"unethical\" if they reflect those differences in the grades they issue?  In other words, is every student submission an \"A\" unless it falls short o the minimal requirement?  Because that seems to be what you and OP are arguing.    \n\n\nI (obviously) don't subscribe to that philosophy, because it's unfair to students who do \"excellent\" work, which is what an \"A\" is meant to indicate.",
