Definitely no more than a day for me because I'd lose focus if I stopped working on it for too long, which would add a ton of time just trying to figure out how to pick up where I left off. So yeah, definitely doable in a week. 1500 may *seem* like a large number, but that's really not a long paper. Depending on how detailed you get, you may struggle keeping it *below* the word limit, at least I know I have with papers of similar lengths.",
