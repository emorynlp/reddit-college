  "title:": "Why can't students in the USA not go to med or law school right away?",
  "text": "First of all, I'm not sure if I'm correct with my assumption, but to me it seems like this:\n\nSo people in the US need at least a bachelor's degree in pretty much anything before they can go on to law or med school?\nIs this obligatory? Are there exceptions?\n\nIf my assumption is true or not, I see too many people going this route. Why ?\nWhat's the point of studying something which doesn't help you one bit towards becoming a lawyer or an MD?\n\nI'm asking because in my country (Germany) it is completely different. You start right away after your Abitur (should be a-level highschool). If your grades are good but not good enough you can choose to wait \"wait\", and every semester not studying at any university is counting towards credit to let you in the near future.\n\nIt takes so long to become an MD or a full-blown lawyer, why prolong it by having this mundane requirement.\n\nI hope you guys can enlighten me on this matter!!",

It's even less if you do things like take a higher course load or take courses in the summer. And like I said, literally every other grad program here expects the same amount of time. If someone doesn't want to commit a couple more years, they're probably better off pursuing a career that takes fewer qualifications and gives better work-life balance. \n\n\n\n>Why is there even a difference?

Staatsexamen in Germany.\nThat would be 7 years in total. You do nothing but law during this timeframe.\nMost people take 1-2 years longer than that.\n\nIn the US, the 4 years of UG only teach you very little about law (if at all) because you don't really start until you are in law school. So it isn't really 7 years as you described, more like 3.5.\n\nAlso, Germany is training full lawyers who don't specialize in 1-2 things, they have to learn the whole thing. They also have all their last exams in a very short time-frame, making it very hard to score highly.\nThis is why law in Germany is much harder than in pretty much any other country.",
