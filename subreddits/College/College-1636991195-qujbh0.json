      "text": "I don't think nearly as many people frown on the liberal arts as you might suspect.  People have been asking this question for decades, if not centuries, and the liberal arts are still here, and as always, the reports of their death are greatly exaggerated.\n\nBut, the people who most look down on the liberal arts usually have a utilitarian view point.  That means that they want to know how these things benefit society.  Now, there are a lot of ways that the liberal arts benefit society, but a lot of them are more abstract.  Things like \"A well educated, well rounded population benefits everyone\" or \"It's good to learn how to look at things from different perspectives.\"\n\nThose are definitely good things, but the liberal arts are not by any stretch of the imagination the only place you can learn those things.  So the people who dislike the liberal arts are usually focused on *concrete*, tangible benefits.  They usually say things like \"This is the 21st century.  What will benefit the most people?  Focusing our limited educational resources on producing more cancer doctors, or producing more experts in the French literature of the Middle Ages?  They then argue that the former are clearly more beneficial to 21st century society than the latter, so we should spend our precious finite resources on the things like the former.\n\nSome people find those arguments convincing, and some don't, which is why the debate has gone on for a long, long time.  But, as someone who's been in academia for 20 years, only very, very rarely do I encounter someone who truly sees no value in the liberal arts.  Like most things in the world, people tend to like what they like and not care about much else.  So scientists focus mostly on science, literature students on literature, business students on business, and so forth.  That doesn't mean they hate all those other things, just that they don't personally want to devote time or energy to them.",

      "text": "It changes over decades and based on where you live or how you were raised, but right now, U.S. society has undergone extreme financialization in both the economy and our minds. Money is believed to rule supreme (debt, cost of living, and social outcomes are tied up in this) so majors that are perceived to be high-paying are also highly respected. Instead of fighting back for financial reform, people think they can win the financial game by going into other majors.",

          "text": "Yeah well I fell for that. Now, despite lack of skill or passion , I made it very far but feel like I can't overcome the obstacles ahead anymore.\nI wanted to study English and History. Couldn't tell my parents why, I just felt it. Well after working for a while and flinging out of engineering, having a tough health period, I convinced myself that money rules. Took a major with a focus on Asian economy (mandarin and economy+ political economy). Yeah guess what, I am eaten up by regret and the realization that I should've listened to the people who mean good for ME. Not for my later Bank account.",
