  "text": "Are there any community colleges that offer online bachelors degrees? I\u2019m a sophomore and I\u2019m so indecisive with my plan/major and I don\u2019t want my parents to pay for a big out of state school if I\u2019m just going to keep changing my major. I\u2019m anxious at my school right now, I have no connections and I live in a bad apartment. I feel like I\u2019m stuck here and to be honest, I think I\u2019m a little immature to make such a huge decision about my major right now, so I want to do community college. However, community colleges only offer associates degrees and i want a bachelors degree. Has anyone had a similar experience?",

      "text": "to my knowledge there\u2019s not community colleges that are online nationwide. I think you would need contact the ones in your area to see if your program is offered in an online format. \n\nTo be honest with you, I think you would be better of taking a gap year and working. You said you\u2019re too immature to deal with making a major based decision right now and to transfer to a new school will keep you in the same place mentally as you are now. There\u2019s not really a point to staying in school while being completely unsure of what you want to do as you will end up taking a decent amount of classes you probably won\u2019t need while trying to do career exploration. \n\nIf you can take a year off, it will allow yourself to really think about who you are and what your passions are. Once you figure that out you can find a major that satisfies you not only emotionally but financially. Maybe try taking an aptitude test as a starting point to build off of. Good luck!",
