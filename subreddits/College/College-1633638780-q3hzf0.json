  "title:": "How Can I do Better In College? I feel like I never have enough time to do anything.",
  "text": "I'm a freshman in college right now taking chemistry 1, english 101, pre-calculus, military science, and intro to programming. My military college does courses based off of 8 week quarters. As I'm heading into the final quarter I've been kind of disappointed in my grades. I'm looking at a 2 A's and 2 B's and either an A or B in chemistry depending on my upcoming final. \n\nMy biggest problem is that I feel like I don't have time to complete my assignments. My professors are extremely lenient. I've been allowed to submit many manyyyyy assignments past the due date.\n\nThings that make it hard to manage my time is mandatory morning PT at 5:45 to 6:45 am then 8:00 am morning classes, and mandatory formation that takes about 40 minutes of my time. I also have ADHD but take medication to help manage it. \n\nThere was two weeks where I fell behind because I had issues getting my meds and fell into a food and sleep coma. I started cutting out almost all gaming time and started cutting out heavily on my internet browsing time.  I would go to the library to study and start tracking what I was doing and noticed concerning things. Even though I would spend 3 hours at the library and 45 mins breaking and I would finish 1 assignment and sometimes not that. I stayed up this week - 3 whole days not sleeping and 1 day of only 5 hours of sleep and I still didn't get much done and am still slightly behind for the week. I just don't get what the hell I'm doing wrong, please give me advice on how to fix myself. Everyone else is submitting things on time and I do well if not better than my classmates on tests but seem to take 4x the amount of time on hw than my peers. What can I change to do better.",

      "text": "Your doing well. College isn't like high school were your going to 4.0 everything with a little effort. Your grades are actually incredibly good for an average freshman. That said here's some advice I've given before.\n\n\nI got advice from my engineering professor once that helped a lot. Treat school like a job. Your there at 8 and you stay till 5. You'll always have something to do whether that's doing extra practice problems from the book or reading ahead. It's an excellent time management method as well. 8 hours of focused work is for more efficient than 16 of inter spaced. That said not all 8 hours needs to be work. Think back to high school when you had 10 min breaks every 50 min and an 30-60 min lunch. These are important.\n\nThis helps in a number of ways. The first is that a schedule like this is so much easier to maintain. You skip class once or show up at different times and it's easy to continue skipping and hard to continue showing up.\n\nThe next big part is it's often consistent with your high school or work schedule. Consistancy Makes life easier in the long run.\n\nThe 3rd and biggest reason is that at 5 o'clock your done. You shut your brain off and enjoy life. This will help you from procrastinating later when your withdrawaling from social media or whatever your hobby is. Let's you decompress and makes you feel like your entire life isn't failing at school.\n\nEngineering school requires around 16 to 18 credits a semester to graduate in 4 years. I was there Monday through Friday and only had extra time a handful of times. I worked 48 hour shifts on the weekends as an EMT. That said always give yourself a break. 8 hours at school every day is hard enough. Add more onto that and your only setting yourself up to burn out. Those hours between 5 and 11 were the only thing that prevented me from burning out with my schedule. I went from flunking out to a 3.0 in about a year. Just realize that school is litterally the hardest time of your life and power through the rough spots. Taking a big picture view always helped me and always look forward. Keep telling yourself I've only got 8 more weeks this semester then I can relax. \n\nAnother big thing about this time in your life is not to stress about everyone else. Focus on yourself. I don't mean in the sense that you need to improve. Fuck knows why everyone is obsessed with self help books. I'm mean don't think your further behind than your peers. Most never went to school. The ones that did a significant portion dropped out. Getting married, finding \"the one\" and partying will be a lot more satisfying when you just have to worry about showing up to your 9-5 or whatever. You'll save yourself a lot of stress throughout school with good time management skills and a solid study schedule. All these kids stressing over finals and pulling all nighters are stressed and miserable because they didn't treat school like a job.  Sorry for rambling a bit there.",

      "text": "Time management was (still is!) the hardest part of college. And I\u2019m speaking from a civilian perspective, without ADHD or military rigor to deal with on top of that.  Seek help from your academic advisors and/or counseling and psychological services (often called CAPS). ADHD is a learning disability, which means there are probably accommodations available to help you with organization and study skills, or maybe even grant extra time on exams and assignments since it\u2019s harder for you to focus than your peers. Most schools have an accessibility office to handle these things, so you should definitely seek that out.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t feel like \u201coh I don\u2019t need/deserve an accommodation\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s not fair that I have one.\u201d  Would it be fair to expect a blind or deaf person to learn the same way as everyone else? No. Assuming your ADHD has been diagnosed (and if you\u2019re on meds then it definitely has been), you have just as much a right to get help with learning as anyone else with a disability.",

          "text": "Yea I've been diagnosed, I'm actually transferring out of this school because the whole point was for me to branch into a military academy which will require me to stop meds for 6 months to prove that my ADHD isn't a hindrance enough but I don't think I can manage :/. I can't seek any accommodations right now but I'll def look into it for the school I'm transferring into. \n\nI'm just worried because I feel like jobs won't hire me if they know I had accommodations in college. Even with meds, I'm just confused as to why I always feel like I'm falling behind in school work. Is it normal to not have any free time in college? Because at this rate to finish my assignments on time I might just have to study and do work all day.",

      "text": "What worked for me was not returning to my place between when I left for my first class and returned after my latest class. Time spent between classes was in study halls or having lunch. In your case if you're sitting at the library but not really working it just gives you more time to slowly work. People who follow schedules tend to do the things they're scheduled to do so after a while working at this you should see that you're working faster and finishing work and using the time to work ahead or go back over stuff which will lead to better results. I had it easy in high school and I had to learn how to work because I never needed to prior to college and it took some time as learning habits isn't instantaneous.",
