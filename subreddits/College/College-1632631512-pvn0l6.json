  "text": "I told my roommate that I had to wake up really early for an athletic event and I apologized but they didn't seem too thrilled (which I totally get). I went to bed early at 10pm for said athletic event.. Told roommate that they didn't have to go to bed with me obviously and could have fun and come back to room later. They said 11:30-12 they'd return, so I was like fine I'll prolly fall asleep hopefully. Unfortunately people on my floor are so freaking loud and I couldn't fall asleep until 1. my roommate walked in at quarter to 2. Then my stupid alarm goes off at 6:20 and my roommate got up too and seemed kinda pissed at me. I also felt pissed at myself. I feel like I am such a baby going to bed at 11. Please tell me I'm not the only one. Any advice for dealing with occasional differences in bedtime?",

      "text": "Not a baby lol, you\u2019re doing the responsible thing, it\u2019s unfortunate honestly, my school paired roommates up by sleep schedule which was helpful, you can still switch roommates if it becomes a real issue. But other than that just talk it out with your roommate and say hey I gotta wake up early tomorrow at six, sorry in advance if I wake you. To try to prevent it take your phone alarm, set it on low volume and stuff it under your head or under the pillow so it only sounds off to you, you can also plug in wire headphones and the alarm will wake only you up, stick it on one ear or wrap it around your ear, you could also put it on vibrate and stuff it under your pillow as well. I would out my phone on my stomach on vibrate so it would kinda tickle me to wake up.",
