My GPA is excellent because I can wing things like a boss, but I don't feel like I'm ever actually learning anything.

I did very well throughout grade school and high school without really learning how to study. I then realized when I got to college that never really needing to study wasn\u2019t actually all that great for my development as a student. I crammed for most exams, wrote essays with the book next to me so I could scan the chapters, and completed many assignments at 11:58 pm on the due date. I also have ADHD, and often, I succumbed to the characteristic tendency to procrastinate until I felt I couldn\u2019t any longer.\n\nUnfortunately \u2013 as you can imagine \u2013 I left freshman year realizing that I hadn\u2019t really learned much of anything from my classes. As someone who is very passionate about learning for the sake of learning, this was really disappointing! I took some very interesting classes in my freshman year, but because of my behavior, I feel like I wasted it.\n\nThis disappointment is what really motivated me to change how I approached my classes. I started small in my sophomore year, choosing at least a couple of classes for which I would try diligently to read ahead of each lecture. Sometimes I still procrastinated or found it hard to discipline myself to read the whole chapter, but importantly, I was finally taking small steps to become the kind of student I wanted to be: one who was consistently prepared and getting the most out of all of my classes. I also asked for advice from people I knew to be great students \u2014 my brother, impressive classmates, my dad, etc. I learned how beneficial it could be to sit in the front of the classroom, to get to know my professors personally, and to do assignments a little bit each day.\n\nYes, my GPA in freshman year was pretty damn good because I was capable of producing good work with little investment, but my grades have only gone up since then. I am very proud of that, but even more importantly, I feel so enriched by what I have learned in my classes. If this seems like yet another one of those stories from students who make you feel like you are hopelessly incapable of doing the same thing, understand that when I entered college, I had no idea how to be a truly good student. There were times I thanked my lucky stars that a class dropped an exam (*cough* 15% on my acids/bases exam *cough*) or that a TA couldn\u2019t see through my writing that I had only skimmed the reading material. Again, I have ADHD, so to be able to say that I am a student who maintains (most of the time, anyway) self-discipline, routines, and pretty good time management is important as *heck* to me. \n\nHere are some of the most important pieces of advice I got from other people and eagerly recommend to other students:\n\u2022 Break up work (even and especially reading) over multiple days. This requires that you start the assignment at least a few days in advance, if possible. It can mean doing the first couple problems, jotting down some thoughts for an essay in a bulleted list, or \u2013 and I\u2019m serious about this one \u2014 setting up your Word document and writing your heading. What\u2019s most important (and what was often the hardest part for me for much of my life) is that you just START. It was like, \u201cI mean, now that I\u2019ve started, why not do just a couple more problems, and then I can stop for today.\u201d In other words, just beginning often makes it easier to do more than you felt you could at the start. This is so important for me when reading textbooks. If I am able to read half of the chapter the night before lecture and the other half the morning before lecture, I manage to get the whole chapter done before lecture without having to sit and read for multiple hours at a time. \n\u2022 Do reach out to your professors, even if, like you said, it\u2019s to let them know that you\u2019re struggling and ask for some guidance. Your professors are people just like you and are more compassionate, interesting, personable, and helpful than you might imagine. I feel like I can\u2019t express enough how much this particular component has enriched my college experience. To be able to make a connection with someone who knows so much more than I do and who has the power to help me when I might need it is really awesome. \n\u2022 Communicate and study with other students. Group studying isn\u2019t the best for everyone, and not every study group is the most effective. In fact, I benefited from group studying in some classes more than in others. It\u2019s something you might have to feel out and may be harder now that your interactions with your classmates are mostly virtual (I\u2019m assuming they are), but it\u2019s still worth doing. Explaining class material to each other and asking each other questions is key to finding out what you didn\u2019t even realize you didn\u2019t know. \n\u2022 This is getting insanely long, so I\u2019ll just give one more tip. At the beginning of each semester, I thoroughly read through each of my syllabi and put all assignments, tests, and other important events and deadlines on a calendar. I keep this calendar on my desk and add things to it almost every day. I tend to like being able to check items off of a to do list, so I check them off on my calendar when I complete them. Since I started doing this, I don\u2019t think I have ever just forgotten an assignment or had an exam date sneak up on me. It also helps me manage my time because I can see what\u2019s on my plate for any given day. This practice is simple, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. \n\nOkay, I\u2019ll wrap it up here. If you managed to read through all of that in one sitting, you\u2019re on the right track for being able to read your textbooks lmao. I hope some of this was helpful and maybe even motivating. Give yourself the credit you deserve in that not only do you seem to have a little bit of cushion grade-wise, you\u2019re making arguably the most important decision, which is to recognize that you can improve and reach out to people who can help you do that. As a senior now, I\u2019m a massively better student than I was in freshman year, but I still look for ways to do things better than I currently am. College is a critical opportunity to learn how to try something, assess its effectiveness/feasibility, adjust your approach, and try again (over and over again) \u2014 you can probably see how important this will be for the rest of your life. I have confidence in you, and I wish you all the best!!!", "author": "ickyvicky98", "created": 1601404797, "upvotes": 1}, "g733pqm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j1kbmv/does_anyone_else_fall_behind_while_still_making/g733pqm/", "text": "Get caught up, take a deep breath, get caught up, take a deep breath, repeat", "author": null, "created": 1601402018, "upvotes": 1}, "g732vcj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j1kbmv/does_anyone_else_fall_behind_while_still_making/g732vcj/", "text": "I absolutely understand this to the core.

Professors LOVE helping students like you-- ones who want to learn and occasionally fall behind. It makes them feel good to see that the student they helped out ended with good grades. The larger the class, the fewer students come to the professor for help, ironically, so most of them are stoked to work with a student one-on-one.\n\nMy alarm clock broke and I slept through an 8am lab worth a significant portion of my grade 2 weeks ago. My professor really appreciated my honesty and was willing to work with me to get me caught back up-- apparently she has narcolepsy and was super understanding. She mentioned that she wasn't particularly worried about me since I seemed to be \"ahead of the curve\" in the class material, but that she was totally willing to help out in the future. I have tons of prior experience in the course content, and my prof was still totally happy to give me an extra boost. Profs don't want their smart students to get bad grades, or it makes them feel like they did a bad job of teaching. If there's any subconscious bias, it will be in your favor.\n\nJust be honest. They'd rather hear that you're struggling to motivate yourself while learning online 2 weeks before the exam than hear that your grandma died the day of. If you're the kind of student who can write a good essay at 3am with two cans of monster energy by your side, it's because you spent the time and effort learning to write well earlier in life.

On some occasions I\u2019ve hired a private tutor. I just don\u2019t want the prof to know I\u2019m winging it or they might subconsciously grade my work harsher. Like \u201coh, I know sloth wrote this paper last night because that\u2019s how she did the last one. It\u2019s probably bad\u201d and then find errors they wouldn\u2019t notice otherwise", "author": "Slothfulness69", "created": 1601346872, "upvotes": 29}, "g70sei3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j1kbmv/does_anyone_else_fall_behind_while_still_making/g70sei3/", "text": "I wouldn't worry too much.
