  "text": "I\u2019m looking at my grades on Blackboard and I have two assignments in there marked 0/100. I reached out to my teacher because they were supposed to be just extra credit and she told me they don\u2019t count against my grade but upon doing all the math I\u2019m pretty sure they do. Does anyone if maybe she put them in wrong or something? And if she did do them wrong, how do I kindly tell her she is wrong?",
