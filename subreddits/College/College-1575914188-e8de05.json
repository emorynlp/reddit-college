Honestly, it never phased me because I just had no motivation or desire to be there.I would just work. Took me like 3 years to realize I didn't have to do what my parents told me too. Though part of the problem, I think, is that I stayed in my hometown for college. Saved money but still have like $30k in debt, but I digress. \n\n\nSo I ended dropping out my junior year, crazy I know. But I was miserable. I couldn't take it anymore. My parents were pissed and dissapointed. I ended up joing the Marine Corps as an aircraft mechanic. Best job in the Marine Corps Btw.\n\n\nYeah, I dont make a lot of money. But I'm finally happy. I'm confident in myself and just feel great. I wake up WANTING to go to work even if it's only 4 am. I've made the best friends I've ever had and people I can count on.\n\n\nThe issue is, my parents dont even talk to me anymore. It's been like 4 months since I last went home didn't feel welcome. My little brother was the only one I can still bond with.

It\u2019s true that college isn\u2019t for everyone, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with leaving.  Don\u2019t let anyone tell you there is.  I\u2019m sorry that your parents are behaving childishly the way they are, but you do not need to feel any guilt about they way they choose to behave.  If I was your parent, I\u2019d be wishing for you to find what makes you truly happy.", "author": "jon4702", "created": 1575921518, "upvotes": 91}, "fab9poy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e8de05/my_parents_are_giving_me_so_much_shit_for/fab9poy/", "text": "I think you should still finish.

I mean if you finished school and your parents watched you cross that stage it would make them so proud BUT again its not just about them being happy, you need to be happy too. Just a thought though.
