  "text": "My university is back in person this year and it just doesn't feel the same at all compared to pre-covid. I cannot take it seriously at all anymore. I barely go to my classes, not as productive as I used to be, don't really feel worried for midterms even though I should be. It just all feels kinda fake, like a summer camp or something. Anyone else feel this way? Not sure exactly what's causing this but it sucks because I am generally a really productive person but I just feel do not feel compelled at all to care about any of this. Feels totally fake",

      "text": "I can relate and honestly its painful to deal with it but the whole thing can also be very beneficial: \n\nBefore covid, we just went alsong with the education system, thinking that this is the only way of living and having no alternatives: we just had to unquestionably do everything and no willpower was wasted on forcing yourself to get the job done.\n\nNow though, we have an idea that school is not mandatory and we feel like we can go on with our lives perfectly without it. We are subconsciously questioning if its really that important to attend classes which strains our already-drained willpower. \n\nI feel like we are kids who were made to believe that drinking milk is the only way to grow big and strong and wether we liked or not we would drink it all up  without questioning (just cause we thought there was no way around it) but after learning that, while its beneficial, milk really isnt the core, fundamental for being healthy u just, meh,  it loses the value, u get demotivated and just because u have an option now of not drinking it, deciding to still consume it requires lot more mental energy. (Not really the best metaphor but hope it made my \"theory\" clearer)\n\nWhat I did to cure myself from a severe procrastination and other deadly diseases was to think beyond the education my country provided for me: what person do i wanna be? What do i want to achieve? What are the ways of achieving it?(this really is not an easy process btw, I had to reflect on many many stuff and i only managed to answer those questions for the next 5ish years, thank god it was enough) And during this process I realised that there is almost no chance i could drop out and still achieve what I want.  It took some good effort to analyse and realise all this but the effort was worth it: just like before covid,  the importance of school is unquestionable and i just do it.\n\nSo id reccomemd trying to remind yourself of the purpose and the importance school has, and stick to it, not easy but the action must be taken.\n\nI went this deep just because the change we had after covid hit was certainly a big one, so it needs equally strong change for us to get back on track. \n\nP.s. dont let ur friends, still bein hot messes, drag you with them, rather try to confront to them that a fundamental change is needed, itll be easier together. \n\nDamn this is a lot, hope you find it helpful and wish you great luck!!",

Since I\u2019ve gotten back to school my anxiety has been awful. I get mini panic attacks going to pick up my food or answer questions in class, and remember I almost burst into tears in the middle of a crowded lecture hall because I got an answer wrong. If this was pre pandemic id probably just be a little embarrassed. \n\n3. My school still has certain protocols in place, so it feels a little more isolating. I do get they\u2019re for our safety, but everything closes at 8PM, we don\u2019t have a dining hall because they turned it into a vaccine center (even if nobody is ever in there), and we can\u2019t use any of the lounges.",
