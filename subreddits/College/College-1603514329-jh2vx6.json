You feel a lot of sentimentality towards college and socially relate with a lot of students. The second year out is similar but it starts to considerably fade. Third year out? At this point, you probably relate more to people in their late 20s/early 30s than, say, 19 and 20 year old kids. It\u2019ll be better sooner than you think, too. By the time you\u2019re 24( certainly 25), adulthood doesn\u2019t progress on a linear scale. Everyone treats you like an adult and life events happen whenever you want them to happen. \n\nDon\u2019t go to grad school unless you are gifted in an academic discipline.

This is what everyone should be striving for, because in the end these workplaces see you as a replaceable commodity. There is no \u2018love\u2019 or \u2018loyalty\u2019 with any company, they\u2019ll drop you in a heart beat if it suits them, so think of your own interests first throughout your career. \n\nThere is a lot of bullshit in the workplace like office politics, nepotism and backbiting but honesty the only thing you should be doing is what\u2019s being asked of you by your manager, completing the task and letting it go as soon as you close your laptop and go home. \n\nLast thing I want to emphasize is learn how to SAVE your money. I can\u2019t stress this enough. As we\u2019ve learned this year, someone can eat a bat that spreads a virus and forces companies to lay off millions of people.
