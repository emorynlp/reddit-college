  "title:": "Do colleges realize that *being at home* does not actually count as a \"break\"?",
  "text": "Leaving campus between Tuesday and Sunday is mandatory at my school, which means I'm forced to be at home, and I'm absolutely miserable. This would actually feel like a good restful break if I was allowed to stay on campus. I don't understand why they make us leave and I'm really annoyed by it.\n\nEdit: I would have hoped that this would have gone without saying but I don\u2019t want to be at home because my family is toxic and my mental illness relapses whenever I\u2019m here. So while I stay in bed all day crying about how I\u2019ll never be good enough, please, do continue telling me how grateful you are to see your family. \n\nI pay 4000 dollars per semester for one small room in a 4-bed on-campus apartment. I am 21 years old and perfectly capable of looking after myself. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t I find other arrangements? Well, I would have stayed, but to be granted permission to stay you need a good reason and documentation for that reason. I had nothing I could show documentation for. Why didn\u2019t I stay somewhere else? I don\u2019t have any money (at least, not 6 nights in a hotel money) and I wouldn\u2019t dare ask a friends family to house and feed me for 5/6 days, I\u2019d just feel like a burden. Why didn\u2019t I try harder? Well because no one wants to believe that their family is as bad as they are.",

              "text": "I mean I understand it from the school's perspective because the RAs get sent home too (at most school's). Mine has us alternate working breaks to give coverage, which means there's always an RA on campus. I know most schools don't have any RAs stay so there's not really anyone to supervise the buildings. \n\nI think that for Thanksgiving Break making everyone leave isn't fair because travel is expensive and it's only a 3 day break. Now winter break and spring break make more sense to me. Sorry your school is strict with the stay requests that kinda sucks. At the same time being in the dorms on break is super quiet and kinda creepy.",
