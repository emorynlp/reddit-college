  "title:": "Should I transfer to community college if I\u2019m not having a good time at a University?",
  "text": "My parents are helping my with college but only have enough saved up for around 2 years at a university so I\u2019m going to be debt. It cost me ~$9,000 just for one semester at KSU with a scholarship. I want to get a degree from UGA. I just attended basically a full semester at KSU (Kennesaw State University). And I have to say it has not been that fun for me and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth anywhere close the $ I\u2019m spending. I\u2019m staying at a dorm so it cost a lot but there isn\u2019t much cheaper off campus options. I knew KSU was a commuter school but It seems like the whole campus is always dead besides traffic. The professors are alright nothing special. I know college isn\u2019t all about having fun and partying but the social atmosphere seems hard to find in Kennesaw. You have to drive 30 minutes to Buckhead just to go to a college bar. I haven\u2019t meet that many new people and my social life here is really just with my friends from high school. Granted I didn\u2019t rush a frat or join any clubs/ intramural teams. I don\u2019t think I will meet that many new people next semester. I would be transferring to UNG Oconee which I have attended for one semester and it costs around $900 a semester. Do you think I should transfer or give it another shot?",
