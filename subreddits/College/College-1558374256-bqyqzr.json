  "text": "So I\u2019m gonna be a freshman at a private school this year. I\u2019m an athlete and the fields and the freshman dorms are literally on opposite sides, so I\u2019m gonna have to walk 40ish minutes to practice everyday. I\u2019m really considering buying heelys cause they were fun as fuck to ride and if I\u2019m gonna get them im gonna get them in black. Just wondering if this is a good idea or am I stupid\n\nUpdate: Yall I might just do it with all this gassing. Also my school does not have a shuttle, and if I actually do get heelys, I won\u2019t be wearing them all the time. I would probably just switch out of them and put them in my bag lol",

They aren't very fast if you arent going strictly downhill (if one direction is all downhill- it may be worth it). Little bumps in the road send you flying way more than any other wheel transport because there is no suspension or give in the shoes. Indoors is pretty fun if the hallway is linoleum but I stopped using them there too because I was almost hitting people whenever I used em. Too fast for indoors and too slow for outdoors.",

We have two on our campus, both inside the outdoor recycling centers where the bins for plastics/glass/cardboard are by the dorms. At other campuses I've seen them outside of libraries and/or student centers. The nicer ones have a modest set of tools attached by a cable; at some schools I've seen whole tool sets and even specialized things like third hands and bottom bracket wrenches available for checkout in the library.\n\nOur campus licenses bikes and clears abandoned/unlicensed ones perhaps once a month. They go to impound (like ticketed cars) and if they aren't claimed they are sold in the fall to incoming students at silly low prices.",

Just buy a cheap bike, that way it will be less likely to get stolen, and take care of it well enough so that it might just last you through a few years\n\nAlso, make sure you stop at STOP signs. Bikers on my campus don't have bike lanes and they tend to blow right through them straight into 4-way intersections. Stay safe :)",

A custom motorbike, motorized skateboards, longboards, and some kind of go cart looking thing with a mounted Bluetooth speaker.\n\nHowever, how much it will help you may depend on your campus. For example, my university (UCF) has the major multilane roads that require crosswalks orbiting the campus, so you can bike or heely without interruption. That's why even though UCF is a HUGE campus, you can bike across most of it in 10-12 minutes. Granted, almost nothing is in a straight line so its never a direct route, but it's still reasonable.\n\nUSF, for example is on a grid system, with the major roads crisscrossing through campus. This blows in my opinion since even though you can bike faster than walk, you waste a ton of time waiting at cross walks and it doesn't say you much time. Plus the clumps of people at crosswalks means you spend a lot of time having to walk.",
