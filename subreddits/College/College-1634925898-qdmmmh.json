  "title:": "Thinking about attending college to become a sign language interpreter",
  "text": "I am 24 years old and I have been fascinated by American sign language for as long as I can remember. When I was 18 years old, I applied at Miami Dade College so I could start the 2 year Associate program. I was struggling with mental illness severely at that age, I let it control my life, and I decided to put it off. Fast forward 6 years later, I'm still struggling with mental illness but I'm taking steps to not let it control my life anymore. \n\nI want to mention that I grew up taking gifted/advanced classes but because my mental illness was so severe, and I let it take control, I dropped out sophomore year of highschool. I attended a GED program at Miami Dade college, got my highschool diploma that way, and graduated earlier than all my peers. My certification literally says \"highschool diploma\". A lot of people give me a hard time because they don't believe a GED is the same thing as a highschool diploma, so that's why I said that.\n\nAnyways, I now live in Jacksonville, Fl and I'm looking to start in FSCJ to get an Associate degree in sign language interpretation. I do have some reservations about doing this though. First, I am very shy/ socially anxious. I wasn't always like this. Due to experiencing trauma over the course of my life, I have become much more reserved but I'm currently doing therapy to overcome my social anxiety. I have noticed that to be a sign language interpreter you need to have good social skills, be very friendly, and be okay with public speaking. That's something I need to work on.\n\nSecond, although I grew up in gifted classes, I did not do well in school. I have a lot of insecurities about my intelligence. I had a lot of learning anxiety, fear of failure, fear of looking stupid. I don't think this means that I'm not intelligent or bright, I think it just means that I allowed my anxiety to really get in the way of learning anything. I was more anxious of how I was coming across to others, to my teachers and having performance anxiety. I had a really hard time focusing as well (I've been diagnosed with ADD) and I still do now.\n\n I want to be able to overcome this. Because I do have a hard time learning, I was thinking of doing school part time, if that's even possible? I will start working full time soon and I think doing school part time will be less taxing on my mental health. I don't know how anything college related works. Credits, semesters, financial aid... I don't understand much about how to get started at college at all, so if any of you would like to help in that regard I would really appreciate it.\n\n* To make this short, I want to get an Associate degree for sign language interpretation. I do have reservations about it because of my mental illnesses, not having been to school in 6 years (and not having done well in school), and not really knowing about how to get started at a community college, how the credits work, how financial aid works, and if I could even do it part time although it would take me much longer to complete.\n\nIf you read all the way through, you are a sweet heart\ud83d\ude07 \ud83d\udc96\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, and any help would be deeply appreciated \ud83e\udd17",

      "text": "Do you know any ASL currently? My only caution here is that if you expect to go into college with no prior experience and come out of it with interpreter options that might be a little ambitious. Not impossible of course! But you will also be expected to be expressive and also get used to having people watching as you sign. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m trying to dissuade you but As someone with social anxiety, I just want to make sure you\u2019re aware of what the job would entail. I know you did mention this a bit but I guess the biggest thing here is how far along you are with developing your coping skills, and if you feel you\u2019re ready for such an undertaking. There\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a bit more time if you\u2019re still working things out. As for part-time college, this will be dependent on your institution but its entirely possible to ease your way into it and take one or two classes but double check the institutions you\u2019re interested in and look for their policy on part time studies",

          "text": "Right now, I don't know any ASL. Taking that into account, they will probably require me to know some ASL already at a specific level. That's something I didn't think about, I thought I would start from the very first level getting into the program. That is very true, thank you for mentioning that. To be an interpreter you need a lot of practice signing, being around the deaf community, exct. It's a new language and it takes a lot of training.\n\nI have thought about the expressiveness and social aspect of the job & that is definitely something I would need to work on because the job revolves around that. I need to continue therapy & practice in social situations. I don't think you're trying to dissuade me!  :) I think you're being honest and realistic. What you're saying is making me think about all of this in a more logical/practical way. I think I have to think about my limitations surrounding this, if I feel ready to take the plunge, and then set a date of when I should start.\n\nI think doing school part time would be good for me. I will look into the part time policies at FSCJ. I already sent them an email for more information regarding the program, and I'm going to ask questions from there. ( I think it's just easier for me not to reach out to call, and type away through Reddit \ud83d\ude02) but it's a first step & I have to do it anyways.",

It sounds like you\u2019re on the right track with your mental health and future planning. Just give yourself some grace and ease into these changes vs. dive right in. I wish you all the best whatever you choose!",
