      "text": "Hi all,\n\nThis is an awful day and our hearts go out to the people injured and killed, and all those at UNCC who've probably experienced one of the worst days in their lives. \n\nPlease remember to keep the comments civil and report any that are in bad taste. We'll be checking regularly. \n\nThis is also not the place to be discussing gun laws. Take it to r/politics. \n\nDo not let this devolve into a discussion about the perpetrator. We will not advertise their crimes or give them the attention they want. For that reason, any mention or link to the perpetrator's identity will be removed. Please report any that you see to help us do this quickly. \n\nFor those at UNCC, please make the most of the counselling that will become available to you in the coming hours and days. These events are traumatic for all, and at the very least, it will give you a chance to decompress in a safe and structured environment. Reach out for help within your community if you need it. You'll find no shortage of people willing to give it freely.",

Movie theaters and gun access have little to do with it.

If you want proof that gun ownership doesn\u2019t correlate to the amount of suicide look at Asian countries that have a high rate a suicide with extremely restricted gun ownership. \n\nNow, you\u2019re right that defending yourself with a firearm is dangerous to all parties during an active shooter situation. So far in these situations the only person to be killed/injured in this exact scenario is the CCWer by a police officer who didn\u2019t follow the typical deescalation protocols recommended for Active Shooter situations.\n\nAdditionally, u/twofedoras, you\u2019re argument is weak as it\u2019s an argument based on emotion not supported by any type of data. There are more guns than people in the United States, yet less than 1% of the population is murdered by firearms and less than 25% of suicides are by firearms each year.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the appropriate  time to make the argument that we should be allowed to carry onto state funded colleges, it\u2019s also not appropriate to make our arguments based around emotions. Especially on a sub for scholars.\n\nI hope we can do better as a nation and focus on how to resolve this issue amicably while respecting the bill of rights.",

I have OCD (diagnosed) so I know how disruptive they can be.\n\n I have a couple of suggestions that I hope you don't take as condescending. Obviously you and others have already mentioned speaking to someone so I'll skip that. \n\nFirstly you can look at it in terms of numbers. To begin with school shootings are already rare but I don't have a specific starting number but it's likely less that 1 in 10000 at the worst. Secondly UNCC has something close to like 30,000 students. If reports are correct and this tragedy has led to 2 deaths, that's 0.007% chance of being killed as a student there. So the likelihood of your daughter being a victim of anyone is tiny tiny. Bees are literally more dangerous. \n\nSecondly if you want to take a few small steps to feel like you're more in control there's always some things you can do to ease your fear. For instance there are light bulletproof inserts you can buy that can easily fit in back packs that stop hand gun and shotgun rounds for around $100.\n\nYou can take a course on firearms to familiarise yourself with them. A sort of \"know your enemy\" type thing. The destructive side, aside shooting as a sport is great fun and is a great way to build confidence (at least for me). The more knowledge you have is always better than the fear of the unknown and the ruminations that your mind can concoct. \n\nI hope any of these suggestions have helped or give you ideas for your own strategies.\n\nYou sound like an awesome mum that obviously wants the best for her child :) . Just make sure you balance that with an accurate risk assessment so as to not stifle her so that she can grow in to the best adult she can be.\n\nEdit. My maths",
