      "text": "My best friend died of cancer very early on in college. Knew that he'd want to see me succeed. Throwing myself into schoolwork as a way to honor him allowed me to turn potential self destruction into something positive instead. And to be frank, it made the grief a lot easier to deal with. Drowning in grief is torture. Throwing yourself into work is easier by far. And I'm sure he'd rather be a part of my success than my failure. My GPA spiked that semester, and while there's a lot of sadness thinking about that, there's also something to feel good about.\n\n\nMy advice would be to view school as an opportunity, not a burden.",

As humans, we all need time to heal. I suggest you request a leave of absence for this very reason. Take some time to grieve for your dad and spend time with your family and friends. Once you have taken time to heal, slowly start up your education. Instead of doing the program for yourself, do it for your dad. He would have wanted you to finish that degree and become successful. Remember all the good moments you had with him and acknowledge the bad. Gradually, you will be able to move on, its just a shitty part of life that everyone has to go through. I wish you the best of luck, your dad raised a bright person, for his sake continue on with your life. Just know everyone will understand your decision and try to continue going to work to make some sort of income. Again I wish you nothing but happiness, just know you can overcome this.",

As cliche as this sounds; the sun always comes round. Your father was your inspiration... what would he be saying to you right now? I found this helped me with my grieving process.\n\nI still talk to my father every day to tell him how much I love him because I never got the chance to say this to his face since my mother left him 19 years ago (I was 10). It hurts so bad, but not as much as it would if I knew for a fact that he could see my pain when I used to cry to sleep every night and he could do nothing about it. \n\nTake the time you NEED to heal but do not withdraw from people. Talk to friends and family. Remember the good times. Go back to work. Also, let your manager know (if you haven't already) so that they can understand why you might be off or leaving early. I know how hard it can be to focus at work; for the first two weeks, I silently cried at my desk trying to hide tears from colleagues who were none the wiser: My minutes from two meetings were delayed, heck I only just completed them. \n\nWishing you peace and comfort at this time. Storms can't last forever.",

I took lighter classes and didn't do my math or sciences.  It took several years for me to get back to \"normal\" and during that time I grieved very deeply. You have a lot on your plate and something has got to give.  Only you can figure out what stays and what goes, but remember, you come first.  Doing everything will not help you grieve or be successful.\n\nYou could take a leave of absence from your school.  The GI Bill might help you through this, but you have to ask.  You never know what support you have until you ask for it. Check with your counseling center and get help.  That is why they are there!\n\nGood luck to you.  It's a hard road, but you WILL get through it. It's your turn to ask for help.",

      "text": "First, I\u2019m so sorry about your loss. My heart is bleeding for you right now, and while there\u2019s so much I wanna say, I know nothing can embody this. This is the emotional equivalent of having your sternum shattered and heart carved out. My thoughts are with you and your family. \n\nLet me just... share some wisdom... \n\nMy mom died from cancer at the start of my senior year of college, and several years later, I still regret muscling through it because \u2018that\u2019s what she would have wanted.\u2019 It prolonged the healing, ingrained unhealthy workaholic tendencies, and unfortunately, aided in the facilitation of toxic romantic relationships. Yes, I\u2019ve been in therapy since, and yes, my therapist and I have been able to narrow down my mishandled grief as one of the root causes for all of those things. Had I acknowledged the severity of my loss, taken a semester to regroup, and been compassionate to my healing, then my entire life would be very different right now. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that grief like this can hit the pause on your entire life. You\u2019ll see the cautionary tales on grief forums for young people who have lost their parents. Something about this particular death in your early twenties stunts growth, and it\u2019s not as obvious as you might think. Because I had read about people waking up one day and realizing they hadn\u2019t moved on, I thought I was in the clear. I was being mindful about it, right? No.\n\nI\u2019m now in my late-twenties, and while I worked small freelance gigs and retail up until now, I just entered my actual field, just put my name on a lease, just stopped being flighty and immature in my relationships, and just started to worry about things like retirement, marriage, and even debt. I avoided growing up because growing up subconsciously meant saying goodbye to my mom, and again, I believe that longterm avoidance was due to not taking care of myself. Paying the bills doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve moved on. No longer sobbing because you can\u2019t wrap your head around the fact Mom or Dad isn\u2019t coming home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve properly healed, and look, grief isn\u2019t linear, and I still cry for my mom five years later, but it\u2019s easy to trick yourself into thinking you\u2019re fine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying to you is what I would say to my younger self. Be kind to yourself. Grief is for the living, not the dead. Your dad wouldn\u2019t be upset or disappointed if you put less than six months of your life on hold so that the 60+ years you have left on this planet are good ones. School isn\u2019t going anywhere, but this window of self-care is fundamental to how you\u2019ll treat life. I promise.\n\nGood luck. You have all of my condolences and hope. If you do stay in school, then utilize every mental health resource on campus (letting your professors know is a great start even if it might seem like oversharing \u2014 it saved my ass) and be kind to yourself when you hit those days that are overcome by sadness, rage, and so on.",

Tell your professors what has happened and just politely request their understanding if you need extra time with homework or leeway with in-class exercises. Get therapy. Keep working.

He was a statistician, completely brilliant, and his belief in me is definitely at the top of my list of reasons for going for a PhD after I graduate this spring. It seems completely overwhelming and impossible right now, I know. I KNOW. \n\nBut if I had left that semester, I honestly don\u2019t think I would have had it in me to go back. I\u2019m sure this will piss a lot of people off, especially those who advocate for mental health first, but for people who have to work and have to go to school to survive financially, you can get through it. I was completely numb the whole semester. The only way I made it through was through a very strict schedule. I woke up and went to bed at the same time every day, ate pretty much the same thing everyday, went directly to class, then work, then study, then collapse and do it again. The days started to blur together and about halfway through, I was actually functional. I made extensive daily checklists, and that was my life (as in, I made a checkbox for EVERYTHING from deodorant to eating 3x day). \n\nYou will get through it. You will make it. I did it. It sucked. But I made it. I also went to grief counseling once a week and gave myself one night a week to watch trash tv. Limit your emotional extremes as much as you can. \n\nGood luck this semester. My heart goes out to you.",

A lot of people are saying to withdraw from school, but I would offer different advice. I would recommend completing full time, but taking a break from work as the GI bill will cover your bah. If you have a cheap enough place to live, you should be able to squeeze by without working. If anything, maybe take a small student loan to cover your expenses for this semester. I know engineering is difficult and time consuming, but that might be just what you need during this time of grieving. Without work you can focus on your studying and reflection. \n\nYou won\u2019t be set behind, and a break in school can be difficult to pick back up, I\u2019d imagine a full year behind would make it even more so. If your worried about a gap in employment or giving up an \u201cin\u201d with an engineering firm, it would be easily explained away when you tell them your situation.\n\nTLDR; Finish school, lighten your load if you need to, quit job, use extra time for healing.",

You deserve to heal. So 12 months is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. It's okay to do this. Your not letting anyone down and it's not going anywhere as long as you follow school policy. \n\nImagine not deferring, not doing well, being over worked and stressed, depression sets in.. things get worse... and now your GPA is permanently damaged.

This is what we do at my campus. Find out the resources for mental health, too. Some schools can refer you to community mental health clinics that might be more accessible if your campus mental health servies are limited.\n\nIf you really don't think you can handle your major classes, but taking a break is not an issue due to finances, you may have options. Take General Education/Elective classes if you need these to complete your degree. Take classes for Credit/No credit (these do not affect GPA). Find out your school's grade forgiveness policy. I have seen students fail a few classes a semester an then utilize grade forgiveness the next semester to their advantage. It is not ideal, and I do not recommend this since it may take a heavier toll mentally but find out your options.\n\nOnly your advisors/professors can help you navigate these options. Also, talk to your financial aid office to see what aid you are eligible for if you drop to part time.",

Also look into other colleges nearby that might offer the classes you need a bit earlier. Some schools will allow you take individual classes from other schools and transfer the credits. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss.",

He loved you and he wouldn't want you to suffer and put yourself through hell trying to do something that you couldn't handle at the moment. \n\n\nTaking a break from school is not quitting/stopping school. I have friends who had to take time off due to poor physical health, but they got back up on their feet and started going back to school, and they were even more successful than they would have been if they tried pushing themselves to go to school when their health simply wouldn't allow it. \n\nThere is no shame in taking time off if that's what your health and grades require. You just need to do what is best for you and your health. Please don't let others make you feel guilty for taking care of yourself and mourning in your own way.",

Retire one year later. \n\nFrom my own experience, even if you can manage now, there will be a time in the next while when you will feel completely exhausted. Toughing it out now is not necessarily the wisest choice. \n\nThat said, maybe you need something to keep you occupied. Maybe you can take just one course this semester? Maybe you can at least take an elective?",
