My heart is bleeding for you right now, and while there\u2019s so much I wanna say, I know nothing can embody this. This is the emotional equivalent of having your sternum shattered and heart carved out. My thoughts are with you and your family. \n\nLet me just... share some wisdom... \n\nMy mom died from cancer at the start of my senior year of college, and several years later, I still regret muscling through it because \u2018that\u2019s what she would have wanted.\u2019 It prolonged the healing, ingrained unhealthy workaholic tendencies, and unfortunately, aided in the facilitation of toxic romantic relationships. Yes, I\u2019ve been in therapy since, and yes, my therapist and I have been able to narrow down my mishandled grief as one of the root causes for all of those things. Had I acknowledged the severity of my loss, taken a semester to regroup, and been compassionate to my healing, then my entire life would be very different right now. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that grief like this can hit the pause on your entire life. You\u2019ll see the cautionary tales on grief forums for young people who have lost their parents. Something about this particular death in your early twenties stunts growth, and it\u2019s not as obvious as you might think. Because I had read about people waking up one day and realizing they hadn\u2019t moved on, I thought I was in the clear. I was being mindful about it, right? No.\n\nI\u2019m now in my late-twenties, and while I worked small freelance gigs and retail up until now, I just entered my actual field, just put my name on a lease, just stopped being flighty and immature in my relationships, and just started to worry about things like retirement, marriage, and even debt. I avoided growing up because growing up subconsciously meant saying goodbye to my mom, and again, I believe that longterm avoidance was due to not taking care of myself. Paying the bills doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve moved on. No longer sobbing because you can\u2019t wrap your head around the fact Mom or Dad isn\u2019t coming home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve properly healed, and look, grief isn\u2019t linear, and I still cry for my mom five years later, but it\u2019s easy to trick yourself into thinking you\u2019re fine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying to you is what I would say to my younger self. Be kind to yourself. Grief is for the living, not the dead. Your dad wouldn\u2019t be upset or disappointed if you put less than six months of your life on hold so that the 60+ years you have left on this planet are good ones. School isn\u2019t going anywhere, but this window of self-care is fundamental to how you\u2019ll treat life. I promise.\n\nGood luck. You have all of my condolences and hope. If you do stay in school, then utilize every mental health resource on campus (letting your professors know is a great start even if it might seem like oversharing \u2014 it saved my ass) and be kind to yourself when you hit those days that are overcome by sadness, rage, and so on.", "author": "OnConch", "created": 1578745172, "upvotes": 1}, "fdujgkq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/emr95v/my_father_suddenly_committed_suicide_on_christmas/fdujgkq/", "text": "I think it is best for you to take at least this semester off to process what happened & eventually recover from this.
