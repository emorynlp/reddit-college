      "text": "Didn\u2019t go to umich and I don\u2019t know what LSA is, but I was a part of a residential college program and I loved it! Think of it as a small community (the RC) inside of a much larger one (the university). I got to be in smaller classrooms and actually got to know my peers and made really good friends - which is nice because we all lived in the same space. I made connections and got to know all of my professors in the RC program on a personal basis (really helped with recommendations later on!!). It was just a really sweet experience and I think being in it really benefitted me later on in my upperclass years of college (my RC helped a lot with advising and gave insight on professionalism in careers, etc).",
