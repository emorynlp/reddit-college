  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m a Sophomore in my 2nd year and right now I\u2019m taking 17 credits. I have A\u2019s in all my other classes and one F (Calculus 2). Tests make up 45% of the grade and I bombed my first test really bad. I don\u2019t see the point in risking messing up my GPA even though this class is required for my planned major. Should I drop it, do you think? How best would I be advised? I feel really stupid and dumb for not doing so well in this class TBH\u2026 normally I\u2019m at least B minimum.",
