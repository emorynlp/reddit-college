  "title:": "should i get a TI-89 calculator?",
  "text": "hey, high school senior here! i'm in calculus right now, and i have a ti-84+ ce - which is obviously great - but i am considering upgrading to a ti-89. obviously, im not gonna spend $130 on a calculator i'll be only using for a year, so the goal here is that i'll be able to use it in college (which wld make it a worthy investment). but i read online that a loooot of math/physics/etc courses in college ban the use of calculators on tests, so getting a super powerful calculator is basically pointless - since saving time on hw isn't really gonna help u in the long run if it makes you over-dependent on ur calculator.\n\nanyway, i thought i should ask u guys? is it worth it? i mean, a ti84 is perfectly fine for calculus, esp calc ab/calc 1 (which is what i'm in!) so it's not like i need it... but would a ti89 be a good investment or nah?",

      "text": "I\u2019m an electrical engineer and the Ti Nspire CAS is a fucking godsend. Also most profs of STEM majors could care less what kind of calculator you use as long as you don\u2019t cheat with it. And even then they\u2019ll just make it a no calculator test before a \u201conly a calculator with X functions\u201d test. I also use the CAS almost every day for complex calculations and integration",
