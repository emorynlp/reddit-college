I\u2019m in no rush to work and quite honestly, I want to prolong it as much as I can.\n\nOriginally, I was planning on getting an MBA, but pretty much all high ranking universities require years of work experience so I wouldn\u2019t be able to go right after undergrad. I was also thinking of doing masters or maybe even going all the way for a phd in econ or financial econ, but I dont know if it makes much sense logically to get a masters in the exact same field as my bachelors. What other programs could I maybe do?\n\nTLDR: I need some advice on what to do after undergrad with a degree in financial economics", "author": "jakk_22", "created": 1632608182, "retrieved": 1632945996, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heahvhk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvgt12/what_should_i_do_after_undergrad/heahvhk/", "text": "Dude the University of Toronto is a very good school first off second off if you want to get an MBA you don\u2019t have to restrict yourself to Canada a lot of American universities while it might be a bit more expensive offer some really good NBA online programs MBA online programs.
