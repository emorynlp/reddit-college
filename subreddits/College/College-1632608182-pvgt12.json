  "text": "I\u2019m currently doing a bs in financial economics at the university of toronto, and although I have loads of time left before I graduate, I have no idea what I should do after I\u2019m done. \n\nI know I want to keep on going to school. I\u2019m in no rush to work and quite honestly, I want to prolong it as much as I can.\n\nOriginally, I was planning on getting an MBA, but pretty much all high ranking universities require years of work experience so I wouldn\u2019t be able to go right after undergrad. I was also thinking of doing masters or maybe even going all the way for a phd in econ or financial econ, but I dont know if it makes much sense logically to get a masters in the exact same field as my bachelors. What other programs could I maybe do?\n\nTLDR: I need some advice on what to do after undergrad with a degree in financial economics",

      "text": "Dude the University of Toronto is a very good school first off second off if you want to get an MBA you don\u2019t have to restrict yourself to Canada a lot of American universities while it might be a bit more expensive offer some really good NBA online programs MBA online programs. Purdue global, I believe Stanford as well as perhaps Northwestern and Ohio State all offer some very reputable online MBA programs So while they might not be Ivy League schools they are very well respected and well you don\u2019t have to have years of work experience to get into the program but it might be advisable to perhaps do an internship or two",

          "text": "Oh yea I was definitely thinking of either a university in the US or the UK, staying in Canada wasn\u2019t even in my plans. I was actually looking at oxford and their masters in economics program, in their requirements it states that I must have a 3.7 gpa minimum from a top global university among other things. I\u2019m not too sure if uoft is considered a top school according to oxford though, since uoft\u2019s ranking in top 20 in the world is pretty much entirely based on their grad programs and research, not undergrad.\n\nBut an internship is a good idea, I will definitely get a few of those before I graduate or do further education, I just don\u2019t  feel like getting an actual career job right after graduation, especially when I don\u2019t even know what I want to do.",
