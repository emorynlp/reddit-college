      "text": "I have a music degree. There are a ton of classes, but some of the specifics will depend on your concentration. Everyone takes lessons and performs in ensembles. Usually you have 4 semesters of music theory and 3 of music history. You often have to choose a secondary instrument to study. Piano is standard. 4 semesters of piano (in addition to your primary instrument) is fairly typical. If you're a vocalist maybe guitar too. Chorus is also required for a few semesters, even if you're an instrumentalist.\n\nIn addition, higher level classes include conducting classes, orchestration and composition classes, more secondary instrument classes if you're a music ed major (as well as education classes if you're a music ed major). That's what I remember off the top of my head, but it's been like 10 years, lol, so my memory's not very fresh. \n\nI was a music ed major but my school also had music therapy, music composition, music performance, jazz studies, etc. I had a blast, honestly-- it was a lot of fun. \n\nIt's a very time consuming major because you're always doing something. My school was even more strict than u/DeepSpaceOG's school in that they wouldn't let *any* non-majors or non-minors take music theory, so even paying for lessons wouldn't be enough for them to allow people who hadn't passed an audition to take the music theory classes. There are many schools that allow anyone to take theory classes, though. My understanding is that fail rates in music theory tend to be high for people who aren't experienced musicians, which is why they try to restrict it to people who can pass the audition. First semester music theory is crazy easy though for anyone with a decent formal background, but backgrounds vary drastically for incoming musicians-- many great musicians have informal backgrounds, which is totally fine, but makes passing theory harder lol.",

      "text": "My friend did some of it. She said it was a lot of taking lessons and being in band/orchestra. But then there were also theory classes, music history classes and what not\n\nIdk about other schools but my school\u2019s music program was tedious, especially for a minor. They actually made you pay for lessons outside of your tuition. $750/semester, but then a heavy discount if your in the major. I thought that was bullshit. Plus, all I wanted to do was take theory, which they don\u2019t allow, til you take the payed lessons. I already studied piano for years so I wrote this off. No music minor for me\n\nShe also expressed dissatisfaction and left. Not a great music program. But hey, I imagine at a music college, they have better classes. Maybe, depending on the quality of your school\u2019s program, you could take courses at a nearby music school",
