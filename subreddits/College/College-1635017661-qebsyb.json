  "text": "Hi everyone. I need some advice. \n\nI'm an honors student in need of advice on which route to go with my life. Previously I wanted to go into nursing. Yesterday I got accepted into nursing school. And I have a week to accept. The problem is, I've realized the issues with nursing these past few months and I'm very worried about the career. Low pay, high stress, high burnout rates, low job satisfaction are all extremely concerning to me and I find myself unsure if I want to pursue this. The other issue is that I have no idea what else I want to do except wanting a high paying stem job. It would be a huge risk to pursue another field, I'm on the older side (25) so I'd like something I can get a good paying job in after graduation. If I do not accept my nursing acceptance letter I will have to study and take the ATI teas all over again if I decide I want to go back, which could take up to a year. I've been thinking about data science but I'm horrible at math (trust me I could barely get through algebra 1101 passing). My GPA is a 3.86 and all I've done so far is nursing prerequisites. I find myself in this horribly stressful dilemma and don't know which direction to go. Advice would be greatly appreciated",

      "text": "It seems like you should just go through with your nursing program. If you\u2019re horrible or not interested in math then there\u2019s no reason you should be in a career that relies heavily on math like data science. As long as you are interested in nursing then you have nothing to be worried about. There are many careers that are nursing-adjacent like a nursing consultant, health service manager, or a non-clinical nursing job.",
