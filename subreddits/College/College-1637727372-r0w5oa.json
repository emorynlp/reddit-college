  "text": "So, I was doing great this semester, my motivation had started to slide a little bit but I had As and I was satisfied, when my grandfather died unexpectedly of COVID. The following week I was diagnosed with mono. I feel like I\u2019ve been hit by a ton of bricks. Two professors know of the death, and one knows of the death and the illness, but I was doing so well I didn\u2019t think I needed to garner any sympathy, now I\u2019m going to need a lot. It feels satirical to have both excuses in my email and I don\u2019t honestly know what to say or ask for. Finals are in 2 weeks and I\u2019m currently bedridden in my hometown. Should I send the obituary and doctors notes? Or wait until asked? I also don\u2019t know how much flexibility there will be but I wanted to reach out because I need help",

      "text": "I would Just make sure they know about everything and ask for some sympathy\u2026 then if they respond asking for doctors note you can send them that. It\u2019s honestly all objective for that part, just depends on what you feel is best. But I hope you get healthy soon and just keep your head up.. life seems to be a little wacky for everyone right now there\u2019s so many weird things happening",

      "text": "I would reach out now and send the documents so there\u2019s less back and fourth with emails. The sooner the better as most profs only have 1-2 weeks (in my experience) to enter in final grades after the end of the semester. \n\nYou could ask for things like a paper extension, alternate project, extra time on exam, whatever you are needing. The worse thing they can do is say no. \n\nSorry to hear about your grandpa, mono sucks too.",
