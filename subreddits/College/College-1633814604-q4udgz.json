  "title:": "My Advice: If you ever feel slow and dumb or are struggling in a class, focus on overcoming the difficulty instead of your intelligence and trust in that process",
  "text": "I mean my dad told me a story about when he was a student. He was in a spatial geometry class and he was the slowest one in the class. Everybody else seems to be much quicker then him. However, he never gave up and tried his best. He eventually overcame all difficulties and become even better at the subject then everybody else. \n\nI have a mental illness that causes me to constantly assess my intelligence and care too much about it, even if their's no evidence that I was struggling in any classes. I always think to the future about some difficult classes coming up and I'm worried I'm going to be the slowest and stupidest one in the class. I always have the tendency to put myself in the shoes of another (such as a mathematician) or to think myself in a certain situation (such as being in a programming class) and then always ending up forming the conclusion that I might be below average or stupid (even if I wasn't struggling in any classes this semester at all). I always think back to the one programming class in which I have to take as a accounting major that I struggled with more than others. I always go to my dad for advice when such thoughts pop up. \n\nMy dad's advice is usually this, and I feel it helped alot. He taught me to focus on the effort, not your innate talent or intelligence. He said for me to be positive and ignore such thoughts and focus on what you're supposed to be doing. I feel that this helped alot. I mean programming is kinda my own fault as I didn't work hard enough to overcome it and focused more on intelligence instead. \n\nMy dad taught me a story of how he's the slowest one at work (I'm not sure if he's making this up or not), he's a engineer. He said everybody is faster then he is at figuring stuff out, however he still didn't feel discouraged or give up (despite not being the sharpest knife in the drawer). Instead he used whatever cards that he's dealt to work hard to figure things out (even if it takes him longer) and asks other's for help when needed. Eventually he ends up performing equally as well or even better then the people that are supposedly smarter and quicker.\n\nThe point of me telling everybody this is that if you ever feel that you're slow and dumb and aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you shouldn't focus to much on the fact that you aren't naturally smart or as quick witted as some other people. Instead you should focus on trying to overcome the difficulty and believe in the fact that if you try hard enough and never give up, everything's eventually going to click. If you struggle with applying what you learned or with logical thinking, do more practice and eventually things would get easier. \n\nRemember their are people with good genes that don't make the best of their abilities simply because they're lazy and that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard. \n\nIf you're naturally smart, then great. But if you aren't, just trust in the process and not give up.",

Just know that you did the best you could do and you gave it your 100%, that the grade you received is representative of what you got. Even if you put in 101% of your effort, there wouldn't even be a difference in how you did. And a 91 is really close to a 96 if you really think about it. A 78 is close to a 90 if you also really want to think about it.\n\nExam scores are a reflection of how you did with the questions you were asked, not what you know completely. I take pride with how much work I put into studying that whatever grade I got, that was an accurate measurement as to how well I did. Even if I wasn't the highest grade in the class, I was convinced that I knew more and worked harder than most people in that room. If I got the lowest grade in the class, I would be upset of course, but I know that I could not have done any better.\n\nIf my professor were to come up to me and ask \"was that the best you could do?\", I wouldn't even take offense to that question. \n\nThat's how I've come to terms with getting these \"low\" grades on exams, but ended up being really happy because it was the best I could do. Clich\u00e9 advice, but you learn to be proud of what others may deem \"not good enough\". As long as you're happy with it and you know you couldn't possibly have done better, than that is a grade well earned. It's not about settling for a lower grade, it's about taking pride in the grade you got.",
