  "text": " The topic of this Assignment is \u201cThe Public Figure That Has Influenced My Life The Most.\u201d  \n\nThe Assignment contains two parts:\n\n1)  A 250-word memoir-style piece in which you outline why this person is so important to you.\u00a0 How have they impacted your life?\u00a0 How are you different/ better off because of them?\u00a0 How did you come across them?\u00a0 And so on.\n\n2)  A four to five-page (double-spaced) research paper in which you identify this person\u2019s greatest achievement. This assignment, then, basically comes with a built-in thesis statement: \u201cX\u2019s greatest achievement was Y.\u201d\u00a0 The essay MUST have five sources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am having trouble even trying to come up with a public figure to talk about let alone to have begun research. Time is ticking by, what do I do? How do I start this? Please help!",

Its really annoying because the professor makes us write about stuff we don\u2019t have the answer to or don\u2019t feel like sharing. So far I have an A in the class by bullshitting my way through half the stuff. Just choose someone even if they haven\u2019t influenced your life at all, but write about them as if they did. Pretty much just lie, don\u2019t overthink it.",

Not sure if this would qualify\u2026\n\nWhen I first read it my mind went to an invention - so for example, I have an iPhone, I could say Steve Jobs influenced my life because of the convenience of communication with my family and the ability to have all of my favorite apps and tools right at my finger tips.  The iPhone has been truly life changing for me, not always in the best ways, but it undeniably has been an important tool in connecting me to the world around me.",

There's even an interesting movie on Netflix made on the experiment, so you could entertain yourself along the way as well.\n\nFamous authors, maybe the author of one of your favorite books (gives you an opportunity to learn more about them and maybe even expand your horizons with that author).\n\nGame developers. Movie directors. The guy that wrote Squid Game would probably be an easy choice, as his story of going from rags to riches is pretty popular at the moment.",

Basically it is a new search engine where you can type things like \"The public figure that has influenced my life the most is\" and it gives you blogs or articles about people writing on the same topic. At least you could have gotten an idea of what to write!\n\nI'm pretty sure you can come up with something easily: what is someone you aspire to become? What would you like to be or do in the future? What is your \"dream\"? I don't see in the assignment above that this influence should be strictly positive.\n\nFor example, how much time do you spend on Facebook? If it is more than 1h per day, that is about 2 months of a full-time job time. In that sense, it seems to me that Zuckerberg influenced your life in a significant way.",

You can talk about how their policies have helped/impacted you/your family.",
