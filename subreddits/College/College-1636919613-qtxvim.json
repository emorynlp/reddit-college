  "text": "When times are tough, when everything seems lost, keep going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou don\u2019t have to change the world; you just have to put one foot in front of the other.\n\nNo one has the power to change the world all on his own, but everyone can make their tomorrow better than today. Even if it just means making your voice heard.\n\nPeople often forget that hope is contagious. If you keep going today, you give others hope, hope that you can turn to one day when you lost yours.\n\nYou do not have to inspire millions, as change is an effect of exponential growth. If you give one person hope, that person will inspire others to do the same.\n\nNot every day can be perfect. Some obstacles will seem impossible to overcome. But each step forward will always result in a better tomorrow, no matter how small they are.\n\nChange is inevitable, it might not be instantaneous, but it comes slowly. If you keep putting that foot in front of the other impossible things will soon come to life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo whatever you do, however lost you may feel, keep going.",
