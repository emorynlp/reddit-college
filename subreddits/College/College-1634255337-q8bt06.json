  "text": "So I have to withdraw for personal reasons, and I haven\u2019t been able to go to the school in a couple of weeks. I told my advisor this and the school is making it a lot more difficult to withdraw. I told them I wouldn\u2019t be able to come to the school to get the paperwork and whatever, so I have to email all of my teachers to get them to let me withdraw. I was wondering what I should do if the teachers aren\u2019t letting me withdraw, even if I haven\u2019t been in their class?",
