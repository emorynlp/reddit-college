I had it fairly nice in the fact I was on a sports team and a few other things. \n\nThe only reason I was there in the first place was to play my sport,  not really interested in the learning part. The stress was getting pretty bad and started to affect my health. That's the main reason for me dropping out. I'm just worried that I made the wrong decision and now I'm not sure what to do. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.", "author": "BigAndy6969", "created": 1632808936, "retrieved": 1632945512, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
