  "text": "My main motivation for college was to have a better life with my ex.. It's also why it took me so long to become a junior.. We were together for 6 years and now I just barely know how to get my shit together. I'm making decent grades, but not the best and they could be better. I'm also not working. My discipline is gone.. the fire that made me care so much about finishing my education..  There's no time for me to work so my money is depreciating, & my courses are extremely demanding right now too. I just want to stop and say fuck it!! But I don't want to be a bum with college debt lmao. Help.\n\nWhat do y'all do when you start to loose motivation?\n\nI literally wrote this yet I have an assignment due at midnight.. :')",

Stick with it, you were meant to do school not be with your ex or the situation would be reversed. This is for you and your future. \n\nKick ass",

The idea of being a college graduate is amazing and I love the school and my path, but motivation is hard to scrape up some days.  Just remember this is your future that you have control of, don't let it slip. It all happens for a reason.. and that kicks my ass back in gear to get it done. \ud83d\ude02",

Gotta see the glass half full.  Every night find 3 good things in your day, anything at all. Focus on those good things before you go to sleep. Stick with it until you finish school. If you're honest I promise it will be easier and you'll feel happier. That should help with wanting to sleep all day... Sounds like the edge of depression.. that's not fun",
