  "text": "Hi guys, I need to write a 1500-2000 word PAD plan for one of my final year modules and I'm slightly confused about what exactly to talk about on it as well as how I should structure it. What type of plans should I speak about and focus on? Assignments? Aspirations? Dissertation? Graduation? Employment? Career goals? Help on this would be greatly appreciated!",
