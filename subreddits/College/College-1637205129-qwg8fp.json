  "text": "At the end of every semester, perfectionist students don't turn in major assignments. \n\nIt's a college course, not a life or death situation. If you really think your work isn't good enough to turn in, turn it in any way. If you don't think you'll get an A or 100%, at least you'll get *something,* and something is far better than nothing in college.\n\nMost of us turn in work we are not satisfied with ALL THE TIME. If you really think you can do better, then do it next time in your next class, but don't stop yourself or make up excuses when you are so close to finishing the classes you have NOW.\n\nWith love,\n\nProfessor Who Sees This All Too Often",

Thank you.",
