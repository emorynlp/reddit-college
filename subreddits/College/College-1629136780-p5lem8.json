For example I\u2019m in a data science club at my school, and while those people are cool, and we talk, outside of data science they don\u2019t talk about anything else or have hobbies/interests like mine so it\u2019s like I can\u2019t be friends with them because there\u2019s simply no commonalities. The other extreme is my hs friends who like to binge drink every weekend. Or another group whose kinda introverted and don\u2019t do much but sit and play video games. It just seems hard to find a solid group of people who share similar interests as me.

I've had to do a group project with two of my classmates, one of which was struggling with dedicating herself to school --seemingly almost the same way that I did, at times she was worse due to traumatic private matters-- and the second one just didn't want to work as a part of the team. That second student brought me to the peak of my depression. It was the 2^(nd) time I've done that course, and I took with these guys another main course.\n\n In my first year, I've felt I was extremely lonely. With my homies it seemed that all ties were cut, due to mismanagement on both sides, and due to all of us being students in different cities --do keep in mind that Israel is a tiny country. I've also barely seen my family and wasn't good at maintaining phone connections with them. \n\nIn addition to all of that I've felt like I've had no one in my class to socialize with. \n\nI have to admit, I was mostly correct, but not totally, in believing that I've had a possibility to properly socialize on my 1st year, all of my classmates (#40 students), didn't seem suitable for *\"one reason or another\",* **so I didn't even try**. Only at the beginning of my second year I've decided to be much less disconnected and to try to build fertile grounds for connections with everyone, considering we were to study 5 years together, I didn't feel a need to rush any relationship. But soon enough I've felt oh so alone, **again**, gradually all hopes were eliminated, and prospect friendships never formed.  \n\nIt was only when I reached the end of my 2^(nd) year that I've discovered a strong friendship with **a** student from my 1st.\n\nThe first-ever (and only) academic study that I've ever read was [Long-Term Health Implications of Students\u2019 Friendship Formation during the Transition to University](http://www.awhillans.com/uploads/1/2/3/5/123580974/klaiber_et_al-2018-applied_psychology_3a_health_and_well-being.pdf). I really recommend it for new & prospective students, the study mentions that a huge chunk of students feel alone, and their perception of their classmates' socialization is skewed. I really recommend anyone who's read this far to not think too much on finding many friends or being a part of any group, but to find themselves academically, to be kind to others, know when to ask for help and how to do so, how to manage to carry their heads above water in this scary scary scenario that is the academy and friendships will form with the proper social intentions and actions. Do not chase, but don't ever give up.\n\nThat being said this is my personal experience, I'm not taking as no expert and I really just hope you would manage to find your best selves to aid you in this journey, this really isn't an easy step to make for many if not most yet it's so empowering once you're past it, I now realize why my dad said \"when you'd go study \\[it doesn't matter what\\] you will find benefit from the experience\" when I was contemplating what to study.", "author": "HebrewDude", "created": 1629220022, "upvotes": 3}, "h9auq4t": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p5lem8/anyone_else_feel_like_they_havent_found_their/h9auq4t/", "text": "It took me about a year or two at college to really find a consistent, close friend group", "author": "BeardedBassist21", "created": 1629214444, "upvotes": 2}, "h9arsa8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p5lem8/anyone_else_feel_like_they_havent_found_their/h9arsa8/", "text": "I\u2019m a senior.

I used to have a lot of friends when I was new to college because I thought that's the most important thing. But as time goes by, a lot of my friends went on to their separate ways. Some took a gap year, others took different classes and few dropped out. \n\nNowadays, I only interact or socialise with people for group projects or studies. I do miss hanging out with a group of friends.", "author": "SnooPickles2204", "created": 1629147476, "upvotes": 18}, "h97dk51": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p5lem8/anyone_else_feel_like_they_havent_found_their/h97dk51/", "text": "I graduated in May and you will not know your people until you have separated yourself from them over several months and years.", "author": "nugsandbug", "created": 1629146652, "upvotes": 3}, "h97d5tk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p5lem8/anyone_else_feel_like_they_havent_found_their/h97d5tk/", "text": "College isn't for making friends or for learning.
