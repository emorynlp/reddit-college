Art classes have very different vibes from standard academic classes and can be a good relaxing, creative break if that\u2019s what you think you need. It can also help fill up necessary credits if you still need some art classes or something similar.

Just wanted to share some my opinion. \n\nBut I believe that you take classes to get better at them. So if you aren\u2019t \u201cvery good\u201d at art yet then your perfect to take the class. They will help you and teach you how to art. \n\nAlso, If you want to take the class (and can afford it) just do it. You don\u2019t need to apply everything you learn into everyday life or profit from it. Self fulfilment is also important.", "author": "skippy5433", "created": 1632088601, "upvotes": 2}}}
