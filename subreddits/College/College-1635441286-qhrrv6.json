Feeling the way you describe- that\u2019s really hard and I don\u2019t think you can find a good answer on Reddit unfortunately. But a good counselor can help. If there are other things at play - money, relationships, grades, maybe there are other campus resources that could be helpful. If you have an advisor maybe they can help you find out what resources to start with. Or maybe try the Dean of Students. If you use the campus counseling center they would know too. I hope you can find some real help and support.",
