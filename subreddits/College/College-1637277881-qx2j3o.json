  "text": "I was severely depressed freshman and most of sophomore year and basically almost flunked out. I also was suspended sophomore year. I did however bring myself up to a weighed 4.0 junior year and the start of my senior year seems to be going great. I did sports all 4 years. I live in NJ and want to stay in state, with my first choice school being Rutgers. Will colleges notice this improvement? And do I still have a chance of getting into Rutgers?",
