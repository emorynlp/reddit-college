I\u2019m struggling to study efficiently, I\u2019ve gotten a few mediocre grades on quizzes, and I\u2019ve already opted for a pass/fail for the first time ever in a class. I don\u2019t feel like myself, I\u2019m usually a good student but for some reason I feel academically crippled right now. What do I do?",
