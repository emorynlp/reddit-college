To start, I like to make categories for each of my classes, then under settings you can create your rules. I have a rule for each class, and all it does is assign the classes' category to emails sent from the professor/ta. It makes searching easier because you can search by category for all emails in one class, and it also makes the inbox easier to look at when all emails automatically are categorized and have their own color with them. You can expand on it to put those emails in their own folder instead of categorizing them but using rules can make it much easier to take control of your inbox.",

It can be based on a variety of things but I mainly use it to target emails sent by a specific person or that contain a specific subject (like those generated by automated messages and always contain the same subject) and either set the rule to delete those emails or move them to a specific folder.\n\nEdit: wanted to add Im not sure if you can use rules on the web version, but if you download outlook for desktop you should be able to create rules.",
