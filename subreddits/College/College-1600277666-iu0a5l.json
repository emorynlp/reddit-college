In other words, every time you read an article, write down in broad terms what the paper is about (ie. irish immigrant women), write down what the author is setting out to do (ie. talk about how domestic work transformed the lives of irish women), and write down what they're arguing (ie. domestic work allowed irish women proximity to wealth and high class, enabling their assimilation to the us). Most academics will make these things pretty clear, but they shouldn't be hard to figure out even if they're writing isn't the most clear. Sometimes, it can be really useful in class discussions to be able to just state or clarify the argument's main points, and once you feel comfortable knowing exactly what they're saying, it's easier to say whether you think they make their points well. \n\nIt can also be super helpful to look in the footnotes or endnotes of secondary sources you read so you can figure out what sources they use. Academics like to make sub points about their work in the footnotes, this can be a great place to mine for ideas, or even bring up things like \"it's interesting how X author seems to use so many newspaper articles.\" \n\nIt's okay if you don't always know how to critique an article or comment on it, there's a lot of good stuff to be added to class discussions by being able to confidently talk about the content you've read, and ask questions about the historiography (the history of the history of whatever you're studying).
