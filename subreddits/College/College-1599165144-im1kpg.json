I left on Monday after exactly three weeks being there, concerned for my safety.\n\nI\u2019m a freshman, and I would not be afraid to admit that my peers are the reason why we were sent home. Covid cases spiked like crazy, and at 200 cases the school announced a 2 week shut down. That\u2019s when I decided to go home for the rest of the semester. Only three days later, -today- the cases are now at almost 400 and we have learned everyone is being sent home for the rest of the semester. \n\nI took two tests and am thankfully negative. Though I cannot assure the same for my peers as I already know a few people from my dorm who were not as lucky.\n\nAny questions?\nAsk away.\n\nEdit: I left Reddit for a few days while moving back home and getting my routine adjusted... just came back to the awards and so so many comments which I\u2019ll try to get to! \nThank you guys for all the love!
