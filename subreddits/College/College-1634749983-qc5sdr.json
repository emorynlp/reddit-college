  "text": "Is it just me or is anyone else\u2019s campus infested with preachers? I can\u2019t enjoy my walk to my next class without a bible shoved in my face. I can\u2019t enjoy lunch outside without loud megaphones shouting about abortion. These grown men/women really have nothing better to do in their days? I\u2019m all for freedom of religion/speech, but why on campus? From what I observe, the majority of students are bothered and uninterested.",

I witnessed an unsolicited preacher escorted off my campus in the US once.\n  \n  However, technically **anyone** is allowed on state and public school grounds (just not necessarily in the buildings) as long as they are not violating any laws.",

I\u2019ve seen a handful of them at different campuses. All of them are scrum.\n\nBtw nothing against anyone\u2019s religion. I\u2019m opposed to these individual assholes, not christianity as a whole.",

Limiting the time and place means it is not really free speech. You cannot have free speech while imposing a hundred caveats, conditions, and expectations.\n\nHonestly it is disconcerting to see just how many students don't understand why preachers can preach on a campus or what the consequences of restricting that would be. If you fight to remove this person, someone else is going to use that framework you established to remove a refugee activist or sex-ed educator.",

You'll see in both respective countries they are now *fearful* to impose speech limitations against anyone because of their grandparent's stories.\n\nCall it what you want, but silence one person and you open the doors to silence any minority. Advocating against this person's right to speak is just as bad as him being an ass to students.\n\nAlso OP's choice of title makes it clear, to me at least, the topic is about their ability (i.e. free speech).
