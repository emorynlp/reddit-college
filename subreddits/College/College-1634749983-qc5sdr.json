  "text": "Is it just me or is anyone else\u2019s campus infested with preachers? I can\u2019t enjoy my walk to my next class without a bible shoved in my face. I can\u2019t enjoy lunch outside without loud megaphones shouting about abortion. These grown men/women really have nothing better to do in their days? I\u2019m all for freedom of religion/speech, but why on campus? From what I observe, the majority of students are bothered and uninterested.",
