  "title:": "I want to be an engineer but I have no idea what kind\u2014or what kinds there are. It\u2019s also discouraged by my mom.",
  "text": "I\u2019m a junior in high school (homeschool) and I\u2019m taking dual enrollment in a community college. Now the time shall soon come when my parents will want to know what classes I wanna take and ask what I wanna be once I graduate hs (pretty routine every year). I told my mom last year that I want to be an engineer. She responded with some of the most sexist shit she\u2019s ever said lmao. \n\nMy mom said I won\u2019t get promotions, let alone get hired in the first place because I\u2019m a woman. And women and engineering won\u2019t go together. I had a brief period a few years back where I wanted to be a pharmacist just bc I want money and she kept saying I should be that. We had an argument over it and I just told her it\u2019s my life and I\u2019m not letting some idea of prejudice from her stop me. We\u2019re chill now but I still don\u2019t think she agrees with my current choice.\n\nNow, I searched Google for types of engineers but I couldn\u2019t find anything (maybe I\u2019m just searching wrong lol) so any advice from yall would be amazing. I might also cross post since this is the college subreddit and idk if my question is valid here loll.\n\nI also have a grandpa who was an engineer back in the day and he said I should 100% do it. He told me to research types of engineers myself and come back and talk to him. He also said that when he was still working, there were plenty of female engineers and he tried his best to treat everyone equally. He said my gender wouldn\u2019t have been a hindrance then, and as it\u2019s 2021 lol, it definitely won\u2019t be a hindrance now. He did say there were some sexist people in the industry but they\u2019re not the majority, and I\u2019ll do great \u201csince i\u2019m smart\u201d. Mans made my confidence in my choice go \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc8.\n\nAnyways, any help with what kinds of engineering there be and what to research for college (which, sry if these are stupid questions I don\u2019t know anything abt college lol am 16) would be greatly appreciated\u2014and any subreddits I should cross post in. Thanks\ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, OP here loll. I just wanted to say thank you all so much for all the advice and help! Y\u2019all are great and very helpful :))\n\nJust wanted to also add that my mom is an immigrant from where ig things were/are more sexist in her home country. Her mom was en engineer tho so idk what she on lmaoo. Anywaysss my parents wouldn\u2019t ever block me from becoming an engineer (dad\u2019s all for it\ud83d\ude42), my moms just convinced I\u2019ll fail. Maybe she\u2019ll turn around someday lolol. Overall she\u2019s great though\ud83d\ude42\n\nI\u2019m pretty much set on being an engineer and I\u2019ll be researching all of your guys\u2019 advice (wrote a lot of stuff down loll). Thanks again!!!",

      "text": "your mom saying women in engineering won\u2019t do well is so wrong. im on a scholarship right now for engineering that is paying most of my tuition because i qualified as a female (underrepresented minority) with good academic standing and extracurriculars. sometimes you get even better opportunities as a woman in a male dominated field because employers and universities are looking for diversity from promising students. \n\nwith that being said, i absolutely love it. im on the chemical engineering track and i want to work in pharmaceuticals when im graduated. it\u2019s definitely not an easy major, but i do enjoy it, and as someone else already said, i joined the SWE club (society of women engineers) and the networking and opportunities in it are endless. \n\nif you\u2019re trying to figure out what type of engineer you want to be but aren\u2019t sure, don\u2019t worry. a lot of universities don\u2019t make you declare your specific engineering type until the second year cuz the first year is all general engineering courses like chem, physics, math, engineering seminar, etc (at least at my college). we are ABET accredited so its a specific path that engineering students follow.\n\ni applied as a BioE and decided i wanted to switch to ChemE so that\u2019s the nice thing about not having to declare in your first year. if you want the most \u201cjack of all trades\u201d engineering degree, MechE would be the way to go and then after you gain more exposure and take your intro classes, you can decide what is the best fit for you! i\u2019d definitely look into which schools let you declare later and also try to eliminate engineering types that you definitely don\u2019t want. good luck! let me know if you have any more questions",

There are *very* few women in my classes though (usually a max of 5 per class). Realistically speaking, the only thing that may hold you back from promotions and such is having kids. It just brings a massive blow to your perceived and actual reliability, mainly with young kids. I'm personally not having any (cats FTW), but I've already seen what's going on with one of my mentors who just left on maternity leave. Some people are hoping she doesn't come back so they can get her job.\n\nAll things considered, I say it's worth it. Whatever you do, avoid staying in an automotive quality department for too long.

Although I have no regrets in choosing math instead (fate was kind to me!), I encourage women to look into engineering. A huge component of engineering is design. You're designing things to solve problems. There's a lot of different types, like civil engineering which involves designing civil structures like roads and bridges. Within civil engineering is structural engineering, which is more about buildings. And then there's stuff like mechanical and aerospace engineering. Aerospace is designing stuff like planes or rockets. My partner graduated with his degree in aerospace. Engineering is difficult but very important and the field needs women. Women can succeed in it. There's still sexism and stuff, but it's a lot better than when your mom was likely young. If you like engineering, stick with it! Don't let anyone discourage you from the things you love. If it turns out you like other things better like math or physics, it should be you who discovers it and makes the choice, not anyone else.",

      "text": "I don't have any input on the engineering stuff but check out r/pharmacy if you want to know the downsides of becoming a pharmacist. Overworked, understaffed, and undervalued retail pharmacists (which is what most pharmacists end up as) very often hate their jobs. Salary growth has diminished over the past decade, and you will be competing with other graduates for these jobs given that the market has become oversaturated.\n\n\nThe number of pharmacists graduating every year has risen [relatively consistently](https://www.ajpe.org/content/84/7/ajpe8207/tab-figures-data), and \"employment of pharmacists [is projected](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/pharmacists.htm#tab-6) to decline 2 percent from 2020 to 2030.\" The same BLS article goes on to state that \"demand is projected to increase for pharmacists in some healthcare settings, including hospitals and clinics.\" Which is great, but [seeing as how](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291051.htm) retail pharmacies employ 14% of the labor force and hospitals only 1.41%, we can see the reason for the overall projected contraction of the job market despite the possibility of a few more hospital jobs opening up.\n\nSo if you do, for whatever reason, end up going to pharmacy school, you'll be competing for what would probably be a pretty lousy job. I'm not a pharmacist, but I was a tech, and my anecdotal evidence for how much retail pharmacists don't like their jobs comes from working with 7 pharmacists at 4 different three-letter stores, all of whom didn't like their jobs. They didn't like them because the company cut their tech hours, they knew that if they took their breaks they'd be depriving the pharmacy of the single pharmacist on duty so they oftentimes didn't, immunizations messed up workflow, dealing with patients throwing fits about their insurance/DEA regulations/whatever gets old, making patient care calls (cold-calling patients asking them if they need refills or want script-sync or how their medication is impacting them or whatever) that interrupt the workflow gets old, calling doctors' offices to clarify prescriptions because some doctors can't take 10 extra seconds to write legibly gets old, calling doctors because they wrote something wrong, only to have them get snarky with you, gets old, and so on. If you become a pharmacist you will hold a PharmD degree, and will be a medication expert, but at least in retail people like me (techs) will, as the BLS [puts it](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/pharmacists.htm#tab-6), \"increasingly perform tasks previously done by pharmacists, such as collecting patient information, preparing some types of medications, and verifying the work of other technicians.\" Technician creep is a thing.\n\n\nThis is not to say that being a retail pharmacist is unrewarding. They are probably the most approachable healthcare provider, and they develop rapport with many of their patients. They put their knowledge to use when they verify prescriptions, and catching an error can be fulfilling. But the companies don't really care about anything but their bottom line, which makes sense I guess, and it makes for a work environment in which the stressful moments outweigh the nice ones. Filling 300+ scripts when you're short staffed sucks. Technicians have the option to quit, and they do, often once they've finally gotten the hang of the job, but the pharmacists, who are tied down by debt, can't. I can't speak to engineering, but I felt the need to further dissuade you from going into pharmacy.",

My mom is an engineer and one of my previous bosses was a woman engineer (that company had a lot of women in the engineering department).  I'd agree with your grandpa saying that there are definitely some sexist people, but being a woman won't hurt you the same way it would have 40-50 years ago.\n\nAs far as what kinds there are:\n\n1.  Nuclear Engineering:  Will likely have you working on a nuclear reactor.  My grandpa was this for the Navy.\n\n2.  Systems Engineering:  Studies logistics and the way things are organized.  This is what both of my parents do.  My mom analyses flight patterns to try and streamline air traffic control for the FAA and my dad does safety parameters for UAVs.  Previously he consulted for the FAA and the DOD, but now he is with NASA.\n\n3.  Software Engineering:  A programmer who specifically takes an engineering approach to designing their programs.  This is what my brother does.\n\n4.  Civil Engineer:  Designs bridges, tunnels, dams, stormwater systems, buildings, roads, and other related infrastructure.  This is the main type of engineer my old company had and was the type of engineer my boss was.  In the case of my company, we designed stream restoration and similar projects to reduce erosion.  I wasn't an engineer myself, but would be an onsite quality control inspector and sometimes called a \"Field Engineer\".\n\n5.  Environmental Engineer:  Another type of engineer my old company had.  They came at the stream restoration from a more biological than structural angle.  The field will also do other sorts of environmental design including site cleanup, recycling, pollution control, etc.\n\n6.  Mechanical Engineer:  They design machines.  Usually focusing more on the structural end than anything else.  A lot of people who get into robotics study this.  A friend of mine is this kind of engineer and he works for UPS maintaining their package sorting equipment and sometimes the vehicles.  \n\n7.  Chemical Engineer:  These are often the people who end up doing the research side of the medical field creating new medicines.  They also sometimes end up in other industries designing things like cleaning chemicals, pesticides, or any other sort of chemical used by anyone.  This has a solid connection to your previous interest in pharmacy, but would have you on the design side.\n\n8.  Petroleum Engineer: Specialized in the extraction and refining of oil products.  It's a narrow range of specialization, but it's also often the highest paid of any engineer.\n\nThere's of course many more.  Engineering can get very specialized.  [This is a decent list of the types](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/stem/types-of-engineering), but it isn't comprehensive.  You name an industry, and there is probably an engineer somewhere designing things for that industry.",

Google first principle thinking on YouTube by Elon Musk and you will understand a bit more on what I mean.\n\n3) Computer Science and Physics. This is the route I chose.

I can\u2019t imagine any other point of my life being more stressful than it is now. But as a woman I have never ever had anyone say anything sexist to me. I don\u2019t even have a funny sexist story to complain about.",

      "text": "I'm a mechanical engineering major and two of my lab partners are women. The field is more saturated by men, but none of that matters because the material is universally challenging. Some universities have special programs for women in STEM; my university has the Woman In Science & Engineering (WISE) program and from what I've heard from my female peers, they're supportive and offer additional resources - makes me a little envious.\n\nIf you're interested in multiple types of engineering, I highly suggest mechanical engineering. We dip our toes in a lot of other engineering and STEM fields. Engineers collaborate on to build machines, and all of that gets put together by a mechanical engineer. It's mainly because it's our job to design and assemble things so it all fits. We learn a lot of electrical engineering, some civil engineering so our things don't collapse, and computer science sometimes (coding too). Of course, it's hard because there's a lot, but you can do well if you keep the grind going. As long as there's a need for machines, there will be mechanical engineers to design and build them.",

If I were you I wouldn\u2019t so much think about what kind of engineer you would want to be but what type of thing you would want to work on. For me I wanted to work on rockets and satellites and space stuff so I did aerospace. And either way you have to remember that what you do as a job won\u2019t be like what you do in school. As long as your doing good in math and science you can probably do it.",
