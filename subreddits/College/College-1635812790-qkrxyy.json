  "text": "Tl;dr: I want to go to a college i genuenly woulrd work to get into but my parents want me to stay close to home and i dont want to stay here. \n\nOkay so im at that point in life where im looking for what colleges i want to go to. My parents want me to stay in state and close to home but i want to go out of state and explore the world. I have a few friends in another state and theirs a college in their state im interested in. Difference between the schools i want to go to is more expencive and farther from home (omly 9 hours) and the one home is cheaper. \n\nThe one i want to go to i fell in love with, they had everything i wanted and more than i could think of. The one here didnt catch my eye like the other did. The one in another state i feel like sometjing is drawing me to. Does that make sence? \n\nI just want random internet strangers in college to give some advise on this because im someone who hates school but id be willing to put effort into this school.",

After that, I\u2019m sure everything else will fall into place. Communication is key. Especially if they\u2019re the ones who might be paying some of or all of ur tuition.",
