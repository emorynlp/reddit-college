  "text": "Lectures go in one ear and out the other. I can\u2019t make sense of anything with a few solid examples where the professor works through it (not just slapping an example in a slide from start to finish) \n\nReally sucks for lecture heavy, example sparse courses",

      "text": "It depends on the type of class & how the slides are constructed.\n\nIf the slide\u2019s a wall of words: Read them on your own before/after the meeting. During the meeting write down key words & summarize the main points w/ your own phrases. Review both w/in 24hrs.\n\nIf it\u2019s formula &/or diagram: Record the steps & draw your own diagrams. After the meeting try to summarize the gist of the lecture or do the problems with your notes. Refer to your text when you get stuck. If you can\u2019t get unstuck go to office hours.",
