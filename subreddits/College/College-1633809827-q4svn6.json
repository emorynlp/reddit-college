  "text": "I\u2019m honestly just over it. Im working 60-70 hours a week and in school part time. Im majoring in computer software engineering. I honestly never had any interest in computers or engineering. I just have an interest in not being broke after graduation. What id really want to do is open up an animal sanctuary raise kids or talk about politics all day haha. However I don\u2019t believe I can make enough to live above the poverty line with just a bachelors in any field I just listed above. I know so many college grads who don\u2019t have jobs (or work minimum wage ones), and I\u2019m just losing hope for everything. How do you guys stay motivated and do you think it\u2019s worth it to work in a field I\u2019m apathetic towards to make ends meet?  If not how do you manage financially? (Most people I know who didn\u2019t get a job outside of college live with their parents).",

It is also no good doing something you enjoy but being broke.\n\nIf your idea was to just make money you went in with the wrong motivation. Change your major and try again.",
