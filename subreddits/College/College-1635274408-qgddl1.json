  "text": "Hey guys, this is a fairly weird question. Right now I am in a bit of a weird situation. I'm not doing well in a class, and when I looked at the prerequisites for this class I realized that I did not have the proper credit hours going into this class for it. Because of this, I was wondering if I could get the class removed from my record due to me not having the proper credit hours.",
