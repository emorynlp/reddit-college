  "text": "Im working on my associates in business and don\u2019t want to go right into a bachelors when I\u2019m done at cc. My school has two different options, business administration and ba transfer. Transfer is for students looking to go to a 4 year school directly after the associates. \n\n\nI plan on getting a job in HR, working for a couple years to gain experience to see what I really want to do, then completing my business bachelors with a concentration in what I actually know I want to do. \n\n\nWill I have difficulty transferring/starting a four year program without taking this \u201ctransfer\u201d route?",
