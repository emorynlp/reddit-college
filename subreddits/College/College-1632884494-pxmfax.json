Try to read for meaning rather than getting too caught up specific words (or maths when it's that type of article) ... but\n2. Also make a vocab list of the words you don't know so you can expand this and make it easier to read future articles. \n3. Form a journal club with classmates. Read together and try to explain the meaning of the articles to each other.\n4. Write notes where you try to explain each section in simple terms.", "author": "DrLyndonWalker", "created": 1632889594, "upvotes": 3}}}
