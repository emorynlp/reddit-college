  "text": "I'm in a class that is mostly reading and I just can't understand them. They're like 20-30 pages long, the sentences are too wordy and there's many words I don't know the meanings of. It just sounds like a bunch of nonsense to me. I could just look up the words I don't understand but that would be time consuming and I already have so much homework. How do I do this? This is literally a beginners class, why would the professor assign this...?",

      "text": "A few tips:\n\n1. Try to read for meaning rather than getting too caught up specific words (or maths when it's that type of article) ... but\n2. Also make a vocab list of the words you don't know so you can expand this and make it easier to read future articles. \n3. Form a journal club with classmates. Read together and try to explain the meaning of the articles to each other.\n4. Write notes where you try to explain each section in simple terms.",
