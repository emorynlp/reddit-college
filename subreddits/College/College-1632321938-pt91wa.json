  "text": "im getting a dual degree rn in forensic chem and bio cuz i want to be a forensic pathologist (medical examiner). this is really good for me because a lot of the required classes overlap so it\u2019s not too much of a work load. i was thinking of tossing in an anthropology minor with a concentration in biological anthropology or going pre-med. should i get the minor or just add in some anthropology classes? should i do pre-med? or am i biting off more than i can chew?",

      "text": "What will the anthropology major add to your current degrees and future job. You can definitely do it if you just enjoy it, but it might add a lot more work than you would enjoy. If you're going pre-med it doesn't matter, but you want to make sure at the very least your prereqs are in good shape. Many would rather see a student who only took one major and did amazing in prereqs then a student who did 2 or 3 and did ok or bad in their prereqs. You also want to make sure you're not spreading yourself too thin with school and it makes it hard to do anything else. Minors at my school aren't bad, but it depends on how many classes you have to add.\n\nedit: My friend is doing 2 majors and 2 minors and he's doing fine. Granted he also maxed out his credits every year, but he likes it. He also has an outside life that doesn't involve school.",
