The actual content the professor lectures in the classes is a week behind the homework we do that week. I feel like if my attendance didn\u2019t affect my grade for said classes, then I probably wouldn\u2019t attend them at all unless I was truly stuck on a subject. I\u2019m pretty much learning everything on the textbook and online resources to complete the homework, then the professor pretty much re-teaches it the following the week. Is this normal? This is my second semester of college and 2 of 4 of my classes are like this.", "author": "poopy-butt-boy", "created": 1632411883, "retrieved": 1632800757, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdz9xe3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pty0x1/is_the_actual_class_being_behind_the_homework/hdz9xe3/", "text": "Professor here. Unfortunately, yes, this is normal. Most professor's structure their class to have you read and do homework ahead of the lectures so that you already have background knowledge in the subject before discussing it. When you get into class, that is where you should be discussing this content and building on what you already learned in the reading or asking questions for clarification on what you didn't understand or didn't learn. Unfortunately, this isn't always applied in the best way, or for some learners who are better at learning on their own it can feel like repetition. You can try coming up with questions about the material, how it extends to other things you know, or questions clarifying things you don't understand quite well enough and bring those to class. That might help you get more out of those repetitive lectures.", "author": "thehelpfulprof", "created": 1632413740, "upvotes": 5}}}
