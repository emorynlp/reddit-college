  "title:": "No desire for school",
  "text": "So I graduated from high school in 2020 took a gap year and just worked to save up money. My freshman year of high school I didn\u2019t really have friends due to coming from a small middle school and not really wanting to associate with them anymore. This definitely affected my relationship with school I didn\u2019t enjoy going because I didn\u2019t have any reason to want to go. Sophomore year I found my best friend and also a friend group to party and hangout with on the weekends. And school became something I wanted to do. Since everyone has gone off to college I\u2019ve just been down and I started at community college this year to get some gen Ed\u2019s out of the way, before hopefully attending and actually state school next year. I have no desire to do well in classes. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is I want to hear other peoples stories and how they overcame the lack of interest in school.\n\nThanks.",

Take some ED\u2019s, work\u2026. maybe your work leads you to a career and then that motivates you to get a particular degree?\n\nThat\u2019s why i ask, maybe life (experiences) , job gives you the focus you need.\n\nCollege will always be there if your truly want / need that degree.\n\nrandom thought: \nand/or get an extremely arduous job (granted, respect those who do it) but then that could also be motivation for not wanting to do that kind of  hard labor\u2026.",
