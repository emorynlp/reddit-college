  "title:": "Girlfriend just barely failed a class final; class condition caused failed class (TLDR @ bottom).",
  "text": "As the title says, my gf failed a written final exam; but just barely. The class condition is she has to pass the final (though her final grade would be a 78% if that wasn\u2019t the condition). I feel really bad for her cause this program is something she\u2019s waited years for (waiting list) getting into and she\u2019s gonna have issues with her second term cause this one class. \n\nI wanna send a message to her professor and ask them about any grace/leeway he could have but I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll make her look bad or may be considered unprofessional. I\u2019ve always been professional and charismatic so I\u2019m certain I could get to this professor and have him come up with some options for her that won\u2019t jeopardize her from moving on. But like I said I\u2019m concerned about how it\u2019d look on her, considering this is her battle with her class and her professor doesn\u2019t know me.\n\nWhat do you think redditors?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend failed class and I wanna talk to her teacher about accommodations for her, is it a bad idea?",

It basically make her and you look bad and like someone in the comments said it's essentially a FERPA violation so don't even expect an answer.\n\nAlso it's not like she didn't know the importance of the exam. It seems like that is a day one syllabus review item so the ability for grace/leeway is probably zero (I've had that experience with several classes and it was very clear from the professor point of view.)",

But the problem is when it comes to a final, it\u2019s too late to be asking the professor what can be done. If there were struggles, she has to reach out early not at the end. If there was something unfair or unpredictable about the exam then the profs advice is the best one honestly and she needs to take it to the head of the program. Its likely not even within his power once final grades are submitted. I am sure she is great and she will do well, and one set back wont change that. If she has to retake it, its an opportunity to come in prepared and fill in the gaps and ace the final. Just be there for her like you\u2019re doing (:",
