The class condition is she has to pass the final (though her final grade would be a 78% if that wasn\u2019t the condition). I feel really bad for her cause this program is something she\u2019s waited years for (waiting list) getting into and she\u2019s gonna have issues with her second term cause this one class. \n\nI wanna send a message to her professor and ask them about any grace/leeway he could have but I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll make her look bad or may be considered unprofessional. I\u2019ve always been professional and charismatic so I\u2019m certain I could get to this professor and have him come up with some options for her that won\u2019t jeopardize her from moving on. But like I said I\u2019m concerned about how it\u2019d look on her, considering this is her battle with her class and her professor doesn\u2019t know me.\n\nWhat do you think redditors?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend failed class and I wanna talk to her teacher about accommodations for her, is it a bad idea?", "author": "vinni8989", "created": 1632442709, "retrieved": 1632946143, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "comments": {"he1guph": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu8a5x/girlfriend_just_barely_failed_a_class_final_class/he1guph/", "text": "Professors do not like it when the students themselves come groveling for a grade change.
