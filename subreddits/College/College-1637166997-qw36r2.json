  "text": "These past couple weeks have been a drag. I have found no motivation to do anything. I'm missing a few assignments and a lab. My professors have noticed my lack of involvement in the class and reached out to me. Even with them reaching out I feel motivated for 20 minutes with the idea of turning in what's missing with no punishment on the grade but then I fall in my dark hole again. I'm not sure if its the weather or it gets pitch-black outside at 5:30 PM. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do have a job but that's 20-28 hours a week. I'm just not really sure why as to I feel very demotivated or what has happened. Any ideas that can help to push through this last couple weeks before the semester ends?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Got rid of the spoiler. Made it look cleaner I guess.\n\n&#x200B;",
