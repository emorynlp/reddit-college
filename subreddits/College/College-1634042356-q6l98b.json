  "text": "i don\u2019t think i have slept over 4-5 hours since college has started. i have a class at 1pm and normally i\u2019d be sleep until like 12:30 and other days i have a class at like 11am and i\u2019d be sleep until 10:30. like you get the point. she has early classes at like 7-8am which i know she can\u2019t help but her fucking alarm goes off every 15 minutes because she doesn\u2019t get it up to it and it CONSTANTLY wakes me up. i go bed kinda early too but with her the lights don\u2019t go off until 1am. she never leaves the room either, i mean ever, like ever, she is ALWAYS at the room so i can never take a nap either. like she is always loud/leaves the lights on/etc. ive basically conditioned myself into leaving the room the moments she wakes me up somehow until like 9pm-10pm when everything on campus is closing/when my friends go back to their dorm so i don\u2019t have to see her. she basically thinks this is just her room at this point and like today i have a conference call and i asked her nicely if i could have the dorm while i was doing it and she\u2019s like \u201cgo to the study room\u201d like WHAT??? you\u2019re ALWAYS in here??? like i honestly can\u2019t wait until break so i can go home and sleep for 14 hours and just be left alone. like this is just a little bit of what she does but she\u2019s low key entitled i can\u2019t stand it. i\u2019ve tried bringing it up i just don\u2019t even know what todo atp i\u2019m definitely switching rooms next semester just how can u be so inconsiderate bye. thanksgiving break cannot come fast enough",
