  "title:": "Will it look bad to employers if I take too many online courses at my college?",
  "text": "Not exactly sure what happened with Spring Semester at my college but the course selection for Comp Sci students is awful. Three sections at most for each of our core classes we're supposed to take, only the English course has regular amount of sections. I'm in a community college btw so this isn't that surprising but still a bit odd.\n\nAnyways, not even sure if this is gonna be an issue for me since I may be switching majors to English soon. But if I continue with Computer Science, will taking too many online courses look bad to any universities I apply to transfer to? Or internships? I'm not doing it out of \"easiness\", it's cause with work and the limited selections I really have no other choice. At most I'll be able to get one in-person course in, my English course. Ty for any help.",
