      "text": "Both will land you a job since both fields are in need. CS is harder in my opinion but I could be biased since I'm a CSajor myself. I'm terrible with math and accounting I think you only need calc 1?\n\nAccounting is my backup if CS doesn't work out. Plus you get certified while pursuing your degree and you get to work in an accounting firm. The downside is all the state and federal laws you'll have to learn and anything else the field requires. A buddy of mine got an accounting degree and became an auditor and is making 200k a year after working his way up in the company. And another one became a cpa and after a few years started his own firm and makes a good deal of money as well. \n\nMedicine, Food, Money and Tech are fields you'll have a guaranteed job in almost any country in the world. And since we can't live without them then that comes with job security and demand.",

Accounting requires 4 tests AFTER college undergrad to get a CPA license and they\u2019re generally considered harder than the bar. Also you have to take them and pass all 4 within like an 18 month time window I believe. \n\nCS has a lot more paths and a lot more choices in my opinion",

      "text": "Both are able to land you a job, but however accounting would be easier to rather than CS.\n\nCS is a growing field, with tons of jobs and great pay. However, a CS degree doesn't ultimately by itself give you a job right out of college. You have to do self-made projects, internships, and pass the coding interviews. You gotta make yourself look like you do know what you are doing, since you'll be competing with other people. A CS degree teaches you the theoretical side of how computers work, but it's not as practical as Accounting\n\nAn Accounting degree on the other hand is different. Internships are a plus, but however you can get a job fairly quickly after graduation, as there are many, many jobs in the field. They don't pay as much as CS degrees do, but the pay is still really good. Now you can go the extra mile and be a CPA (Certified Public Accountant), but the exams will be very difficult. There are 4 in total, but you can get a pay increase if you even pass one of the tests. Passing all 4 will make you a CPA and you'll make like 200k+ a year. \n\nIf you still don't know, meet the middle ground and go for a Computer Information Systems degree. It's a combination of Business and CS, and it's known by some people as the \"Jack of all Trades\" because you can get a job in both fields (Business and Technology). Pay is good, job prospects are good because you can get a job in business or a job in Technology. However, there are different names for this degree (Management Information Systems, Computer Information Systems, Information Systems) but they all have the same focus.\n\nManagement Information Systems (MIS) is more focused on the business side of things\n\nComputer Information Systems (CIS) is more focused on the computer side of things\n\nInformation Systems (IS) same as CIS, or even a equal amount of the 2. \n\nHere's a video for Accounting:\nhttps://youtu.be/06DH-8QM6D0\n\nHere's a video for CS:\nhttps://youtu.be/c-41IY0bOGU\n\nHere's a video for MIS/CIS:\nhttps://youtu.be/EMGvP6hav_U\n\nHope this helps! And if you have anymore questions, don't be afraid to ask!",
