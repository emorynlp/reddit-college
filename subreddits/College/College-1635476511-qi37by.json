  "text": "It makes me feel so good to talk shit about crappy professors. Honestly if you can\u2019t do your job right how tf is a student supposed to succeed? This is probably the worst way to cope with it but it\u2019s the only way for me. I don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t fire bad professors. Like if a student acts up they get expelled or if they don\u2019t do well in a class they fail. Why can\u2019t it be the same with incompetent professors?",

He just assigns work without meeting with us or explaining clearly what we should do. He meets with us after we have done a first draft and says that what we did is wrong so we should redo all of it or parts of the essay. We are supposed to meet for 2 hours per week and he doesn't meet with us because he doesn't want to. He doesn't even have office hours. I hope they fire him.",
