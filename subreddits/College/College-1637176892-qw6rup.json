  "text": "Hi guys! I was curious if any of you have thoughts on this. I have severe anxiety that, last semester, forced me to drop my classes and switch to online learning. \n\nI'm now going into the spring semester with hopefully one in person class and the rest online. I'm having a lot of anxiety about going in person. Thankfully I have a therapist who's willing to vouch for my need for accommodations, but I'm questioning whether or not it will actually be helpful.\n\nHas anyone been through this, or has successfully used this type of service? I can't decide if it's worth the effort and, I'm assuming, the decent amount of paperwork. I'd appreciate if someone shared their opinion or their experience. Thank you!",

      "text": "Do you have an officially diagnosed with any anxiety disorders?  Because you need to have a diagnosed with something to be enabled for accommodations.\n\nI have dyslexia and Speech disorder. All that I remember when I requested accommodation is that submit paperswork that I officially have those disabilities.  I believe if you have recent paperwork of your disabilities and disorders, you should have no trouble in receiving accommodations.\n\nEver since Covid 19. I have not requested accommodations because all of my issues were in person and all of my professors so far have be super giving in their how much time everybody's gets. \n\nUltimately it's up to you if you want to get accommodations. I would say if you can legitimately get them.  just get them",

      "text": "You should absolutely register with the accommodations office and also find out what you can and can\u2019t get as an accommodation.\n\nFor example, if some classes are not given online, you wont be able to do them online.  If in person proctoring is required, you will have to do that. If you have presentations or participation of people require cameras on, you may not be able to get out of those either",
