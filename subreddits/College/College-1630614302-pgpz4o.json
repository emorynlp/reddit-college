  "text": "Since a young age my parents basically forced me into the medical path. Because my dad is a doctor and my mom is a nurse. Now everyone in my family is pressuring me to be a doctor especially bc my two sisters aren\u2019t gonna be doctors. They want me to \u201ccontinue the path my father left off.\u201d Because he has passed.\n\nNow as a sophomore I\u2019m stuck in a science major that I fucking hate (Biology). I really don\u2019t like science and I was never really good at it. I currently have a 3.5 GPA and want to transfer to a business-related major like accounting or finance because those are the only few subjects that actually interest me. However of course this requires an internal transfer which at my school you usually have to have a pretty high GPA like 3.8. Obviously my GPA isn\u2019t high enough now so I\u2019m not gonna apply at this instant. Now I have to battle through more dreadful science classes. I fucking hate science man. I don\u2019t want to be a fucking doctor but no one care about what I like. They all just want me to be like my dad. I can\u2019t deal with this shit another semester. And I don\u2019t want to wait until 30 until I can get an official job.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m trapped. If I can\u2019t get my GPA I\u2019ll be fucked and will probably never get into the business school and get a job. All while taking the most difficult shit ever\n\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do now, just battle it out? Fuck.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m terrified\n\nEDIT: To clarify: you need at least a 3.25 to APPLY to my business school but most admitted students entered with around a 3.8",

      "text": "I completely understand how you feel since I\u2019ve been through a similar experience too with my parents. At the end I realized that my parents and the people around me can\u2019t choose my life. My parents can\u2019t live through me. I can\u2019t be miserable for the rest of my life because my parents want me to do what they want me to just so they can \u201ccontinue a legacy\u201d. I\u2019m telling you right now that it\u2019s just not worth it. You will be miserable for the rest of your life if you push through doing something you hate. Being a doctor isn\u2019t everything. You don\u2019t need to be like your parents, you are your own person with your own dreams. Most importantly this is YOUR life not your parents. \n\nMy advice is to switch into a business/accounting major now no matter what your parents say. To be able to get a 3.5 gpa in a major that you hate is actually quite impressive so I have no doubt that you\u2019ll do even better in accounting. And try your best to finish all course requirements for that major. Take an extra year if you have to. And then apply to business school. Or another option is to just finish this degree, graduate, and then apply for a post-bacc program to finish any pre requisites for business school and then apply afterwards. So many students have switched majors, careers, halfway through or even by the end of their college career. It\u2019s not that uncommon. And your life is not ruined at all, you have your whole life ahead of you. You\u2019re only in your second year at college.",

Essentially, you\u2019re going to fulfill your desired major\u2019s requirements whilst not taking your current majors class pathway. Do this for a semester or however long it takes you to get that average up to a 3.8. Once you do, officially switch majors and voila. You have successfully switched majors whilst being minimally behind in that majors course requirements and can hopefully graduate on time.",

These majors are flexible and  allow students to study or combine multiple disciplines. Each university has a different set up. It could be three minors, one minor, two areas of focus, etc.\n\nYou could look into this to utilize your existing credits. Perhaps look at a minor in Biology (if it's done) and picking up a business related minor or classes. Incorporate some high impact practices, like an internship for academic credit to get some experience.\n\nIf you stick with biology, there are many business related careers out there that require A degree, not a specific degree.\n\nDM if you have questions.",

It is vital you pursue your interests otherwise you will be in a lot of debt and have a resounding amount of resentment for your parents. And if you hate it this much it would be irresponsible to participate in a field where lives are on the line.\n\nSome things to remember\n\n1. Your life is not ruined. You aren't addicted to drugs or have a criminal record as long as a CVS receipt.\n\n2. It is not too late. Being a sophomore is literally being brand new to college. Now is the time to discover which paths you wish to follow and set course accordingly.\n\n3. Your GPA is GREAT! 3.5 is awesome and if you are already well above the minimum for admission to buisness school then apply. Make sure to have a good essay and talk with your advisor for more tips.\n\n4. If your parents bring up the cost: People have gone into to MUCH more debt for many things FAR less valuable then a college education. \n\n5. You are not your dad. Your legacy is your own and it is selfish of them to think that your purpose in life is to make him or your family look good (especialy doing what they deem as \"good\"). Your life will be much more fulfilling and successful if you pursue your interests. Otherwise you will be living for someone else, not you. What happens when you're older and your dad dies? Are you going to continue to live for him even when he is gone? Thats a recipe for hate and resentment, which is not a good basis for a relationship with anyone, none the less your family.\n\nTL;DR: Live for yourself, not your family. Please don't become a doctor if you don't want to (people might die). It is NOT too late, and your GPA is FANTASTIC.",

      "text": "First, your life isn't ruined. Not at all. It is far from over. If you continue down a path that makes you unhappy, you may continue to be unhappy. In that case, reflect on why you are unhappy, ask questions like 'is it me or is it my path?' and then work on yourself or change paths. You are not at all past the point of no return. You still have so many options. It sounds like it is time to start looking into those options. You can change your mind as many times as you want. You have plenty of time.\n\nSecond, I would go ahead and start talking to whoever you have to talk to about the transfer. Your 3.5 which I'm guessing involves a lot of natural science classes might still be seen as good compared to a 3.5 from other majors. Don't defeat yourself. Start the process. I don't see any reason why you can't take some of the business classes you want now. Good grades in any lower level classes you can take now should also help convince the school that you are a safe bet for a business major.\n\nThird, why business? I understand you have been pushed into your current direction, but what about business makes you think that will be better? Do you have other experiences that suggest that is a good path for you? For some people, they just don't like the college process, no mater what the focus, and then it gets better once they are out doing something with their life and using knowledge, instead of just learning things that feel arbitrary to them. \n\nFourth, Alternatively, is a job going to be better than college for you? What are the things that make you hate where you are right now, and can you / should you change how you react to any of it? Are you making things harder on yourself? Sometimes you have to learn how to live happily. It sounds like thats not the issue, but anything in that stress management area can still help.\n\nFinally, what is your worst case scenario? You will graduate with a college degree, which is more than what many have. You also have more options than just med school / doctor with a biology degree. And really, no matter what you will probably want more training past the basic degree. So you also have plenty of time to get a degree and then change focus. I think it will be okay no matter what.

Then, he said he was more interested in doing something else, and now we\u2019re both doing the same thing.\n\nNow I understand not everyone can afford to go to grad school but if you can and if you were thinking of a career switch, maybe reconsider. But I can assure you your life is not ruined. Plus if you really do go to UT (your post history confirmed my suspicions), isn\u2019t transferring majors in CNS much more seamless?

I wish I didn\u2019t spend all the time and money on those first 3 years, but at least it solidified what I actually wanted to do with my life. And I did learn a lot with biology.\n\nApply and try your best. Allow yourself to take extra time if needed to get where you want to be. Everyone\u2019s timeline is different, just do your best to start, don\u2019t worry about when you finish. You\u2019ll get your GPA up and get started eventually. Maybe switch courses just to get your grades up? Especially business electives, if you want to switch your degree anyway. So don\u2019t lose hope and work to get there, one step at a time. I know it seems like the end, but you haven\u2019t even started yet. Work on getting started first, your position in school right now isn\u2019t as tough as it seems. It will work out, just get yourself there with a clear head.",

      "text": "I have a Bach degree in Finance because it actually interested me. I worked as a Paramedic while was going through it. My Dad is a CRNA, but never was forceful in me getting into the medical field, or the sciences at all. Yet, here I am, years later, in Nursing school. I have 2 sets of advice, one as a finance major, and the other as a medical professional and nursing student:\n\nBusiness: Are you in a target school? If not, the only job waiting for you after you get your Finance Degree is a loan officer at a local bank. Thats hyperbole, obviously, but brace yourself for how shockingly limited your finance degree will actually be. If you want a Business degree, I suggest Accounting. You will have plenty of chances to learn finance and take the important finance classes, and if that doesn't work out, CPAs still make awesome money and it will give you a better understanding of the innerworkings of a company that finance. When you say that's what interests you, what do you mean? What specifically about this interests you?\n\nMedical: Health care schooling is not like hard sciences. It is hard and it is science but its an applied science. You will use everything you learned in Chem and A&P and and the rest, yes, but your schooling will not be like the sciences. Its *Applied* Science. Imagine how much Physics an Engineering student needs to remember and do. Engineers are not need to be physicists. They have to have a good understanding, but they don't need to be a physicist. That's what healthcare and Biology is like. I don't know if that helps or anything, but keep that in mind. You don't have to adore science to be a doctor or nurse, just have a good handle on it.\n\nSide note: there are a TON of Concurrent MBA/MSN programs. If you are interest in business, but don't want disappoint your family and not go medical, that is a very good option. If you do get a business degree, in this job market, you will need to get an MBA regardless. Getting your BSN first then working into nurse management may be a good compromise option for you. There are also a lot of colleges now offering Degrees in Hospital Administration, but its like the finance Degree, its limiting. Its the kind of job the want you to have some experience for, which you can get with a BSN.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck, my friend!",

People who become doctors should actually want to, otherwise, they will be miserable. \n\nPlus you also need a good GPA to become a doctor. That is the reason I didn't even bother trying to major in bio and go to vet school. I am just not good enough in science (especially evil evil math and chemistry) to get straight As. \n\nWhat I would do if I were you is stop taking science courses. It is probably too late for this semester but for next semester just apply for some courses that you will be good at. Do you have any more GE courses to fill? Are there any business courses you can take that don't require you to be in the business school? Look for easy A classes and make sure to do well. Use those courses to boost up your GPA. Then apply to business school. \n\nYour life is not over. It just might take you a little longer to graduate. But honestly, the real world sucks. College was fun. I miss it.",

Many people get into really good careers and grad schools with bad 1st/2nd year grades. So many people don't figure out what they want to do until their later years in college and thus they don't apply themselves well at first. If you can later show improvement as time goes on and get a GPA that is more to your liking in 3rd & 4th year you will be absolutely fine.",

My sister was heading for a law degree and my brother was going business, both impressive and also both not science. So it was up to me to \u201ckeep the legacy alive\u201d. \n\nI tried biology, and it was immediately horrible. I didn\u2019t enjoy it, I wasn\u2019t good at it, and most importantly I had no passion for it. A month in, I knew I had to change. I feel very grateful that I had a family friend introduce me to interior design, a field I fell in love with that merged a passion for art and a \u201crealistic future\u201d that I could get my parents to accept. Even then, it was still pretty difficult convincing my parents of what I was doing and that it was worth it/necessary to change, but it\u2019s been beyond worth it. It took me a few extra mess ups first, I changed colleges and moved out of state twice after that. I\u2019m finally a senior now, and I\u2019ve had some crazy experiences like apartments burning down and trying to get internships in a pandemic. I love what I do though, and I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019m proud of my work and so are my parents. \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be hard. You\u2019re gonna regret it sometimes. But not as much as you would if you stay on this route. This is an extremely personal decision, it\u2019s what you, and only you, will be doing for the rest of your life. \n\nFollow your gut, it\u2019s usually right, and you\u2019ll learn so many important life lessons along the way like resilience and self-dependence. And most importantly: you\u2019ll be a-ok. Life\u2019s too serious, too often. Enjoy what you do. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, need anything, or just wanna chat! Good luck!! :)",

      "text": "You might be able to leverage your science/bio background thus far to get a foot in the door in finance opportunities related to biotech or pharma. \n\nDoes your school have a consulting club? Or an entrepreneurship/biotech/finance group? Try to find a list of groups/clubs somewhere for your school and see if something fits. Then try to get involved and learn from the people there. Networking through these groups will be a great opportunity for you to learn where you want to go and how to prepare yourself starting from here. \n\nI also started out in bio, and am considering leaving for finance or consulting. These kinds of clubs helped me get some experience, meet people, and have something on my resume. They have been helpful in interviews when explaining my \"story\" and why I'm applying to their finance jobs. \n\n\nHow much flexibility does your school have in choosing courses? In the meantime, you can take some courses that bio majors could/should take but that would be helpful in your preferred path as well. For example, every bio major should take stats, computer science, math/calc, etc. those will definitely help you get started in finance, but you can still make the argument to your parents/bio major that it is useful in bio if you are not ready to tell them about the switch. You can probably even convince them that econ and finance courses will help you understand the broader financial needs of patients so that you can make an even larger impact as a physician or whatever. (Which is not a lie, scientists and medical professionals can and do benefit from understanding these systems. There's a lot more to medicine that the individual doctor-patient relationship. Lots of doctors and biologists do research in this area to try to figure out how to get healthcare access to the most people)\n\n\nYou can also try looking into labs at your school to join during the school year. Even if it is not finance, it will still give you something to put on your resume. You could try to find a bio professor who is trying to take their medicine to market, an econ professor who studies the healthcare system, or a bioinformatics professor studying how poverty impacts health, or something. Point being, there may be lots of opportunities at your university where your current coursework can get you started in an interdisciplinary field, after which you can leave and do pure finance or if you find it interesting stay in that niche. I would look into labs in econ, business, bioinformatics, Bioengieering, biology, neuroscience, etc. Then also try to find academic labs to join during the summer, either at your school or other schools. (applications for summer internships at universities are generally due in the early fall). \n\nYou may also be able to find similar industry internships over the summer, though I am not entirely sure how that works. Someone at your school (career center?) should be able to help you with that. \n\nLastly, I would go on LinkedIn and find alumni from your school that are working in positions you are interested in. Then reach out and ask for a 30 minute conversation just to learn about their career path and ask for advice. People are more than happy to do it, some people actually love this.  (I've had people very enthusiastic that I reached out). The career center can help you figure out LinkedIn, get in touch with people, and help you think of questions to ask. You can also Google \"networking questions\"\n\nTl;DR : your life is not ruined. You still have plenty of time to do some course correction. Your first year doing bio can definitely be used to get your foot in the door with the career that you want. You can buy some time by taking courses I mentioned above, and there are plenty of opportunities in finance that want someone with some bio background. You are actually in a great place right now and it is great that you are thinking about the long term. That will definitely serve you well. You have many options still. \n\nAnyway, happy to chat more. Let me know if there are any questions I can answer. \n\n(I am on mobile so forgive me for any typos/poor grammar. )",

Try telling that to  my family and they still think and i am saying i should stayll in clinical medicine when all i want to do is technology in medicine, pertaining to prosthetics. I do not know why they would care in the first place, they are not even close to the medical field. I assume its to brag to other people how they inspired me or how since they raised me it is due to them that i became successful. I don't know, but its annoying. and I come from a minority based family, so speaking to them about my issues or wants is like me having to talk to the board of chairmen. So what I did is simple, I did what I wanted. Why stay somewhere you don't want to be. Leave even if your GPA is low. I would be much happier at a top 200 school doing what I wanted than a top 15 school where I hate my job. There is basically no legacy if it is only your father being a doctor. They do not own you, they can only pressure you.  Can they change your schooling? no. Are they gonna work your job, spend their 80-90 hours on sleep depriving work under your name? (Just because our grandparents had to walk like a thousand miles to school and we don't. Doesn't mean we should do what they did.(analogy  of course)). Why do your sisters get to have the privilege of not being a doctor and you are pressured? That's not right why have them have choices, and you alone to bear a path you do not want. Now I am not saying you should confront your parents and leave forever. But again they are not living your life, change your major if you can. You should do what you want, you are an adult now, so we have to make adult choices. If you live at Uni, cool distance yourself for a while. Change your major without telling them. Do not let them pay for your school or they will have something to complain about, how they invested so much. If at a community college, don't tell them again and pay for the college. Whether you are brave enough to live the life you want or not depends on you and not them. I would much more likely live my own life than live the life of another. That is the main reason why I will be changing my name, (BAckground, my name is the same as my dads) I don't want to be a junior. So I will be changing it to what I want.

At the very least, Political Science is much more closely related to business than biology is (and you might not hate yourself while taking poli sci classes), and it is a much easier major to raise your GPA in.\n\nEither that, or talk to your advisor and see if they can make an exemption with your situation. A 3.5 GPA is very good, so I think it's ludicrous they wouldn't accept you. Good luck!",

Start by meeting with an advisor in that college and having a conversation with them about requirements, admission, etc. Ask what is the best way for u to switch into their program, see if they can provide u with maybe recommended schedule or course plan and then go from there. But definitely make the switch. Trust me. Being stuck in a major u hate will ruin u in the long run. You got this! Good luck!",

      "text": "You got this OP. Take a deep breath. This is part of the deal.\n\nI think I can relate. I was pre-med in college and came from a family of doctors. There was definitely pressure (though not as much as in your situation) to go down that path. It wasn't for me, and I remember really struggling to let go of the security of \"knowing\" what my life was going to look like.\n\nIn my humble opinion, here is the simple truth. You obviously can't be a doctor. It's not even an option. If you don't love it, you'll be terrible at it. People will get hurt. The debt load and time sacrifice in school and while you practice are HUGE. It's a no brainer to be honest with yourself and your family that this just isn't your path. It will be a tough convo, and whether they take it well or not, it will get better as time goes on.\n\nI had a close friend who went to medical school because he thought he \"should\". We met as ski instructors while we were in college. What he really wanted to do in his life was adventure, climb, and ski. He grumbled often about how much med school sucked and how heavy the debt burden was. For years I'd listen to him complain about his life. Then, no lies, he DIED this last year at 33 in a rock climbing accident. So sad. Not just because I lost a good friend, but because I know he spent most of the past 10 years not doing what he really wanted to be doing with his life.\n\nNow that its clear what NOT to do, you can free yourself to explore what you DO want to do. That's the key, really. Set aside business school, med school, law school... whatever \"paths\" you think you \"should\" go down. What do you enjoy? What things do you most enjoy learning? What do you gravitate towards in your free time? What unique strengths and interests make you... well you? Journal and look at your answer to these questions. Ask your friends and family to get their perspective. Then look at the clustering of your strengths and interests and brainstorm jobs/careers with an older person. You'll then have a messy list of hypotheses, which you can go test! Think you want to go into business, find a way to get involved in a local business. Think you want to be a professor, find a TA position on campus... you get the idea. College is an AMAZING opportunity to test these hypothesis and learn about yourself. Really lost progressing in school? Take a gap year, work, live, and test your ideas that way.\n\nOr you can just waste that time, stress the eff out, memorize shit you hate for tests, and generally run like a hamster in a wheel down some path you \"should\" be on. Lots of people do that too, so you won't be alone.\n\nIf you find something that you have passion for, leverages your strengths, and is something you can obsess over, you are heading in a good direction. Its messy, windy, and eventually you'll stumble towards a great path. Maybe that's towards an advanced degree, maybe not. Lots of hard working smart people succeed without advanced degrees. In the real world, people care a lot less about your degree, your fancy school, than you think. They care about the skills you have and what that means for their business.\n\nGood luck OP.",

One out of ten college students who want to be a doctor make it to medical school.  Half of the ones who make it through medical school and residency are happy with their careers.\n\nYou'll never be successful if you're at war with yourself.  You're competing against people who look at x-rays with wonder and want to become the person who can see things in x-rays that no one else has seen.  Your best-case scenario is that one of those people will take your position in medical school.  Your worst-case scenario is that you'll take their position and hate your life until you can retire.\n\nDo whatever it takes to escape.",

Will your parents pay for that (if they are)? What requisites does the new universities business school have?\n\n3. Make a plan for if you drop out of college because there aren't any suitable options for schools for you. (Where can I get a job? Where will I live? What direction will I take?)\n\nEssentially ask \"How do I get in?\" and \"What do I do if I don't?\"",

It's *your* life, not theirs.\n\nIf you have to switch schools, do that. If you have to do another semester and boost your GPA to transfer programs, do that. If you need to take time off and de-stress and rethink things, do that.

It is only the living that really matters, and even if the dead watch over you after they pass they wouldn't want to see you suffer on the path they laid out for you.   \n\nIf you want to look into transferring internally even if you dont have the GPA requirements talk to your advisor as well as the school of business department head.  \n\nIf your family asks what happened tell them the truth, you were unhappy and you didn't think you would be happy on that path.

However of course this requires an internal transfer which at my school you usually have to have a pretty high GPA like 3.8. Obviously my GPA isn\u2019t high enough now so I\u2019m not gonna apply at this instant.\n\nNow I am not typically the argumentative type but unless OP corrects me I will sit here all day for this one. He says \\*right there\\* he needs roughly a 3.8 GPA to get in, as that is what most students who get in have.\n\nBy going to his counselor, he can see if he can apply for a GPA waiver where the program will disregard his GPA and instead look at the waiver he filled out which typically consists of several essay questions that ask \"Why do you want to be in the program?\" \"How will getting into this program help your career?\" Stuff like that.\n\nOnce he submits that, the administrators of that program put his GPA at the bottom of the order and look at the waiver first to see if he is an acceptable candidate for the program. They will look at his grammar, writing style, all of that type of stuff and make a decision from there.\n\nI know all of this because I have done it before like I said, for LSU to get into a program. OP Should at least explore the option.\n\nSo yes, my answer does make sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you mean why I commented on OPs individual comment instead of the main post, then this whole argument is pointless. I did that so he will see it as a direct reply to him instead of another individual comment on the post.",
