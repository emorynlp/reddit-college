  "title:": "Psychology and History teacher screwed up my GPA. What should I do?",
  "text": "So last semester I took Psychology and Western Civ.  I got a C in both of them because in Psychology the website I was taking the exam on was shut down due to an outage and my test submitted a third of the way through.  This gave me an F on the first exam and despite getting A's on the other two exams and A's and B's on every other assignment, I still ended the class with a 74%.\n\nThen in my Western Civ class my teacher would consistently mispell things and word things in a confusing way on purpose to prevent people from googling the answers, but as a result nobody knew what he was talking about.  The average grade in that class was a 67% and I ended up making  a 79.4%.\n\nBefore this I had made mostly A's, and this brought my GPA down to 3.0.  It's going to be very difficult to bring back up to what I would consider a good GPA(3.5-3.7) and I'm wondering if anyone would suggest I try something else rather than trying to get 15 credit hours worth of A's.\n\nAny advice is appreciated.  Thanks.",
