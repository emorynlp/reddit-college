  "text": "i just finished my first semester of freshman year, and wow, it was terrible. long story short, everything that could have went wrong, went wrong, and i barely met my gpa requirent by .1. im back home for Christmas, and maybe it\u2019s just because im older, but it\u2019s Christmas day and i don\u2019t feel happy. i spent a decent part of my morning crying in the shower thinking about everything that had happened. i don\u2019t have any friends in my hometown and my grandparents couldn\u2019t make it because grandfather is recovering from surgery (he\u2019s fine btw he\u2019s just the one that usually drives and he can\u2019t rn). sorry this is a bit sad, but i was just wondering if anyone one else felt this way about the holidays.

      "text": "Awww, I'm so sorry all of those things happened! I really hope he gets better soon and that you start to feel happier soon. \n\nFor next semester, maybe try to lighten your workload or try to free your schedule a little more (if possible) that way you have more time to focus on studying and getting work done. \n\nDefinitely try to just use this experience as motivation to do better next semester. A way that helps me through rough times is to just try to improve the next time, and planning out how to go about doing that. I made the mistake this past semester of not managing my time appropriately, so I didn't end up doing as well in one of my classes as I'd hoped. So for this coming semester I'm going to make a schedule to follow each week for blocks of time that I will dedicate to each class. \n\nAlso, **this is winter break!!** After a stressful semester we need this time to rest ourselves and recharge for next semester. Make sure to find time during this break to relieve stress and try to enjoy yourself. Maybe find a show to get involved in, exercising, running, discovering a new hobby/activity, etc. I personally enjoy exercising to try to get more flexible, watching Netflix, listening to music, etc. Just try to find some activities that might bring some joy or entertainment that will hopefully be helpful for you. I know this is already a long reply (lol) but one more thing I suggest is to try spending an entire day (or at least some time) to just focus on you. This includes things like pampering yourself, snuggling in a blanket with a favorite snack, and just watching TV or something entertaining to you. :)\n\nRemember that hard times do not last forever, and good luck!!! <3 ",

Holidays are not great when u have something to worry about for the next year. What I do is loosen up and try not to think about it all the time. I recently learned how to ride a bike (yup I know too late for a college kid hahaha) and have been binge-watching shows. These tough times are just a small fraction in our lives so it's best to not worry too much and take it day by day. Have a nice day ahead!",

I had best friends from way back treat me like shit and just rub into my face about how much better they are doing than me. I think what I need to do is just make a pact to stay sober again and finish out the rest of the year strong. Hang in there, and as long as you continue the spirit of Christmas good things will come your way and it happens in college. Especially the first years, they are something that you need to get adjusted to. ",

It\u2019s not because we aren\u2019t having the same tradition in my family that we always do but because the lead up to the holiday itself isn\u2019t the same for me. While away at college I am typically doing a lot of work in December so I am not really paying attention to it being Christmas time. That\u2019s also paired with growing up and having things change. \n\nCongrats on your first semester though! It seems like it was a struggle but now you can learn from your mistakes and have a better time next semester! Classes in the future may get more difficult but the way that you handle things can only get better. Good luck!",

High school friends are still in their past social circles but I feel separated because I went so far away. And this year my family went through some splits that just made all the change harder to handle and Christmas feel all the more different. It feels like I\u2019ve time traveled and things don\u2019t feel quite right. But Christmas turned out alright and I\u2019m planning for next semester.

I\u2019m surrounded by family, but it just seems like the turnout gets smaller every year. It\u2019s fun but it just doesn\u2019t feel the same anymore.

But I've also found through these years of college that I don't prepare for Christmas the same way I do when I'm at home. As a kid I was making cards and presents for family on the weekends, listening to Christmas music on the bus, preparing for the Christmas performance at school, and all sorts of other activities and traditions that get you in the Christmas spirit. Instead at college, I'm trying to tie up all the loose ends at school to make sure I pass my classes. I'm sleeping less, worrying more, rushing around.\n\nSo maybe less year make an effort to incorporate a tradition or two from home or your childhood back into your life, so you anticipate Christmas more? This year I listened to Christmas music as I wrote one of my papers and it was a nice change of pace.",

But, I realize that this all just the process of growing up, and like it or not, we all have to come to terms with this. Nothing is permanent. Things will change. I would invite you to look into mindulness meditation as it has been incredibly beneficial for me accepting that life and everything it entails is impermanent.

      "text": "My whole first year of university felt like this. It fucking sucked. When the holidays came, I felt like I was just going through the motions, not actually happy about anything. I didn\u2019t meet my gpa requirements, was on academic warning and just felt like an absolute failure. Second semester was slightly better, but only because I knew what to avoid-hit my requirement by .008. I just finished my 3rd semester and got all A\u2019s and B\u2019s, and the holidays have been lovely. I wish people would have been more open and honest with me when I started uni, but A) you\u2019re not alone in these feelings and B) despite the enormous burden, you ARE learning a lot about what to do better, even if it\u2019s slowly. Don\u2019t get worried about feeling sad, and don\u2019t feel obligated to hide it. Let yourself reflect on it and take appropriate action. For me, it was changing my major, for you it may be a combination of 15 different smaller things. Lean into what you\u2019re feeling so you can begin to change your reality\u2014there really is no right or wrong way to do that. \n\nI\u2019m proud that you finished your semester, and I hope you get some rest during the break. PM me if you ever need a soundboard or someone to bitch at. ",

I felt like I had no friends, I wasn\u2019t doing too hot in school, I hated my living situation, and a lot of drama was happening in my friend group but just trust me man crawl out of the rut your in and try to remember that these are the best years of your life for a reason. It sucks since it\u2019s your freshman year but just know things can only go up from here. Take this semester as a learning lesson and just know things can only go up from here. Now realize that shit happens and you\u2019ll probably kill this next semester, you got this, stay strong.",

      "text": "As cliche as this sounds, this hurt you are experiencing right now is all a part of growing up. Yeah growing up sucks! First semester of freshman year I failed three classes, I fell severely ill right before the finals, and I hated every minute of class because I was expected to do something I didn't love nor want to do. But things change, people grow, life moves, and oddly sometimes the very things you want you end up finding miles and years away from where you were looking. \n\nI have since moved miles from home on multiple occasions. I have met new people, made new friends, and forgotten more friends than I care to remember. There is nothing constant in life but what you make of it. So this holiday cry; shed every tear, till you have none to shed anymore. And then spend time with your family, enjoy lunch, dinner, a walk in the park. Start a new tradition, or redesign an old one. Festive seasons are not festive because of the presents you find under the tree, even though they surely feel that way as a child. They are festive because of the people you have around you and the memories you make. \n\nYes things will change, and it wont always be wonderful and fun. But never give up that child like curiosity you had each time you saw those presents under the tree and the wonder when you opened the wrapping to discover what was inside. Direct those towards finding your passion, your hobbies, and your love. Spend this Christmas expanding your horizons even if you know it will be painful.",

Keep your head up are recognize when you can just forget about your responsibilities. This is one of those days. Relax and smell the roses while you can. It is hell while you're still in it, but you'll always look back at it as the best time of your life. Really think about finding the balance between fun and school. There is a way to do great in school and still have all the college fun. Just maybe not on Tuesdays haha. Good luck mate, you'll be fine. Merry Christmas\n\n\nEdit: and my friends and I all felt the same about the holidays. This is a huge transition period in your life. There will be many more down the road. Just embrace it. This is a big \"growing up\" period",

I booked a snowboarding trip but I am afraid to go and spend more money as I am a government employee and do not know when my next paycheck is coming in. At least I have my dog. Some friends were kind enough to have me at their family\u2019s Christmas dinner last night. However, nothing beats being home for the holidays. Today I am spending the day with my dog, making us a special meal, taking a long walk by the lake, dancing around the house, etc. The best thing you can do is enjoy what you have and hope for a better holiday next year. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year !",

My younger sister and her daughter lived with my mother up until this year, so even after I moved out, Christmas morning was still done at my mother's.\n\nHowever, now that my sister and her boyfriend have their own place, my sister decided that she wanted to have her own immediate family Christmas morning -- the three of them, without my mother and I. While this is totally normal when people start having families - after all, growing up, Christmas morning was done with my parents and sister, not my grandparents or aunts/uncles - it has made me feel isolated, a bit.\n\nThis is the first year that this is happening, and it's...thrown me off a little bit. We're going to my mother's for Christmas dinner, but I'm currently sitting in bed with my laptop, watching Netflix, feeling like today is any normal day -- it doesn't feel like Christmas anymore, and as someone who doesn't intend to have kids (and right now has no interest in a partner), I feel like Christmas will never feel like Christmas again.",

Christmas isn\u2019t running down the stairs to open presents anymore, it\u2019s just trying to get everyone together for few hours to eat and catch up. ",
