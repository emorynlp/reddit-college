A way that helps me through rough times is to just try to improve the next time, and planning out how to go about doing that. I made the mistake this past semester of not managing my time appropriately, so I didn't end up doing as well in one of my classes as I'd hoped. So for this coming semester I'm going to make a schedule to follow each week for blocks of time that I will dedicate to each class. \n\nAlso, **this is winter break!!** After a stressful semester we need this time to rest ourselves and recharge for next semester. Make sure to find time during this break to relieve stress and try to enjoy yourself. Maybe find a show to get involved in, exercising, running, discovering a new hobby/activity, etc. I personally enjoy exercising to try to get more flexible, watching Netflix, listening to music, etc. Just try to find some activities that might bring some joy or entertainment that will hopefully be helpful for you. I know this is already a long reply (lol) but one more thing I suggest is to try spending an entire day (or at least some time) to just focus on you. This includes things like pampering yourself, snuggling in a blanket with a favorite snack, and just watching TV or something entertaining to you. :)\n\nRemember that hard times do not last forever, and good luck!!! <3 ", "author": "VanillaSundaex", "created": 1545897365, "upvotes": 1}, "ecn0cp4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a9flvk/does_it_not_feel_like_christmas_to_anyone_else/ecn0cp4/", "text": "This is part of growing up", "author": "navyseal722", "created": 1545888617, "upvotes": 1}, "eclig7c": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a9flvk/does_it_not_feel_like_christmas_to_anyone_else/eclig7c/", "text": "I feel you.
