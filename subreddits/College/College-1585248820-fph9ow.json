If you're paying your own bills (rent, utilities, etc.) you are NOT a dependent and shouldn't be filing as one regardless of whether your parents want to claim you for their own benefit.  Its also super easy to fight if you file before your parents and your return gets flagged.  \n\nMy income got cut (and I'm self-employed, paid in cash) and I just took out part of a student loan I declined previously to pay for my tuiton.
