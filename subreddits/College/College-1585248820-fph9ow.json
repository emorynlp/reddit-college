  "title:": "Can we just talk about how the coronavirus stimulus bill completely excludes us college students?",
  "text": "According to the bill, adults that made less than $75k will receive $1,200, **HOWEVER** those who were claimed as dependents by their parents will not receive any money from the stimulus package. Even if you filed taxes as an individual. Nor will your parents be receiving the $500 check if you are not less than 17 years old.\n\nPersonally I am just super disappointed. This money would\u2019ve helped me pay for my college tuition but **yet again** the government purposely excludes college students. There seems to be a lot of outrage amongst college students on twitter as well.\n\nEdit: and of course the \u201ccollege students have enough and don\u2019t need anything else\u201d crowd shows up lol\n\n**Bottom line is, our parent\u2019s tax returns don\u2019t directly cover our own expenses. Not everyone is privileged to have their college paid for and just because others have it worse, doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t benefit. To say that college students shouldn\u2019t get anything because (essentially) \u201cthey have more than enough from being considered dependent\u201d is grossly naive. Feel free to argue otherwise but I (and millions of other college students) stand by this.**",

      "text": "You are probably not going to like this answer, but it's not my intent to frustrate you with it. \n\nNo one included it into the bill because historically college students rarely have raised opposition to bills that affected them in large numbers. In fact, the last time I can think of a nationwide strike involving students is the Vietnam War. \n\nWrite a letter to a senator or representative, ask for change, promise to spread information at college with Associated Student Body about the outcome. There should be a concerted barrage of letters to representatives and senators right about now about how dependent college students are excluded, yet they file and pay taxes every year. Twitter rage only helps Trump.\n\nI work/teach at a college level, and I completely outraged by the exclusion of adult students from the stimulus, believe me. But there is a very straightforward reason why this is happening in my opinion - easy savings at no major loss of votes.",

      "text": "I think people with student debt should get $1200 based on their debt value. So for example if your debt is $100k+ you should get $1200, between 80-99k $800-$1000 and so on. Maybe play around with the numbers on debt since student debt is like a noose around everyones neck. But if you filed your own return, live with parents, and have no student debt you shouldn't be getting anything.\n\nThis opinion is also coming from a college student with 50k in debt so yeah I think that's how it should be structured.",

Now your saying despite the fact that your parents apparently take care of you, they don\u2019t? If your parents claimed you, they got money to take care of you in their tax return as they have since you were born. Again, I was trying to explain your parents have MULTIPLE financials means during this crisis\n\u2022 unemployment $600+/m\n\u2022$1200 stimulus check\n\u2022savings\n\u2022tax return (with extra $ because of 2 dependents and child tax credit)\n\u2022kid(s) paying part of bills and rent\n\u2022possible PTO\nSo I\u2019m trying to explain with all this EXTRA $$ and savings, with you as a dependent your needs should be met during this pandemic. You don\u2019t need the stimulus check. If your needs aren\u2019t met you should have a serious talk with your parents because they ARE getting money to take care of you. Your saying you NEED the $ like your going to starve if you don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know what kind of bills your trying to pay but if important bills aren\u2019t being paid by your parents but yourself, you already qualify as independent and again need to have a serious talk with them.

If you aren\u2019t being helped by family you likely have a side job or some other income to help sustain your living expenses that college tuition doesn\u2019t cover and so you\u2019re paying taxes on that income. \n\nMaybe I don\u2019t understand the nuances of the bill in regards to college students, but there isn\u2019t a minimum income level that has to be reached to receive money, you just have to file your taxes (I\u2019m assuming as a college student you didn\u2019t make over the $75K/$99K limits that they placed). So if you have some income you can either fall as a dependent (makes the assumption that your parents are helping you on some level so they are entitled to tax breaks and incentive that \u201cin theory\u201d help benefit you) or you can be independent like the 18-24 year olds that don\u2019t go to college and start working and have to pay their taxes.\n\nThe point is that you are getting a stimulus of tax money that you\u2019ve paid before back. So you can either grow up and start paying taxes and become an \u201cadult\u201d to the federal government or you can stay a \u201cdependent\u201d that is considered someone who gets benefits from their parents (regardless of whether you do or not).

          "text": "Disclaimer: I am not an accountant or a lawyer. \n\nSo, being a dependent isn't just a race to file. There are legal definitions of who can be claimed and who can't. If they didn't provide at least 50% of your support (providing for your needs and paying your bills) they can't technically claim you.\n\nIf they claim you as a dependent but you don't think they should be able to, then you can file on paper (not e-file), claim yourself, and the IRS will ask you and your parents to provide proof of who pays your expenses. If you take out student loans on your own name to pay tuition and room&board, that's probably more than 50% of your expenses for the year.\n\nHowever, at least when I was in college, letting my mom claim me increased her tax refund by a LOT whereas claiming myself only increased my refund by a little. She paid me the difference, and we split the extra. And she really did support me about 50% so claiming me was basically a judgement call.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your parents, you could talk to them about an arrangement like this. But from your post, it sounds like maybe you don't - In which case, I would seriously look into amending your prior year taxes. It's as easy as filing your taxes was last time. \n\nBut fair warning, if you go back and amend 2019 to claim yourself successfully, there's no guarantee you'll get the stimulus money. I don't know if the stimulus bill requires that your 2019 taxes have to be processed before the stimulus goes out. And the IRS will send your parents a very large bill (possibly several thousand dollars) to pay back the refund they got for claiming you. But you could get a lot of money for someone in college.\n\nA lot to consider. Good luck! I recommend posting a top level post abou this in r/personalfinance.",

Do I get a payment?**\n\nThe bill does not help people in that circumstance now, but you may benefit once you file your 2020 taxes. That\u2019s because the payment is technically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year. So it will depend on how much you earn.\n\nMeanwhile, there are many other provisions in the legislation. You may be able to file for unemployment or for one of the new loans for small-business owners or sole proprietors.\"\n\n**Source:** https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html",

Maybe the house will toss it back at the senate with an added grant for students in need, but I\u2019m gonna lift my hands from this topic now because I should have known better than to dig into this anyway.

I haven't read the entire bill itself (just articles covering the broader points) because I don't particularly need the money myself, so I thought that it meant you could potentially get a check _later_ after you file for 2020, but not right now like some people might need. I was a dependent for 2019 as well because I was still finishing undergrad so filling for 2019 now wouldn't change that anyway.\n\nEdit: love getting downvoted for asking questions AND being right about it, if you check the more recent post to this sub.",

                      "text": "Omg came across this and HAD to say something \n\n1.) everyone else on this post is being polite and normal, even if they are disagreeing with the OP. So you really need to chill w/ this angry \u201cfUcK yOu\u201d attitude as if people on this sub have came in and personally attacked you. It\u2019s really unnecessary and makes you come off as mentally unwell. \n\n2.) also chill with you\u2019re \u201cbetter than thou\u201d attitude on you\u2019re fellow college students. you seem bitter about something, and that\u2019s fine, but go to therapy and don\u2019t take it out on the rest of us. people shouldn\u2019t have to deal with unprovoked rudeness because you seem to have some childhood issue that made you upset towards adults who\u2019s parents help them. \n\n3.) it\u2019s also really retarded that you think most college students don\u2019t pay any bills of their own, and are fully dependent on their parents. Maybe it\u2019s because I grew up in a poor area, but the \u201crich kid w/ mommy n daddy\u201d stereotype doesn\u2019t apply to most students. yeah there are plenty of kids who can call their parents for help. But there\u2019s plenty of poor students. students who go to community college, or only go to school part time because their parents can\u2019t afford it. a million different economic situations because life isn\u2019t black and white. \n\nyou never know what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s life, their financial and economic situation. you can\u2019t ever assume things since unless you know the person personally- wtf do you know about their life? or if they are better off?\n\n4.) just because someone\u2019s parents help support them doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have bills that are important. you are assuming that everyone\u2019s parents are going to cover what their kids now can\u2019t pay for themselves because they lost their job. not the case for most of the college students around me. most of my friends have their own car payments and car insurance and are panicking since their parents either 1) aren\u2019t willing to cover 2) even if they wanted too, they don\u2019t have the resources. bottom line is, if you have any bills and lost you\u2019re job during this time, you\u2019re fucked. doesn\u2019t matter if you pay less bills then some people. this whole covid-19 thing effects everyone to a point. \n\nyou kind of don\u2019t need to assume people\u2019s living situations too. a lot of my friends live with their parents but everything else they pay for- they even have to cough up some money for rent. the only bonus is that they save some money then living fully on their own, but they DO have expenses that mom or dad aren\u2019t gunna start paying now. cause guess what? they out of a job too Lmao\n\nI have friends who live on their own but are only on their parents car or health insurance. A Million different variables- and having less bills doesn\u2019t take away the rest of them. cool that one of my friends lives with their mom- but mom isn\u2019t going to pay her 300$ car payment. \n\n5.) ur also assuming that everyone has rich parents. That everyone has parents that it would be okay if you didn\u2019t have a job. I think that\u2019s odd of you- but maybe because I go to community college and grew up in the hood I just don\u2019t really see it a lot. plenty of college folks that while a dependent on their parent/s (a lot of people also... have a single parent too?), their parents depend on their money to help pay bills in their house or cover some important things. you are assuming that everyone\u2019s parents are w o r k I n g. plenty of already broke people, now any broker. Linda who lives with her single mom of 3 kids can\u2019t call \u201c~~~ mommy n daddy~~~~\u201d because moms broke and dads not around. there\u2019s a lot of parents who would really benefit getting money for their adult dependents. \n\nwhile I don\u2019t think every college student needs that 1,200, I think in all reality that there should be money given to the person who claims them. I seen a lot of people talking about how they wish their parents got the money since they are out of a job as well. idk what selfish pricks you\u2019re around, but most people would put that money towards bills or to their parents. nothing wrong w/ that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\noverall, stop making these weird assumptions about a wide population. you don\u2019t know peoples situations, and just because they have a little bit better off rn than others, DOESNT take away their struggles and issues they are going to face. there\u2019s always someone better off then another, and if we wanna play the oppression olympics, as Americans we already losing. I used to live in China, and let me too you, there\u2019s people who would consider YOU rich and lucky for having internet or running water. don\u2019t think you\u2019re above others, because there\u2019s millions around who\u2019d look at you and think \u201cwhat the fuck do they have to complain about?\u201d\n\n\nChill the fuck out and get off you\u2019re high horse. cause honestly you look like a rude dumbass, and seeing by some of you\u2019re other post crying about your anxiety, quit trying to act like a badass. ur some random person online. I love seeing ppl try to sound tough cause they know someone else can\u2019t sock them in the face for being a jackass. \n\nperiod. \n\n~~~this message was supported by ur local Latino who has a single mom of 5 kids who isn\u2019t working n doesn\u2019t qualify for unemployment~~~~~ (but we all are rich huh? Lmao) \n\n\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude12",

I\u2019m not going to abandon my mom and not help out. \n\nShe\u2019s a single mother with two kids. She needs all the money she can get which is why she claims me. \n\nYou\u2019re right in that most college students do love with their parents etc. But most college kids also work and most are now out of work. Most college kids still need that money. \n\nJust because they\u2019re now living with their parents doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need that money. \n\nAlso from what i read and i could be wrong so please someone correct me, college students whose parents claim them don\u2019t get any money. Since they\u2019re claimed they don\u2019t get the money a regular adult would get, but they are also older than 16/17 (the age in the bill) so the parents won\u2019t get the $500 they would for each child under 17. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case that\u2019s even worse. There are many families who do better when their kids are at school because that is one less mouth to feed. Now you have college kids back home likely without a job and them and their parents aren\u2019t getting any money to help (for them).",

It just means you\u2019re still living with your parents. Not they pay for your bills. Not that they cover your tuition. Not that they pay for your dorm either. Most college students living on campus are STILL considered dependent because they are full time students and living away from home during the school year does not exempt them (once again, even IF they are paying for all their own expeses -i.e. dorm and tuition) Not everyone receives financial aid and even those who do, most of it doesn\u2019t even cover tuition. Every college student\u2019s situation is different. You\u2019re making it seem as if college students receiving the aid is just some useless handout. I can tell it\u2019s not and i\u2019m certainly not whining. Being jaded and unsympathetic doesn\u2019t make a valid argument.",

I can almost guarantee the next generation of Weinstein is busily cornering young actresses in hotel rooms right now. Sending one or two bad guys to prison hasn't altered the social power dynamics that make a Weinstein inevitable.\n\nLikewise, Black Lives Matter didn't actually *do* anything. The passengers may have gotten upset for a while, but the ship sailed on.\n\nThe social media power you're extolling is ephemeral and largely meaningless. It's not real power, except perhaps personal power for those who enrich themselves via social media.\n\nIn general, if something is simple, easy and requires little thought, it's not going to make much of a difference.",

The powers that be, know this and continue to make it more difficult to vote (because they know someone like Bernie would be elected by a landslide). You want to change government? You\u2019ve got to do more than just talk about it on social media. Especially if it\u2019s issues that affect younger generations. Don\u2019t rely on older people to do it for you because they\u2019ve got their own ideas about what they want, and they do vote. Contact your senator and representative about issues, visit their office, and vote. \n\nBtw, Just talking about it has always been a problem with younger people and why they are not taken seriously as a voting block. Your generation has the power to change that. ...As a member of genx, we didn\u2019t have the numbers to be taken seriously, but the current younger generations do!",

There are two types of dependents: a qualifying child or a qualifying relative. Because you were 25, you bumped up to the qualifying relative category. In order for someone to say you are a qualifying relative, there are still a number of qualifications that need to be met. This [worksheet](https://apps.irs.gov/app/vita/content/globalmedia/table_2_dependency_exemption_relative_4012.pdf) was taken directly from the IRS for a specific qualification test. I do know that being a full-time student is an exception to the rule that states you have to live in the house for at least half of the year. \n\nAlso student loans are NOT considered a part of your gross income. However, if you are the sole owner of those loans (meaning your parents\u2019 aren\u2019t co-signers nor are the loans parent plus loans), then you can use that to help show that they did not provide more than half of your support. And here is a link to that [information](https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/filing/dependents/student-loans-and-your-dependents/) as well. So your loan types and amounts are really the deciding factor here because it looks you would\u2019ve been their dependent otherwise.
