I got sick, and got sent home. The night before I left, however, my Roommate and our friends went to a frat party. I felt a little sick and I'm not big into Greek life so I decided to study for my quiz I had this morning and also get some shut eye.\n\n\nThey came back around 1am from the fucking party and I talked to them for a bit. Everyone left and it was fine. I fell back asleep.\n\nThen came 4am, mind you, I still have a quiz. Now, idk about you, but I have NEVER in my 20 years of life on this planet, had somebody urinate on my bed while I was sleeping in it. So I was woken up by this, I fuckin take a look. First I think \"Jesus why is he pouring shit on my bed\" it kinda stank of beer. So I thought he'd have a fuckin bottle of beer. Nope, just his fuckin dick. \n\nMy friend was literally  *PEEING* ON MY BED. I knew he was trashed, so I held back on like hitting him or something, I helped him get back into his room and everything. His roommate let him in.\n\nSo yeah, anyone have any other experiences similar? Am I just incredibly unlucky?\n\nAnd also I berated my friend about getting into my room and pissing on my bed, sheets and comforter. He apologized and is going to clean up his mess. I'm kinda shook tho ngl like, really? We pissing in other peoples beds now?", "author": "kanyeBest11", "created": 1631908477, "retrieved": 1632801527, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hde76s3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pq7fiu/my_friend_somehow_got_into_my_room_blackout_drunk/hde76s3/", "text": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "author": "Pupajesas", "created": 1632007309, "upvotes": 1}, "hdcg2g8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pq7fiu/my_friend_somehow_got_into_my_room_blackout_drunk/hdcg2g8/", "text": "People that do stuff like that are douchebags.
