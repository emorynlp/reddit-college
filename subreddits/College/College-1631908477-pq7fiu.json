  "title:": "my friend somehow got into my room blackout drunk and pissed ON my bed",
  "text": "Guys, these last few days have been a doozy. I got sick, and got sent home. The night before I left, however, my Roommate and our friends went to a frat party. I felt a little sick and I'm not big into Greek life so I decided to study for my quiz I had this morning and also get some shut eye.\n\n\nThey came back around 1am from the fucking party and I talked to them for a bit. Everyone left and it was fine. I fell back asleep.\n\nThen came 4am, mind you, I still have a quiz. Now, idk about you, but I have NEVER in my 20 years of life on this planet, had somebody urinate on my bed while I was sleeping in it. So I was woken up by this, I fuckin take a look. First I think \"Jesus why is he pouring shit on my bed\" it kinda stank of beer. So I thought he'd have a fuckin bottle of beer. Nope, just his fuckin dick. \n\nMy friend was literally  *PEEING* ON MY BED. I knew he was trashed, so I held back on like hitting him or something, I helped him get back into his room and everything. His roommate let him in.\n\nSo yeah, anyone have any other experiences similar? Am I just incredibly unlucky?\n\nAnd also I berated my friend about getting into my room and pissing on my bed, sheets and comforter. He apologized and is going to clean up his mess. I'm kinda shook tho ngl like, really? We pissing in other peoples beds now?",

      "text": "People that do stuff like that are douchebags. I have been fucked up beyond comprehension and I never even considered pissing ON a bed. Have I pissed myself drunk or high ? Sure. But never pissed on a bed. That shit is some asshole behavior. He did it on purpose. I absolutely cannot fucking stand little shits that can't handle a buzz and they do shit like this or showing out in public. Got arrested trying to get a little shit head like OP described back in a car. He was standing at the McDonald's drive through menu puking right in front of cars and the police got there in 2 minutes. \n\nBe a man about your buzz or don't drink",

Welcome to college dude this is just going to be one of your stories but just from the perspective of a senior get at least three spare sets of sheets this probably isn\u2019t going to be the last time someone messes with your bed unintentionally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may or may not have someone puke in your bed after a hook up this may or may not be a personal story or example just have some spare sheets and maybe invest in some bleach or some thing to sanitize things sorry you got sick dude but on the bright side I\u2019ve been reading some of the posts on here and at least it sounds like you\u2019re making friends and having a good time which is a good thing",
