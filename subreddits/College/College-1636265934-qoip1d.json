  "text": "Do you know any organisations that are offering counselling for last year students, mainly for applying to foreign unis(Canada-Us-Europe)? I am seeking admission to the world's top universities, but at the moment the application process and deciding 100% what I want to study is daunting and causing me too much stress. So I am seeking help. Also, if anyone of you has already applied or admitted to MIT, ivies, canada's Top, or Uk, can you give me some advice or just anyone who has gone through the process of applying to foreign unis.Side note: I am located in lebanon.Thank youu",
