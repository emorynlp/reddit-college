  "text": "I understand that this is not a good option at times but you can graduate college with like a 2.3 GPA or something. Most employers and grad schools will look at that GPA and your chances of success are very low. If you take a second bachelor's degree, your old credits will transfer into the new one and it will take two years to complete the second bachelor's degree. Any thoughts?",

      "text": "This is absurd. Even if you want to get into a PhD program, which in general are much more picky about GPA than employers, you could successfully do so by retaking just the relevant undergrad courses and then \"leveling up\" by getting a master's degree.  \n\nUsually to get a second bachelor's, most schools require that your major is in a different area than your first degree and if you want a career in what your first degree is in then obviously getting a second bachelor's won't be of much help. In all seriousness, most people who are in the situation you described either 1) get a job despite their bad GPA, 2) get a master's to demonstrate that while they started out weak, they eventually learned the relevant material and then built on it, or 3) realize that they suck at what they initially wanted to do and change careers. \n\nWith regards to the latter, even this group usually just takes relevant prerequisites plus a masters for the new career instead of getting a second undergrad degree. Why waste time on an undergrad degree when getting a master's is often quicker and worth more on the market?",

You don't have to take so many classes that you get a second bachelor's-- you just need to take enough that admissions can see that you know your shit. \n\nIt's not uncommon for the 3.0 minimum requirement for a master's to be more of a recommendation than a requirement-- schools tend to look at a student's most recent performance and judge them based on that.\n\nThis isn't to say a sub-3.0 GPA is getting anyone into an Ivy any time soon, but there are a plethora of master's programs that take students with low GPA's. Schools will often offer conditional acceptance to these students, making it easier to kick them out if they perform badly early on. Still, an acceptance is an acceptance.",

Many are \"scams\" in that they are cash cows and accepting you for the money, but many of these \"cash cows\" also often offer a very good education and will just fail you if you can't keep up which sounds shitty but it's that weed-out that makes the degree valuable. Also, these are in-person programs that I'm familiar with (in STEM). \n\nIt's not a good idea to go to these programs if you're not prepared, but if you've gotten your shit together between undergrad and when you apply to one of these programs, then they are very valuable. Also, although these programs won't graduate you if you have a low GPA, they tend also to not kick you out (even if they say they will, because money). They string students along until they drop out, usually. So yeah, it is a scam in that sense, but again the degree itself is valuable if you can get decent enough grades that you can graduate.",
