Even if you want to get into a PhD program, which in general are much more picky about GPA than employers, you could successfully do so by retaking just the relevant undergrad courses and then \"leveling up\" by getting a master's degree.  \n\nUsually to get a second bachelor's, most schools require that your major is in a different area than your first degree and if you want a career in what your first degree is in then obviously getting a second bachelor's won't be of much help. In all seriousness, most people who are in the situation you described either 1) get a job despite their bad GPA, 2) get a master's to demonstrate that while they started out weak, they eventually learned the relevant material and then built on it, or 3) realize that they suck at what they initially wanted to do and change careers. \n\nWith regards to the latter, even this group usually just takes relevant prerequisites plus a masters for the new career instead of getting a second undergrad degree. Why waste time on an undergrad degree when getting a master's is often quicker and worth more on the market?", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632419622, "upvotes": 2}, "hdzgq4b": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptx2j9/people_who_graduated_with_a_gpa_less_than_30_why/hdzgq4b/", "text": "1) It is really expensive and you are also not working full time at the same time.
