  "title:": "Is taking Biology(+ Lab), Chemistry(+Lab), Psychology, English, and Japanese too much? I\u2019m a bit worried if my gpa will drop but also feel like it won\u2019t be that hard.",
  "text": "Since I\u2019m planning to transfer schools(about 50% acceptance rate or a bit lower), I\u2019m expecting my gpa to be close to 4.0\n* the Japanese course is extreamely easy(doesn\u2019t require to study out of class) also for chem lab\n\nACTUALLY these are the classes that I\u2019m taking this year already and those ends on December. My average for psyc is 94 and I definitely could\u2019ve done better. Should I drop or not?",

              "text": "oh i think i understand the question. Although i honestly am not sure, depends on how much time you getting and whether you can sustain that, remembering that these subjects get more complex each quarter. I will say you're doing exceptional for being able to make it with those classes already though!",
