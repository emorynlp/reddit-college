  "text": "This is my 2nd year doing full-online university. My lectures are online, live (not recorded) and a lot of professors get really mad if students don't turn on their cameras and waste half of the lecture complaining about it. What's your take on this?",

Plus having bad internet sucks up a lot of it.",

These are things you need to learn to do as an adult or else your employer will walk all over you. Learning to advocate for yourself is terribly fucking important.",
