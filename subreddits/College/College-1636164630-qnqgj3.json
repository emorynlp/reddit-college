  "title:": "Feel Like I\u2019m Not Smart Enough to be in College",
  "text": "The title says it all\u2026I\u2019ve had really bad self esteem issues for as long as I can remember, but since starting college this fall, it has gotten a lot worse. Over the summer I failed my math placement exam so because of that I was put in an introductory algebra class and I feel so stupid because it\u2019s basic concepts that I cannot understand at all. I literally don\u2019t know how I\u2019m passing the class. I also was doing the Pre-Med route and had to drop the intro to biology class that was required if I wanted to do Pre-Med because I didn\u2019t understand anything that was going on. And now since I\u2019ve made up my mind that I don\u2019t want to do Pre-Med anymore I don\u2019t know what I want to major in and it\u2019s causing my anxiety to go through the roof. Everyday I wake up with this horrible pain in my chest because I genuinely don\u2019t know how I got accepted into college. I feel so unprepared and stupid when doing assignments. I feel like a failure. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to survive these next 4 years.",
