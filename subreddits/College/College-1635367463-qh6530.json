  "text": "So I just got accepted into a state university that is three hours away from my hometown. I have two weeks left until deadline to decide whether to move away or stay in town :( \n\nI am currently in my junior year, throughout my high school year, I never really went to any social events with any friends. I moved to the U.S. when I was in middle school and stayed in the same suburban town since. The idea of moving away for college, and especially to the college that I got accepted to is exciting because it will open many opportunities for me (internships/friends/etc) \n\nHowever, the closer the deadline is, the more anxiety I built up. For people that moved away your hometown, did you end up enjoying the experience?",

      "text": "Meeting people and filling your nights with activities (*after* your homework!) will remove a lot of the anxiety during the first month.\n\nIt's hard for a lot of people but necessary. People move for college, move to start a job, move to emigrate, etc. Not something that is avoidable, you have to take some of the opportunities life gives you.\n\nThree hours is also not much at all if that's by train or car. Definitely possible to do weekend visits.",
