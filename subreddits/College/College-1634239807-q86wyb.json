  "text": "Hey everyone! I recently began a transfer from a SUNY to another SUNY while on a leave of absence due to personal/family reasons. I'm having a difficult time with the process because I'm uncertain when I should withdraw from my current school during the application process. I've already sent in my application to the other SUNY. Would it make sense to withdraw now without any guarantee I'll be accepted? Any insight would be helpful, super stressed at the moment.",

      "text": "Hey sorry to hear you are going through a tough time! I would recommend not withdrawing from your current school until you are accepted to your new school (unless it is your only option). Transfers can sometimes be tricky and schools often have transfer quotas that might already be met. I would try to extend your leave of absence while waiting for the application process to wrap up. It might also be helpful to reach out to your academic counselor and explain your situation - more often than not they are willing to help or at the very least point you in the right direction!",
