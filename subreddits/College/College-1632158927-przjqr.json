  "title:": "Switching majors from Computer Engineering to Computer information systems maybe?",
  "text": "So I\u2019ve been a computer engineering major for 3 years and I have found out I\u2019m really hate circuitry work. So my advisor told me I should look into something else if I really dislike what I do. I also am not crazy about coding so that\u2019s the reason on not just doing CS. I have done Calc 1-4, all my gen Ed\u2019s physics 1-2, Computer science 1&2 and some more into computer engineering. I want to work with computers or like tech in some how I just do not want to work with circuits what so ever and I\u2019m not a huge fan of coding as well. Im fine with minimal coding but any tips on what I should look into because right now I\u2019m looking at CIS but I\u2019m not certain I want to go into it yet.",

      "text": "I think CIS could be a good option if you want to do business/IT type work: setting up computer systems and using tech to address the needs of businesses. Another option could be computer science. I know you said you disliked programming, but depending on your curriculum, you may be able to take mostly computer science theory classes (advanced algorithms, cryptography, optimization, etc.) where there is little coding involved. Having that kind of mathematical background could qualify you for a lot of jobs in finance, tech, business, etc.",

I\u2019m still looking into CIS to see if it is right for me but integrating tech into business side of things sounds interesting that\u2019s why I looked into it. Just Computer engineering is way to hard and circuit work I really hate so I was wondering if there are any advice on any easier well paying degrees that are in the tech field. But computer systems analysis, data base administration, or like information security analysis. Maybe something like network management.",

It's employable. It's reasonably in demand.  \n\nBut your level of success in this field will depend on how well you like the activities and challenges you will encounter within the field.  \n\nA couple of good internships should do you a world of good to learning if you like this kind of work or not.  \n\nYour CE degree is perfectly valid preparation for a career in IT as well.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nYou might try reading some of these:  \n\n\n | \n---|\n[/r/ITCareerQuestions Wiki](/r/ITCareerQuestions/wiki/index) |\n[/r/CSCareerQuestions Wiki](/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/index) |\n[/r/Sysadmin Wiki](/r/sysadmin/wiki/index  ) | \n[/r/Networking Wiki](/r/networking/wiki/index) | \n[/r/NetSec Wiki](/r/netsec/wiki/index) | \n[/r/NetSecStudents Wiki](/r/netsecstudents/wiki/index) | \n[/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/](/r/SecurityCareerAdvice/) |  \n[/r/CompTIA Wiki](/r/CompTIA/wiki/index) | \n[/r/Linux4Noobs Wiki](/r/linux4noobs/wiki/index) | \n | \n**Essential Blogs for Early-Career Technology Workers** | \n[Krebs on Security: Thinking of a Cybersecurity Career?
