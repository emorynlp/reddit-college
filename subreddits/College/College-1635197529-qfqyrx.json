  "text": "I think I might end up hyperventilating. I can\u2019t fathom the idea of skipping class, never done it intentionally before, but I\u2019m keen on doing it now! Class starts in 5 mins.\n\nI know today that we\u2019ll have a sub, just a sub, and in my opinion, that\u2019s not very important. Might make myself feel better by going to study in the library instead, but anything other than going to the class, cause I 100% don\u2019t feel like it! Just, I didn\u2019t know what also to do, so I\u2019m expressing myself about it here.",
