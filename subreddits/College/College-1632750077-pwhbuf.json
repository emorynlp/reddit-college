I would have been like ten minutes late, but I didn't have a textbook for the class, and I figured it would be better to show up later but prepared rather than late and unprepared. The worst part was the door was locked and so my prof had to open it for me, but she was a chill professor and understood my excuse of being lost (it was a new building). Anyway, someone came in 15 min after me, so I wasn't the latest at least. \n\nIf you ever feel bad about being late though, a math prof of mine told us about a guy that came so late he missed the quiz. This wouldn't have been so bad if this was literally the only day he ever showed up. She had a policy that if you didn't show up/sign in at all for the first two weeks, she'd drop you, and he just managed to make the cut to stay and get a zero for the entire class", "author": "wishfulhermit", "created": 1632760857, "upvotes": 3}, "hehlb7g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwhbuf/what_is_the_latest_youve_ever_showed_up_to_a_class/hehlb7g/", "text": "I\u2019ve walked in an hour late to 1:15 long class", "author": "truthseeker3408", "created": 1632760206, "upvotes": 5}, "hehhn9n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwhbuf/what_is_the_latest_youve_ever_showed_up_to_a_class/hehhn9n/", "text": "It depends on the class size.
