  "text": "Hello everyone, I hope you are enjoying your time. \nI\u2019ve graduated from high school, and just as the title says, I\u2019m struggling to choose the right major, sometimes I feel like I want to be an engineer, other times a doctor, I feel hearing others advice might help me decide by knowing what I am going to study in medical college, and whether it would suit me. \nI\u2019m sorry for making this post long but I\u2019m really anxious and want help. \nThanks in advance",

      "text": "I wouldn't stress too much right now. You're going to be a freshman and it's pretty common for students to flip flop on majors during their freshman and sophomore years. I ended up changing mine 3 times. The key thing to remember is RESEARCH....RESEARCH....RESEARCH. I cannot stress this enough. If you know what you're about to get into and what to expect it will make your experience so much better. Take this time to maybe narrow down on a profession that interests you and then choose your major accordingly.",

      "text": "It is normal for someone to change their major multiple times. General ed classes are required to make a \"well rounded scholar,\" but it also helps to see what other subjects are out there. You may find that a business or accounting class is really interesting and want to pursue that, for example. That is why it is suggested to try not to take too many of your major courses in your first year in case you do change your major and it won't be wasted time.",
