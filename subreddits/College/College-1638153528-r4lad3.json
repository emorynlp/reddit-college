  "text": "I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how much study time this major typically requires. I added per course to the question since some people might be taking 3 courses in a semester, other might be taking 5 courses, etc. Peace!",

      "text": "1-3 hours per class depending on if we had an assignment or exam coming up. I was a pretty lazy student and naturally decent at math - either I got it in class or I didn\u2019t, studying rarely changed that for me. \n\nIt also depended on the level of math, type of math, and professors style. For me, the time outside of class was really dependent on assignments - if the professor gives homework or not would vastly change the time commitment for me. \n\nPretty sure I had classmates that spent 5+ hours per week. Probably was a 5 point difference in our grades. B+ or A- vs. A just wasn\u2019t worth the extra study time for me.",

      "text": "stats major, but taking math classes. got B+ in all of them except the lower level community college math classes.\n\nfor real, complex, numerical analysis class, at least 5 hours. homework is brutal because we get assigned problems out of rudin/stein&shakarchi, the hard(est?) books.\n\nfor optimization and upper division linear algebra, about 4 hours.\n\nfor the lower level math classes at community college, never over 2.  got A grades in all of these, though they honestly should have been B or B+ because of heavy curve (and no, the problems were not hard at all. I just did not really care about the classes due to some personal *issues,* and quite a few students were unbelievably lazy and refused to read the textbook for any reason).",
