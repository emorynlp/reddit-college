  "title:": "Why do people bring their bikes to college when they RARELY use them?",
  "text": "Has anyone else experienced this? Off campus it\u2019s far more prevalent, especially in majority college student apartments. The wee bike racks they have for large complexes FULL always, but there are always a good handful of rusted bikes with flat tires and webs that clearly have not moved in ages. \n\nI commute daily by bike, and while sure I have a spot, it\u2019s quite a hassle to wedge my bike in between the wall and other rack at my complex. Yet, it seems that at least 3 of the 5 bikes there barely have moved if at all - ones frame is rusting and has both tires popped, has been like this for months. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t going to use your bike, why have it there at all..?",

      "text": "At my school, everyone uses a bike or a scooter. That's mostly bc our parking is complete $h!t. I've never seen any bikes there for too long, although I did see a janitor come out and remove one with a bolt cutter cause it was double-locked and the kid forgot the combinations. Maybe you can ask them to remove the ones that don't move?",
