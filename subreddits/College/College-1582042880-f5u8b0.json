Remember, the GPA that you are saying you have now is what you can do WITHOUT managing a child.  That will change when you have a baby.  That is okay. \n\nA short answer to your question: No, having a child does not affect your chances of medical school or being interviewed.  Should you decide to apply, you should know what you are getting into.\n\n1)Before even getting accepted You will spend several thousand dollars taking the MCAT, applying to schools through MCAS, applying to the specific schools you are interested in, and traveling to interviews.  Throughout this time your supportive family may not be available to cover for one or all of these things (monetarily or time wise), all of which are essential for even application.\n\n2)Medical School is not the same as undergrad - it is undergrad on steroids.  There is a reason that if you are accepted you are not allowed to have another job.  Medical School is full time with between 60 and 80 hours a week of study in the first two didactic years and even more intensive during the last two years of clinical rotations and constant SHELF exams ( r/medicalschool and r/Residency).  Additionally, there is no flexibility in attending workshops, clinical reasoning cases, etc.  You will be REQUIRED to attend all excepted one or two, regardless of personal situations.  This is because all of these exercises are required to help you pass STEP\n\n3)After four years of medical school, to become an actual accredited physician, you will need to apply and be accepted to a residency program, which is not guaranteed even after you pass all your exams and finish your MD program.  Many medical students specifically time pregnancies around their residency transition or exit from residency to full attending, simply because the amount of time required to commit to residency.  With luck your child by this point is already in school, but you will not be able to participate in standard parent teacher interactions, drive them or pick them up on a regular basis, and get any sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:Yes you can apply and they can't discriminate based on your family status.  Regardless, having a child and entering and completing medical school are both life changing and full time commitments and unless you are willing to not see your child again until they are about 7 you can't realistically do both.", "author": "zegdba199", "created": 1582121982, "upvotes": 3}, "fi3l7d4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/f5u8b0/im_pregnant/fi3l7d4/", "text": "I don't think being pregnant and having a child will affect your chances of getting into medical school.
