  "text": "I'm 20m sophomore. I had a bad roommate experience last year and didn't really know anyone I wanted to room with for this year. Anyway I went random and have to room with people from my program. I was put it a suite with three other guys that are all older than me. My direct roommate is a senior that means he has alreadyestablishedhimselfon campus and has his own friends and does his thing. He also has a really intense major and is always doing work. He is a nice guy and good roommate, but we really don't ever talk or hangout or anything. It kinda stinks because I really want a roommate that I am friends with.",
