  "text": "At the age of 18, I embarked on a nonlinear journey of higher education at a local community college. I majored in graphic design because I really enjoyed the subject in high school and loved creating art throughout my childhood. However, after two semesters of major requirements, I realized it wasn't for me. I changed my major to general studies to get a sense of what I wanted to do, but I failed/withdrew because I worked a lot and quite frankly, my priorities weren't straight. I also failed to take care of myself. I just drowned my depression and responsibilities in music, stupid memes, and the occasional therapy session. My dad suggested to major in business because it's 'easy' and there's 'a lot you can do with it', so I followed suit. The following semester, I went back to school and took Principles of Marketing along with two core classes before transferring to university the following school year. I found the course work/lectures easy and engaging, and I was a lot less depressed at the time. \n\nThis university is reputable, close to home, and specializes in business. I felt thrilled to transfer to university at age 20, but not for the right reasons. I wanted to separate myself from my emotionally abusive dad (he's abusive to my mother, not me, but it's very traumatizing to overhear/witness the verbal abuse and depressing that intervention doesn't deescalate the conflict). My dad flies of the rails over the slightest inconvenience, he's probably bipolar, but refuses to seek professional help. I also looked forward to sleeping around, but I didn't socialize much and was quite terrified of sex until I lost my virginity this semester. \n\nI was enrolled full-time (15-18 credit hours per semester) and pretty much just went through the motions of college. My professors really like me and my work; I received fairly good grades, participated in class discussions, got internships, networked with professors and their colleagues. Overall, I have a pretty good life at the moment. I just don't think business is for me. I worked in marketing and B2B sales and found it disengaging and unfulfilling, my boss also took advantage of me with benefits and compensation. I think I might have ADD/ADHD because I cannot sit still from 9-5 and have a poor attention span in general. \n\nMy boyfriend is studying clinical psychology, and it's something that I deeply WISH I had pursued. He's going to obtain his master's in counseling in a few years and I'm jealous. I remember telling my mother in high school that I wanted to become a therapist, but she discouraged it because it requires further study. Despite my credit standing, I begged my mom to switch majors to psychology or behavioral science with a minor in women and gender studies, but it's not fiscally feasible and would take at least two years to complete that degree. \n\nWhat's sad is that my boyfriend could tell that I wasn't passionate about my major sophomore year and suggested to change it to psychology, but I didn't listen. I thought my lack of enthusiasm and depression was just me, because I've always been depressed. I'm taking Theories of Personality as an elective, and even the professor said I should've majored in psychology. I'm more engaged in the class than the psychology majors!\n\nI understand that it's possible to become a mental health counselor with a totally unrelated bachelor's degree, but I still feel so defeated and lost? I'm anxious and upset all of the time, I can't concentrate on studies. I don't feel like I've learned much over the past four years, and I don't have the money for an advanced degree. I feel guilty that I wasted my grandparent's inheritance on something I don't even want to pursue anymore. I reminded my mom about my dream of becoming a therapist, and she still discourages it, mostly because counselors don't earn much money. \n\nMy dad also believes psychology is a 'useless' degree, claiming that there are 'no jobs in psychology'.\n\nI told him that my boyfriend is aiming for a PsyD/PhD later in life, and he had the nerve to ask me what is he going to do with that...\n\n\"What can a doctor do?\"\n\nAnyways, I proposed a plan to my parents, which is returning to the community college for some perquisite courses for allied health admissions. I'm interested in becoming an occupational therapy assistant (very similar to what I actually want to do without breaking the bank for a master's degree), physical therapy assistant, or even massage therapy. Enrollment is limited and competitive, but I can probably get in with my GPA and a compelling self-essay.  \n\nMy parents aren't very happy with this swift career change, but I need to take control of my life. Maybe I'll become a LPC later in life.",
