  "text": "I\u2019m almost done with my first semester and I have zero friends. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to get into clubs and stuff so I can meet people but 80% of the clubs advertised on my school\u2019s organizations site don\u2019t exist, and out of the few that do that I\u2019m even remotely interested in, they\u2019re almost all during one of my labs so I can\u2019t even go to them. I\u2019m in one club right now but it gets canceled most of the time because they don\u2019t have a specific space reserved and can never find anywhere to meet. And it doesn\u2019t help that most people try to spend as little time on campus as possible. The huge student parking lot is 90% empty from 3pm on Friday to 7am on Monday. Most people I\u2019ve met are super negative and I don\u2019t want to be around people like that. I\u2019m really at a loss, I can\u2019t figure out a way to meet people I\u2019ll actually like. I\u2019m seriously considering transferring if it keeps up like this (not just for this reason, there\u2019s a bunch of things making me want to transfer, this is just a big one). Does anyone have any advice?",

I\u2019ve never connected w people from clubs so I can\u2019t comment on that\n\nWhatever you do don\u2019t try to force relationships, the best ones are formed naturally. I know it sucks :( but I pray you\u2019ll find your people soon",
