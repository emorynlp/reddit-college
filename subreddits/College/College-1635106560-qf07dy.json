  "title:": "Is it rude to my roommate to leave my dorm from Thursday-Sunday",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo I\u2019m in college in NYC right now with 1 roommate. My house is not too far from the city. Usually Thursday at noon, I head home after class and come back Sunday evening / night. I\u2019m wondering if maybe I shouldn\u2019t be doing this as I wonder if it\u2019s not courteous to do as it seems like lots of people stay in the city. The reason I go back is to see family, but I\u2019m also a Boyscout leader for my local troop as well as an EMT there and soon to be fire fighter so I also have to go to firefighting events. I just wander if it\u2019s rude to be gone for so long but at the same time I have commitments at home as said before. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",

      "text": "I get why you are asking. I only lived 30 minutes from my house when I lived in a dorm my freshman year. I didn\u2019t have a car at the time and I wanted to get the full college experience. However, during my 2nd semester I finally got a car and started driving home all the time. I missed my family and was really struggling mentally. I felt bad for my roommate cause she didn\u2019t really have any friends and there was something about leaving her by herself that felt wrong for some odd reason. But I think what\u2019s more wrong is if your roommate was upset about it. I know mine seemed very mopey every time I left. It sounds like you have some major responsibilities(which is great btw). Even if you didn\u2019t though, you aren\u2019t obligated to stay there. If they\u2019re a good person, they\u2019ll understand why you have to leave.",
