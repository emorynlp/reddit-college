  "text": "My roommate has been telling me that I snore, apparently so loudly and powerfully that I wake him up several times throughout the night.  \n\nLet me say, i have **absolutely no history of snoring**.  None at all.  I didn\u2019t snore at camp, i didn\u2019t snore at home, i didn\u2019t snore last year, and when i sleep over at my boyfriends or other friends, they told me after I asked that I don\u2019t snore.  \n\nToday he told me that my snoring woke him up a couple times last night, including at 3 o\u2019 clock, which I know is BS, because **i was still awake then** (and he was fast asleep).   He keeps telling me that he wants to record me while I sleep, which i\u2019m definitely not comfortable with.\n\nWhat the hell am I supposed to do?",

There's some stuff you get to help with snoring(something worn while sleeping iirc) . Not sure if it's for sleep apnea or snoring but apparently it helps both the person who snores and others (it reduces it or something apparently). But it may require professional opinion.",

      "text": "Just speaking from my own experience, I'd be wary of this as a bad sign. I agree with others, download an app to see if you snore. It's not impossible that your sinuses have developed an issue you haven't yet noticed, or something. I was being abused at home and my abuser said I was always loud and would claim I was screaming when I was in my room silently writing essays. Later threatened to kill me and the biggest warning sign was that they created little problems and then gaslit me about it. Just be cautious and get a new roomie situation if it escalates in any way.",
