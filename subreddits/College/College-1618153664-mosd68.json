I took this weekend off to grieve, but I know life doesn't stop for anyone. I need to get back to it. \n\nI want to learn from your tips, and anything helps.

I'm going to be happy if i can avoid repeating a course. \n\nOne thing is: you are going to have to learn to accept that feeling of bothering the professor to get them to actually teach you. Oh, is this the \"office hours\" or the \"conference time\" you announced? Because i am the only one here, it looks like i woke you up for this, and it seems like you would love for me to GTFO so you can get on with your day. \"No...no. ... no no. This is this time i am contractually obligated to have to interact with students, so if you hurry up and tell me your question, i can mark this ticket solved.\"\n\nThat is the biggest hurdle for me. Instead of the class environment (that i am still being charged for) where i can ask questions, hear others questions, take notes, and get a real feel for what the professor expects out of assignments, I have to come crawling for help and force someone to their webcam to handhold the one dum dum that isn't getting it.... or at least that is how it feels a lot of the time. \n\nWhat i'm going to have to learn i guess, is to power through and be assertive enough to go through all the hoops, make all the appointments, write the emails, and demand my education. \n\nI know what you are talking about. Even the Zoom classes are a very limp wrist variant of the real deal. It is always a \"ok, lets get through this\" type of deal. \n\nI went in this with the plan in my head that i was going to resort to online class as little as possible and go with \"ground\" 100% of the time if possible.

Stop lying to yourself that you can cover this much portion in this much time , and then allot the time to a portion double than that you anticipated , like if you think it takes an hour to do it , allot 2 hours for it , 2. Put on some music from the need for speed games in the background , this might sound weird but it works as good as duct tape over a small leak over procrastination , 3. If you have strong will and are able to handel an insult to yourself than write a insulting quote to yourself which might come to life if you fail , now remember this 3rs point is completely optional , aand not meant for ppl with low morale , 4. Just keep the phone away . 5. Try to do as much as flow charts as possible , works for me as I have good graphic memory and I am able to recall the whole theory with just a hinting word in the flow chart . See if it works for you , flow charts are the best , especially for mechanical engineering, they are life savers, 6. They say spite is the best motivator , and I agree, if you can't get to concentrate so it out of spite , I do this , my parents aren't happy with my ways of studying a day before exam , but frankly I get good marks , rank good in class , and it pays off , and I so retent stuff after exams , so it works for me , I do it my spite for my parents to give them the \"I told ya so !\" And goddaamn it it's satisfactory to all bounds , I do have a good relationship with them , but that moment , described above, is satisfactory , all the benifits in exchange for a 2 nights complete sleep instead I just sleep 3 hours at night and 2.5 in day , and it's worth it , write the exam and come home and sleep again , that's it , 7. Do the spite thing on repeat :-) , hope this helps\n\nPS : this all I do are on my part , like the other person said , talking to your parents helps , you may talk to them about your situation ,it will help , if you don't want to talk about it , then talk about something else , may e cry over a dead pet or something with them , but pls talk , parent's voices have a calming effect , just have a heart to heart with them not dependent on the topic , just pick one\n\nPS2: I will tell you , I was preparing for jee mains + jee advanced , away from home , did my best for 2 years , wasn't ever happy , felt like a burden , I got swine flu in the end of 1st year , in the treatment process I lost my hearing , which I don't know is temporary or not , doctors told me I couldn't continue with coaching , I came back to home town , took the rest of the year off that is from March end to Oct end , and just did what I wanted to all the timepass one can do , then I joined school in nov for 12th class , teachers told me that I would fail the boards or not score good marks if did them this year , and were almost on the line for making me skip this year , then our principal being a nice man , took a gamble and allowed me to attempt , I studied the whole syllabus for pcm course by myself in 3 months with the above tricks except the music part ( can't hear lol) and still got 73 % all by myself , in 3 months , and if you see , this is relatively a ginormous amount of syllabus I am talking , all in 3 months , so mate why did I do this? Out of spite to teachers who underestimate me , ( except our physics teacher , he was very good ) , they used to give me a disgusting look , and used to disrespect my parents, in PTAs etc , that day I swore I will give all teacher a told you so look at the very spot , and well then I did , spite is the best motivator for achieving goals , just don't let it spiral out of control , thanks for reading :-)\n\nI am now studying in one of the best colleges in my region , and mechanical engineering is what I chose", "author": "angaddeepsingh", "created": 1618196492, "upvotes": 1}, "gu7qwsc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mosd68/to_those_maintaining_a_gpa_above_35_how/gu7qwsc/", "text": "I\u2019ll be graduating with a 3.98 GPA (two A-s).

(also, this only really feels like it works when i write stuff down on paper, but that part i think is more just on my end. whatever works for you!)\n\nyou can also apply this to assignments in particular, though! and that can be writing out an overview of all the assigned work due in, say, the next week, OR that can be writing out all the specific steps you\u2019ll need to do for a certain assignment- this is most useful to me for a project like an essay, since just saying \u201cwrite this essay by tuesday\u201d is WAY too general & my brain sees that lack of specific starting point and makes it really hard for me to even think about working on the assignment.\n\nso, what i\u2019d do to combat that for a medium-big project like that (after i\u2019ve already realized i\u2019m avoiding the assignment, which is usually the hardest part, whoops) is get out my notebook & find a page in there to be the project to-do, create a new doc for the project on my laptop for the actual writing, then go to the assignment page and write down on my to-do things like required word/page/paragraph count, to get a handle on the scope of the assignment & how long it might take to write (since i know when i have things to say, i can write maybe 800-1000 words an hour). then, i\u2019d look at the project topic. is it free choice? i\u2019d write down on my project to-do something like \u201cspend 15 minutes brainstorming project topics\u201d. is it a research paper? i\u2019d write down how many sources my professor wants as a minimum, as well as (once i have a topic) to spend, say, an hour looking for information on my topic, tossing links i\u2019d like to use back to my project doc. maybe another thing i\u2019d have would be if the project assignment has an outline provided, i\u2019d transfer that to my project doc, but if it doesn\u2019t, i\u2019d put on my to-do to take 15 minutes and draft a rough outline. (outline here literally meaning like, intro + body paragraph + body paragraph + conclusion + bibliography, but written out vertically so i can organize ideas in bullet points)\n\nmy point being, especially when breaking down a big project, the most important part is making things into tasks that are quantitative not qualitative where possible. so, writing down to spend X time working on something that doesn\u2019t have its own start & end point (like reviewing for a test) or taking large but well defined tasks and, if you think you\u2019re still reluctant to start that item, you can write out the individual steps of it to make it more approachable.\n\nbut, honestly, the version i use more often is just the larger overview list of all my assignments- expanding something out like that is really helpful if brain fog has me stuck in place, but i don\u2019t need to use it every time.\n\n\nTLDR! the organizational system i use to combat my executive dysfunction involves making sure i\u2019m keeping track of to-do items and ongoing assignments on paper (more importantly, not just keeping them in my brain). in addition, recognizing when i\u2019m having trouble working on a project because it doesn\u2019t have a concrete starting point, & from there sitting down and working out what the individual steps for that assignment would be.\n\ni\u2019d also SUPER recommend trying to have assignments done and turned in by 24 hours before they\u2019re due, or working on at least small tasks for each of your classes every day.\n\ni can tell i got UNBEARABLY ramble-y with this post... uh, my bad! i hope at least i could help you out :-) let me know if you have any questions about my setup o/", "author": "unlinkings", "created": 1618191623, "upvotes": 1}, "gu7ggam": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mosd68/to_those_maintaining_a_gpa_above_35_how/gu7ggam/", "text": "Honestly?

Don't let that time go to waste. \n\nTry to look at new material before class. My goal is to have an idea about what the lecture is about before the lecture. This gives me a chance to learn new vocabulary before trying to apply that vocabulary to concepts. It lets me prepare for a math heavy lecture by getting familiar with formulas ahead of time. It also gives me a chance to see what areas I might have questions about, which helps me ask better questions in, before or after class. \n\nI try to look at all my classes everyday. If I'm not working on something else for a class (assignments, test prep, quizzes), I'll still take 5 minutes to flip through something related to the class. Sometimes it means looking at old notes, writing down formulas that I need to memorize, reviewing a lab procedure, revisiting a topic I struggled with, reviewing old quizzes, or skimming the next chapter in the book before lecture.

In reality it only take 15-20 minutes day to look at material for 3 or 4 classes, assuming I'm working on material or was in class for my other classes. \n\nUse the test prep materials. If the professor posts materials, use them. I've found that my professors have a pretty good idea of what will be on their test Those materials have always been valuable study aids for me.

If you knew everything about it, you wouldn't be in that class. I email my professors constantly with clarifying questions, advice, etc. I see so many people feel ashamed or too shy to ask questions to their professor. That's what the professor is there for, so ask them, even if you feel like it's the dumbest question you could be asking. The professor can judge you all they want, but if you benefit from asking that dumb question, then it's 100% worth it. \n\n2) Take a day off. Every quarter, I try to find one day a week where I do nothing related to school. I do not log onto Canvas, I don't take notes or do assignments, I just spend the entire day bumming around and doing what I enjoy doing. I typically plan these days on days that I know have no classes, no assignments due, etc. If you don't have a day where you have nothing that is due / can't do nothing, then take an evening off. For example, let's say you have a class at 10AM till 11AM and then have an assignment due on the same day. Go to your class, do the assignment, then take the rest of the day off and just do shit that you like. This helps a lot with the feeling of burnout.

I will say this, gpa is NOT an indication of how good you are at that subject, I have seen plenty of other students who are much, much better at math and CS than me with more success outside the classroom (finding internships and etc) with lower gpas. I think probably the biggest determinant of gpa is how much time you put in / how much you care about grades. To be honest I wasn't expecting to have a 4.0 in college (I had a 3.8-9 ish in a small rural highschool so I wasn't expecting much), and I don't really care that much about maintaining a perfect gpa (I am not planning on going to grad school at the moment). However what I am motivated by is the fact that I am at college to learn and make the most out of my time. I took a few years between high school and college due to personal reasons and I found myself reflecting on myself whether or not college was really worth it. But after my acceptance to a program I was interested in I made sure that I remembered why I was here to begin with, and that I would make sure that I was getting my money and times worth in college. I also wanted to form good habits for the future since I was motivated not to be like myself during the gap years where I basically wasted my time all day doing next to nothing (my own laziness ended up motivating me lol). Remembering these things are what keeps me motivated to try my best in any class, I would encourage you to do something similar is thinking about why you are at college and finding meaning in the position you are in now.\n\nAlso some other really useful tips\n\nGet sleep - sleep is the human superpower, your brain needs it, you need your brain to study, so get good sleep. I have never once pulled an all nighter (even when I had 4 exams and 3 projects due in one week).\n\nStart on assignments early - it baffles me how many people start 3 week projects 2 days before the due date and then complain to the professor that they don't have enough time. I make sure to read the project/assignment descriptions when it is released, do a little bit of work, and spend more chunks of time working on the assignment as the due date approaches. This is much more efficient and effective for your learning\n\nHave fun - allocate some time for exercise, hobbies, and socializing. I am a strong introvert but I try to have at least about an hour or more a day doing these things. COVID has really made it hard to socialize but I hope to actually go to some campus events when I return to campus in future semesters.

Do what you can to push the worries out of your mind for a bit and find an activity that you can immerse yourself in for a set period of time. Gaming, painting, jogging, whatever floats your boat. Use this time to recharge, and don't allow yourself to feel guilty about not doing work. Entering that \"flow state\" can be great for your physical and mental health. (I recommend the book *Flow* by  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, it does a great job of explaining this.)\n\n**Organization:** Some people are naturally organized, others not so much. I recommend that at a bare minimum you have one, if not more, lists/calendars to keep track of assignment due dates so that none sneak up on you. I use Google Calendar to keep track of classes/events, Trello and a physical planner to stay on top of due dates, and a scrap sheet of paper to map out individual dates. At the beginning of each semester, look at your due dates on the syllabus and jot them down on your physical planner. It may take an hour or two to get through all of them, but it will make your life so much easier. The bulk of stress from a lot of students results from missing deadlines or waking up in the middle of the night and remembering that assignment due at 11:59pm. You don't need this additional stress. I personally set \"fake deadlines\" 24-48 hours before the actual assignment is due. It can be tricky to keep yourself accountable at first, but it provides a great cushion for any of life's challenges. Technical issues? No worries, you have time to fix it. Got invited out with friends? No problem, you don't need to say \"sorry I have an assignment due tonight\" anymore. Feeling burnt out and not in the mood to do it? Give yourself the night off and try again in the morning. I attribute a lot of my success to this method.\n\n**Self-Awareness:** At the core of it all, know your needs. Don't sacrifice your health or the things you love for your grades. This is something I am still working on myself. At the end of the day, you are only in college once. Allow yourself to enjoy it, however that may be. Maybe that's time with friends, trying new things, going to a new club, travelling. Whatever it is, don't fall into the lie that \"I'm too busy.\" There will be weeks where you legitimately have to miss out because of a barrage of assignments or exams, but this should not be every week. Allow yourself to breathe, enjoy life, and prioritize your health whenever possible. \n\nCollege is hard. Life is hard. But you can manage it, one step at a time. Find strategies that work for you to stay on top of these three things, and I guarantee you will have a much better time.

I'm 2 years out from finishing my PhD. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety disorder, and major depression. Here are my rules.\n\n**1) Always aim for legitimate self improvement in your work**. A lot of students, I feel, come at school work with the mentality that the goal is to do just enough work with minimum of effort to snag a \"good enough grade\" (naturally more academically talented people tend to do this more often, probably because they have the ability to inuit how to do it and what is required for \"good enough\").\n\nThis is a bad mindset, instead come at your work with a mindset of self improvement. **When you sit down to work say to yourself, \"my goal isn't to get an A.\" Instead tell yourself, \"my goal is to really understand this new concept / commit to memory these formulas / do something I haven't done before.\"** In this way you are not only actually developing the skills and knowledge you're paying a dick load in tuition to acquire, but you are crafting yourself into someone with specific specialized knowledges and abilities. If you do this the grades will follow.\n\n**2) Understand you don't have to go to college, you get to go to college.** You don't have to be here, only a small fraction of people globally get to go. So come at the process with an understanding that it is a privilege, not have to do. This attitude has helped me immensely.\n\n**3) Corollary to that, you don't have to go to college to get a nice job.** There are plenty of jobs you don't need a degree to do that pay well, you can be a plumber, a manager of a store, a nurse, etc. If you are seriously unhappy doing the kind of work you do in college you are likely to be extremely unhappy doing that work outside of college. So, unless you actually like what you are doing consider changing courses. Obviously you won't love what you're doing all the time, and there are parts which you just hate, but if you overall really don't like it you don't have to do it. You can also switch majors, I did my associates, bachelors, masters, and PhD in different fields. Around my masters I finally felt like I was settling into my niche, just took a minute.\n\nI liked computers so I started as a comp sci student, realized I was more into studying how people used computers than programing them so I switched to a field that let me dive more into that. You will get better grades doing something you like instead of something you hate. Equally, everything is marketable. You'll hear something like \"why would you get a history degree rather than an engineering degree.\" Well, an absolutely masterful historian is going to be much more employable than an engineer who barely graduated.\n\n**4) Get things done ahead of time.** Nine times out of ten if I fucked something up I did so because I didn't give it enough time. If your assignment is due on a Friday, tell yourself it is due on Wednesday. That way you have wiggle room incase something isn't working.\n\n**5) Work on something each day.** Starting something is often the hardest part of doing it. If you sit down each day and work a little on your commitments the work comes so much easier. It's hard to sit down and work for 3 hours the day before an assignment is due, watching the time tick closer to the due date. What's not hard is sitting down for 30 minutes day and doing a little bit of work a week before hand.\n\n**6) Build a support network and pick the right people.** I had my partner all throughout college rooting for me and helping me out. I made good relationships by visiting professors (during office hours) and those people became my friends who helped me out (one professor of mine drove me to take a important test after my car broke down). I hung out with people who had the right priorities (mostly).\n\n**7) Build real relationships with your professors.** I read a study a while back that said students who sit in the front two rows of classes get about 5% higher grades in classes where the primary grade scheme was qualitative instead of quantitative (like the difference between an essay and a multiple choice worksheet). The study's writers suggested this was because the professors could put a name to a face when grading which caused a subconscious bias. It makes sense, you like people you're familiar with more than those you aren't. So, get to know your professors. Go to office hours to ask questions. You're developing that familiarity while also getting advice on how to proceed in each class.\n\nThis turned into a bit of a rant, but I really think these tips, particularly number 1 and number 4, are principally responsible for my success (knock on wood) in college.\n\n*Edit: Oh, and rule 8.

It sounds like a really rough time and I want you to know it is perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Going off of that, let me just say that college is **hard*****.*** I am a current junior and the main reason for my being able to sustain a gpa above 3.5 is because early on I learned a few different things about succeeding in college. I am a humanities major, so I can't say if these tips will help, but I hope that they'll at least alleviate some of your current pressure.\n\n* Know that your gpa and grades are not the end all be all of your education. I personally do stress out a lot about my grades, but one thing that helps to alleviate my anxiety is to look at the current job qualifications for any career I may interested. Also, it helps to keep in mind, you can cherry pick your gpa to some extent. Say you had a bad class or semester. You can choose to focus on the classes within your major or even just the classes that may be relevant to whatever job your applying for and report the gpa for that. \n* Take advantage of your college's resources! This may seem obvious, but for me, it seems that a majority of the different resources offered by most colleges are severely underused. I'm sure you've heard it before, but go to office hours, talk with your counselor, visit with your dean. Even if you're on a scholarship, you still are paying the college by spending a portion of your life there, so take advantage of it!\n* If you don't feel comfortable or have the energy to take advantage of the in-person resources, go through your college's website. Most colleges have a good range of online resources that students can take advantage of, everything from time management to homework assistance to long term goals outlines. \n* Don't feel the need to go above and beyond for every single assignment. My college is fairly reading intensive and if I read every single assignment critically, I would spend upwards of 6 hours a day just reading. Instead, use the most invaluable piece of information a professor will give you every semester: the syllabus.\n* In my personal opinion, college syllabi are the ultimate cheat sheet. They (should) outline the minimum amount of work to pass or what you need to do succeed. They give assignment expectations, deadlines for exams and let you get an idea of what the professor bases the most on. For me, I loathe class discussion but if I see the professor places a lot of weight on in class discussion, I will take the time to make sure I have enough to say to meet that requirement. This also plays into my last point about assignments. The syllabi let you which portion of the class you need to put the most effort in and once you understand that, you can figure out how to portion out your time accordingly.\n* It is perfectly okay to take the easy route on some assignments. Sometimes everything just seems to come piling up all at once and you end up feeling overwhelmed. If you are ever in that situation, take 15 or so minutes to write out which assignments matter the most in the long run using some of the tips I mentioned above. If two courses have equally important assignments according to their syllabi, then go with the one that is more important to your future goals.\n* Take the time to reflect on yourself. This to me is the biggest indicator of how successful you can be during college. Are you the kind of person who needs a good deal of social interaction or do you need a chunk of quiet time to collect your thoughts? Is your dream day off a day in solitude or spent surrounded by others? How much sleep do you need to feel okay? What reenergizes you, eg. video games, Netflix, taking a walk, sports, chatting with friends? By understanding your limitations and needs, you can start to build up your life around those. If you have trouble developing this kind of mindset, try talking with a counselor if your school provides them or look into any similar programs that your school may offer. Remember, your gpa means nothing if it destroy your health to get it.\n\nI'm going to be a bit blunt. The classes who have entered and will be entering college in the next few years have come into an extremely shitty situation. Like I said at first, college is hard and online college is even worse if your school has never had a program online before. Even ignoring the online factor, it can be stressful, depressing, and seem like it will never end. But it is also supposed to be a time of self discovery. And in the end if you feel like the best route is to either take some time away to collect your thoughts or rework your game plan, that is completely acceptable. Never fall into the mindset that college or your gpa is something that controls your life. Your secondary education is meant to support your growth, and if it's not doing that, then take a step back and reevaluate. No matter what, in the end what matters is you as individual, existing in this crazy world, not you as a student of X University.

Even if you stop working after that, you worked for 20 minutes. And generally speaking I keep going for longer than that. I often have trouble paying attention in class because online lectures have so little sensory input (it's like watching a movie). So I do something with my hands whenever I'm not taking notes, and that helps. I recommend knitting or silly putty.\n\nAlso, cut yourself slack if you can't do something or get a bad grade. I know from experience that that's easier said than done, but if you get into the mindset of \"I'm a bad slacker and I'm so late getting started\", you'll demotivate yourself. Starting yesterday would have been better than starting now, but starting now is better than tomorrow.\n\nEdit: Also, if anyone's still reading, here's your proof that you need to cut yourself slack: I was a straight A/A+ student despite taking 5 classes and working 20 hours a week until online classes started. Now I work 12-15 hours a week and get A-'s and B's. I just turned in an assignment late and probably wrong. I reduced my workload and still can't do as well as I used to. No one on the planet is producing their top work right now.
