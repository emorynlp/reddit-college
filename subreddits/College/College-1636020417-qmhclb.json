  "text": "Hey, I'm a freshman on Computer Science and recently I've found out that I barely learn anything in class and I prefer studying alone at home instead in a room with people, using the same notes that the professor is using in class. I just see attending a way of wasting my time that I could be using way better at home, going through a lot more material and actually understanding it.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Should I continue studying from home or should I  start attending classes?  I feel bad because everyone else is in class even though they feel like they don't understand anything and I'm at home trying to figure things out by myself.",

      "text": "Do whatever you think best.\n\nHowever, as a faculty member (in the United States, not Europe), I will simply say that I have known many, many students over my career who frequently skip class and only later (usually when it's too late to master the material) wish they had attended the lectures more regularly.  I haven't known any students who attended class and then later wished they hadn't.  In my personal experience (which I think is fairly common among faculty), there is a clear correlation between frequent lecture attendance and better grades.",
