You\u2019ll need them for later.\n\nOnce you get out, you\u2019ll see that work friends while friendly aren\u2019t necessarily the best people to have around all the time. Not because of them as people, but just because when you chill, you can\u2019t help but think about work. And/or your usually at work when you even see them. It\u2019s good to have a backup network of friends that you can just chill with that aren\u2019t solely work related. And shocker, unfortunately, this group will dissolve over time slowly as everyone\u2019s life will become more complicated. So, if in college you could walk away with a solid group of people that you could later chill with, that\u2019ll probably buy you 10 years or so, outside of college socially, so that you could socially coast through your later 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s before the chapter of marriage, family, children, and career start to complicate things. \n\nI\u2019m saying this as someone who took a different route. Went to college after high school, dropped out. Over my stretch of experiences, I bounced around from friend group to friend group, job to job, before coming back; by the time I did, I didn\u2019t really have a solid group. It wasn\u2019t really a bad thing at least for me, I was used to it; but if I had the choice, it would\u2019ve been great to still have one. Meanwhile, the old friends of mine have been out of college for like 7 years, they\u2019re approaching 30, still hang out with their college buds. While I don\u2019t necessarily regret dropping out, I do regret not taking advantage of the fact that at that time, the playing field was pretty much level in terms of maturity and low risk. Everyone was like late teens/early twenties, the age gaps were negligible, and life was simple. Plus, at a university, depending on the location, the students are all pretty much stuck there lol. So, there has to be at some point, probably frequently, indirect mass gatherings of early twenty-somethings all mingling around, in the same general situation, sharing points of interest common with one another lol; some even so much as in the same major!!!\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect storm for making friends. \n\nSo, with that. I\u2019d just get involved with your university. Use all the resources they give the students to be social to your advantage. This could be clubs, fraternities/sororities, parties, events, sports, research, activism, meet up groups, inter murals, academics, etc. anything where you can get around some kind of group of people and interact. And then just make the most bad ass friend group you can. And then onward after university, continue in this pursuit to make an even larger badass friend group. And then use that group for that pre-33 \u201ccollege 2.0 experience\u201d", "author": "pekkalacd", "created": 1625515477, "upvotes": 2}, "h3d94zi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o8y8q3/anyone_else_entering_their_final_year_feeling/h3d94zi/", "text": "literally just was anxious about this today", "author": "nakedmolerat12", "created": 1624915566, "upvotes": 1}, "h3d6spw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o8y8q3/anyone_else_entering_their_final_year_feeling/h3d6spw/", "text": "i started college 2019 and my first year was derailed by covid by the end. my second was online and now due to trying to get ahead while in HS, I\u2019m entering my final year. it\u2019s hard to deal with how much I know I\u2019m going to miss", "author": "Floor_Subject", "created": 1624914527, "upvotes": 2}, "h3atn4z": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o8y8q3/anyone_else_entering_their_final_year_feeling/h3atn4z/", "text": "I'm starting my 3rd year and already feel it", "author": "eamarwan", "created": 1624868381, "upvotes": 1}, "h3at4ev": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o8y8q3/anyone_else_entering_their_final_year_feeling/h3at4ev/", "text": "Do some shit.
