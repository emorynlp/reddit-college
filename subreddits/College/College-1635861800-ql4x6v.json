  "text": "I\u2019m 21F, a college student. I\u2019ve worked part time jobs every school break. I still receive allowance from my parents despite being old enough as I don\u2019t have a job now since full time college started & I\u2019m financially dependent on my parents. My college fees are paid through student loans. \n\nSince I was born, I\u2019ve had the habit of saving money and not spending much. I save at least half of my allowance. Now at 21, I have $20k in my bank account. This winter, I am finally spending my money for once through a month long overseas exchange. However as I go about planning my trip - flight tickets, accommodation, overseas school fees etc, I\u2019m getting extremely anxious due to the costs. They add up to about $5k and maybe more. I\u2019m trying to be tight with my budget this trip but at the same time I want to enjoy myself to the fullest like other students. After this trip, I would be left with about $15k which isn\u2019t that bad. But I\u2019m worried about things like paying back student loans. I know when I graduate and get a full time job I will pay it back, but I\u2019m still anxious spending so much for one trip. I\u2019m excited and happy, but this is just a looming worry. \n\nCan anyone - college students, adults, anyone - give advice / encouragement on how I can stop worrying? Or are my worries valid? Thank you.",

It is possible to work a part time job while in school so you should probably do that. You\u2019re in a very privileged position to have 20k in the bank and get money from parents.

                  "text": "A Roth is a type of IRA investment account, not an actual investment. The same way a checking account itself is not the actual money and you have to make deposits into it. They are just containers basically. Checking account holds cash. Roth can hold cash, mutual funds, stock, property, land, patents, etc. You can put a mutual fund in a Roth IRA and would do so for tax benefits among other reasons. You put money in the Roth and then have the Roth (as an entity) buy the investment.\n\nI would tell OP to keep most of it liquid for now. Or at least use an HYSA as the main account. Maybe take advantage of a couple new account bonuses too that go by opening deposit. They will need access to that money in the future for moving, security deposit, expenses before first paycheck, etc. Would keep at least 50% liquid.\n\nWould never recommend individual equities for someone that is not passionate. Mutual funds and ETFs are the way to go if OP doesn't want to make investing a part-time job.",

Individual stocks require research and using a financial advisor says you aren't willing to learn about a few basic target date plans and invest it yourself. That's just my take on it, would rather save money and do the same thing the advisor would do myself. Really the benefit is hand holding.",
