  "title:": "transferring out to another college? need some advice",
  "text": " hey guys my situation isn't really that unique but I need some advice. Transferred to a small liberal arts university from community college and do not like it at all. My major's department is very small and electives are so few, most are offered every other year with only one time slot and professor. On this part yeah I was kind of an idiot I didn't do enough research I just looked at avg SAT and was cocky. Tried joining different clubs but they meet sporadically, only one of them meets once a week so I really don't know anyone. Also don't have a roommate in my upperclassmen dorm (they cancelled right before) and there is no floor community at all I've only seen the RA once at the beginning of semester and everybody closes their doors. Feels like a hotel more than a dorm. So I'm of course thinking about transferring to a new university but I'm afraid things will be even worse starting in the spring term. Somedays I think I can grin and bear this only 1.5 years to go with seasonal breaks I'll be just fine, but other days I think I can't live like this. Can't believe I'm complaining about receiving a college education, but I'm just not happy. What are your thoughts?",
