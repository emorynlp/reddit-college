Even if I were making that effort, what are the odds I'd suddenly have met some amazing guy or made a new best friend within these past few months? Probably very slim, since it's easy to meet people, but much, much harder to meet the right people!\n\nI also strongly believe that everything will happen when it is supposed to happen, and not necessarily on my schedule. That doesn't always feel good, but I think we can certainly make the most of our time, in the present, and focus on what we do have now, rather than what we don't have (yet). :) We are only 22 after all, and we really have so much to look forward to in the years ahead.",

So no, to me this is pretty ideal. My advice, learn how to be happy by yourself and with the close friends you already have. You can\u2019t let your happiness be dependent on other people.",

Dating after college when people have careers to talk about, some change to spend and ACTUAL free time (evenings and weekends) are where it\u2019s at. Though, both men and women have a lot of hormones in their twenties but not necessarily the emotional maturity to handle them/relationships, so be careful and have fun! Don\u2019t sweat not dating in college. I cringe to think I would have ended up with any of the guys I was with then (and my early/mid 20s for that matter)",

Hell, I feel as if it might be easier since there may be less drama and more and more people are seeking long-term and serious relationships.\n\nDon't let the pandemic bring you down. If it makes you feel better, I'm 20 years old and I've never dated before. But use this time to work on yourself and be the best version of yourself that you can possibly be. Be the person that you would date. Whether it be picking up a new hobby, learning a new language, volunteering, or exercising and eating right, there are many things on this planet that you can do to improve yourself. I'm not saying you aren't already awesome, but be the best you can be is all I'm saying!\n\nAnd please don't feel like you're in this rush to find a partner. It'll come. I promise you.",

Never partied (college parties) i guess. I\u2019ve always done a lot of things on my own. \n\nI ended up getting Covid back in June and went on a traveling spree thereafter recovering/isolation.\n\nI just did a meetup group (with 15 random strangers) where we wore masks at camp and what not to take precautions. I did the trip to get out, not to find anyone to date just because everyone was older than me. I typically will go out to a bar or an outdoor event to meet up people. I do concerts (prior to Covid) by myself and am not afraid to strike a conversation with people. Whether it\u2019s just platonic or actually trying to get a girl\u2019s number for something down the line. \n\nUnderstand that Covid doesn\u2019t have a high death rate (not saying it\u2019s not dangerous, clearly 220k people are dead in the US) but you gotta live. I\u2019ve been to multiple states, took solo trips and met friendly people. \n\nNow with dating, people are still going out. Just lay some ground rules until you feel comfortable. You could do a FaceTime, Meetup with masks on, but either way work on yourself and when you\u2019re ready take a jump into trying to go on dates. \n\nI don\u2019t really have regrets as I\u2019ve been sexually actively before but it\u2019s been 2 years since a consistent relationship one. So yeah I\u2019d like to get back to that and what not but I honestly prefer solid group of friends and family.",

      "text": "I feel you g. look at it this way, you're early 20s and dating the wrong person is literally a waste of time - like most people in a relationship spend a significant proportion of time together, and when it doesn't work out it's like 'well fuck'. In that regard, you haven't missed out on anything (sorry if the way i explained that is weird im drunk af). Whoever you might've not dated bc of covid, ah well you just gotta look forwards from now on.\n\nYou never know what could've happened, you only got time ahead of you so might as well make the most of it.\n\nDon't go outta your comfort zone just bc you want to experience dating at uni, it's no different from dating when you've got a proper job in a years time.\n\nTo sum up OP, what im tryna say is 1) relationships aren't to be forced for the fuck of it if you wanna be serious, otherwise you both are wasting your time 2) for sure put yourself out there, but don't feel like you have to do anything just bc you wanna you fulfill uni-life expectations.\n\nbest of luck from a fellow single lady (unless you're a gay guy, then gl from a random lady) x",

Though if you are ever in a position to offer her counsel, particularly when she asks for it, I say be honest with how concerned you are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou also have, in most normal scenarios, to support your friend, and to trust them to eventually make the right choices. You have to trust people and let them come to their pwn conclusions about what is right for them. I don't know your scenario, so I apologize if this comes off as tone-deaf.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough in my experience, casual dating may not actually be a bad idea for her. Young people want to hang out with others, and that helps with finding out what they want. My suggestion for her? Casual dating is great, but don't rush into a formal relationship. Hang out, meet new people, form friendships! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile there are plenty of fish in the sea, one should learn to swim for a bit, rather than chomp the first fish they see.",

I married him in May. \ud83d\ude02 So, taking time for yourself really can be a good thing in helping you prepare to be a partner someday. It's also so wonderful to be on your own.
