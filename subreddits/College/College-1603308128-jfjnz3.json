I\u2019ve dated one girl in college and a few hookups. Never partied (college parties) i guess. I\u2019ve always done a lot of things on my own. \n\nI ended up getting Covid back in June and went on a traveling spree thereafter recovering/isolation.\n\nI just did a meetup group (with 15 random strangers) where we wore masks at camp and what not to take precautions. I did the trip to get out, not to find anyone to date just because everyone was older than me. I typically will go out to a bar or an outdoor event to meet up people. I do concerts (prior to Covid) by myself and am not afraid to strike a conversation with people. Whether it\u2019s just platonic or actually trying to get a girl\u2019s number for something down the line. \n\nUnderstand that Covid doesn\u2019t have a high death rate (not saying it\u2019s not dangerous, clearly 220k people are dead in the US) but you gotta live. I\u2019ve been to multiple states, took solo trips and met friendly people. \n\nNow with dating, people are still going out. Just lay some ground rules until you feel comfortable. You could do a FaceTime, Meetup with masks on, but either way work on yourself and when you\u2019re ready take a jump into trying to go on dates. \n\nI don\u2019t really have regrets as I\u2019ve been sexually actively before but it\u2019s been 2 years since a consistent relationship one.
