If you don\u2019t change your studying habits now, you will not magically pass the class. Devote more time to this class and make sure you fully understand the material before each exam. Also, make sure you know when the last day is to drop a class. If you miss this date and you\u2019re still failing miserably, then you\u2019re screwed.",
