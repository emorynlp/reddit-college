  "text": "I\u2019m in college and I feel like I should know how to send emails but when it comes to sending emails to professors I suddenly just want to dig myself a hole. I\u2019ve sent plenty of emails before to know how to sound professional but with professors I feel like I can do everything right and they\u2019ll still tell me I\u2019m doing everything wrong.\n\nI have to send an email to thesis supervising professor asking him about my paper. I know some professors don\u2019t like lengthy emails and I would also prefer setting up a meeting and talking but he\u2019s so busy and doesn\u2019t have the time. So I wrote an email to him with questions etc. and I\u2019m contemplating if I have to apologize for the lengthy email and if I do how do I say it? \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the long email. Thank you\u201d?",
