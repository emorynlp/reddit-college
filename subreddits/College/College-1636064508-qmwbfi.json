  "text": "I am trying to decide if I should drop a class I am currently failing or if I should try and save my grade  or if I should drop it and try again next semester which I am very confident I can do better\n\nAnother reason it might be better to drop is that I was really struggling to get enough classes for full-time next semester because most of the ones I have left I need are ones with prerequisites that are fall semester only that I haven't taken yet, there is technically one other class I could take to fill but it is recommended to take that one with physics which isn't available next semester and the class would be at the same time as the math class I want to retake",
