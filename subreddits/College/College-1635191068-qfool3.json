  "text": "Hey, I'm going into college soon and I wanted to ask a few questions to any current students who can offer some advice.\n\nOver quarantine I kind of learned that I thrive when I have *some* free time a day. Like, two to three hours where I don't explicitly need to do anything, where I can work on my hobbies and relax. These past few weeks in senior year have just been nonstop work with applications and courseload and it's freaking me out for the next four years. Is a hint of free time, at any capacity, possible during college? \n\nAlso, is there an inherently different work/life balance at specific schools? E.g. a state school with 40k people vs. an Ivy League, ex. Cornell? I seem to get a different answer everywhere I look. \n\nI can handle all work vs. no life but I function best with time to myself. I'm looking to go into computer science if that helps. \n\nThanks to anyone willing to offer advice!",

My auditing class gives me 10+ hours of homework a week while my final business polices gives me <1 hour of work each week.\n\nI make schedules for the week and plan in my free-time. It\u2019s possible for me. But I have a friend who never had any free-time no matter how much she schedules",
