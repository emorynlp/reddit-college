I pursued an associates degree in music right out of high school. It was like a vocational school and not a traditional accredited university. They told me that none of the classes I took there transfer. But now they are trying to count the classes I took there as attempted hours so they can charge me out of state tuition. They can\u2019t be serious. I was completely different person then. That degree has absolutely nothing to do with the degree I\u2019m pursuing today.", "author": "gtrman571", "created": 1632352892, "retrieved": 1632946383, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdwquic": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptieug/my_university_is_trying_to_charge_me_out_of_state/hdwquic/", "text": "Yes.
