Anyways come finals time today two hours in he walks up to me and says, \"the reaper cometh\" and starts collecting finals. Me and everyone else are like wtf because we thought we still had two hours left but he said he was 'joking'. Now all finals are scheduled in 2 hour slots but we all thought he was giving us extra time to be nice if we needed it. Not once before or during the final did he say we only had 2 hours instead of 4 and never warned us our time was almost up. This man has been teaching the course for years and is tenured, how the hell do you get this far as a professor acting so childish and unprofessional? \nWho can I contact to file a complaint about this, me along with several other people may have failed the course because of this.\n\ntl;dr my professor said we had 4 hours for a final in a 2 hour time slot but collected finals after 2 hours saying he was joking. No one finished because we thought we had extra time.
