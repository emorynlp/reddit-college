But for real idk life and shit flashed before my eyes and my school had a prom, Even though our whole year was online school torture and the prom was scheduled inside of the gym, But later got moved outside because of covid and then it started pouring rain. I Didn\u2019t go thank goodness and having a Senior or 4th year of in person high-school would have been nice, But staying inside and doing work in my own time and space felt okay for once and i learned a lot of useful information i had no perception about in school.", "author": "npcterraria", "created": 1632123614, "retrieved": 1632801404, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
