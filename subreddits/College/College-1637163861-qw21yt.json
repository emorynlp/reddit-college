  "text": "He\u2019s clearly upset by a lot of things, and he always tries to talk it through with me and i have literally no idea how to solve his problems, and tbh he just kinda makes me depressed.  He\u2019s basically screaming right now about how bad he is at his language class and his dad and its really upsetting, and he\u2019s being really fucking loud.",

      "text": "You have to just make it clear and tell him that you're not a therapist that can deal with his issues and that the screaming is over the top. Rdirect him to your school's Wellness Center, they should have an actual counselor for dealing with stress and mental health.",

      "text": "I think what I would do is tell them honestly how I am not qualified nor have the time to be able to help him through his problems, and at every turn answer that he should see a professional for this. In my mind it\u2019s compassionate stonewalling, and it usually works to get the point across. If your roommate is that hellbent on making you their therapist, actual stonewalling works too.",
