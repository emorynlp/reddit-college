  "text": "He\u2019s clearly upset by a lot of things, and he always tries to talk it through with me and i have literally no idea how to solve his problems, and tbh he just kinda makes me depressed.  He\u2019s basically screaming right now about how bad he is at his language class and his dad and its really upsetting, and he\u2019s being really fucking loud.",

In my mind it\u2019s compassionate stonewalling, and it usually works to get the point across. If your roommate is that hellbent on making you their therapist, actual stonewalling works too.",

Maybe sit him down when he's feeling more calm and have a non-confrontational discussion (i.e. not blaming it all on him) telling him that you already have you own problems to deal with and need to take a step back from your emotional availability to him?",
