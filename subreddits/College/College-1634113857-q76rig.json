  "text": "To call this semester the worst in my academic career would be... Fitting because it is.\n\nSo everything started wrong. I went in for an academic advisement meeting in which the advisor layed out a plan with me for this semester and the next.\n\nCool, so I go back home to sign up for my classes, one of the classes given to me by my academic advisor needs a pre requisite and there's no way I can take it this semester because it's a spring only class... So I guess we aren't taking that class. For the spring semester my advisor gave me another class, we'll call that class 340. But to take 340 in spring, I first have to take 240 in the fall semester, which is a class the advisor did not put under the fall semester (I learnt of this through professors) so I said OK, I'll take 240 in fall so I can take the important one in spring. \n\n240 is a boring class. It still has to do somewhat with my career, but it doesn't directly teach me anything that helps it, and this always struck me as odd. I have no interest in anything being taught in 240, and I immediately dislike the class, but I tell myself to tough it out... After all, what else am I going to do? It's a requirement. I had taken 5 classes, and I decided to drop one, though I had to drop it *after* the drop period so it gave me a W, just to make a little more time for 240.\n\nWell, we're halfway through the semester basically, and I have recently found out that 240 and 340 were never requirements to begin with. I dropped an actual required class, and I've sacrificed other projects (for classes that _are_ requirements) just so that I could finish projects for 240. I'm not going to lie I'm feeling every emotion right now, just the negative ones though.\n\nI don't know what to do, I really really want to withdraw from the class. Doing so would give me tremendous time to pour into the other classes that are a) actual requirements for my career\nAnd b) classes I'm actually interested in.\n\nThe thing is though that in the career path, I was told to pick two elective classes, this one would count as one of those, but I wouldn't have picked it as an elective if I knew that's what I was doing!!!. So, that and having two Ws in one semester are the only things keeping me from withdrawing. But mentally I just can't take it. Every failed attempt at turning something in on time sends me into a deeper hole. \n\nThere's been multiple days where I've thought of just dropping out period. I just don't want to deal with this shit anymore, I'm not doing good in any of my classes right now, I've felt like a worthless loser ever since the semester started.",
