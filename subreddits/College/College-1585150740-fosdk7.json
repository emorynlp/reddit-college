  "text": "Hi all,\nI just found out my uncle died from complications due to corona.  When I email my professors do I mention the fact that his death was corona-related? I\u2019m a freshman and have never been in this situation before, especially one like this. Any advice would be appreciated!\n\nUpdate: I emailed 2 of my 4 professors, including the fact that my uncles death was COVID-19 related.  They both were incredibly understanding, as I expected they would be.  Thank you to everyone for the condolences, and I hope everyone stays healthy during this trying time!",
