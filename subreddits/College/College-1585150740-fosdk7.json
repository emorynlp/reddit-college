When I email my professors do I mention the fact that his death was corona-related? I\u2019m a freshman and have never been in this situation before, especially one like this. Any advice would be appreciated!\n\nUpdate: I emailed 2 of my 4 professors, including the fact that my uncles death was COVID-19 related.  They both were incredibly understanding, as I expected they would be.  Thank you to everyone for the condolences, and I hope everyone stays healthy during this trying time!", "author": "sawyer56", "created": 1585150740, "retrieved": 1632802104, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1130, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fljrdtd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fosdk7/emails_to_professors_about_corona_related_deaths/fljrdtd/", "text": "Sorry for your loss", "author": "Charlie_7364", "created": 1585224181, "upvotes": 1}, "fljq82g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fosdk7/emails_to_professors_about_corona_related_deaths/fljq82g/", "text": "You've been give some good advice already, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for your loss.
