In the US it would be illegal for a health provider to tell that stuff to your parents because of ~~HIPPA~~ HIPAA. The UK doesn't have that specific law, but I'd be surprised if they don't have *any* medical privacy laws that would have you covered.",

I did this and my counselor said anything we talk about will NOT be shared to home and counseling is free so no bills will be sent home. In other words, no one at home will know I went for a counseling session. \n\nGoodluck to you, if you need any help send me a private message.",
