I've heard of instances where students will get in trouble with the police and their alibi is that they were in class.

I know some professor's also use it to cover themselves when students say they are failing the course, but they haven't showed up so that isn't suprising.

I'm at a small school, so my largest classes are still under thirty people. Professors will learn who you are, and it's hard not to see them sometimes. It also helps you learn names, and if you're doing a group project, seeing who's not there. I'm currently working on a group paper, and I know one person hasn't shown up at all because they never respond during attendance. That's good evidence for all of us when her grade goes down because of lack of participation. Plus it also has to do with dropping here. After six absences, unless you have an accommodation, you can be dropped from your class without your input. And attendance points are the easiest things to earn.

Having proof that the student was hardly ever in class pretty much shuts that line of argument down immediately.\n\nSome schools have policies where enough no-show means that you end up dropped from the class. \n\nSome schools have mandatory attendance policies. \n\nSome classes pretty much require constant attendance/participation to be able to keep up with the material. Language classes are like this. Again, if somebody wants to fail it's their own problem, but some students like to turn around and make it seem like their failure to learn is the professor's fault. If they never showed up to class, again, it's very obviously not. \n\nSo, depending on the class/school, there can be good reasons for it. I would say that in a 300 person lecture it's probably less useful (other than for fin aid/grade complaining reasons) since the professor doesn't even really know who's in the class. \n\nBut, personally, I never really saw the point of spending thousands of dollars on a class and then not showing up to it, so I'm not against attendance on a personal level, either.
