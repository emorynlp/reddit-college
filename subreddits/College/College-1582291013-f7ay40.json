Sometimes we do it because our bosses tell us to do so. We may not have a choice.",

      "text": "As a professor with 25+ years teaching I refuse to take attendance for these reasons:\n\n1) it wastes time\n\n2) it's so very high school\n\n3) students are adults and need to make their own choices at going to class or not\n\n4) if I can't make class time useful they shouldn't bother attending\n\nThat said, since I *do* intend class time to be useful and it's impossible to pass without showing up at least most of the time (since what we do in class does not repeat the readings/assignments, and they need both to understand the course material) , I will reach out to students who miss more than a couple of classes to ask what's up.  I think any class that is designed so that students can do well without attending is by definition a bad class-- class time should be spent in active learning activities, not wasted on lecturing or otherwise repeating material that can be delivered outside of class.\n\nLuckily I have spent most of my career at liberal arts colleges where classes don't go over 25 and are often smaller, so it's easy to tell when someone is missing regularly.",

Generally with the clicker questions they are reviewing concepts from the previous class so it helps me review what we've done in the past, so kinda a win-win all around.\n\nI have issues with professors who aren't lenient about attendance and don't provide built in \"skips\".

Hell, I'll start a petition on campus to get attendance policies abolished. Returning at 30 gives you a *very* good idea of what you will and won't tolerate from teachers. Then again, I've always been like that, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but when you have teachers picking on you, you literally learn to stick up for yourself against authority.",

      "text": "I'm fairly neutral on attendance being graded. I think as long as there's a general university policy for a maximum of how much attendance can count for, it should be up to the professor whether they want to count attendance for a grade.\n\nThat said, attendance data is important to have. Like others have mentioned, it's important for financial aid, and it's also something that can work in students' favor and not just to their detriment. I'm always more willing to cut a student slack if they can at least put in the effort to show up consistently. When a student comes asking for extra credit, an extension, or some other leniency, and it's someone that never even shows up to class, I'm going to be annoyed.\n\nPlus, even if you say \"who cares, the students paid for it so if they don't show up it's on them and the university already has their money,\" retention is a *huge* deal. Schools are putting a hell of a lot of effort and money into keeping both enrollment and graduation rates up. Most of the people who don't show up to class don't do well, and a lot of them end up dropping out. If making attendance mandatory and graded is enough of an incentive to make students go to class, then it's a very easy and obvious rule to implement.",

However, for any upper year classes then I would say that there\u2019s a lot of content in these fundamental courses that it would be such a loss for me to skip. With that, some classes you can get away with depending on the different circumstances.\n\nIt all depends on what degree, I would think that for more harder majors then it would be harder to self-learn sciences and math. My first year intro to business classes were not so bad so skipping tbh, wasn\u2019t much of an issue. Also, I\u2019d say attendance is better for small classes rather than big but there\u2019s other ways to punish attendance too. For my calculus class, we have mandatory labs every Friday and random quizzes which require attendance to receive marks (it\u2019s a tiny percentage but every little counts). He does announce when the quiz is the class beforehand but I mean you still need to attend the Wednesday class to know.",

Wouldn\u2019t you want your professor to give you help/understanding if your classmate was slacking and not showing up to class? \n\n3) They use it to get used to people\u2019s names, if they are teaching 4-5 courses a semester, daily action of saying people\u2019s names will help",

But for my other classes, most my professors only take attendance as extra credit which I absolutely love since it rewards those of us who go and doesn\u2019t punish those who don\u2019t.

If there is an attendance it is generally as a method of a) enforcing attendance - if classes are very popular your attendance may be preventing somebody else taking that class. If you don\u2019t turn up then you are wasting that space. Just because you think you can pass the university has to take the position that if you don\u2019t turn up your chances of passing and getting a good grade go down. Also, remember that the class and prof have metrics, failures drop the class scores.\nB) to develop an understanding of popularity of the class and teacher. If attendance drops drastically and grades stay high then the lectures are not effective. Likewise if the grades stay low despite high attendance then the teaching style ability etc is in question.\nC) safety, as has been mentioned previously if students don\u2019t turn up for class and then bitch and moan about grades.....",

Even then, most of the time no one actually takes attendance, they just fail you on the assessment piece you didn't complete because you weren't in class. That's the punishment. \n\nI don't understand attendance policies and I think they're pretty disrespectful to students and professors, actually. I'm currently a supervisor (UK version of a TA), and I haven't changed my mind. In fact, I'm pushing for my university to record their lectures *precisely* so that undergraduates can skip class more easily. \n\nMy students are adults and they have adult things to attend to. University is *not* their job, it's just one of the many things they do. Sometimes other life things will mean they need/want to miss a lecture. If they don't *need* to be there then they shouldn't be explicitly penalised for it. If they fail to catch up on what they missed then that's their punishment, and they're free to fail their courses as much as they like. They're adults. They get to make adult decisions and deal with adult consequences, and either they're responsible enough to do that already or they will learn. \n\nWe always had fantastic attendance rates because it was in our best interest to attend, so we did. The lectures provided information and interactions with the professors you couldn't get from a textbook or online. If you get absolutely nothing out of going to the lectures (e.g. because it's pure lecture with no interaction, all copied from online notes), then why is the class even being offered since it's such an obvious waste of everyone's time, including the professor's?\n\nAttendance policies penalise students who are lazy, and *may* motivate them to attend more and try harder. But they also disproportionately penalise students who are already disadvantaged - those with families to care for, in precarious financial situations, chronically ill, etc. And getting exceptions to the policies is hardly fair when it costs time and money on the *student's* part.",

There's also an effective feedback loop in process via homework and/or tests.

Imagine a speech class with no required attendance and students don't show unless it's there day to present. The other students are losing the benefit of presenting in front of a larger group. So cases like this or in discussion based classes I absolutely think mandatory attendance is fine. In classes where the teacher is just teaching at you, I think its unnecessary.",

I know some professor's also use it to cover themselves when students say they are failing the course, but they haven't showed up so that isn't suprising. Most of my professor's take it to record who's there and not there, but it doesn't impact our grade. If it does it's only 5% or less.",

Professors will learn who you are, and it's hard not to see them sometimes. It also helps you learn names, and if you're doing a group project, seeing who's not there. I'm currently working on a group paper, and I know one person hasn't shown up at all because they never respond during attendance. That's good evidence for all of us when her grade goes down because of lack of participation. Plus it also has to do with dropping here. After six absences, unless you have an accommodation, you can be dropped from your class without your input. And attendance points are the easiest things to earn. Show up, pay attention, and that's a good way to help cushion your grade in case you do poorly on something.",

Having proof that the student was hardly ever in class pretty much shuts that line of argument down immediately.\n\nSome schools have policies where enough no-show means that you end up dropped from the class. \n\nSome schools have mandatory attendance policies. \n\nSome classes pretty much require constant attendance/participation to be able to keep up with the material. Language classes are like this. Again, if somebody wants to fail it's their own problem, but some students like to turn around and make it seem like their failure to learn is the professor's fault. If they never showed up to class, again, it's very obviously not. \n\nSo, depending on the class/school, there can be good reasons for it. I would say that in a 300 person lecture it's probably less useful (other than for fin aid/grade complaining reasons) since the professor doesn't even really know who's in the class. \n\nBut, personally, I never really saw the point of spending thousands of dollars on a class and then not showing up to it, so I'm not against attendance on a personal level, either. When I'm a full-time student, school is my job and I treat it as such. So... if attendance is part of a grade, that's easy points.",

Little did she know that over the past four years of having bipolar, I had gotten pretty good at dealing with little shits such as herself. Upon her trying to unenroll me, I contacted my local ADA rep and threatened to sue the school on the account of about a million ADA violations she had committed.

The community college i went to was about $116 a credit hour. \n\n\u201cThousands\u201d of dollars indicates at least $2000, and I guess that would make sense if you\u2019re going to an out of state institution but still, it\u2019s wholly possible to spend less than that\n\nEdit: Actually I just did research and in state is $211 for undergrad classes. OOS is $575.",

So when I take a 4 credit science class with its 1 credit lab, it comes out to a little over 2K. Obviously that\u2019s not for all classes because some vary with having no lab or being 3 credits, but it certainly is around 2K. And my school is one of the cheaper public universities in my  state\u2019s area. Also if it matters, I transferred from my local CC too so I am not above trying to save money lol. It\u2019s definitely possible for sure to spend 2K+ on one class here. \n\nAlso for reference, Umich AA (more expensive end) is $10K+ for 12-18 undergraduate upper div credits (in my equivalent college), and Central Michigan is $430 per credit hour for general continuing students ($436 if incoming junior/senior lol) which is a little less than 2K for a 4 credit class. \n\nThese were all in state stats I pulled from their 2019-20 info. There can definitely be a range based on various things like block tuition/per credit hour, department, etc. but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s absurd to hear one class being \u201cthousands\u201d of dollars, especially since colleges be raising this shit every year :/",

If you miss a test she will either take your highest test grade to replace it or if your final exam grade is higher you can use that grade to replace it but she doesn\u2019t do any make up tests. And it\u2019s at her discretion if you try to abuse it by missing more than one test you just get a 0 for missing a second or third test. It only applies for the first missed test. There was a few students that tried to hustle her and missed 2 tests and she was like sorry but the second one will be a 0. Also if you have a high average you can skip the final exam if you want. I have a 100 average in my A&P class as I\u2019ve made 100 on every test and lab so far so I won\u2019t be required to take if I don\u2019t want to as long as I keep my grade up. I\u2019m still gonna take it thought because I\u2019m going into nursing and want all the extra help and information that I can possibly learn!! \n\nI usually miss one or 2 questions but always get the bonus so that\u2019s how I\u2019ve maintained a 100 in that class.",
