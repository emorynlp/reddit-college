              "text": "Hmm do you know which kind of law you\u2019d be interested in practicing further down the line? I would say go with Economics though as opposed to Anthropology!! \u2014Especially if you would like to do corporate law, real estate law, tax law, etc. Big money right there lol. But if you are more interested in Anthro, then study that! It doesn\u2019t really matter what you major in; I think law schools primarily look at GPA and LSAT and admit students of all academic backgrounds. Best of luck! I am thinking of going to law school myself, but feel as though I may not be cut out for it though :/",
