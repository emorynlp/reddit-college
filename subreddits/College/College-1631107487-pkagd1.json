I hated this about myself since I really love spending time with friends. \n\nEver since moving on campus I really just feel an urge to talk to people. Especially since i\u2019m a freshman in a new place and I don\u2019t know anyone, I really wanted to make some friends quickly. \n\nOn the second (first full) day here after move-in, I was in the lobby of my residence hall and saw a big group of students walking past. I said hey and asked where they were going (they said Walgreens), decided to come along, and next thing I know i\u2019m added into their group chat and we\u2019re having dinner together downtown. \n\nEven since then, I\u2019ve been the one talking first to people in my classes and making more friends to add to the group chat. Now there\u2019s like 15 of us! \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted a big friend group like this, but was never able to have it since I was so shy. Not sure what happened inside of me to change this drastically, but I am really thankful for it.\n\nEdit: grammar\n\n2nd edit: Wow thanks for all the awards!! Im glad my story resonated with you all.
