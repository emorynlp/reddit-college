My first and foremost question is, what can I do with each degree? I live in rural KY, so the job market isn't very competitive for STEM fields. (To my benefit.)    \n\n\nI plan on taking the CompTIA A+ on my own, and earning some more certs on my own as a safety net so I can get an IT job. But what can I do with associate in science? I love ecology and would love to work with nature. I've considered getting a bachelors in the future, but I just want to make a two-year plan for now.", "author": "Spectralunicorn1", "created": 1632796216, "retrieved": 1632799970, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
