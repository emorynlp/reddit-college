  "text": "My roommate and I are in the same year and major so naturally we have a few classes together. Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. \n\nFast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now. I don't know how to prove that I didn't cheat and I'm worried about suffering consequences that I don't deserve. Any advice would be much appreciated right now.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the advice everyone. I\u2019m currently writing an email to the dean where I present the story, refute her points, and highlight the fact that she was disrespectful towards me.",

IDK it might work, either way because you have no proof it\u2019s a he said she said situation, however you could use that to your advantage in some ways. I would learn all you can about plagiarism and look at past cases where people were in the same situation to see what they did, and maybe you can figure out what to do with that. Good luck!!!!",

      "text": "Well, if it walks like a duck... While you may not have cheated, you did put your professor in a weird spot. Most schools have 0 tolerance for academic dishonesty and pursuant to that policy, they have to investigate every instance. I honestly think they're just doing their jobs.\n\nYou're right for defending yourself and I believe you are telling the truth but there is a certain track this type of incident must follow or else the policy would be useless. Just ride out the storm and keep to your story. There's nothing that proves you plagiarized but theres also no proof you didn't. Know what I mean?\n\nI've had this happen to me when I was in the Navy at nuclear power school. The guy next to me actually cheated on my test but it looked like I was the one who cheated. They ended up grilling us (military style which wasn't pleasant or respectful) both and put us in separate rooms to watch us work out a random problem on a whiteboard in front of a few instructors. What happened? We ended up doing the exact same work because the kid next to me had memorized the answer in question (because he obviously cheated). They let both of us go since it was inconclusive. Sometimes you just have to ride out the storm with these kinds of things but most importantly you should stick to your own knowledge in case something like what I went through happens to you. Lack of proof isn't enough to take disciplinary action, IMO.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

This professor walked him into a trap and tried to take advantage of the perceived power of her position to get him to sign a document admitting guilt. No matter how you look at it that's a terrible thing and shouldn't be defended.\n\nThe Professor should have approached him and his friend separately and had conversations with them one adult to another and gave them an opportunity to defend themselves where in she actually respectfully listened to them. Laughing in his face when he points out evidence countering her claim of cheating and shoving a document in his face isn't respect nor is it professional conduct.\n\nYou and that Professor are everything wrong with the academic system these days. It's honestly hilarious that shes so certain of cheating on what sounds like a basic entry level assignment. Which was assigned to dozens of students who are all being taught to think and code the same way. There are only so many ways to crack an egg, and only so many ways to screw it up. In this context I'd absolutely expect similar code layout and errors.",

      "text": "What was the assignment (lots of lines, functions, etc.)? If you are in an intro course, there are a lot of assignments where multiple people can have very similar code and run into the same errors with it. It's very different than a lot of other fields and there is an almost universally accepted rule that general coding snippets like basic sort functions, class constructors, etc. are okay to copy because they are so generic. If it was a smaller assignment (by lines of code), you have a better chance at refuting her claim based on the actual work itself.\n\nE.g: There's only so many ways to write a loop that sums up numbers. If you gave everyone a while loop assignment to increment a number to 10, you'd probably have 90% of the class turn in something exactly like:\n\n>`while x < 10:`  \n>  \n>`x++`\n\nor:\n\n>`while x < 10:`  \n>  \n>`x += 1`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can sometimes use the metadata in your IDE to view the history/undo stuff. If you can find data like this, it would show that you wrote it piece by piece and didn't copy/paste it. Take the laptop to her and hit CTRL+Z to show her all the progress and times you ran it, that's pretty good proof. People copying don't take 30 minutes to type a problem and keep running it for errors.",

That's gonna be a really hard thing to overcome. I've had hearings hinge on just that 1 piece of evidence, because while 2+2=4 is right, 2 people getting 2+2=5 is incredibly unlikely if they didn't work together.\n\nGiven what you said your friend was with you, that may be unpermitted collaboration. And it's entirely possible that your friend copied your code without you knowing. If it's unpermitted  collaboration, then there's not much you can do except ask for understanding since you broke the rule by ignorance, not intentionally. If it's your friend copying off you, they would need to own up to it, and you may still be given a minor punishment since you didn't properly protect your work (depends on how anal the professor is).\n\nAll of that said, she will probably find you responsible and give you a punishment. Since you don't agree with that, look through all the paperwork and figure out who to appeal to and when by. Send that appeal up before the deadline and explain everything clearly and with details.\n\nDon't go off and email the dean and everyone else yet. They will just tell you to appeal and they'll keep an eye out for it. Your academic advisor is good to email though, they can help you navigate the process.",

Variable names for example. You mentioned that you pointed out differences. If there are stylistic differences, take the time to find them and point them out. If you have a  copy of your roommates assignment, make notes on what is different, problem solving wise. \n\nNext email your prof. Confirm that she wants to speak to you Monday. Keep a paper trail of this. Some universities need proof that you talked to your prof and tried to work it out, before they'll let you escalate the issue. If she doesn't reply its fine, still go. You're just creating proof that you tried to solve this. \n\nNow you go to an advisor or your dean if they'll talk to you. Explain the situation. Tell them that you're not sure how many different ways there are to solve the problem. Restate your post. Tell them you can't prove that you didn't do it but then mention that you followed standards (either class or general), and that you looked over your roommates assignment after being confronted, and found several glaring differences. \n\nIf you can't meet with the dean or an advisor before Monday, go into her office, hear what she has to say, but don't sign anything. Tell her politely that you're not willing to sign anything, or that you're not happy with the conclusion reached at this meeting, and it will need to be discussed further. Don't threaten to escalate the issue to the dean, even if you intend to. \n\nFinally, brush up on your colleges academic dishonesty policy, as well as the policy for challenging a grade. It helps to have a slight understanding of where you stand and what your rights are going in.",
