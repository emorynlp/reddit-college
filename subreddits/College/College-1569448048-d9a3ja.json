Last week we had a computer science assignment due that we both forgot about until he looked at the course page and realized it was due at 11:59 which was in half in hour. We both busted our laptops out and wrote the code as fast as possible and finished around the same time... 12:01. frantic and not wanted to get stuck with a zero we both sent separate emails to our professor with the files attached. The fact that we did this assignment so quickly is an important detail to me because it means there is no way we could have worked together and still get done so fast. \n\nFast forward to today, about a week later. This morning she replied to the email finally and asked us to come her at her office hours. my roommate had a class so I went alone. My professor accused me of plagiarism citing that our code was too similar, we made the same mistakes, and we both tried to turn them in late, around the same time. I tried fighting for my case but of course she was very dismissive and at one point laughed at me. She tried getting me to sign off on a paper that would be sent to the office of student conduct but I refused and wanted to consider my options before admitting to something I didn't do, so I have to go to her office hours again on Monday. and that brings us to right now. I don't know how to prove that I didn't cheat and I'm worried about suffering consequences that I don't deserve. Any advice would be much appreciated right now.\n\nEDIT: thanks for the advice everyone. I\u2019m currently writing an email to the dean where I present the story, refute her points, and highlight the fact that she was disrespectful towards me.", "author": "recnepsj", "created": 1569448048, "retrieved": 1632802074, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1187, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f1jf9dc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/d9a3ja/im_being_falsely_accused_of_academic_misconduct/f1jf9dc/", "text": "Well just because you and your roommate did similar things doesn\u2019t mean you plagiarized.

While you may not have cheated, you did put your professor in a weird spot. Most schools have 0 tolerance for academic dishonesty and pursuant to that policy, they have to investigate every instance. I honestly think they're just doing their jobs.\n\nYou're right for defending yourself and I believe you are telling the truth but there is a certain track this type of incident must follow or else the policy would be useless. Just ride out the storm and keep to your story. There's nothing that proves you plagiarized but theres also no proof you didn't. Know what I mean?\n\nI've had this happen to me when I was in the Navy at nuclear power school. The guy next to me actually cheated on my test but it looked like I was the one who cheated. They ended up grilling us (military style which wasn't pleasant or respectful) both and put us in separate rooms to watch us work out a random problem on a whiteboard in front of a few instructors. What happened? We ended up doing the exact same work because the kid next to me had memorized the answer in question (because he obviously cheated). They let both of us go since it was inconclusive. Sometimes you just have to ride out the storm with these kinds of things but most importantly you should stick to your own knowledge in case something like what I went through happens to you.

If you are in an intro course, there are a lot of assignments where multiple people can have very similar code and run into the same errors with it.

If it was a smaller assignment (by lines of code), you have a better chance at refuting her claim based on the actual work itself.\n\nE.g: There's only so many ways to write a loop that sums up numbers. If you gave everyone a while loop assignment to increment a number to 10, you'd probably have 90% of the class turn in something exactly like:\n\n>`while x < 10:`  \n>  \n>`x++`\n\nor:\n\n>`while x < 10:`  \n>  \n>`x += 1`\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can sometimes use the metadata in your IDE to view the history/undo stuff.
