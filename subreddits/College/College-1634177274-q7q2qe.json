  "title:": "Should I withdraw from a class or fail it? HELP",
  "text": "&#x200B;\n\nThis is my freshman year at community college and I plan to transfer after two years. I am studying precalculus and I have no motivation in the subject even though I took the class and did well in high school. I'm 2 months in and I'm failing the class badly. I rarely do the assignments and quizzes and I failed the last test and will do same to my midterm tomorrow. The problem isn't the material, because precalculus is familiar to me, but my depression and lack of motivation to study makes it hard to re-learn the material.\n\nIs it better continue struggling through the material and power through it to get a better grade or should I drop and try again another semester taking some time to understand? I have 2 months left.\n\nI already withdrew from French, so would it look even worse if I have two W's on my transfer script?\n\nGod dude, I feel like a f\\*cking failure among my friends and I haven't told my parents either.",

      "text": "Idk how it works in your state but in my state (California) the CSU/UC schools don\u2019t care about any Ws on your transcript. For the UCs you are allowed to explain why you got them in the writing section. I got 2 Ws in a math class and my final try was during covid and guess what? I dropped the class again but luckily got an Excused Withdrawal. Rest assured if you have many Ws it will not impede you as much as you think.",

Be honest with yourself.\n\nA W will not be as bad as you think. Sometimes it takes time to find motivation to succeed in classes that you dread. It\u2019s okay to take a break and try again later.",

      "text": "Withdraw. Or have an honest discussion with the instructor of whether it is even possible to pass at this point. If you rarely do the assignments or quizzes, it seems unlikely you will pull yourself out of this hole. It is fine to have two Ws for the semester. If you get a D, it probably won\u2019t transfer anyway, so you\u2019d have to be able to pull at least a C or C- depending on the transfer policy at your future university. You will just need to consider how to make up for that lost time/credits in future semesters so your graduation isn\u2019t delayed.",
