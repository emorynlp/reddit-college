  "text": "I always thought after I graduated from college I'd be a different person. I've finally graduated now, and I still feel the same. I've taken many classes over the course of my college career and I even double majored, yet I still feel like I don't actually know anything. My GPA is pretty good so I know I didn't sleep through my classes. Supposedly I must have learned something, yet I don't feel anymore qualified to do anything than I did before. Anyone else experiencing something similar or have any thoughts on this?",

It doesn't help that a lot of entry level jobs list requirements of things we've never be taught about.",

On the flip side, many people without higher education think that education, inside or outside university, is overrated and obsolete compared to real life. There\u2019s a middle ground, and generalizing too much isn\u2019t good for anyone.\n\nI personally think your argument is an over exaggeration, but I\u2019ll agree with you that it\u2019s not without its merit, especially for PhDs. The only defense to them is you spend so much time becoming an expert in something singular for so long, it\u2019s really draining to get into anything else. It\u2019s self-actualization to the extreme.\n\nI\u2019d say 20% of my friends have doctorates, and none of them are like that. While in grad school I certainly met people like that, but not any PhDs I worked with outside of academia. What I will say, is that many PhDs are a bit socially inept. They\u2019re often nerds, introverted, and awkward. Maybe that contributes to the negative stigmas, but they\u2019re all super interesting people if you want to know about complex ideas and have a deep convo.\n\nAlso, knowledge for the sake of knowledge is very much a valid thing, regardless of application.",

If you got through college you likely learned skills like time management, the ability to work with others/ work through interpersonal conflict, the ability to think critically, the ability to sift through information and pull out the most important pieces quickly, the ability to manage multiple projects and prioritize tasks, and many other \u201csoft\u201d skills that are extremely important for being successful as an adult. \n\nAlso, OP, if you are feeling like you don\u2019t know as much as you should about what you studied or like you aren\u2019t as smart or knowledgeable as your peers/ coworkers/ you feel you should be, that might be some imposter syndrome happening. Imposter syndrome is the general feeling that you are an imposter in your own field. It is the feeling that you don\u2019t belong or that you don\u2019t know as much as you should to be doing what you\u2019re doing. It is common among most people but especially young adults and especially especially young women. Many people with college degrees and even many people with masters and doctorates often feel that they are \u201clying\u201d to those around them when claiming to be an expert of the subject they studied (and may have even published research or written books on) because humans have a tendency to idolize people we see as intelligent, like Einstein or Stephen Hawking and we assume that we, the regulars, could never be like them, but even Einstein suffered from imposter syndrome because he saw himself as just a normal guy. \n\nNo matter how much knowledge you gain or what accolades you may earn, you\u2019ll always still feel like just *you.* Winning a Nobel prize or an academy award won\u2019t change who you see when you look in the mirror. \n\nSo know this: You *do* know things. You *are* smart. You spent 4 years studying your discipline and now even if you don\u2019t feel any smarter or wiser or different, that\u2019s impressive and it does mean something. \n\nCongratulations on finishing your degrees!!",

But your overall development, genetics and the way your brain is wired is what truly determines what you can do and how you apply what you know. Being \"intelligent\" is often confused for being knowledgeable, especially about obscure topics. Accidentally memorized the capital of a country no one has heard of? Oh, you're smart! We're just not teaching people what fluid intelligence means and we're not emphasizing the emotional intelligence is takes to have the humility to learn from the opposing sides. There is more humility in grad/research students than in the average person which is sad. There are some rare people who can truly see something abstract and magical when they look at geometrical figures. Very rarely, there truly are just brilliant people who we will never comprehend. Only a fool would find that threatening or offensive. We need to be very careful when we're using words like \"smart\", \"know\" \"wise\". Because there's an enormous difference between fluid intelligence, knowledgability, and emotional intelligence/maturity (wisdom). It's almost as if no one possesses a higg amount of all three, not that it matters because wisdom beats intelligence.",

The reality of how it really works will be learned in the years following graduation and will continue for a life time. At the very least one should graduate: knowing how to compose  grammatically correct communications, able perform simple math, having an understanding of history and culture (Helps keep you oriented in time and space.) and be able to think critically.
