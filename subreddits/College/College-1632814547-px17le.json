Weird part is, when I submitted my first draft, I got a reply in two days, with only some minor changes being necessary. Now I have no idea why my supervisor is taking so long, given that he already basically read the whole thing and now just needs to go through 4-5 paragraphs that I have changed.\n\nI e-mailed him first two weeks ago, then a couple of days ago and he completely ignored both of them. And it's not like he's on medical leave or something, he teaches some courses that my friends are enrolled into and he never missed class. \n\nThis is incredibly frustrating. First of all, I know the thing is as good as passed, since after the first draft he only gave me minor things to change, and I did. Second of all, as of September I'm not even enrolled anymore (that is fine, I can still receive grades as long as I was enrolled when I submitted it, which I was). I already have a job and just want to get it over with this uni as soon as possible. But idk what to do, this guy won't reply. And if he asks me to clarify something that  I wrote in there, it's been so long I might not even remember.", "author": "Zepp41", "created": 1632814547, "retrieved": 1632945495, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
