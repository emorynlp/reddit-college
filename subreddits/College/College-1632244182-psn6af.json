It's a brief moment of time where you weren't prepared, but isn't indicative of your potential. Pop quizzes also don't allow for people who are slower on the uptake to spend time consolidating their knowledge. \n\nThe strategy I use, because I struggled with pop quizzes: Get ahead on readings, work practice problems immediately after class, and do a morning slides review (while you drink your coffee or eat your bagel or something). I wish more fellow students would look at Ebbinghaus and his forgetting curve! You lose a significant fraction of your knowledge within just hours of consuming new information, so it's very very important that you review content daily and as soon as you can after class, so it's less likely to fall out of your head. If you're interested in this topic, look into spaced repetition.\n\nBest of luck, this will pass. Again, this is not indicative of your ability, you were caught off-guard. Kill it on the exam and use your pop quiz as a diagnostic tool for your weaker areas.", "author": "ItsReallyVega", "created": 1632247604, "upvotes": 2}, "hdqs69e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psn6af/failed_a_pop_quiz_this_morning_and_its_really/hdqs69e/", "text": "It\u2019s just one quiz.
