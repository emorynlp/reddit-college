  "title:": "I have a total of four W\u2019s on my transcript\u2026 how bad is this?",
  "text": "During my freshman year I was failing a math class but I dropped after the deadline resulting in a W. Then during the pandemic I dropped 2 more courses with a W. \n\nI told myself I wasn\u2019t ever dropping a class again but this semester low and behold I\u2019m dropping another class. Two of the classes I\u2019ve dropped have nothing to do with my major and the other two were just not at a good time, I had a lot going on (at home during the pandemic) and I was getting behind in those classes.\n\nSo now I\u2019m gonna have four W\u2019s on my transcript. Is this bad? I feel like it is. It hasn\u2019t affected my FASFA since I\u2019m still a full time student but I feel like it just looks terrible. How can this negatively affect me? \n\nI\u2019m (F, 21, Junior) an English Language Arts Education Major (undergrad) btw. Also the reason I dropped the classes is because I need at least a C (73% or 75% depending on the grading scale) in them to graduate as an ELA major and I was still gonna fail those classes if I continued.",
