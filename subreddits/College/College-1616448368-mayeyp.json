I used to be an employer - and I am now a teacher. There are usually a top 3 of things employers ask for educators to focus on that would make students better prepared for a career or the work world.\n\n1. Communication skills (oral and written)\n2. Ability to work and interact in group and interpersonal interactions well\n3. Time management.\n\nWhether you like something or can't see the forest for the trees - group interactions require to some degree of all of the above. Moreso very few professors or educators force group work out of fun - multiple research studies point to purposeful use being a positive in education and retention, coupled with sponsors and businesses hammering on eductors to make sure those who move into the work world have been exposed if not are proficient and these are some of the metrics that are used against education as measurements of success or failure. Exposing students to various forms of group and inter personal interaction over time in small and large doses makes you more prepared for the pro's and con's as well as how to hopefully overcome this.\n\nFile this under the same category as most people not understanding that learning a broad set of subject areas isn't necessarily about learning what a parallelogram is but in learning various ways to learn and approach problem solving to give you a broad set of tools that can be transferable into unique and novel situations in the future (aka teach broadly and you might be able to apply those processes to multiple situations, teach narrow and that skillset functions in extremely limited situations if not only one).\n\n\\*Edit\\* on a personal level I hate group and partner work myself - but only because I have to deal with so many people who refuse to step up and do their bare minimum and I actually care about my education more than just a C...I have loved group and partner work in groups where everyone brings their best (and I have been in those groups before - you tend to see more of that when you into higher level coursework and or into more concentrated field studies).", "author": "werdsmart", "created": 1616520100, "upvotes": 1}, "grxzqzf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mayeyp/why_do_professors_of_zoom_classes_feel_like_its_a/grxzqzf/", "text": "Did students actually like group work before the pandemic?

Hopefully I won\u2019t get penalized for late assignments.\n\nTLDR: I hate group work over Zoom too.", "author": null, "created": 1616468243, "upvotes": 45}, "grvr3f1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mayeyp/why_do_professors_of_zoom_classes_feel_like_its_a/grvr3f1/", "text": "I know some professors are simply forced to do either group work or Discussions or break out groups because the University requires some kind of peer-to-peer interaction or something.", "author": "HugeRichard11", "created": 1616464021, "upvotes": 20}, "grvkoy7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mayeyp/why_do_professors_of_zoom_classes_feel_like_its_a/grvkoy7/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1616460675, "upvotes": 47}, "grvgtci": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mayeyp/why_do_professors_of_zoom_classes_feel_like_its_a/grvgtci/", "text": "It\u2019s so awkward", "author": "Mbeheit", "created": 1616458656, "upvotes": 3}, "grvfgph": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mayeyp/why_do_professors_of_zoom_classes_feel_like_its_a/grvfgph/", "text": "I\u2019m a physics professor.
