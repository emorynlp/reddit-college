  "text": "I\u2019m a senior, and I\u2019m going to university for Computer Science, but if I were to choose a subject based off of pure interest, it\u2019d be music composition/theory. I love it, but Ive heard that it\u2019s probably the worst degree, and I honestly don\u2019t know how my family would feel. So, is a music degree as useless as everyone says it is?",

      "text": "Yeah it is pretty useless when it comes to finding jobs. I see it as something that you pursue when you already have a stable career or rich parents. Even then. But it also depends on the college you go to. If you\u2019re going to a private liberal arts college that costs 50k/yr. it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a music major or an engineering major, you\u2019re an idiot regardless.",
