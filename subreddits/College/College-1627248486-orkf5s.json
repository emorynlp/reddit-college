  "text": "Hey guys, I'm gonna give a bit of backstory for you guys. I go to a medium sized school in the midwest. Tuition and room and board and all other fees add up to about $16,000. I'm very excited though, because I have received around $12,000 in scholarships and Grant's, and with all the work I'm putting in at 2 full time jobs I'm able to use the money I saved up to pay the whole year out of pocket and avoid loans! I'm extremely satisfied with all the work and dedication I put in in order to make this a reality!",
