I go to a medium sized school in the midwest. Tuition and room and board and all other fees add up to about $16,000. I'm very excited though, because I have received around $12,000 in scholarships and Grant's, and with all the work I'm putting in at 2 full time jobs I'm able to use the money I saved up to pay the whole year out of pocket and avoid loans! I'm extremely satisfied with all the work and dedication I put in in order to make this a reality!", "author": "rawalfredo", "created": 1627248486, "retrieved": 1632802467, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 873, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h9ynw9f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/orkf5s/im_able_to_pay_this_upcoming_year_out_of_pocket/h9ynw9f/", "text": "congratulations! :)", "author": "Massive_Attorney_322", "created": 1629670964, "upvotes": 1}, "h6npcd6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/orkf5s/im_able_to_pay_this_upcoming_year_out_of_pocket/h6npcd6/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1627350380, "upvotes": 1}, "h6lx4hd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/orkf5s/im_able_to_pay_this_upcoming_year_out_of_pocket/h6lx4hd/", "text": "Lets gooooo!!!", "author": "og_usrnme", "created": 1627320449, "upvotes": 1}, "h6lml2j": {"link": "/r/college/comments/orkf5s/im_able_to_pay_this_upcoming_year_out_of_pocket/h6lml2j/", "text": "This is so amazing.
