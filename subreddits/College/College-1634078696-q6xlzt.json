  "title:": "help me find a liberal and welcoming college",
  "text": "I'm a freshman at UNC Wilmington and I'm just not having fun here at all.\n\nThe school is way too white and conservative for me and I would really like some help finding a school better fit for me. The people here are not welcoming, there's not much to do other than going to the beach, and the school is so big and spread out that I feel isolated. Also, almost everyone here goes home every weekend to see their family and friends!\n\n I visited Belmont University to see a friend and loved the vibe there. Liberal, lots of LBGTQ+ students (I'm queer, so I would love this), and lots to do around the city of Nashville.\n\nDo you guys know any schools I can transfer to my sophomore year that fits those categories?",

      "text": "If you think you can make it, you could shoot for UNC Chapel Hill, which is just a much bigger and more diverse school in general. Can\u2019t say much for the queer dating scene in the Triangle area ngl\u2026 but I\u2019m not at unc. Take your pick as to which of the other two points of the triangle I represent. Chapel Hill is a great town. It\u2019s definitely a college town, so all the things in/near campus are pretty tailored to the interests of college students. There\u2019s also an arts and literature frat which is essentially just the greek organization for queer people, and they throw great parties.\n\nYou could also consider UNC Asheville, which I\u2019m pretty sure is quite liberal. Asheville is very hipster-y if I\u2019m remembering correctly. And I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a really fun place to visit. Plus nc mountain weather tends to be pretty nice.\n\nBoth of the places I\u2019ve mentioned are in the UNC system, specifically because I think that it\u2019s probably a little bit easier to transfer between them than into an entirely different university (system). There\u2019s also a higher chance that your credits will transfer.",
