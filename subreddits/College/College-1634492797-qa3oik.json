  "text": "I am in my second semester of my second year in community college. Up until this point everything has been paid for by scholarships. After this semester ends, I have to apply for a financial aid appeal due to the fact that I will have taken too many credits to be covered by FAFSA. That being said, I should be thinking about what school I want to transfer to. The thing is that I'm confused now. I thought I had a plan coming out of high school which was to get my pre reqs and apply for nursing in order transfer later on and get my BSN. I even settled on the pediatric oncology speciality. \n\nThen I hated what I was doing. Taking classes behind a computer all day and going to my part time job or eating or sleeping and repeat. I realized maybe I wanted something else. I ventured off into looking at jobs with animals such as a vet tech, veterinarian, or a zookeeper even. I also looked into MRI or CT technologist. I also looked into a bilingual elementary school teacher. I even started considering trade school or a locomotive engineer. Now, I am just so confused.\n\nI have struggled with mental health for about 5 years now and never addressed it. I reached a breaking point last week where I had the most massive panic attack, thinking I was going to die on my floor from by body aching and loosing control over my hyperventilation. Now I get stressed as hell everytime I need to just sit down to study. All that goes through my mind is failure, the future, uncertainty, and worry. I even had to withdraw from a class for the first time a few weeks prior to this. Finally, I had the balls to set up appointments with a psychologist, school counselor, and a career counselor for a few days from now.\n\nMeanwhile, I have a rough sketch of a plan right now. That is to finish my Certified Nursing Assistant course and physiology class fro this semester and possibly try out working as a CNA afterward. If I like it, I will keep going and simultaneously look into being a certified medical assistant. If I do not, I will keep working my current part time job and look towards a Certified Medical Assistant certification. Then I will do that for a year or so to see if I like any other paths in the medical field. As of now, I am looking into being a CT scan technologist.\n\nOverall, I just want happiness, job security, helping people in any way that I can, money to pay bills and provide for my younger siblings as well as my parents when they age. I also just want to be someone that I can be proud of. I want to be someone that I can respect. I want to be someone who my siblings and parents can also be proud of. I am just worried about not knowing exactly what I want. I am scared of switching majors and wasting money and time and energy. \n\nI know that life is not a race. But to see other people my age knowing what they want, going after it, and making money already to get a nice little space for themselves and a nice car makes me stressed out in that I am not there yet. It makes me anxious that I do not know myself that well to know what I want in life. I just want to make something out of myself and make the right choices.",
