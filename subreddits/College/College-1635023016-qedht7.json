  "text": "I go to a very large, urban university in California which is known for being a party school and having an attractive student body.\n\nAs a transfer student, I've been having trouble making friends especially having social anxiety and depression. To make up for this, I've been trying to look \"popular\" in front of them in hopes of them saying \"hi\" to me or hitting me up to join a party or get job connections. Because of this, every time I walk on campus, I'm always socially conscious of bumping into people, having smelly appearance, and obsessively thinking about how to not \"screw\" up by being awkward or not displaying eye contact. Turns out because of this worrying using up all my energy, I end up doing all of what I want to avoid. How do I stop worrying about what the others think of me?  Also, the loneliness I'm experiencing is only intensifying the feelings of wanting to be popular. My social anxiety is worsening as a result, even with my roommates.\n\n&#x200B;",

I\u2019d say join clubs or groups that interest you, that\u2019s a good way to meet people with similar interests. And sometimes you gotta take that leap\nOf faith and reach out to people rather than wait for them to say something, cause you could be waiting a while.",

Most aren\u2019t looking around at everyone else to judge what they are doing/wearing/etc. They are probably more concerned with getting to class based on a certain time, or the test they have tomorrow,where they are going to eat this evening, or some other arbitrary personal thing. I would just focus on acting natural and comfortable and finding people who like similar things as you. People aren\u2019t really \u201cpopular\u201d in college like how they are in high school, it\u2019s too big for that. Sure, some people may have a lot of friends, but it\u2019s not some social hierarchy thing.",

I behave as I normally would & I have met a lot of interesting people on campus, even in the elevator. Just saying hi, asking how the person is, what they are up to, where they are from, can turn into a good conversation.",

There's a saying of \"If we wait until we're ready, we'll be waiting for the rest of our lives\" it's the idea if you wait for something to happen then you will just keep on waiting. Life is about taking action if everyone decided not to nothing would happen honestly.\n\nThat said it's up to you to go at a pace you feel comfortable, but try and put yourself in uncomfortable positions or else you will not grow as a person.\n\nRealize you will likely not see these people again after graduating. The world is a very large place.",

      "text": "It's not easy to gain self-confidence, which is usually what attracts people to wanting to be friends with you. I think the first step is learning to like yourself, which also means getting to know yourself--the positives about yourself. What are you good at? What do you like to do in your free time? What are some things you enjoy? Not what other people like or what's trendy, but what YOU like. You can start forming an identity beyond your fears and insecurities because you are more than them. Then you can connect with others based on similar interests. \n\nAlso, it's ok to not be perfectly confident and not socially awkward. You learn by experience. You don't have to push yourself to do things you aren't fully comfortable with yet. Start out by talking with one of your classmates you sit next to in classes. You could talk about assignments or how they're doing in class. You could even ask them for help or if they would want to study for an exam with you. It might not be a lasting relationship beyond that class or you might not get the response you're looking for, but don't be too discouraged. Some people might not be looking for friendships or even mesh well with you, & that's ok. It's just part of life. Good luck!",
