Maybe you decide you have to ignore loud music as long as it's before midnight or not during exams, for example, and speak up when it breaks your boundaries. For me, I grew up in a family of professional cleaners and others' standards of cleanliness drove me crazy, even when they said they cleaned up. (e.g. not rinsing dishes, not cleaning the taps when they clean the bathroom, not mopping after they sweep when the floor needs it, etc.) I realized that as long as my roommates are making an effort, if something isn't clean enough for me, I should clean it myself to my own standards rather than letting the problem irritate me until I resent the people around me.", "author": "DrawnInInk", "created": 1617892149, "upvotes": 3}, "gtt9cgu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mmdid6/what_are_some_dorming_tips_youd_give_incoming/gtt9cgu/", "text": "Good ear muffs that are comfortable to sleep with", "author": "HelloMyNameIsErnie", "created": 1617891273, "upvotes": 3}, "gtt8vut": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mmdid6/what_are_some_dorming_tips_youd_give_incoming/gtt8vut/", "text": "Discuss room temperature with potential roommate.

If you have communal showers, bring a pair of flip flops to wear in the shower. People will come back to the dorms on the weekends and do some cursed things in those bathrooms.\n\n-The bathrooms will likely have 1 or 2 ply toilet paper. If you can't handle it, bring your own.\n\n-Bring air freshener. I reccomend the ones you plug into the wall. This is not only to make your room smell good but also to protect against your neighbors. One time the guys across the hallway from me hot boxed their room and the whole wing smelled like weed for a day.\n\n-Bring trash bags for your trashcan. It makes everything so much easier. If you have a smaller trashcan use tall kitchen sized bags. Bring a Swiffer too and do a once over of your floors with a dry pad maybe once a month or so. But in general, just try and be clean, don't be a stereotypical college kid who wrecks their dorm. You are now an adult, start acting like one.\n\n-Join as many clubs as you can handle in the first two weeks and drop the ones you don't like. Many of them were likely virtual for the last year so they will be very welcoming to new people.

Bring a mini vacuum, this will come in handy if you are a girl/will room with women because hair will get everywhere. Get a lamp with a USB outlet attached for charging! Bring a small book lamp to study at night so you won\u2019t blast roommates with the light of your lamp. Definitely get a laptop/book desk you can set on your lap/bed and a comfy, collapse-able cushioned chair. Bring blanket and pillows. Have a bin to store food or cosmetics.

Set boundaries early. Make it clear if you feel uncomfortable with people of the opposite sex sleeping over while you\u2019re around, make it clear if you aren\u2019t okay with alcohol/ weed in the room. Whatever your comfort level with these things is is fine, it\u2019s just that people have varying opinions on these topics. \n2. If you can\u2019t fall asleep without the TV or the light on figure out how to kick that habit before you move in. \n3. If your parents are visiting give your roommate advance notice and don\u2019t expect they\u2019ll have time to make the room perfectly clean with one day of notice. \n4. You will inevitably find something irritating about your roommate. I\u2019ve seen plenty of roommates that let a small difference in cleaning habits drive a huge wedge between them, I\u2019ve also seen friendships that existed before college end because of disagreements when living together. Don\u2019t live with your friend from before college freshman year, wait until you can at least get an apartment with separate bedrooms.  \n5. Every single person needs alone time, even the people who seem to be very social and always partying. If you and your roommate have classes all around the same time plan an hour or two a week at the library or another common area so your roommate will have some time to just relax by themselves in the room, and have them do the same for you. When it comes to romantic interests, don\u2019t be the person who will never let a roommate have someone over. Of course it\u2019s not okay for them to hookup with someone when you have to be up at 7 am, but giving you and your roommate giving each other a couple Friday nights each to have a guest over is reasonable. I guess I\u2019m trying to say don\u2019t be that person who never leaves the room. \n6. Depending on the school you go to it might be common to sign leases for the next school year during the first semester.

People in your wing and below you will have different schedules and you will be the asshole/bitch for not thinking of that.\n\nUse the study hall if you find your room too distracting. Seriously discipline yourself on time management to knock out your studies (reading, do a chunk of your paper that is due in a few weeks, etc.) hopefully by Thursday afternoon so when you got that weekend coming up you can really relax. \n\nGet involved with your dorm, be it working the front desk or being part of a resident leadership group. Looks great on a resume even if money is not an issue and you don\u2019t really need a job, and you meet a lot of great people.\n\nFind people in your classes who are also in your dorm.

Too many freshman get a taste of freedom and are on academic probation by December and dropped out by the following May because they can\u2019t handle being independent, thinking like a child and the satisfaction of \u201cnow\u201d and not as a fucking adult and the future forgetting to go to class or get the work done.
