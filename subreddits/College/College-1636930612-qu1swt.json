  "text": "Nothing interests me to the point where I would be able to focus on it for more than a month.   \nAfter high school I took a gap year during which I did absolutely nothing. Now I'm studying psychology and at first I was really into it but now I cannot force myself to study anymore. Or maybe I can but there goes question that if I have to force myself to study so early then should I really stay here? I don't even want to do anything related to psychology in later life, I choose it only because I'm slightly interested in psychology. But what else can I do? I cannot do anything, I have no ambitions, plans, interests. I can drop out and try a different major but won't it be the same?   \nThe hell are you supossed to to when you are 20 and have literally no motivation to achieve anything? All I enjoy is either sitting at my couch and watch anime/play games or going out with friends. I don't care about making money or gaining knowledge. But I feel the overwhelming pressure to do something with my life. My parents are quite rich, they provide me with everything, theoretically speaking I have some wealth cause my dad gave me shares in his company but I kinda reject this fact. I feel like a leech, I did nothing to have all of those things. I wanna be independent but the process to become independent is not something that interests me.",
