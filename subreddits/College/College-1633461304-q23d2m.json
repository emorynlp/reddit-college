  "text": "So far this semester, I\u2019ve missed 2 lectures and 1 smaller section in this class. I missed these classes because I got COVID 19 and had to isolate through my university. Those absences were excused.\n\nHowever, I am now experiencing food poisoning and could not attend today\u2019s lecture and section. The syllabus says more than two unexcused absences puts you at risk of a failing grade. Should I email this professor?",

      "text": "At my university we are still mitigating Covid issues by extending flexibility when it comes to attendance. Students have to miss sometimes because of Covid, or other illness, and we have to have more flexibility than we normally would. That said I would reach out to your instructor, demonstrate good faith, and ask what you can do to make up the work.",
