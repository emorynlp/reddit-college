  "text": "I think a few universities/colleges offer a BS in Mathematics (SNHU does), but that's pure Mathematics. I'm interested in Applied Mathematics or Statistics and no university offers it online.. yet many colleges offer Accounting and Biology and some Engineering degree programs for example COMPLETELY online. So what's up with the Math degrees not being available online? Anyone know why?",

          "text": "well they need to hurry up lol. i guess i could try to take as many classes online as possible and then it virtually becomes an online degree lol. i thought maybe it was because they didn't want people cheating on math tests or math classes were difficult and it would be difficult to get tutoring if the degree is offered online",
