  "text": "Looking for advice with my cm degree. Currently a sophomore getting ready to be a junior and about to start taking more major related classes. I\u2019m having second thoughts on whether or not this is the major for me, and have considered engineering design technology (cad), civil engineering, and a few other degrees. Is the cm field enjoyable and worth it or should I switch? I am very interested in engineering, but i\u2019d have to transfer and be further away from my girlfriend/family. Im just not positive what is right for me, and experience/advice on any of these majors is appreciated.",

      "text": "CM grad here. I worked for a GC for some years and now work on the owners side running projects through planning, design, and construction. I considered architecture, engineering, and CM programs and ultimately chose CM. I\u2019ve found my CM education more relatable to my career in capitol project and program management and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. All that said, if design is your jam, go for engineering. Look at PMCM jobs on LinkedIn, most list CM, engineering, and architecture under degrees. You can get into CM later on if design starts to get lame.",
