  "text": "Looking for advice with my cm degree. Currently a sophomore getting ready to be a junior and about to start taking more major related classes. I\u2019m having second thoughts on whether or not this is the major for me, and have considered engineering design technology (cad), civil engineering, and a few other degrees. Is the cm field enjoyable and worth it or should I switch? I am very interested in engineering, but i\u2019d have to transfer and be further away from my girlfriend/family. Im just not positive what is right for me, and experience/advice on any of these majors is appreciated.",
