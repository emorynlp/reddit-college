  "text": "I hate that I have to talk to an advisor just to be able to find out if I'm going to continue college or drop the fuck out. And they keep prolonging it, and giving me appointments like a week in advance and I'm busy so of course I miss them. And everytime anyone at my school talks to me it's like they don't understand that I'm not gonna pay out of pocket if it comes to that. They're all like \"oh well you're gonna have to pay out of pocket for that\" with a half smirk on their face, like they get off of making people poor. Also those hybrid classes are the biggest rip off, like you expect me to pay $600 for access codes for my foreign language requirement that's supposed to be in person????? Like hell no! If you gonna be charging that much I'm just not gonna graduate.",

          "text": "I only made an appointment just because I wanna figure out if I'm gonna be forced to pay out of pocket or not. Basically I only have 6 credits left for my A.A. but I have alot of prerequisites before I can start my bachelor's in computer science at the university of my choice. My current school already told me that since I used up all my elective credits I can't get these prerequisites paid for. But the university told me that I would be considered \"degree seeking\" if I just transferred over there and took my prerequisites there, which means it might be covered my financial aid. Also all the foreign language classes except ASL require me to buy a $300 code per class and I have to take 2 classes! And $600 for 2 pieces of paper is way overpriced.",

But personally I don't find their \"advice\" to be so helpful. Remember they're going to do what makes the college more money, they don't care about the students. And as far as paying for classes, I receive Pell grant which if you didn't know covers 100% of my tuition up to a bachelor's degree. So yes of course I'm hesitant to pay out of pocket for classes when my financial aid should cover all of it.\n\nI'll also add another thing, I'm trying to enlist in the military so paying out of pocket now makes no sense, when it's cheaper just to wait until I get the GI Bill or tuition assistance and use that to pay for my prerequisites.",
