  "text": "I am an Aeronautical Engineering student here in the Philippines. I have recently developed an anxiety towards math, lectures, quizes, activities or etc. Whenever I think or see math now I get anxious to the point that I get shaky and can almost throw up. I also failed my prelim grade on Math for Engineers and Calculus subject. \nAm I the only one that feels like this? \nDo you have any advice on how I can overcome this?\nThank you in advance. \nI just really need help at the moment. I feel like im drowning in anxiety.",

The problem I had with anxiety was I treated it like I was scared. Don\u2019t do that, act like a tough guy that isn\u2019t scared to die and it will go away",

It is also hard to shift courses since I dont really know what I am passionate on and it is kinda expensive. But since I choose this course I might as well try. Thank you for your comment!",

It's those fundamental rules and building blocks that you have already mastered that will be the most useful to you moving forward. \n\nIt's ok to make mistakes, just be sure to show your work so that others can help show you where you went wrong.\n\nThe point of your studies isn't to get everything right, it's to make mistakes and learn from them.",

Currently in Calc I and the reason why my answers are incorrect is due to algebraic-related errors. But to be fair, the last time I took Algebra was in 8th grade. \n\nOn top of the algebra, you also want to know the basic fundamentals of trigonometric functions. I highly recommend [Paul\u2019s Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu) that offers notes and practice problems on Algebra and Calc I-III. I\u2019ve been using it and it has helped tremendously in strengthening my understanding of the material.",
