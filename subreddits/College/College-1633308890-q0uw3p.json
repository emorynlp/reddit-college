  "text": "Including me. I feel like I chose the wrong major and I\u2019m heavily struggling to stay afloat right now. I\u2019ve started donating plasma so I can pay for a tutor and who knows how that will go at this point. \n\nMy mental health issues absolutely make things way worse of course, and honestly, it doesn\u2019t help too much to know that others are struggling, it just makes me feel like college is a place that sucks the souls out of people. It\u2019s not a good place to be and frankly I\u2019m getting really sick of it. I\u2019m a junior too so it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve just lost the battle immediately. I don\u2019t think college is for everyone and maybe we should find a better way to get ahead in life.",

Literally all of my friends that were in my major didn\u2019t make it(failed and dropped out). Everyone else graduated and moved on with their lives. I feel so freakin alone and sad all the time. I\u2019ve only got a couple months left but I can\u2019t wait to get away from here. My whole experience has sucked out any motivation and happiness that I had when I started. I can only hope that it comes back when/if I get the job I want.",
