  "text": "Back then when I've studied at a german engineering school, we had a big finals project. It could have been basically everything; some built solar panels that automatically followed the sun, others built devices to efficiently produce hydrogen; I built an automaton that converted an XML-based database to another format. (In C++; and handling strings in C++ is a major PITA.) It was just about solving some technical problem with at least some of the knowledge we've got there.\n\nSome failed, but many succeeded.\n\nBut there was one very clear rule, that wasn't even up to discussion: Anyone who suggests to build a perpetuum mobile for his finals project, would be expelled on the spot. No graduation from that school, ever.\n\nAs much as I've seen, nobody tried.\n\n(Although we had built perpetuum mobiles before, at least according to our multimeter readings on some rather creative circuits; but the Electronics Prof just laughed at us, when we came up with our solution for the worlds energy problem.)\n\n-- Now, if you please allow: May I ask if you have such a policy at your institution? Is there a formal rule in place that threatens anyone with exmatriculation once they suggest to invent a perpetuum mobile?",
