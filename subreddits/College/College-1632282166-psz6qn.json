  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at a very prestigious school. I came in not with the proper education. i was really behind in comparison. but i\u2019ve been leaning on others to get me through my classes. (it\u2019s week 4) i cannot do anything in any of my classes but mainly (chem, multi calc, comp sci, climate change physics) i don\u2019t know what to do. this school has a very serious honor code. (we take tests at home and are given a lot of trust. )i want to approach my professors but i\u2019m worried about being expelled because if i met with my teachers one on one it would be VERY obvious i have zero clue about the material. any advice?",

The more pressure your desired industry has, the better equipped they are in identifying bullshit.\n\n\nIgnore anything I said above if you have connections.",

There nothing wrong with your classmates helping you but if they\u2019re doing your work for you it\u2019s going to compound the problem next semester.   I\u2019d also encourage you to be realistic about how you\u2019re doing. Your friends maybe helping you but unless they\u2019re actually taking your exams for you, you\u2019re learning enough to be doing ok. Sounds like you may need some help with note taking, study habits and time management.",

And that fear is normal but if you don't feel comfortable with the material and need more help you need to ask for help from people who can help you. You cant do it all on your own and you'd be screwing yourself even more by not seeking help. You will never get expelled asking for help like this, you can get sacked for bad grades tho.",
