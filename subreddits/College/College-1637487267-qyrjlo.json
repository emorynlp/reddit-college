  "title:": "Graduating late and feeling kinda bad about it",
  "text": "Hi there! I\u2019m currently going to a state school. I was suppose to graduate next semester (spr 2022). I am a triple major in CS, Data Science, and Health Science. I am now scheduled for fall 2023.\n\nHowever, I made some choices over the summer. Reasons why I am graduating late: \n\n- I originally came in as a bio major. Took me until sophomore year to switch.\n\n- Complete a CS degree (only need to finish 9 more classes for a BA) Lots of my CS classes were cross-listed with my DS courses. Also unsure of which tech field I want to get into.\n\n- Scholarship will be able to cover my 5th year. I currently have no student loans. I want to keep it this way. I originally wanted to finish my undergrad then go to grad school for masters in CS, but realized it\u2019s not financially smart & I\u2019d still have to take the same intro classes. \n\n- More time to do internships\n\nI\u2019m grateful to be in a position where I am. But I\u2019m still unsure if I\u2019ve made the right choice. Been feeling kinda insecure and all these Linkedin posts about how my connections are getting full time jobs before they graduate. It\u2019s so hard not to compare yourself to others. Plus I\u2019ll be 24 when I finish.\n\nI mean my question is: \n- Did you graduate late too? \n- How did this effect your job search?",

      "text": "I can\u2019t contribute anything insightful here, but why feel bad graduating late when you won\u2019t only be graduating with two, but three degrees?\n\nThat\u2019s pretty incredible in my opinion, especially when people struggle just to graduate with one.",
