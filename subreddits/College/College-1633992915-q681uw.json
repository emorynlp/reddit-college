  "text": "First of all, I want to say sorry for my bad English, but it isn't my first language. I recently started my 4th year but I basically don't know anything from previous years of learning. I lack fundamental knowledge of my major. I try to learn those informations again and again but I just forget them every time. I don't have bad grades. I'm good at exams but after I pass them, everything I learned just disappears from my head. My knowledge is probably on the same level as the knowledge of someone who never took any of the classes I took the last three years.\n\nI lack any ambitions. I see my colleagues eager to learn and share their knowledge. They know their field of interest (in my major) and I sit here not interested in anything. I don't even have plans for my future work. \n\nI just feel like college was a mistake. Especially my major. But I have only these two last years to deal with and I will graduate.",
