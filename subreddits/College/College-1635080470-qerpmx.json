  "text": "I\u2019m having a hard time understanding what a thesis for a claim of fact essay looks like. I know that it\u2019s an argument which proves or disproves a commonly believed idea or misconception. I have an essay due next week & I want to write about human trafficking. A potential claim I\u2019m thinking of is \u201cSocioeconomically disadvantaged people are at a higher risk of being victim to human trafficking.\u201d Is this a claim of fact or am I missing something?",

      "text": "If you can prove or disprove your claim with evidence, then it is a claim of fact. Argument of fact is different from just regular old \"fact\" because you can make an attempt to prove/disprove it. Fact: chickens have feathers. Can't really argue about this one since you can literally see feathers on chickens. Argument of fact: suicide rates are higher in LBGTQ people than in those who are not. This one is a little more gray. Are you 100% confident in this claim? Is there evidence to back this up? You can probably make an argument with this one by finding data and research to support/dispute this claim.",

      "text": "Is there a particular reason you are choosing that as your question? Personally I feel that when a claim has less moving parts to it, it is easier to take apart and either prove or disprove. Your claim has at least 3 moving parts to it:\n\n\n1. Socioeconomic disadvantaged people\n   -i consider this 2 moving parts because you have to understand what both socioeconomics are as well as how someone is disadvantaged based on their socioeconomic status\n\n2. Higher risk of being a victim of human trafficking\n\nHave you any ideas on how to prove or disprove such a claim?",
