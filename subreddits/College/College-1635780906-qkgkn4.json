  "text": "I just don't understand. Prior to this semester I was great.  Now all of a sudden I have a C for physics & a D for chemistry. I feel so sure of myself then when I get the test, I flunk it. I'm working towards the medical route but if I can't pass a single test what makes me so sure I'll excel veterinarian school. I know if I want to go I need to have the best of the best grades. I'm thinking maybe medicine just won't be my thing.",

Physics and Chemistry are both tough subjects and do need a certain amount of studying for succeed in it. Form studying groups in your classes and try to take effective notes in the classes. If you want good studying materials and sources, try looking the Youtube channel, \"The Organic Chemistry Tutor\" on Youtube. He helps well with physics and chemistry.",

Teacher just have PowerPoints of the chapter so I just feel like I'm not actually learning. I have to teach myself how to work the problems and i feel like I'm confusing myself by looking at different resources like YouTube or books and such since they all do it differently.",

Organic chemistry and physics 1? I suggest that you study longer hours and should be able to take a break. Have you been sleeping healthy? There's othe good habits that can help you out",

I tried videos, tutoring, asking the TA for help, I\u2019ve tried everything and I\u2019m still barely holding on. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shame in realizing that something isn\u2019t for you, as long as you try your best. I would try absolutely every option before giving up though.",
