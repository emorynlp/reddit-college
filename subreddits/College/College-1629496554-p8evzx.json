  "text": "I'm an introvert who struggled to make friends all throughout college. I tend to be too nervous to start conversations unless it's a forced situation like with roommates, and I am guilty of judging a book by its cover. Someone who visually looks like the type of person who would not talk to me is someone I'm not talking to. My high school friends are still solid, and I just don't care anymore as a senior, but this just happened.\n\nI had the privilege of shadowing an extrovert at an event, and she had a friend group assembled in just minutes. This girl was indiscriminate about who she was talking to. She just went for it. Literally the next four people who approached our area were roped into a circle and added to a group chat, and everyone was invited to another event. This is the first time I've seen \"it's easy to make friends in college\" happen in real life. I was amazed lol. Like, what power is this???",

What should I say?\u201d Nobody is thinking about you as much as you are, and maybe  if you say something weird that relates with someone else, you can make a cool friend. Introverted people I\u2019ve know always held back sharing niche interests and thinks in fear of judgement. but as an extrovert, I\u2019d genuinely like to hear it. but also introversion and extroversion have nothing to do with confidence and charisma, it has to do with how much you yearn to actually connect with people. I make good conversation because I actually am interested in other people. other people I find can\u2019t make friends because really, they don\u2019t care and are just caring for the sake of having \u201cfriends\u201d around. But also personally I\u2019d rather be introverted, I care too much about feeling connected with people and most people would rather mostly be alone, and just have u by their side in case they feel like talking for once. Which feels isolating. I would say I have more friends than most but I probably feel alone more than someone who\u2019s just content with being alone. I am only as secure as my surroundings are",
