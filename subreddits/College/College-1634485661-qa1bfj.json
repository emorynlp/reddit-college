  "text": "Hello I\u2019m in desperate need for help. I\u2019m applying to college right now and i want to go far away i really do but i don\u2019t want to be in debt. I want to go to a big school but still get scholarships. I live in Michigan I have a 3.8 GPA and a few extracurriculars. Do you guys know any big schools anywhere in America with great scholarships?",
