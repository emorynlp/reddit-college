Long story short, I hate this class, like HATE ITT. It depresses me just thinking that I have to go to that class and I\u2019m doing very bad in the class too. At this point, I think it is best to just drop it and focus my attention on other classes, but at the same time, I\u2019ll be a little behind on graduating and I\u2019m afraid my girlfriend might think less of me. Any advice?", "author": "HydrogenRocketman", "created": 1632742129, "retrieved": 1632800208, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hegmzq6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwf2bh/should_i_drop_a_class/hegmzq6/", "text": "Sounds like you already have your answer and just need reassurance.
