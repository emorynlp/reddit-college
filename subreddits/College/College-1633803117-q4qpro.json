      "text": "There are certainly classes early on that serve as weed out classes. There\u2019s also the whole idea that your understanding gets better as you go on, but I have honestly experienced easier material in my later classes than my earlier ones. However, I\u2019m in biology so we had to first get through all the molecular stuff before moving on to the bigger concepts. For example, understanding every step of cellular respiration was a lot more difficult than explaining what impacts fragmentation can have on a habitat. I had a lot of trouble with those more detailed concepts, but apparently not as much as the people who failed out. I don\u2019t know if others have experienced it that way or not, but that\u2019s just what I\u2019ve noticed.",

      "text": "Tends to be the experience, considering weed out classes but also tackling new concepts. \n\nPhysics, Organic Chemistry, and Calculus are classes whose prerequisites generally do not prepare you for the type of material you\u2019re expected to learn and how to learn them. I can do Organic Chemistry effortlessly, but between the rote memorization and spatial aspects, among others, it\u2019s among the most difficult classes for a reason.\n\nYou can learn more complex topics if you have the foundation, *but you can\u2019t lay the foundation for a foundation*. These introductory courses throw a ton at you so you have a good foundation to build on for that topic.",
