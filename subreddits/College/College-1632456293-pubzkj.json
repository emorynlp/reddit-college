  "text": "Today I had a exam for a online class and in the middle of the exam my professor sent out a email which I saw as a notification from my phone and stated that he extended the time for the exam up till 10pm and on Canvas all of the sudden the time remaining left went up (meaning I got more time added) and I was confused so I talked to a live chat representative of the proctoring service (because I couldn\u2019t leave the tab) and they told me the exam was extended for everyone and I ended up taking all that extra time but when I turned it in, it came up as \u201clate\u201d on canvas although I turned it in before the new extended time.",
