  "text": "Hello, my name is Tyler and I am taking Qualitative Research Methods at my university this semester. As part of my final project, I have to carry out my research proposal with a small sample size. I am hoping to interview 3-5 college students over zoom. My study is about exploring the motivations of college students who utilize computer-mediated communication (texting, emailing, IM-ing, posting on social media, etc.) to self-disclose and make and maintain connections with others; in addition to what specific channels they use and why they prefer those channels.\n\nThis study is not exclusive to any particular channel. If you are a part of any online communities, use certain features of social media to talk about your thoughts and feelings, or simply text your friends about your ideas, you fit into this topic. If you\u2019re really into Discord, Slack, Tweeting, posting on your social media stories, sharing posts on Facebook and adding to them, emailing your parents even, it all has to do with computer-mediated self-disclosure. The research has nothing to do with the frequency of your use, follower count, likes, online popularity, but rather what you are talking about and the depth and variety of that content.\n\nInterviews will last 30 minutes and will be recorded over zoom. I am the only one who will watch them, and only to transcribe the interview. After that, the recording will be deleted and a pseudonym will be used in place of your name in the final research report. This is an opportunity for you to talk about anything you want pertaining to why you use online methods to self-disclose and/or make and maintain friendships. Your answers will be included in this research, my senior thesis work, and if I go to grad school, I\u2019m sure there as well.\n\nI've been having trouble finding people who specifically use online methods as opposed to face-to-face communication to self-disclose. If you are interested in being part of this study, please message me for more details!\n\nThank you!",
