I graduated with my AA and I'm starting nursing school in the fall but I took a year off to take any extra classes I needed at Community College and the only thing I had to pay for was books. I just don't understand why more people don't see it as the opportunity it is. You don't have to go to a big four year university at first. Most of the time the first two years is just the general education classes anyway.\n\nEdit to add: I mean I get people wanting traditional experience but everyone I know that went to a four year was sent home by thanksgiving anyway.\n\n2nd edit: it\u2019s so nice to see everyone\u2019s opinions! I wish there wasn\u2019t such a stigma around CC. I understand why someone would want to go straight to a 4 year I just wish it wasn\u2019t expected of everyone. Thanks for all the responses!",

Like for me I\u2019m still planning on getting the college experience by living in a residence hall and joining clubs and etc. The best part is that the residents hall that I\u2019ll live in will be apartment style and that is only offered to sophomores and above.

Also in early University you are typically taking classes outside your major anyways so networking with your entry level English professor when you are Computer science student is not as effective.",

Obviously it might be different for other fields. It took me going through two rounds of recruiting to land an internship that started after my last semester of my undergrad. These firms recruit a year in advance so by not being on campus earlier prevented me from getting the internship under my belt before graduation. They also run these summer leadership programs for younger students that I missed out on. \n\nAs for professors I agree that it is not as important in the first two years. I also don\u2019t view that as being as beneficial in general unless you\u2019re more focused on academia.\n\nAlso Go Mean Green!",

If you're looking to get very involved in research, orgs, clubs, competitions early on, a university will be the better option. I got involved with an international engineering competition freshman year, and by junior year I was running my University's branch. I honestly got more out of that comp than classes, and I really enjoyed it. It was also cited by my boss as one of the major reasons I got hired.\n\nIf I had gone to CC I wouldnt have had those same opportunities and wouldn't have the same job now that I love.

However, being involved for twice as long will always be better. You make more connections and can build better relationships with professors/staff with more time. \n\nIts become a balancing act with money now though. 9 times out of 10 the best bang for your buck will be 2 years CC then university because university is so unreasonably expensive today. If you have the ability to pay for university through scholarships/grants/work and can do it with little to no debt its important to know there are benefits.\n\nAnecdotal, but while 2 year students can do well and contribute with research/orgs/comps, the majority in leadership roles or doing more advanced research are almost always 4 year students in my experience.",

I wanted to get into a specific program at one of the state schools and it would require me to retake the SAT and that was just not appealing to me. I didn\u2019t really care about school at that point in time and I didn\u2019t even really want to go to college. \nWhen I tell you it was the best decision I could have made for myself, I was suddenly given the ability to study what I wanted to study, get gen Ed\u2019s out of the way and get the individualized attention I needed, all on my schedule. I ended my first semester with a 3.8 gpa (I\u2019m not good at math) and every other semester with a 4.0. I graduated high school with a 3.2. I also joined clubs and got to be editor in chief of my CC\u2019s newspaper. I ended my time there with an internship and an acceptance into the program that I needed to get into. Now when I got to university I was able to hit the ground running 4.0 gpa, I joined clubs and got prestigious jobs on campus. I have paid less than half of what my peers have paid in 4 years (tuition at cc 1k a semester, at university it was 10k), I was able to get elected student body president and have job prospects when I graduate. Community college will build you up and give you the skills you need to be successful. I promise your abilities to have the \u201ccollege experience\u201d will still be there when you get to university. (Not to mention that I was able to work full-time for most of my cc time and I have quite a bit saved up.) I am in a far better place coming out of undergrad than my peers and I can almost entirely thank community college for that.",

Also as for AP classes one your teachers have to let you do AP classes at least at my school you had to prove in your previous classes that you could do the work well. As for community college it\u2019s really not as prestigious and you miss out on the college experience. I severely regret it because I spent all my time working or traveling when I wasn\u2019t doing school. Didn\u2019t meet many friends, didn\u2019t get research opportunities, didn\u2019t have close connections with professors. It really removes the whole experience so if you can afford it or your parents actually file their taxes unlike mine then I would say go to a cheaper state school which is what I do now. I will say it benefited me with more freedom to work and travel but overall that didn\u2019t last and I wish I had spent more time like everyone else. Granted my family and I were going through stuff and I didn\u2019t have the money or focus to do full time at a university but I really missed out and it shows because I don\u2019t have any college friends.",

Third the social setting, environment, and general scene is not for everyone. As for the question of why more people aren\u2019t taking college or AP classes in high school the answer is a lot of people aren\u2019t capable or motivated enough to do them. Not everyone has the capacity to do tougher extra courses beyond schoolwork. On the other hand AP/IB classes are indeed very common among high performing high school students who aspire for the countries top 80ish colleges.

Taking Physics 101 from Harvard vs. Physics 101 from a CC roughly covers pretty much the same material and even the same txtbk. And now that classes have been online for almost a year, we realize how all the things we pay for an elite school doesn't matter. It's like we're paying for a \"Brand\" to put on our resume. But more and more employers now days do not care where you went to school. Your education is what you make of it and shouldn't matter whether you went to a CC or prestigious 4 year uni. Online classes aren't ideal now and I'm sure every college student no matter what school they attended are in the same boat now (no clubs , sports, social events within the school). \n\nI feel bad for the kids that paid so much for school only just to do it for home this year. But I definitely think CC needs less stigma and can offer a quality education, less competition/pressure, and individual attention from professors.\n\nAP/IB classes aren't available in all high schools especially in lower income communities. My town, for instance, didn't offer IB. Administering & taking AP exams are expensive and that's how the CollegeBoard makes its money.  \n\nFrom my experience taking many, I can say that AP classes also are very difficult and require a lot of time, effort, and homework so not all students can achieve that. Especially in a school day where you have about 8-9 periods in a day. I missed out on prom or doing things like homecoming or learning to drive or didn't really hang out with friends ever outside of school. \n\nAlso, the fact that the one test for the individual subject is the determining factor in whether you get credit or not, which is typically 3-5 score. That can place a lot of pressure into students especially those who have performance and test anxiety.",

I originally wanted to go to to uni for the college experience however I hated it. I got unlucky and placed in the international building, despite the many cool people and cultures I experienced it was not at all what my other friends were experiencing in their dorms.\nI have one term left now at CC, and already have an ok job lined up that I got with the assistance of my advisors who fucking rock!! They sent out opportunities for internships and jobs all the time and met with us each term to check up. CC is also so much easier for changing your major with little penalty financially. Literally even just taking one class in a topic your interested in can help you decide if you want to persue it or not, and at Oregon State it was costly and you would have to change advisors or colleges to take classes outside your major. CC? So easy. My two years hear have cost as much as one term with housing. Since moving home and going to CC I was able to easily get a part time job and move out in a fairly large city, pay rent and utilities, get 3 years of work experience. \nI\u2019d highly recommend community college first if you think a dorm experience isn\u2019t for you, you meet a broader group of people, your peers are usually there for a reason and taking it semi seriously. It\u2019s good. Also trades, two years in Electrical or welding or whatever and you will be making bank and coming out with way less debt. The stigma attached to CC is just bogus, and anyone who judges them or students from there as less, are dicks.",

Maybe the 4 year will teach those subjects at a higher standard. However, they are still the same classes and those pre req classes do not matter as much as the higher level classes. Frankly, a 4 year is only good for the high level major classes. Those are the classes that matter not the pre reqs. You can come from a community college and transfer to Harvard and still be at the same level as someone who took pre reqs at a 4 year.\n\nAlso, dual enrollment is way better than an AP class because you are learning from teachers who are specialized in teaching college level classes rather than a High School teacher. Especially right now it's easy to do dual enrollment if your classes are online.",

I found myself incredibly bored and distracted. I was 10 minutes from where I went to HS, in class and surrounded by far too many people I went to HS with. While my close friends were off having new experiences and living college life the way you imagine it to be. I regularly found myself making trips out to their universities and neglecting my responsibilities at home.

I didn't have to move home because I never left, I just picked up more hours at work the following semester.       \n     \nThis is not to discredit what CC offers because a few years later I returned and now I'm about to be transferring to my university of choice as a junior following this semester. It is more so a warning to those considering this option that if you desire the traditional college experience don't discount that. It can be worth the increased cost, or going to your second choice.

      "text": "There is stigma associated with CC. People may assume you did not do well in high school. Some people did well in high school but want to have an easier transition to college. \n\nMost people live at home when they go to a CC and for some people they would rather be off on their own at this point. I can understand this very well, I chose CC and it has been great but home life has become increasingly stressful. If I knew it would end up like that I may have chose a UC. Even though I love the low tuition costs and avoidance of debt. \n\nThere are cons to CC and it is not for everyone. \nFor example:\n- people with stressful home lives\n-people who want to be independent\n-people who want to have the \u201ccollege experience\u201d and live in a dorm. \n-people who have full rides or plenty of scholarships making a 4 yr university a more logical choice. \n- people who know what they want to do as a career already\n- also people who have the $ taken care of and can afford a 4 year without loans, who may already know what the want to do. \n- people who want to graduate early\n\nMy personal cons to CC:\n- You cannot take intro to upper level classes. For example I want to do Neuroscience but there is no \u201cintro to neuroscience\u201d course I can take at my CC to determine if the workload and subject matter is something I want to stick with. Unlike at a 4 year school this class may be an option for people. \n- Also doing undergrad research can be difficult because there are fewer opportunities because most students don\u2019t do research at CC. \n- You don\u2019t have the strong community feeling at a CC like a 4 year. It is harder to make friends because some don\u2019t stay very long, many work, some are just there to switch careers and don\u2019t want to meet new people. Also, when you transfer it can be hard to integrate into the campus and you have less time to make solid friendships. This does kind of suck because college friendships for some last a long time and you may come out of college with fewer strong friendships than someone at a 4 yr the whole time. It is harder to make friends but is not impossible, it just takes more effort on your part. \n- you also have to do college apps while doing your college classes and for some that will be harder than completing them senior year of HS so something to keep in mind. \n- not every school accepts many transfers so you may be \u201cout of luck\u201d for some schools. May depend on which year you are transferring into though - transferring into junior yr is a lot easier than earlier years.  \n\nI think everyone knows the pros about CC so I won\u2019t mention them here. (I listed cons - don\u2019t assume that I dislike CC. I like it more than I dislike it - I\u2019m just answering OP\u2019s question).",

There are no networking/research/job search opportunities for many fields and there is only one course in the entire catalog that relates to the field I'm going into.

I don't know how many credits he takes, but for me that would be less than $3000 total per semester for a SINGLE on-campus dorm, meals and basics paid for (e.g TP, soap because the campus markets sell it), and 12 credits of classes. \n\nFor others, like myself, their homelife was/is bad and since community colleges don't usually have on campus housing, there's usually at least one community college per county (often with multiple campuses in larger counties), and the housing market is difficult to jump into at 18 with a min-wage job and no credit/renting history, the dorms of a 4-yr is the often only palatable option they have to get away.",

In my state, not every high school offers dual credit, not every student could afford the extra fees, and not every student could get into those classes.  Plus, some students get offered a hefty scholarship/aid package that wouldn't be available to them as a transfer student so they have to go straight to traditional university after high school to take advantage of that.  \n\nObviously this year was a big hot mess with online classes and quarantining, etc. I do know that at the small, state university I teach at, we had decreased enrollment and fewer face to face classes but we opened our residence halls to as many students as needed to live there.  They still weren't at full capacity but a lot of our students from rural areas benefitted by living on campus and having access to the wifi, food service, and other things.  Had they stayed home, I don't think they would have gotten any of their schoolwork done and would have failed.  (Our community colleges don't offer housing...they are \"commuter only\" so that also makes a difference).\n\nI am encouraging both of my nephews to get as much dual credit and AP courses that they can.  My oldest one already knows he wants to go to grad school, so he might as well get ahead while he can (and he's smart enough to ace the classes).  My younger nephew isn't sure on what he wants to do just yet, but it wouldn't hurt him to get dual credit in some of the basics so he has the time/credit hours available to take some extra college courses that speak to his interests.  We also know that Pell Grants won't be an option for them due to parental income, so they can save money by getting credits done in high school.  However, if they are offered a good scholarship (the oldest is smart enough to get the highest level of scholarships at college he wants to attend), staying home and taking CC classes before matriculating on campus would cause them to lose that scholarship money.  It all comes down to the math when the time comes.",

For those of whom just seeking a job, there\u2019s no reason not to. People might not want to admit that there\u2019s a distinction between what you get at Wharton versus a community business school, but for the majority it\u2019s not a different story. The level of education you\u2019d get at a community college isn\u2019t all that different from what you\u2019d get outside of a T-50 school. Plus cost is an enormous factor.\n\nBearing that in mind, the reputation of a school is an enormous factor for a lot of interviewers and when you network in general. When people ask \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d And you say a CC? Prepare for the bad looks. The \u201cOh...cool\u201d responses. Should it be that way? No. Same as why it shouldn\u2019t matter if you grew up in downtown Chicago or if you grew up without a father. But people do care. It\u2019s the reality of the situation. People aren\u2019t as bad as they used to be (90s, 2000s) but are still judgemental. And thus, people are far more willing to sacrifice a substantial amount of money to avoid that association.\n\nCombine that with what other users have mentioned\u2014college experience and such\u2014and community college just isn\u2019t appreciated.",

One part of the problem is that only 30 percent of community college students succeed in transferring to a four-year institution.\u201d That\u2019s from the [Hechinger Report](https://www.google.com/amp/s/hechingerreport.org/why-so-few-students-transfer-from-community-colleges-to-four-year-universities/) and links some study from the National Student Clearinghouse Center.\n\nIf you actually manage to transfer, best of luck to you. But my point stands for a good chunk of people. Many dropout or just end up getting a Bachelor\u2019s from their CC. Again, I\u2019m not giving the claim that CC will lead nowhere; but my father experienced this stigma, and a lot of people I know do too. But you asked why more people don\u2019t attend CC\u2014why people don\u2019t see the \u201copportunity\u201d that it is\u2014and my answer is because most people acknowledge the financial gain but are pressured into it being outweighed by societal expectations.",

At one school you can come in as a mid-year sophomore by credits because of you passed enough APs, whereas at another you might get no credits or they give you credits but the credits only count as electives.",

And i also feel like you have that closer experience on the major you pick on. And its would be easy work if i decided to get my batchelors. I understand others wanna have that university life but i feel like that wasnt me at all. I wanted to do it in cheapest way for me and my prents. Overall i still have good experience in and out",

It helped get me ahead and reduced the number of general ed classes I needed, so I can pull back a bit for these online semesters and not be behind in any way. However, I didn't go to community College. It was an option, and I considered it, but decided it wasn't worth it for me. Accedemically and financially, I would have been better off. I would have had a year to adjust to being in a college course setting, and would have likely been able to get a job while staying with my parents so save up so as not to need to take out any loans in the future. However, for me personally, I had enough saved up that with financial aid and scholarships, it wasn't the biggest issue. I decided that I would rather have my independence sooner and be able to live away from my family than have the advantages community college offers. YMMV, but i don't regret my decision at all",

People are sold the college experience of living in dorms, partying and having and fun with your friends and being away from your parents. You can't really do this at most CC's (most don't have dorms) and most young people who go to a CC are going locally, so they're probably living at home (most all of the young people my age at the CC lived at home). And making friends at commuter school's is hard! Most people want to go home, and lots of events don't have a huge turnout because people don't want to drive out of their way for free pizza at a mixer. \n\nAnd tbh I'll admit that I feel like I missed out because even though I transferred to a university, it was local one. I never got the college experience, and seeing my friends end up at the same place as me but with tons more experiences and fun, I definitely feel like I missed out.

I grew up with strict parents so my high school experience sucked and I didn't have a ton of friend's.  While they softened up in college, they were still kinda strict, and like I said making friends at a commuter school is hard.

Went to community college for a couple of years and worked my ass off before transferring this fall. People would ask me what I was doing or which college I was going to and I would sheepishly have to say \u201ccommunity college\u201d, waiting for a reply that seemed to put down where I was going. \n\nI received some unkind responses but never let it phase me and now I\u2019m finishing out my undergrad at one of the most prestigious and rigorous engineering universities in the world (my major being Mechanical Engineering). And despite CC\u2019s reputation for being \u201ceasier\u201d, I still got 3 A+\u2019s and 1 A for my first semester at my new university. \n\nI feel incredibly blessed that I was given a second chance at receiving a good education and am thankful for the time I spent at community college. I met so many hard working professors and students who I still keep in touch with and who are doing incredible things. I know people who are getting PhD\u2019s in engineering at MIT and Stanford and who also started out at community college. Some people decide to go to community college cause of money and others because they didn\u2019t do so well in high school. All of these reasons are perfectly valid and we shouldn\u2019t think of anyone as being \u201cless than\u201d for not going to a 4 year university straight out of high school. It was a great choice for me and it allowed me to grow and gain skills and experiences that I probably would not have gotten if I went straight to university.",

My parents even pushed for it, so I can't really say it was me wanting to leave home fully, as it was an enforced thing from all the adults in my life. But I think it is also worth noting they went to college when it was far cheaper so the loan burden I signed onto when I was 17 was like...already more than what my dad had after he got his master's \ud83e\udd74",

I live in SE MI so I study in Toledo. I\u2019m so grateful that the education/ credit system is universal and pretty painless in Ohio. They def know what they are doing!\n\nEdit: To elaborate, I went to a CC in Ann Arbor. I wanted to transfer my credits to UMich or MSU but it was a lot easier to just transfer my credits to UToledo somehow.. So that\u2019s where I went. And along the way, I figured out that most Ohio students don\u2019t have this problem at all. Like if you wanted to transfer credits from Owens to UT or UT to Ohio State University you could pretty painlessly and without much thought. It just seems universal in Ohio. Can\u2019t say the exact same for Michigan.",

[This](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfers-major) page is from UC Admissions and breaks down each major at each UC and the average GPA ranges that were admitted and enrolled from 2019. If you go to a CCC, can also look up the breakdown of your CCC's admit to the different UC's (though idk how much that aspect matters tbh - my CCC had pretty average admits but I've seen Bay Area CC's get more which makes sense bc proximity while my closer UC is Davis).\n\nMy major is on the easier end to get in, and is in the L&S college. The range was something like 3.5-3.9 is the avg admit GPA, and I was about a 3.77 when I applied and a 3.89 when I transferred. I had a rocky start at CSU, and early CC was mediocre, but I also just had a crapload of classes and generally did well just changed majors like crazy. The last 2 years before I transferred is where I pretty much averaged 3.9-4.0 semesters and my GPA increased a lot. Generally I see it noted that an upward trend can work heavily in your favor if you have some rocky areas in your transcripts early on. There is also a section in the UC App that you can go into areas of your transcript, and explain the discrepancies a bit.\n\nGoing back to GPA and major, some are incredibly impacted and do expect that 3.9+ GPA, but you have figure out if yours actually is or what the admit range is. In these more impacted areas, I'd probably rec getting into EC's that are major related (honestly rec that for any major, but especially impacted ones) as it further shows your interest in the major + it can be used in your PIQ's in the App as well. My major I ended up a TA and lab tech in the department, and it lead to an outside school internship and job. Was able to use it in both EC section and PIQ section, but just went over different aspects of it (EC was more straight forward/what my tasks and expectations were, hours, etc - PIQ was what I learned and how I grew from it).\n\nBerkeley specifically really wants the IGETC to be finished - a lot of the others it can be partial, but Berkeley has a larger emphasis on it and it streamlines the transfer process considerably. None of my credits were contested/had to be redone bc I had the IGETC finished, so I transferred over the max allowed 70 np.",

Many can feel like where they live doesn't let them expand their professional life. This can be due to location or connections with professors and/or the connections that the college can offer. If you go to a R1 research college and make good connections with your professors early on you can get good recommendation letters and be in their research cohort.\n\nCommunity college is a great opportunity financially and it's definitely a better path financially, but for many people, especially for one's right out of high school, finances aren't the only thing that is being looked at.",

Lots of high school kids (and adults too) aren't willing/able to see that short term sacrifices can (potentially) lead to long term success. I took AP classes myself and even I didn't fully realize how valuable they were until I got to skip both English classes in college while my friends were writing essays.

And some people have extremely high expectations, either placed by themselves or their family.\n\nAlso, I kinda get that some people view failing as meaning they aren't smart/ capable. Ignorance is bliss. If you never take an AP class, you get to believe that you could've if you put in the effort, you just chose not to. You know, the \"I could quit at any time, I just choose not to\" rhetoric. But if you actually try then fail, you know now that you couldn't pass. Even if you failed because you had a terrible teacher or something, you still failed and have to live with that. Whereas if you never tried, you get to say \"well I'm sure I could've passed, I'm a great crammer and that subject is so easy.\" \n\nAnd yes, this used to be my mentality before I realized that I'd rather know than not know.",
