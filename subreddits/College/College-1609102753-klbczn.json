I can understand this very well, I chose CC and it has been great but home life has become increasingly stressful. If I knew it would end up like that I may have chose a UC.

For example I want to do Neuroscience but there is no \u201cintro to neuroscience\u201d course I can take at my CC to determine if the workload and subject matter is something I want to stick with. Unlike at a 4 year school this class may be an option for people. \n- Also doing undergrad research can be difficult because there are fewer opportunities because most students don\u2019t do research at CC. \n- You don\u2019t have the strong community feeling at a CC like a 4 year. It is harder to make friends because some don\u2019t stay very long, many work, some are just there to switch careers and don\u2019t want to meet new people. Also, when you transfer it can be hard to integrate into the campus and you have less time to make solid friendships. This does kind of suck because college friendships for some last a long time and you may come out of college with fewer strong friendships than someone at a 4 yr the whole time. It is harder to make friends but is not impossible, it just takes more effort on your part. \n- you also have to do college apps while doing your college classes and for some that will be harder than completing them senior year of HS so something to keep in mind. \n- not every school accepts many transfers so you may be \u201cout of luck\u201d for some schools.
