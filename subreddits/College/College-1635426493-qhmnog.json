But I\u2019ve heard some people state that universities are considered \u201cbetter\u201d than colleges and I was just wondering if this was academically true since I plan on applying to a college I really like.",

There is a difference, which I believe and someone is welcome to correct me, uni's have graduate studies while colleges do not. That's why in some uni's there's also sub colleges because those are dedicated to undergrads. Either way it doesn't matter.",

So be prepared to pay or borrow $200k for medschool.  \n - All med schools in the US have the same mandatory pre-req classes you MUST complete to be a qualified applicant.  \n* A larger school might have some additional mentoring or preparatory classes to prepare students for the MCAT and/or med school.  \n - You also need to gather a couple hundred hours of volunteer time in a medical environment.  \n* A smaller school might help deliver deeper more connected learning of foundational materials.  \n\n\n-----  \n\nI encourage you to subscribe to /r/premed and see what others are talking about.  \n\nI also very much encourage you to read their excellent [FAQ](/r/premed/comments/5gc2ri/welcome_to_rpremed_heres_our_faq/).",

      "text": "As far as what it means for you, a university is probably more likely to have better opportunities for you as far as networking with high profile companies, looking good for grad/med school applications, research team opportunities etc. However, a lot of professors that are really great at research are awful teachers and care very little about their students, so sometimes your education will suffer more from that. So if you have high goals to go work for a big company like Microsoft right out of school, going to Local Town College probably isn't going to get you there. But if your major isn't something that has these high profile, high competition companies, or you don't have a desire to work for one, then save the money and go to a local college.",
