Then this kid who I don't even think is in our class came on the Zoom meeting loudly blabbering to his roommate about eggs and clanging pots and pans which only increased the professor's agitation tenfold. After 5 minutes of telling this rando to mute his mic and said rando I guess not hearing him or being out of range idk, professor abruptly removed himself from the Zoom meeting and left us all sitting there with derp faces wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nThanks a lot Korben.

She\u2019s teaching her class via Zoom right now and even though students were provided equipment and internet if they didn\u2019t have it previously, she said about half of her class hasn\u2019t been participating. When she started reaching out to those families individually, she found most of them couldn\u2019t figure out how to work Zoom so their kids haven\u2019t been on. And I feel so bad for these kids, most of them enroll into school late and leave the year early because they go wherever their parents go, and their parents are in no position to educate them.
