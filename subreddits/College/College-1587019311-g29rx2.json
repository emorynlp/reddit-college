  "title:": "Welp, my already flustered professor rage quit in the middle of our Zoom lecture today. How's your online semester going?",
  "text": "My professor can't figure out the Zoom interface (the other two professors are having no issues with it), but this particular one somehow locked himself into a 30 minute time limit, so today he was scrambling to fit all the lecture material into that brief time slot and frustrating himself in the process. Then this kid who I don't even think is in our class came on the Zoom meeting loudly blabbering to his roommate about eggs and clanging pots and pans which only increased the professor's agitation tenfold. After 5 minutes of telling this rando to mute his mic and said rando I guess not hearing him or being out of range idk, professor abruptly removed himself from the Zoom meeting and left us all sitting there with derp faces wondering what the hell just happened.\n\nThanks a lot Korben. I paid good money for these classes and you made my professor cry.",

Schools are not giving their staff enough information on how to work Zoom and for people that aren\u2019t tech savvy it\u2019s a struggle to figure out. My professor decided Zoom was too complicated so she recorded videos for our last unit. But I would\u2019ve been able to do so much better on the last test had it been Zoom lectures. But I really can\u2019t blame the staff, I blame the school for not having resources prepared for the teachers and students.\n\nUnrelated to college, my sister teaches 4th grade at a very poor school where most of the parents are migrant workers and very undereducated. She\u2019s teaching her class via Zoom right now and even though students were provided equipment and internet if they didn\u2019t have it previously, she said about half of her class hasn\u2019t been participating. When she started reaching out to those families individually, she found most of them couldn\u2019t figure out how to work Zoom so their kids haven\u2019t been on. And I feel so bad for these kids, most of them enroll into school late and leave the year early because they go wherever their parents go, and their parents are in no position to educate them. Some really bright students are left behind because our system doesn\u2019t have a way to help them.",

Doing labs online is a bit harder since we can't ask any questions. I do going to miss in bio near the end of the semester one lab was going to but cut a pig open which I really wanted to do.

This far in there is no excuse for professors failing at basic use of Zoom.",

I want to know where these gosh darned  rabble-rousers that everyone talks about are!\n\nAll jokes aside, in my Modern Physics class everyone is left unmuted >50% percent of the time and we are all very respectful of that responsibility. People take turns responding to questions without needing to raise their hands, are silent otherwise, and mute themselves if someone comes into the room they're in.\n\n\n I see these videos of people trolling in Zoom classes and I just can't imagine what kind of person it takes to actively try to disrupt the class that they paid for and need a good grade in. This is university, people. You're going back (hopefully) in the fall. You think your professors and classmates take kindly to your disrespect toward them? I guess in a very large university (and choice of major) there's less accountability, but still...why can't some people act like adults?",

The only large class I'm in (macroeconomics) they do video lectures instead of Zoom, so I haven't seen too many people being annoying.\n\nZoom has a good feature though -- you can leave yourself muted and press/hold the space bar to temporarily unmute. This, I think, is the best way to do it. Background sound doesn't get picked up if you're muted, but you can easily answer questions quickly, like if you were there in person.",

That way everyone gets a chance to speak and my professor gets to hear from everyone. We also have open discussions on forums. Yeah, it's a lot of work for her, but it seems worth it to her and it forces everyone to participate.",
