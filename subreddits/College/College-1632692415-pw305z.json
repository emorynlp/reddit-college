You should expect the course work to be more rigorous, it\u2019s college, it\u2019s supposed to challenge you and force you to grow. It also is supposed to teach you time management skills that will undoubtedly aid you in \u201cthe real world\u201d. Granted some courses are drastically more difficult than others, but if proper planning is used to balance highly rigorous courses with easy electives or lower level requirements those courses should also not be a problem. I\u2019m currently in my second term of taking 4, 8 week courses simultaneously and I could barely even call my currently smothering workload to be unfair, even though I have next to no free time, my social life has disappeared, and I haven\u2019t gotten a full nights sleep since classes started. I knew what I was signing up for at the time I did so, and I\u2019ve managed to maintain a 4.0 while doing so. That\u2019s my reward for diligently disciplining myself to do what needs done by being chained to my laptop. Something can hardly be unfair when one was in agreement to making the required commitments before beginning. If a social life and large amounts of free time are more important than earning your degree cut back to part time status or get out of the kitchen entirely if you can\u2019t handle the heat, the classes won\u2019t get easier as you progress.

Here\u2019s my take:\n\nA lot of work I\u2019ve been given thus far has just been busy work. Do I think it\u2019s reasonable that we\u2019re paying 60k a year and I have to memorize lines from a Shakespeare play that I\u2019m never going to use again? Nah. In fact, I think having a workload that is overbearing busy work makes students resent the actual content. In my opinion, many students get stuck on busy work and don\u2019t actually appreciate or retain what\u2019s being taught.\n\nBut work is necessary. We need to constantly refine our reading and writing skills, math, etc.\n\nI feel that the amount of work varies for everyone though. Some majors just have less homework than others - or at least less rigorous work. Some profs are more lenient. Others don\u2019t have work other than studying (which is up to the student)\n\nIt\u2019s a hard question to answer", "author": "Different-Stress6041", "created": 1632724646, "upvotes": 1}, "hefj9q2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw305z/is_the_amount_of_work_fair_to_anyone/hefj9q2/", "text": "Dude you\u2019re at a university the schoolwork as rigorous as a general depending on the school you\u2019re going to it could be more challenging than others but it\u2019s still college the workload is higher than in high school for most cases. The expected amount of studying is basically the equivalent to working a full-time job about 30 hours a week this is pretty damn normal and they aren\u2019t going to adjust the curriculum for people who are also working or may have other shit going on like if their parents or something.
