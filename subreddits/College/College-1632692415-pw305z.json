  "text": "Is the amount of work that colleges assign fair and reasonable to anyone here?\n\nIn my opinion, it would be fine to give us more work if we already knew how to do it. \n\nHowever we are given so much assignments and so much work on top of having to learn it and maybe even teaching ourselves. \n\nWhat are your opinions on this?",

The last 3 semesters I think have been fine and understandable in terms of work load but the ones I have this semester are driving me nuts.\n\nFor context though, I'm a full time worker and part time student. \n\nThis semester, I have one class that expects 16-20  assignments a week (not including reading the chapter or power point). While some are just easy quizzes, others are essays and take days to finish. \n\nMy other professor didn't show up for 3 weeks, posted an open ended assignment that ended up being 15 pages long. 15 pages. In a week and a half! Not including reading, which we would have had no idea the chapters to read since they were weird ones like 10, 12, and 13 to start the semester. \n\nSo yea, I think its too much this semester. I haven't been pressed this much for time before despite my school load staying the same. I wish professors were help to a much higher standard.",

      "text": "A full time college class schedule (4-5 courses) over a 16 week semester doesn\u2019t require an unrealistic amount of time to complete the workload. You should expect the course work to be more rigorous, it\u2019s college, it\u2019s supposed to challenge you and force you to grow. It also is supposed to teach you time management skills that will undoubtedly aid you in \u201cthe real world\u201d. Granted some courses are drastically more difficult than others, but if proper planning is used to balance highly rigorous courses with easy electives or lower level requirements those courses should also not be a problem. I\u2019m currently in my second term of taking 4, 8 week courses simultaneously and I could barely even call my currently smothering workload to be unfair, even though I have next to no free time, my social life has disappeared, and I haven\u2019t gotten a full nights sleep since classes started. I knew what I was signing up for at the time I did so, and I\u2019ve managed to maintain a 4.0 while doing so. That\u2019s my reward for diligently disciplining myself to do what needs done by being chained to my laptop. Something can hardly be unfair when one was in agreement to making the required commitments before beginning. If a social life and large amounts of free time are more important than earning your degree cut back to part time status or get out of the kitchen entirely if you can\u2019t handle the heat, the classes won\u2019t get easier as you progress. You have to adapt and overcome the challenges to earn your degree it won\u2019t be just handed to you.",

Here\u2019s my take:\n\nA lot of work I\u2019ve been given thus far has just been busy work. Do I think it\u2019s reasonable that we\u2019re paying 60k a year and I have to memorize lines from a Shakespeare play that I\u2019m never going to use again? Nah. In fact, I think having a workload that is overbearing busy work makes students resent the actual content. In my opinion, many students get stuck on busy work and don\u2019t actually appreciate or retain what\u2019s being taught.\n\nBut work is necessary. We need to constantly refine our reading and writing skills, math, etc.\n\nI feel that the amount of work varies for everyone though. Some majors just have less homework than others - or at least less rigorous work. Some profs are more lenient. Others don\u2019t have work other than studying (which is up to the student)\n\nIt\u2019s a hard question to answer",

The expected amount of studying is basically the equivalent to working a full-time job about 30 hours a week this is pretty damn normal and they aren\u2019t going to adjust the curriculum for people who are also working or may have other shit going on like if their parents or something. A university education is challenging doesn\u2019t make it easy.It\u2019s a higher level of education than high school so of course you\u2019re going to have more work it\u2019s expected you just need to learn how to study and manage your time you\u2019re an adult in a more challenging post secondary institution your first year is what\u2019s expected for you to learn how to study in the most effective way possible and manage your time properly in addition to getting the best grade you possibly can so everyone has the same workload no matter whether they have additional obligations outside of school work",

          "text": "Its perfectly fine and reasonable if you are fresh out of high school and have no job and no life outside of college. For some people, the amount of coursework is overwhelming because there isn't \"more than enough time to master it.\" Especially when you are taking more than one class. I understand the work isn't meant to hinder your success but when they say in the syllabus that college is a full time job, how do they expect you to have time to actually work your full time job that you have to have in order to pay for the college, and come home and study, and make time for sleeping and eating and just taking a mental break. It's very difficult. And in my opinion they don't expect you to be doing anything besides studying every single day all day. And its just not possible.",
