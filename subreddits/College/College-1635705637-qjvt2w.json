I\u2019m always doing assignments or studying, I can\u2019t imagine more classes on top of this. I see people irl and on here who take 5-6 classes (ex: chem/bio/physics with labs + english + language course) who have A\u2019s in everything. I just\u2026 how?",

Putting effort into work and assignments takes tons of time and can feel extremely exhausting.  I don\u2019t think you are exceptionally slow or anyone else is exceptionally quick, you just take a lot of pride in your work and thus expend a lot of energy in making sure you get good grades.  Hope this helps",
