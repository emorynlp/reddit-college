I have anxiety/panic disorder so participating in class can be really stressful bc if i said something off or wrong I would think about it the rest of the day but try to remember thats just our heads playing with us and the majority of people in class aren\u2019t paying that close of attention anyway.",

Avoid \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions but hit the points you assume others might have. Make friends in each class and develop a circle you can communicate the lessons taught. Practice forming the questions in a way that is natural for you and then go back and reiterate for perfection. Practice makes perfect brother, you are at college. You\u2019re a scholar now, never stop asking questions!",

Imagine one of your fellow students misunderstood the question but answered anyway or stuttered over their words. You wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re an idiot or a loser, you\u2019d be empathetic of how nervous or anxious they are. That\u2019s how everyone else will feel toward you. Speaking up also has some definite benefits. Regardless of whether or not your question/answer is smart or good, it\u2019ll make you look confident to your fellow students and your professor will like you more for participating. I also struggle with speaking up a lot of the time, but when I muster up the courage, this is what I told myself.",
