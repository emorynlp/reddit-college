  "text": "I am a pre-med needing to find an easier major than Biology. I am pretty interested in psychology or sociology but don't know which one to pick. \n\nI need some insight into the differences between the two, and the type of work id need to do. Not necessarily rather it's easier than the other because that's very subjective. But just some advice on the type of material ill be studying and how the assignments are (lots of essays, or hard tests).",

      "text": "I\u2019d recommend looking through the course catalog at your specific school. Which department\u2019s classes seem the best to you?  I believe sociology has more essays with very few tests. But I\u2019m not sure as I\u2019m not in either of the fields.\n\nWith pre-med if you are getting burnt out with bio, I think that you should maybe reconsider and have a serious reflection on what you want to do and if pre-med is still the best path for you. I\u2019d recommend having a blunt talk with the pre-med advisor. Med school is far closer to bio than it is to psych or sociology. You also need to look at what courses med schools require you to take for admission and make sure you get those taken care of.",
