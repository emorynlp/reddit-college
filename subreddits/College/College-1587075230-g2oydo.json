Any place that offers you a \"guaranteed\" internship in exchange for cash is a SCAM. If a company wants you to pay \"onboarding fees\" or wants you to \"invest\" in their products that you are supposed to sell, run away! A legitimate company will provide you with any materials necessary to do the job. Unfortunately, many of us are increasingly desperate for opportunities and lots of scumbags (especially MLMs) are going to try to take advantage of us. If you have no other career-relevant plans for the summer, you are much better off taking summer classes, reaching out to local businesses and offering your services as a remote intern, doing an independent research project, or building a portfolio. Don't get scammed.\n\nedit: I should clarify that this does not necessarily apply to travel/living costs, although personally I would raise my eyebrow at an employer that requires relocation and/or travel without offering any kind of assistance. However, I know that's common in some fields and could very well be legit, but I doubt that anyone is being asked to relocate in the midst of a pandemic anyway. You may also have to pay tuition if you are receiving academic credit for an internship.
