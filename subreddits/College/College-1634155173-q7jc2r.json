  "text": "I have a desktop gaming PC that I brought to college and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s safe to leave it in the dorm over the break. I\u2019m taking a plane to see family and won\u2019t be able to take it with me. Is it safe to leave in the dorm (security and temperature) wise? Or should I get a small climate controlled storage space?\nThe dorm is in the northern US and it gets below freezing constantly in the winter.",
