Taking advice from people who\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD", "text": "Hey everyone, this would be my first official semester on meds (20mg Adderall x 2 daily). I\u2019m currently on academic probation with a 1.8 GPA and I\u2019m looking for advice from those who have ADHD. This is my 3rd year (5th semester) so far it\u2019s going good but I feel extremely prone to forgetting an assignment/feeling unmotivated to study, I\u2019m going to graduate late and that\u2019s not the end of the world but I still am worried. Any tips? Majoring in CSCI. This semester I\u2019m\ngoing to finish my common core classes, tbh I just have a lot of anxiety. How does FAFSA work while you\u2019re on academic probation btw? A bit confused on that.", "author": "LoserAnimeNerds", "created": 1632421795, "retrieved": 1632800753, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"he0gudf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu1iz7/severe_adhd_and_college_taking_advice_from_people/he0gudf/", "text": "I take concerta, so I'm not sure how helpful this will be.\n\nStudy/work at the library or another location away from home. It will help you be in a work mental state. \n\nSet up a calendar system with reminders on your phone for due dates. Make sure you are alerted when there is an upcoming assignment at a time where you can still reasonably get it done. \n\nOrganize your schedule and stick to it. Wake up at the same time, go to sleep at the same time. It's hard, but it helps. \n\nTry to visit your professor during office hours to ask questions about the material. Also, tell them that you have ADHD and that any reminder they can give on coursework is helpful.", "author": "Toxitoxi", "created": 1632431938, "upvotes": 3}}}
