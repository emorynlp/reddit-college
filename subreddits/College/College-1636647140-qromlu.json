  "text": "We just spent two years living with recorded lectures on zoom. If you didn't understand something, you could go back and watch it again to see what the professor said. I don't understand why this stopped with in-person lectures. All it does is hurt student performance. Especially when they expect us to stay home for 2 weeks if we get infected, but then don't provide lecture recordings. Makes no sense. I missed a few lectures and now I'm struggling to get by with the written notes online, but I'm so confused.",

While I would agree that recorded lectures are certainly a convenient option for people if they have to miss, it is a bit more complicated to do and not every professor does want their personal lecture material (that they may have spend years fine tuning) to be posted online for anyone to see/copy. \n\nI will say that even now that we've come back in person at my university, the vast majority of the classrooms have no recording capabilities. This means that instructors (who may only be making $3,000 a semester per class) would have to set up cameras and mics and then edit and upload everything buy themselves, even if the institution did provide the equipment.\n\nEven if they did all that, recordings of the discussion heavy sections would be useless (as noone would be able to understand the audio). Also, from teaching on zoom I know I have had many students who do not want to have their faces, bodies, and or voices recorded. \n\nAll in all, recorded lectures are helpful for people who have to miss, but they are a lot more work and come with a lot more baggage than students often realize. I find it a lot more helpful for my students to just post slides and group notes (taken by all students on a common google doc) after each class.",

Having to teach a course hybridly almost doubles the teacher's workload, as they now have to manage students in the physical space and digital. What happens when you want to have a full class discussion or get in groups? What do you do if only one student shows up in person vs online? \n\nI think providing more resources for instructors to record lectures would be helpful and also providing more fully online vs fully in person classes would help students as well. But expecting professors to teach a hybrid course with no additional resources (e.g. money, tech support, instructor support, etc) is just not feasible without drastically reducing quality.",

The majority of students genuinely want to go to classes in person, the hybrid is for the few people who can't make it. They just go on the zoom so that they don't miss the class material or fall behind.\n\nAll you need is a projector/TV screens and a stand with a laptop for the professor to lecture at to both audiences. The professor records themself speaking at the laptop, and can screenshare the paper or ipad that they are writing on. It's not double workload since both audiences are seeing the same thing, and the professor uploads the video.

Some have an actual camera, others just record what goes through the projector. Sound has been done in the past using a wireless lav mic, but recently they switched most rooms to a room-mic system. Recordings are made automatically at the lecture time using Panopto, and are only viewable by signing into your campus account. Technically they could be downloaded using inspect element and redistributed, but that is not made obvious to the students.\n\nThe teacher can opt in or out of the recording for their class. Most teachers in my experience allow the recordings, though some do not. I've always thought this was to boost in-person attendance, but could be due to other reasons, such as the lecture hall they were assigned not supporting the recording system.",

So personally I think we should encourage it to be recorded for lectures but at the same time I still think it would also be beneficial to just have it be at the professor's discretion some classes it's a lot easier to at least learn the material not listening to a recorded lecture courted lecture but actually being in the room and like participating in discussion. So I can understand why some professors don't want to record lectures but recorded lectures are convenient for certain things left like I think there should always be an option to attend a class virtually rather than in person if for whatever reason you have something going on where you can't be in class in in person but at the same time recorded lectures sometimes might also give people the impression they can't go to their actual class which could cause problems as well",

I'll personally be continuing to produce edited content, to schedule remote office hours, record/share raw lecture content and/or to have a streamed livefeed of IRL class sessions so that some students can attend virtually, while others attend in the traditional face to face manner. \n\nI think a hybrid approach really ought to become the norm for accessibility, flexibility, and it encourages -- I think -- new ways of engaging with students. Not everyone will agree, but it's something that I, as a relatively young faculty member (I'm 35), really want to see further developed.",
