  "text": "We just spent two years living with recorded lectures on zoom. If you didn't understand something, you could go back and watch it again to see what the professor said. I don't understand why this stopped with in-person lectures. All it does is hurt student performance. Especially when they expect us to stay home for 2 weeks if we get infected, but then don't provide lecture recordings. Makes no sense. I missed a few lectures and now I'm struggling to get by with the written notes online, but I'm so confused.",
