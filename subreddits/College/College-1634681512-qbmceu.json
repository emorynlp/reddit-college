  "text": "one of my professors moved our midterm up by two weeks (from nov 15th to the 3rd) out of the blue, I went from having a whole month to study to just a couple of weeks, I've literally never had an exam changed like this and now I'm having an internal panic attack because I barely passed the first one and am in no way ready to start preparing for a second one already (I just finished one paper and was planning on starting a second one, but now I have half the time to do it)",
