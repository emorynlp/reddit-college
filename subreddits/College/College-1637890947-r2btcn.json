  "title:": "Residence for Only Second Term",
  "text": "I currently live about a 10 minutes drive away from campus and decided not to live on residence for 1st term because I only have 1 in-person class.  However, next term the University is going 100% in-person and I actually applied to residence and got a placement for Jan - Apr.  The reason for which I did this is because I feel like residence is a super important thing for first year, and I don't know if moving in to res is worth it for the amount of money that it costs. Anyway, just wondering if anyone who has lived on residence thinks that this is actually a good idea even if I live pretty close to campus.",

      "text": "After a semester living at home, I am sure you're itching to meet more people and be out of the house. I definitely think it's good to live on campus, even if it's just for one semester. You're more likely to meet people and be more involved on campus since you'll live there. Also, even if it does not live up to the hype, you can at least say you tried it and won't have as much FOMO on the \"college experience\"\n\nI'm in the same boat--My mom lives 15 minutes away from my college campus, and I've done both on-campus living and commuting from home. Personal preference, but if it's financially feasible, I'd easily pick living on campus over living at home because it's much easier to hang out with my friends on campus.",
