Everyone seems to be in a clique but I am one of those who is \"affiliated\" with a lot but not in a clique or close to anyone. I hangout with them by chance when I see them and it's not usually planned. We don't text/call often.

If you want a \"clique\", do this with several friends, and then ask them to go do something fun together. If they all vibe with each other, rinse and repeat.\n\nIt's completely normal to not have a close-knit friend group. But if that's something you want, some of the effort's gonna have to come from you.", "author": "protistgang", "created": 1632194461, "upvotes": 2}, "hdneky1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps5f8f/is_it_normal_not_to_be_really_close_or_in_a/hdneky1/", "text": "I'd say keep at it...3 weeks isn't that far in and each semester is a soft reset sometimes.
