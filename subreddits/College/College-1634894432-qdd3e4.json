  "title:": "I like to game late into the night. I try to be considerate to my roommate who sleeps earlier but apparently I'm still too loud. What do I do?",
  "text": "For context, I mostly play league of legends (which requires me to click my mouse a lot), and I'll typically play until around 3am or whenever I get tired. When my roommate turns the lights off around 12-1 am, I take that as my queue to start being more quiet, so I don't get up as much, try not to move things around, and I wont talk on the mic. I've asked him before if I was still making too much noise and he said I was fine, but now I'm thinking he just didn't want to confront me because tonight he asked me to keep it down, and the only way I could reduce my noise to an acceptable level is by not playing at all. This really bothers me though because it's the only time I have for myself where I can decompress and I don't want to give it up. I would even consider going to bed and waking up early, but he doesn't wake up until 11-12 am most days, so the problem remains. Any advice for this situation?  \n\n\nTLDR; my gaming is too loud for my roommate despite the accommodations I've made but I dont want to give it up",

I play Dota a lot, and if I were in this situation, I\u2019d probably reserve a study room in the library and take my laptop and mouse there to play for a few hours. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if my roommate expected me to fall asleep to him clicking away at light speed.",

It's pretty unreasonable to stay up until 3 am when you share a bedroom with another person and your behavior is impacting their sleep. \n\nIf you want to be a good roommate, I would find an earlier time to play, or do as you suggested and wake up earlier to game. It's much more reasonable to make some noise in your shared room at 9 am than 3 am, and your roommate will likely be able to sleep through the noise at that time.",
