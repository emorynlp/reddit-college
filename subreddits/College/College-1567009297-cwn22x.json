That is completely contrary to active learning research and the pedagogical models that dominate at many US schools, including mine. There is not a single course in my department that has less than 20% of the semester grade based on participation, and literally every course uses discussion as a major component.  Lecturing is a terribly inefficient way to convey information and using class time for information delivery is about the lowest-value way to use the period-- if there is no reading available to cover the material the instructor would be much better off recording a video lecture for students to watch on their own time. The class period should be used for active learning and higher-order thinking, which can/does include discussion.\n\nWhat's clear from the posts here is that the great majority of posters are students at large schools and/or schools that don't really invest in teaching. In classes of 500 it's hard to have a good discussion (but I've seen it done). In classes of 15-20 it's entirely appropriate to expect everyone to participate regularly, and indeed to create an environment when even reluctant students will be willing to take the risk of speaking up-- in part because speaking before groups is a basic skill that college graduates are expected to have, and there aren't many careers where you can just work quietly by yourself somewhere. I wonder what all these \"I won't speak in class ever\"  imagine doing for a career, and how much learning they miss out on by refusing to participate fully in their courses.

Normally they\u2019re freshman, but at my school (relatively small state university) I\u2019ve only had 2 classes with people like that. One professor shut it down pretty quick, while the other was too nice to say anything. If the latter is the case I generally don\u2019t answer questions. \n\nIf you\u2019re not the person I mentioned above, don\u2019t worry about it. Most people probably actually view you as the person saving them from the professor asking them. Sometimes, it takes a little nudge from you to get people to be comfortable. From personal experience, I\u2019ve answered questions wrong on purpose, so the professor can elaborate on a topic, and more people see it\u2019s okay to be wrong. Other times I just tell someone next to me the right answer. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s only week 2 at my school, so people are still getting their bearings, professors are starting to get a feel for the class, and homework is actually starting to pop up.
