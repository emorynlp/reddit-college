He will make sly comments like \"this stuffs easy, you should be fine\", \"we learned this last course, you shouldn't be confused\". My favorite being, \"even a 10 year old could do this\"\n\nHis teaching method is so bad imo, doesn't take time to really explain concepts and goes way too fast. When classmates ask for reclarificafion, professor will dodge by saying this stuffs the basics, should already know it. \n\nJust so frustrated and we're having our first exam in 5 days. Idk if can continue the entire semester, really don't wanna drop this class as he's the only finance teacher and it's a required course. Please give me survival tips..", "author": "threefold_law", "created": 1632345456, "retrieved": 1632800841, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hdwmi1s": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptgicu/how_do_you_deal_with_pretentious_professors/hdwmi1s/", "text": "How did you do in the prerequisite course(s)? The comment about \u201ceven a 10 year old could do this\u201d is a bit unprofessional, but the other things sound like he\u2019s assuming the class has a baseline knowledge before coming in. He may not have time to go over the basics again, nor should he be expected to if they were supposed to be learned prior to entering the course. However, if these are brand new concepts whose foundations were never before covered, then that would be a potential problem.\n\nThe best thing you could do if you are missing some of the foundational knowledge is to seek outside help (tutoring, practice with more basic finance concepts, etc).", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1632356908, "upvotes": 5}}}
