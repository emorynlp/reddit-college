  "text": "Should I go to school?\n\nHi, I\u2019m 19 years old, I feel that my whole life I\u2019ve had an aptitude for math, so much so that I gave up on it during school because school came so easy. After about 10th grade of high school I stopped caring about school completely and found the way everything was taught very boxed. Anyway, let\u2019s just say I was one of those bare minimum doers in school leading me to have poor grades.\n\nRecently I had a mushroom trip that opened these chasms of memories of me and my father, a very mathematical man, doing math with me when I was younger. Because of my bad kid high school years our relationship deteriorated into constant bickering and I forgot about math completely. This trip led me to begin studying mathematics again. I spend about 95% of my free time  learning some form of math or another. I really fell in love with math and physics and I want to study it. I\u2019ve always been anti-school and institutions, but I\u2019ve come to understand the importance of having a degree. My math level is probably at an 11-12 grade, but I\u2019m learning constantly. I want to go to school but I\u2019m not sure my grades are good enough, I would like to go to Berkeley, because I get lots of government help for school (my dads a \u201cdisabled\u201d vet) should I go to school, maybe community college first, then transfer? Maybe even Europe? Or study on my own?",

      "text": "If your grades are poor, Berkely or an equivalent is not going to be an option right out of the gate. But that's okay. I would recommend going to a community college for a year or two. You can pull your grades up and then apply as a transfer student to a four-year university. This might help you land scholarships, as well. \n\nMake sure you spend some time trying to figure out what behavioral patterns led to your doing poorly in high school - sounds like you've already given it some thought. Make sure, too, that you don't repeat those patterns in college. It sounds like you've got a real aptitude and passion, so you should definitely give school a shot. good luck!",

      "text": "I'm a lot like you in the sense I was very apprehensive about starting college due to my poor grades in grade school and what not.\n\nI started at a CC and I don't regret it at all, if you've found something you really plan to pursue then do it, there's nothing stopping you. I'd highly advise the community college route if your grades aren't great as that gives you plenty of time to adjust and make better grades so you can transfer.",

      "text": "It doesn't matter if you have an aptitude for math, just that you enjoy doing it. With time, mathematical skill will come.\n\nNow about Berkley.... brand name schools are an illusion. There are thousands of schools that give a similarly high quality education. Going to name-brand schools is like whip cream on a sundae. It's nice to have if you can get it, but not necessary.\n\nInstead I would focus on deciding what areas of life I would apply your mathematical ability once you finish your educational journey. Good luck!",

I\u2019m not going to deter you away from this route but I realllly really wish I could have done it different. Berkeley has the name and prestige but it\u2019s not perfect. And it\u2019s a turbulent ride",
