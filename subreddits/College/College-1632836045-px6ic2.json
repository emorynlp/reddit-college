  "text": "I\u2019m looking for a good college in London where I can study pop/rock music, songwriting, performance, production, everything like that. I got accepted at BIMM and ICMP but I feel so unsure about the quality of the school. I\u2019ve seen great reviews, but also terrible reviews that scare me. I feel like London is the best place for me to be (I\u2019m 100% sure actually) but I just really need a good place where I can seriously study, stay busy and improve.",
