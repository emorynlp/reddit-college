  "title:": "I (19F) want to start investing. I know a little bit, but very much an amateur and would love advice from fellow college investors",
  "text": "The title is pretty much says it all, but to expand, I really want to get a head start on this. They say start when you're young and I figured maybe it's time. \n\nMy parents have no experience and no investments of their own and they will be retiring in 15 years or so. They are worried about how they will afford it or if they will even be able to. I struggled a lot financially growing up and have been low class nearly my entire life. I want to break that cycle. \n\nI have 2k in savings at the moment which I managed to save in just one year. This is the most money I've EVER had. I worked really hard for it and I'm looking to maybe investing some of it. But I have no clue where to really begin or if right now is a good time to get into the market. Any advice from any who is investing would be very appreciated!\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the great advice everyone! I definitely think I'll hold on till I get more money saved up and during that time I will continue to educate myself so when I do start I'll have more knowledge.",

It's not an either-or. Pick a comfortable amount to invest that doesn't strain you and doesn't conflict with other saving behaviors, and put that in your Vanguard account every month. Is that $10? $50? $300? Doesn't matter. When investing, you're in for the long haul, and the idea is to accrue relatively small amounts over a long time, which will snowball. You'll learn a lot, and the risk is relatively small (with ETFs, the odds are you might lose some money in the short term, but over at least a few years, you'll  probably*at worst* break even, and probably earn), so why not?\n\nKeep about a month's worth of expenses in your checking, build up six months of expenses in a savings account (alternative: keep 3 months in a savings account, keep another 3 months in CDs). Prioritize that, sure, but that doesn't mean you can't do that monthly $50 to Vanguard. Once you get that savings account built up, then you can start pushing $150, $300 a month to Vanguard, or whatever.",

You can build your own portfolio and buy fractional shares. It's passive investing and you can deposit as little as $100 to start. I invest $50-100 a week and just invest and forget. It's more of a long term thing and you don't need to check it daily. It's almost guaranteed a return and is very similar to a high yield savings account if you pick the right funds/stocks. About 80% of my portfolio is VTI, and I would suggest the same for you. As long as you put some money toward an ETF like VTI, VOO, SPY or QQQ you should be good.",

With your first $6000 in disposable income, you should max out your Roth IRA and invest in normal S&P500 indices. You won\u2019t touch this month until you\u2019re 60.\n\nThis is like a safety net, and this will help you retire earlier (for example, you could retire off other investments at 40 while knowing that this money comes into play when you\u2019re 60).\n\nOnce you do that, you need to look into other tax advantaged accounts. If you have qualified education expenses, open a 529 account for yourself and put the money in there ahead of time. This will let you pay tuition with pre-tax money instead of lost-tax money.\n\nSince you\u2019re probably on your parents\u2019 health plan, you can start investing at this point. Open a Robinhood account (easiest user interface) and invest remaining disposable income. You\u2019ll learn investing lessons over time.",

Get in when you are ready financially. \n\nStart off with ETFs/index funds/blue chip dividend stocks (google popular ones) so you start off safe, do not invest in everything you come across, find a handful and stick with them for now, then continue to watch YouTube videos to learn strategies.

Basically a higher interest bank account.\nWhen you come into more income you might like to invest in companies you like. But please research each and know what you are buying.

If you only want a short-term investment, or want to be able to access that money if the need arises, I would stick to a savings with a decent rate. You can find some online with a 1-2% return.

Do you pay any bills where you might need an emergency fund to cover said bills In case you lose your job? First priority is definitely paying for your college. Try to pay for all of your school in cash, don\u2019t take out loans and have money laying around in investments. Currently I am piling money up to make sure I have my college paid for, even though I have a scholarship to pay 75% of tuition for 5 years. Money I get extra from grants I put into a high yield savings account, NOT IN INVESTMENTS. If you put school money into investments you risk having less for when you need it. Make sure you INVEST IN YOURSELF, as in a degree/knowledge that will make you note money than an investment that would get you 10% on your money. Would you rather get a degree to make you possibly $60k+ in a few years or invest a few thousand that would grow 10%? After you graduate if you have any money left over from saving you should invest it depending on your outlook of what you\u2019ll be doing in the next few years. Personally I invest long term with money I don\u2019t need in the short term (only around $600 in S&P 500). However, I also have around $7500 cash saved that will ensure I have college paid for, not to mention the money I can save in the next 3 years throughout college.",

You can only put $6000 a year max into it and the money has to be income that you earned in the current year (thus, it is better to start early and contribute small amounts because you are limited by time in how much you can contribute). An IRA is better than a 401k in that you pay taxes on the contributions, but not withdrawals/interests. So all the interest that you earn in 30-40 years on the money that you put in now, won't be taxed at all.\nI believe you need $3000 to start most Roth IRAs with Vanguard. I would save your money and once you have some excess get one started. I suggest contributing a certain amount off every paycheck you earn, starting now (maybe 10-15% if you can afford it).",

      "text": "Personally, I'd open a Vanguard mutual fund account and put a small fraction of your savings in there to get the ball rolling and keep the rest in a savings account as a rainy day fund, you'll almost certainly need to dip into it at some point. A Vanguard-type account is great because it has low management fees and basically follows the stock market as an aggregate, so relatively safe. As you earn money above your living expenses, transfer some of that to your Vanguard account on a regular basis while also growing your rainy day fund. \n\nHonestly your best investment right now is in doing well in college. So if that means splurging a bit on a better laptop or other things that will help you succeed, it's well worth it in the long run.  You can make up the difference later on with higher earnings.\n\nOnce you get your first job, that's when things really get moving. You can contribute out of your earnings to a 401k retirement plan, and if you've got a nice chunk saved from college in a mutual fund you can contribute more of your paycheck to your retirement account to springboard things.\n\nFinal note: stay tf away from stock options.",

      "text": "In my opinion, the most important part of investing when your poor, is making living cheaply sustainable. Anyone can technically live cheaply. Check out /r/Frugal. But I think the goal is not to live cheaply, the goal is to make living cheaply a better experience, so that you are less likely to cheat.\n\nI call this the black bean principle, although it has other names. \n\nSay I'm making black bean stew. There are basically three ingredients in black bean stew: stock, pork, and black beans. It is one of the cheaper ways to consume calories, and whenever I eat it, I save myself a couple of dollars over what I would have eaten otherwise. The problem is, if I use the cheapest possible ingredients, I won't want to eat black bean stew very often. The less I enjoy my own cooking, the more encouraged I am to go out.\n\nMost people don't factor their impulsive expenses into their budget, or consider the causes of that impulsiveness. My solution? Buy better black beans. Spending extra money on black beans saves me money. Spending twice as much on black beans doesn't get me black beans that are twice as good, but they are enough better, that I am more likely to want black bean stew, and they are still cheap. If I, in 20 pounds of better black beans, can convince myself to replace one meal out with better black bean stew, then I have saved myself money. \n\nIn short, if there's something you like doing that's cheap, consider spending some money on improving that thing for yourself. The most expensive thing you can be is unsatisfied.",

      "text": "You've gotten great advice.  You sound like you're still pretty much living paycheck to paycheck, you're going to need your savings in case of unexpected expenses until you're in a stable spot financially.  When you have a full time job, 6 months of expenses saved up in case of an emergency, and you still have extra money burning a hole in your pocket?  That's when you want to live below your means and invest.\n\nThe other piece of advice I want to give is that when you get a full time job, your company may offer a 401k match.  Maybe 4% or something like that.  This means that if you put 4% of your salary into a retirement account, your company will put an extra 4% in there.  That's free money, so you should pretty much always contribute to your retirement fund up to the match amount, even if you have other debts, or are still building an emergency fund.\n\nNever invest more than you can afford to lose, you shouldn't expect to pull money out until you retire.  Stick to index funds if you are a new investor, historically they have generated consistent returns.  You don't need to buy any specific stocks, that comes with additional risk.  Definitely do not touch options, that's just gambling with extra steps.\n\n/u/VA_Network_Nerd gave you a good summary for steps to take once you graduate",

With you being so young, this could mean anything from financial aid not coming in on time, dental, medical, etc.\n\n2.)  If you were to need a new car or anything else that would normally require a loan to purchase, paying, \"in cash\" is a far better option to save the interest.\n\n3.) With you being in college, there may be a time when your aid won't cover something.  I remember my last semester was only partially covered along with about 1/4 of my university.

I invest $75 per month in the mutual fund for 2060 retirees (since that\u2019s as far as it goes). Basically it\u2019s a fund that divides up your money into different bonds/domestic stocks/foreign stocks and does all the work for you. 25% goes into the S&P 500 which is essentially all the top companies in the stock market. This stuff can be hard to understand so I recommend finding an adult who would know about this to talk to or a Fidelity advisor if you go with Fidelity.",

There are 2 things I need to point out off the bat and one thing I noticed after taking a closer look at the ticker. \n\n\n1. There is no such thing as a fidelity \u201cadvisor\u201d.  They\u2019re salesmen.  Plain and simple. It\u2019s in the interest of these institutions to have a nice spread of shitty redundant funds so that they can keep your fees in house and make it look like they\u2019re giving you some semblance of personalized advice. \n\n2. Putting 10% of your portfolio in bonds with a 40 year time horizon is atrocious. Scaling that up over time, as these funds do, is just foolish. Look at the performance of stock indexes vs bonds in a historical context and you\u2019ll see what I mean. By the time you\u2019re at a point in your life where going long bonds might even be a reasonable option, your position in life is going to be vastly different (think 50s). The only reason to hold bonds long, imho, is if you\u2019re so fucking loaded you can live off the yield (but you somehow made all your money without figuring out how markets work) or if you\u2019re basically using high liquid bond etfs as cash equivalents. Ex: I hold my \u201ccash\u201d in vgsh or vmmxx (not a bond fund). \n\n3. While it\u2019s perfectly fine to diversify internationally, this is not the way to do it.  Fsgex, the international fund that is now in your portfolio (remember those shitty funds that no one wants?) is heavily weighted toward Europe (40%), which is heavily correlated to the US and has way shittier growth potential than domestic markets (it\u2019ll drag on your portfolio in exchange for zero risk mitigation).  \n\n\nComparison of your fund to a benchmark and a few other funds since the time of FDKLX\u2019s inception: https://imgur.com/a/XmIvi2W\n\n(Spy is in pink and VT is in purple)\n\n\nPeek at how Europe has done over the past 5 growth years, until today: https://imgur.com/a/OQNB672\n\nEdit: a word",

          "text": "While over investing is a risk, and I agree completely with the 3 suggestions you gave, the predominant risk is under investing. Most people don't invest, or don't invest what they should. If a young person can put aside a fixed amount for emergencies, and an equal amount for investing, they would be in a good position. \n\nYes, have at least 3 months of emergency savings. More if one can. Reduce any credit card or loan interest. But investing is a habit that must be cultivated.  \n\nInitially, invest in broad based mutual funds regularly in a way that you never see the money from your paycheck. As you learn more, then look into other types of investments. \n\nBut most important is to learn the habit of investing. (And the habit of living at or below one's means)",
