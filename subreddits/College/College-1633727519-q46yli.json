  "text": "I\u2019ve used proctorio before and usually my camera lights up, it asks me to scan the room, and once the test starts i can see myself. this time none of that happened so i\u2019m assuming my professor didn\u2019t turn on the camera feature and only recorded the screen? but i just want to be sure bc i have a fear that it recorded me without me knowing which is illegal but still. i need some validation lol",
