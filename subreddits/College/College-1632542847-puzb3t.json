If it\u2019s a sit in bed all day and stare at the ceiling day do that. The best rule of thumb id say is maybe every week or two? weekends are generally a good time, specifically Saturday because everyone is saving homework for Sunday so you can get pretty much anyone you want to go hang out with you. Just don\u2019t hang out everyday or you\u2019ll be sick of them and don\u2019t hang out once in a blue moon or they\u2019ll get new friends and vanish. I try to at least ask them to eat at the dining hall once a week, it\u2019s nice to catch up after a week or two because everyone has so much to talk about.", "author": "Kenkxb", "created": 1632547542, "upvotes": 1}}}
