You are absolutely not being lazy by taking less hours. If anything, you're being more productive by keeping yourself mentally healthy in the long run, as being in school is a job in itself so it's not like you're dropping hours to do nothing. Also you can always pick up extra shifts if you ever have time so in my opinion, I'd say keep doing the 10-12 hours, maybe throw in a couple extra hours every once in a while if you feel up to it.
