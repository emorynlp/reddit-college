I had an extremely hard time keeping on top of due dates up until I got an actual (like paper) planner where I could cross things off. Every week I would sit down and plan out how much I would do each day and make sure to give myself at least one day off. I'd break it down into sections. If I was taking five classes I would try to do the first class's work on Monday, the second class's work on Tuesday, etc if the load wasn't too much. If I was too drained before I finished it, I'd just add the remaining to the following day.

Take care of your basic needs. It\u2019s hard to learn if you are dealing with something physical, mental, psychological and/or spiritual. Drink lots of water, and try and eat healthy foods regularly (although diet is heavily impacted by class and income and this might not always be an option.) 2. Go to class, watch your videos, and do the readings. Nothing will ever replace a first impression, so if your classes are in a video or PowerPoint format, try to have a notebook or something to write notes down in while the material is going. There is lots of research that shows writing things down can help people better absorb material compared to typing. 3. Keep a planner and a journal. Planners, or planner apps, are meant to keep you on track and help map out weekly and daily responsibilities as well as academic, scholarship related, and personal deadlines. Journaling can also be very helpful in being motivated. 4. Go over your material (notes, readings, presentations, lectures, etc.) as frequently as you can. Flashcards are great because repetition is key in committing material to memory.", "author": "eporitamakesart", "created": 1594685390, "upvotes": 8}, "fxzgdaw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hqgfdt/can_we_get_a_megathread_for_advice_on_online/fxzgdaw/", "text": "Motivation: You want to graduate, and odds are you're taking loans for the class or someone is paying good money for you to take the class.\n\nWhat other motivation do you need?

I wake up at 8:30 and I start working on hw by 9:30 at the earliest and 10 at the latest. I plan about an hour to an hour and a half per class and take anywhere between a 30-60 min break in-between based on how many classes I'm taking. I would finish my work by 4 at the latest and the only time I worked after that was if I felt like it. Having a specific start and end time made it easier for me to stay on track and motivated.
