  "text": " \n\nI know this might seem like FAQ. But I am can't really get over the fact that it seems like only young people get good internships during or after college.  \nI'll be 27 when I graduate engineering here in Europe and am feeling a bit terrified that the market will put me at a disadvantage when trying to find good internships. I've finished my first year as probably one of the best in class. The only people who were better than were people whose way of spending their free time is reviewing their math homework for the 5th time.  \nSo Engineers of the world will I have issues finding some good starting positions as a 27-year-old or the idea of a young intern is just a myth?  \nThank you in advance!!!  \nEdit: I am currently studying EE :)",

      "text": "Hey man, please don't worry. I was just like you, with the same issues and same worries. But I have graduated and I'm doing very very well. You'll be fine man. Your age experience will only serve to help you. \n\nDon't let the fear stop you from applying. That will guarantee a failure. Just keep applying because it's a numbers game. During the interview talk about your skills and show you are interested and easy to make friends with, and enthusiastic about the job. \n\nI don't spend your time worrying about this, it's not worth it. Keep doing your best and be well mannered, everything else will fall in place",
