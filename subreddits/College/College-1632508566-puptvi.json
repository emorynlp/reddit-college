I believe I\u2019m entering a depressive episode. This one is worse than the usual ones and I\u2019m kind of watching it happen to me as much as I\u2019m getting help and mitigating it.  Hospitalization is like a big \u201cdon\u2019t kill yourself\u201d holding cell and while I don\u2019t currently plan to die, I feel like if the episode bottoms out where I suspect it will that won\u2019t exactly be true anymore.\n\nThe last time I was hospitalized it was not my choice and I found it to be more stressful than it had to be. If I put myself in this time, I can pack my own bag and wear my own clothes, and bring things for me to do. I can pick where I go instead of being carted to wherever is open. I also would like to be able to put something in place with the school, so I don\u2019t miss 2 weeks of work and come back failing and a total shitshow.\n\nIf anyone has experience with this I\u2019d appreciate it.

However, I\u2019m fairly certain they can\u2019t penalize you for being hospitalized, at least not in any actual formal way (like grades-wise or disciplinary wise). \n\nThere are probably protocols in place for extended excused abscenses that you have to go looking for.\n\nFrom my own experience, when I was hospitalized a few times in high school (not college but similar laws and rules apply), the teachers sent me work and such to do in the hospital. You might want to talk to your professors about giving you some assignments in advance to work on in the hospital, and so they aren\u2019t surprised by your absences. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know what hospital you will be at of course, but try to print out as much as you can because hospitals often have no/limited access to computers/the internet. Make sure all your work is \u201chospital safe\u201d (no paper clips, staples, binder clips, metal pieces, etc.) so you don\u2019t lose access to anything because of that.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m gonna add general tips too for getting ready because I have a lot of experience:\n\n- make sure your clothes are hospital safe (no strings, metal zippers, shoelaces, etc.). Find some sweatshirts/sweatpants without strings so you don\u2019t have to pull strings out of ones you like. Bring shoes without shoelaces so you don\u2019t have to re-lace your shoes when you get out. \n\n- the word puzzle things you get at the airport/the train station/the magazine section of the grocery store  with crosswords and word searches and sudokos and such are a pretty good time killer. \n\n- when picking the hospital, try to find out their policies on: phone calls (who you can call, when tou can call, if you have to be a certain level,etc), access to computers/electronics (for schoolwork), wearing your own clothes (some hospitals make you wear scrubs until you reach a certain level and such), and what non-obvious  items are prohibited (sometimes they don\u2019t let you bring your own blanket, or stuffed animal, or hard cover books, etc.). That\u2019s important information for picking the place and getting ready to go.\n\n- if the hospital you go to let\u2019s you call anyone, write down your friends phone numbers on a piece of paper and let them know you\u2019re going to the hospital and ask if they\u2019re okay with you calling them from there. It can be really nice to hear your friends voice after being surrounded by so many unknowns/uncertains\n\n- bring stuff to do!! Card games, notebooks, the puzzle books I mentioned earlier, reading books for fun, etc. Most hospitals don\u2019t let you have normal pens/pencils (they give you \u201csafety pens\u201d that you can\u2019t stab yourself with), so if they don\u2019t allow that don\u2019t bring coloring books unless you also bring crayons/they have crayons (and sometimes washable markers but that depends). Also, avoid books about mental health topics, because some hospitals only allow \u201cappropriate\u201d books.\n\n- bring things that make you feel safe/more at home. Your favorite blanket/stuffed animal (if allowed), pictures, letters from people you care about, fuzzy socks, etc. Don\u2019t worry about people judging you because it\u2019s the psych ward and everyone\u2019s in a similar position. \n\n- if they let you, bring as many of your own hygiene items as possible. Areosol cans are usually prohibited, but bring deodorant, toothbrush/toothpaste, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, etc. The ones the hospital provides are almost always crappy.\n\n- find out if you can bring your own food and store it there. Often, hospital food is unpleasant so it helps to have your favorite snacks available too. \n\n- during intake, don\u2019t lie to them, especially about drugs if you do them. If you smoke, hospitals often have nicotine patches or gum to help with the addiction. In general, they can\u2019t help you with something if they don\u2019t know you need help with it.\n\nTips for when you\u2019re there:\n\n- it\u2019s nice and pleasant to make friends, and I encourage that, but don\u2019t let other people get in the way of your treatment. You are there for yourself first and foremost, and need to devote most of your problem solving/helping/etc energy to work on your yourself. \n\n- the hospital is not a cure. There\u2019s a decent chance you will still feel pretty shitty when you\u2019re discharged. This is because the hospital isn\u2019t meant to solve a problem, it\u2019s meant to be a place to allow you to stabilize and begin solving your problems. You need to continue working after you leave, with a therapist and maybe other professionals, on getting your shit together. If you stop trying when you leave, you\u2019re going to find yourself right back where tou started.", "author": "afterforeverends", "created": 1632511724, "upvotes": 13}}}
