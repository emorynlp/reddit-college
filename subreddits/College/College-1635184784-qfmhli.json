  "title:": "Writing an internship interest letter to a current professor. Am I being too informal?",
  "text": "Basically my writing arts professor is a well-known and respected publisher who just launched a student-run publishing press. She announced it on the first day of class and I followed up with her immediately after to express my interest. She recently asked me to send a letter of interest and resume into her, but that I\u2019m pretty much guaranteed the spot. \n\nThis is a totally new field for me as I\u2019ve just dropped Education from my double major and am now only majoring in English. I don\u2019t know much about publishing but I am excited to work with this professor and learn more about it. Would it be appropriate to just express that I\u2019m interested in the internship because of my love of writing, that I\u2019m looking to gain experience in the field, etc. or do I need to give specific examples of what I hope to learn? \n\nThanks all!",
