  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a college student in the U.S., and am considering withdrawing from a couple course at my university due to personal reasons. However, I still want to transfer out to a different school after the end of the fall semester. My question is, will a withdrawal on my transcript hurt my chances of being accepted for transfer? And will multiple withdrawals have the same affect or is that worse for my situation?",
