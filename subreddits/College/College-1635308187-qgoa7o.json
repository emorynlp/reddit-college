  "text": "For my sales management class, we're at the point where we the students have to teach the class a particular section of a chapter in our textbook. We all agreed that we would work on one subsection for the presentation. It's due tomorrow and none of the other students added on this presentation except me. I finished my section of the PowerPoint, and nobody even started their's. It's 11:16 central time at the time I posted this and I got to go to bed and brace myself for the F on a group project.",

I\u2019ve been let down too many times, hate to say it but I don\u2019t trust anyone with my grades anymore. I hope you can talk to your prof and get some leniency if you can show you had an agreed upon plan they didn\u2019t adhere to.",
