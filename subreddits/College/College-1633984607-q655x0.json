  "text": "Hello,\n\nMy math professor from last semester said I could come in anytime to TA for the day when I went in and said hi last week, since i did good in the class.  I sent him an email saying I could come in today since I will be on campus all morning.  He responded by saying there will be exams for the next 3 weeks, so he won't need me.  That's all.  He did not say anything else.  I would be willing to TA after the exams are over, but based on his email, he never said he would want me to TA after the exams are over.  I don't want to be annoying by not\"reading between the lines\" that I am not wanted, however, I would really like to still TA.  I am not sure if that message was him politely saying he does not want me to help, and only said that at the beginning to be polite.  \n\nI am not sure how to respond to the email because I don't want to pester him and make it awkward when he might not even want me in the first place ://",
