  "text": "Okay so I know what you are going to say \u201c it really depends on what you want to do.\u201d But I\u2019m just going to college to get a degree that\u2019s it. I\u2019m not interested in any of the degrees my college offers but want a degree for higher pay. I feel like once I get done I would have wasted my time cause I studied for a degree I\u2019m not going to use. \n\nI want a life for myself but not sure where to go. What are your experiences with college and how has it affected your life?",

Maybe one day I'll find a decent career thru the govt but for now I haven't used my degree once since graduation, except being belittled by former coworkers five years my junior who think they are hot shit and gonna make 100 racks a year after graduating. Newsflash... I know people who graduated with business degrees who still can't find work, same with bio, and numerous other majors.",

But also, no.\n\nLet's take two people: Kyle and Charles (real people, not real names).\n\nThey both started working on Help Desks for different companies around the age of 23 with no college degrees. While working Charles went to school while Kyle did not.\n\nTwo years later Charles and Kyle both start for the same company.  Charles on the security team at much higher pay, because he is going to school and clearly trying to get to that next level. Kyle on Help Desk.\n\n3 years later, Charles leaves that company to work at a Fortune 50 company for twice the pay after finishing his bachelors and starting a masters. Kyle gets promoted to Help Desk Supervisor, at Charles' initial payscale.\n\nIt isn't just having a degree that gets you the job anymore. No company is going to slob your knob hoping to get you to work for them. But you won't need to be the exception to their rule anymore, you're just part of the rule now. For two otherwise equal candidates. You usually take the one with the degree, shows that they can learn and more importantly *stick with something*.",
