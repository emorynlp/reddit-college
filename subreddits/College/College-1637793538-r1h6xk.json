  "text": "So I graduated high school almost a year ago and I first went into physics then robotics and finally now I transferred into fashion design and i\u2019m genuinely the happiest i\u2019ve ever been.The only issue is that I was never \u201cartistic\u201d or creative growing up.I think i\u2019ve always had a creative side but I never put effort into that side of me so it just never showed.My grades were all straight A in high school especially when it comes to scientific subjects.However,those subjects aren\u2019t my thing other than for studying and getting grades.I\u2019m enjoying fashion design but this is my first semester and i\u2019m struggling.\n\n\nNow I\u2019m struggling not because i can\u2019t understand or can\u2019t do the work,but because i need a lot more time and practice to finish anything since it\u2019s my first time sewing and learning and working with my hands.The professors have such high expectations and compare me to other classmates and point out how slow i am..I mean it\u2019s not my fault?Im literally here to learn and take my time with it.\n\n\nIt\u2019s genuinely my first time working with my hands and i\u2019m making alot of mistakes which I believe is normal..right?\n\nI practice a lot  in my free time and I genuinely try my best to perfect whatever i\u2019m doing even if it\u2019s my first time.I just compare myself to others and i end up with zero confidence .\n\nI\u2019ll probably fail this semester honestly but i still learned a lot..What should I do?\n\nI just need time and practice.\n(also i have ADHD and it makes everything 10x more difficult)",
