  "title:": "53% plagiarism on my essay although I did not cheat at all",
  "text": "So I had to write a 7-page research paper for one of my history classes, containing a LOT of citations and sources (the professor said at least 12 sources). Meaning a big part of the essay should be quotes from different journals. I tried to make sure that the citations were made right, as I did not plagiarize at all of the essays. \n\nWhen I turned it in nearly EVERY SINGLE quote on there that I cited counted as plagiarized for some reason. None of my own writing counted as copied only the quotes. \n\nFor example: According to \" and then here is the quote from the journal\". Would be totally counted as plagiarism.\n\nShould I be worried that my essay still says 53 percent plagiarism although the only things copied were the quotes?",

Sometimes they'll tell you if they're strict about how much % of your essay can be quoted.\n\nParaphrasing is a useful skill to learn, where you restate quotes in your own words (this still needs to be cited, as its someone else's idea), - that gives you a lower similarity % while still showing you know the material.

Five percent of adolescence in western countries, including the US, are reporting eating disorders ( Comer & Comer, 2021). Twenty six percent are reporting protracted bouts of depression (RAINN, 2021). Forty percent are pre-diabetic (ADA, 2019). Dr. Ben Bikman says that 85% of Americans could be insulin resistant (2014)! Insulin resistance is the precsursor to diabetes, heart disease, and even Alzheimer's (ADA, 2017). The root of all of these appear to be a direct result of public policy.  \n\n\nSo, this has no direct quotes just statements of fact with proof to back it up. The Bikman thing is a paraphrase.  If you were to paraphrase or cite these facts without backing them up, that would get into ethics territory.",

I can read the articles myself if I want to know what they say. I want to see you USE what you\u2019ve read. A very brief summary of what\u2019s in each piece is all that\u2019s necessary. Explain why each is important and provides unique insight. Most of your paper should be explaining what we can learn by looking at all of it together. Your paper should display your analysis and critical thinking skills, not just repeat what you read. It\u2019s not just about learning facts. It\u2019s about using them to create and display a deeper understanding of the human world when we put it all together. I\u2019m sorry that your own prof is not teaching you that.",

Try to put the quote in your own words without repeating more three consecutive words from the quote.

Other may choose to fully till fields to make the germination process easier and increase short term yields.\" (Smith, 2005)\n\nParaphrase: Farmers can use different kinds of tilling methods, such as full-till and no-till, based on their unique needs. Some farmers are interested in storing carbon while others are interested in increasing short-term yields. (Smith, 2005) \n\nPlease let me know if this makes sense. Paraphrasing can be a little tricky at first but it is a great way to improve your writing and paper grade.",

      "text": "If it's only the citations that are counted as plagiarized, you should have no reason to worry. Professors know to expect that kind of number on assignments that rely on quotations. They also check through the assignments to see what exactly is labelled as plagiarism, and that way they're making sure the plagiarism checker service is doing its job correctly. You should be fine.",

      "text": ">Meaning a big part of the essay should be quotes from different journals\n\nThis is not what citing your sources means. It means you gather info from the article you're reading and then put it into your own words.  You then cite that information source at the end of that sentence/paragraph.  Placing direct quotes into your paper should only be reserved for when citing spoken word (someone actually talking).  If you're quoting 50% of your paper then you really aren't writing that paper.",
