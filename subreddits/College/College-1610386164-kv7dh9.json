  "text": "Lessons always start on Monday for me (I know that might be different for others depending on their schedules) but every Sunday, I start to get nervous. Then by Monday morning, I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up before class. Throughout the rest of the week, the anxiety dies down. But then it starts all over again when Sunday rolls around. \n\n\nDoes anyone else get like this? I\u2019ve been trying to make Mondays a little easier by watching a some short stand up comedies while I get ready to get into a good mood. But it\u2019s a tiring cycle. My grade are good and I understand the lessons. I think part of it is anticipating what we might be learning next. Aside  from what\u2019s briefly mentioned in the syllabus, my teachers don\u2019t mention what we\u2019re going to learn the following week.",

It\u2019s included in the cost of most universities\u2019 tuition and from anecdotal evidence from friends they found it useful. College causes a lot of anxiety for people for different reasons and it might help to talk to a professional. Also many are being done over zoom/phone, so the difficulty of doing it is lessened.\n\nBeing nervous/worried is something that is natural to feel when working through a degree, but to the point of feeling ill may be a point of concern. I hope you figure it out, I know from personal experience how much anxiety can ruin how you are feeling. Best of luck!",

Anxiety is just your mind's way of trying to protect you. It's a good thing to acknowledge those thoughts- what is your anxiety trying to tell you? What does logic say? I usually journal mine- so the journal entry may look like this.\n\nAnxiety: I don't do well under pressure. I don't know what the assignment is so I can't prepare. Therefore, I'm going to do really poorly. What if the assignment is too overwhelming and I have a panic attack during the lecture?\n\nLogic: I've done really well in the past. I am intelligent and budget my time well. Even if I am overwhelmed with an assignment, I can always ask the professor for help and/or an extension. \n\nAnother thing that's really helped me is keeping my sleep schedule the same through the weekends and breaks. It's helped loads. Sending you good vibes. You can do this!",

Only reason I can afford to hold out for a non-retail job is because I yeeted a good portion of my last jobs paycheck into an emergency fund. Even so, I may have to go to retail soon if I don't find something.\n\nYou may have gotten lucky, based on what you wrote, and never had to work while you were taking classes. But many of us here had no choice but to hold down a job and classes. \n\nLike, man, check yourself before you wreck yourself.
