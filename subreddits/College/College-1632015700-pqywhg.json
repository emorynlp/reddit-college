  "text": "I'm in grad school. The majority of my assignments so far have been really time-consuming but not necessarily difficult at all. But, even when I look at something and think, \"Oh okay, that's not bad at all,\" I still find myself putting it off until the last minute. It's like I get myself so worked up about the thought of doing it, despite also thinking to myself that it looks easy, that it's like I have anxiety or something and then of course it does turn out to be stressful racing to meet the 11:59 deadline... I'm currently staring at the clock thinking, \"I have 11 hours to get this done\" and knowing it shouldn't take more than 2 or 3 hours if I just buckle down and do it, but here I am avoiding it and then I'm going to end up exhausted from putting it off. Are there other people like this? Is there any way to train yourself to stop it? And the worst part is that I usually make perfect grades even if I do it at the last minute, so I don't learn my lesson.",

      "text": "absolutely. I actually learned about this in one of my classes and i forgot what it was called but it\u2019s common! (even happens to me).\n\nwhat helps me is:\n1. scheduling my day. including assignments when I\u2019m not motivated. so I\u2019ll write (psychology chapter 3) between 11-12 if I have a break from classes and try to do it then. \n\n2. BREAK IT DOWN. this is gonna sound a bit funny but I\u2019ll literally break down tasks into like 10 mini-tasks. so for example sometimes I\u2019ll even write \u201cget out textbook\u201d and \u201cread pages 1-3\u201d. every time you check the box for a task, you\u2019re rewarding yourself and GETTING STARTED IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART. even if you split it up throughout the day, it might help especially if you\u2019re doing long assignments.\n\n3. try to do the assignment for ONLY five minutes. chances are you\u2019ll start to be on a roll and keep working. \n\n4. schedule breaks. I use the pomodoro method and work for 25 mins and take a 5 min break. it helps prevent feeling tired too quickly.\n\n5. listening to music when I first start or during the whole assignment. sometimes I listen to jazz music without words if I need to focus. it really helps me get into a good mood and relieve stress. \n\n6. think about why you want to get this assignment done. life is really all about perspective. if you go into an assignment asking yourself questions about it or trying to become interested, you might enjoy it more. \n\ndon\u2019t put too much pressure on yourself. I have found I push assignments out because I\u2019m a perfectionist. sometimes I tell myself I\u2019m just starting a first draft and try to get it done. other times feeling like I don\u2019t understand anything or am overwhelmed causes me to feel stressed. take a deep breath and remember you will be okay.",
