If you took out a private loan from a bank or some other private student loan lending company, you have a legal contract between you and that private organization, so whether the school is open or closed has nothing to do with your private legal obligations.  If you have student loans funded or provided by the government, there may be some prevision that was passed during the pandemic that lightens or temporarily halts the repayment obligation, so check with the Department of Education (assuming you're in the US).  For instance, the government is forgiving some loans for students who attended predatory, for-profit institutions.  If you're not sure about what kind of loans you have or what policies there might be for someone in your situation, the best thing to do would be to consult a lawyer, who will be able to give you much more authoritative advice than what we can provide here on Reddit.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632500198, "upvotes": 2}, "he3e916": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puj625/why/he3e916/", "text": "You\u2019re barley realizing college is a scam?", "author": "Spicybooiii", "created": 1632493047, "upvotes": 1}, "he3566n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puj625/why/he3566n/", "text": "Did your school close, or did they move online?
