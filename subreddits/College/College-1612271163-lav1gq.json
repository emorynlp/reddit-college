I chose my major in Fall 2019 when things were \u201cnormal\u201d and I\u2019m supposed to graduate Spring 2022 (been taking summer classes and already had 6 credits from CC). Most of what we\u2019re learning these days is how to adapt to an event with COVID (virtual, hybrid, spacing etc.) and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll either be dealing with virtual events for the foreseeable future or that when real full capacity events come back I\u2019ll have no idea what to do. My professors are all raving about how now is the perfect time to get into hospitality as an undergrad but I personally am thinking it\u2019s a little risky. Hopefully I am wrong. This pandemic has turned me a little pessimistic.",

I get that I was probably doing grunt work, but it also got me thinking. I was taking a big risk going into that feild. There's just not a lot of jobs for paleontologists. Even if I did catch a break, I was probably going to get stuck with a lot of grunt work until I worked. Then I thought, would I even like the work as I moved past grunt work? Only a small portion of my work would be actually going to dig sites. I still love geology and am sticking with that and I still want a masters/doctorate but maybe not in paleontology.

I realized I did not have the patients or even cared about fabric history or even colour theory for that matter.\n\nI'm sure many people out their love fashion design, but I'll stick to just knowing how to sew simple pieces that my high school fashion design class taught me like a skater skirt.\n\nI'm a BBA student now and I find it odd how I enjoy finance accounting over fabric. I just have one year left before transferring to uni. It's about time since,it took me forever to finally decide I am a capitalistic pig.\n\nWord of advice, as I said before just do your basics and combine what you like with what you're willing to put up working on for 8+ hours a day and you'll figure it out.\n\nI like data and money, so I'm willing to do algebra on spreadsheets if it means I can buy collectable Bratz dolls at the end of the day.",

I had to get at least 15 credit hours to maintain scholarships, and since science classes have weird credit hours, I always ended up fixing my schedule to around 16-17 hours. The hours only get worse from there. I did all my prereqs at a community college, so I had no buffers between all my sciences. I now hate learning science, I have no confidence in myself, and I\u2019m still trying to get over the lasting stress effects of my semesters in premed. Organic chemistry is the only class I\u2019ve ever failed, and I went back with vengeance and finished it in a summer I semester with an A. That was the last burst of motivation I had. I\u2019m in a program I love now and I still have difficulty learning because I don\u2019t study like I used to before getting in the premed program. Kudos to anyone in those programs, I couldn\u2019t hang.\n\nEDIT: also wanted to mention I had to work 30+ hours a week to live while doing this. I was able to cut hours back after a while, but the burnout was already there.",

              "text": "US based here. Honestly the success rate varies so much as it\u2019s such a broad field. I graduated early so I got out right in time to cash in on the 2018 economy. My friends also all graduated either before me or in 2019, so we had great economic luck right before this market crashed. \nWe\u2019ve all been lucky enough to hang on to our jobs, but my bro graduated 2020 and none of his friends got one yet. \nAs to pay, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you make if you live somewhere cheap. Some of us make 6 figures but live in NYC with 3 roommates/huge college debt/and spender life style and struggle.  some of us make $15/hr had no debt, live in a. Small town, and have bought houses or cars. My best advice to you in pay is don\u2019t take out crazy debt because 50k is like $600/month which adds up fast. and before you decide where to move determine what you want your budget to look like for your ideal lifestyle (maybe it\u2019s music festivals once a year, maybe it\u2019s saving 20%, whatever you want) and use that to determine what salary you\u2019ll need. \n\nI\u2019d encourage you to explore via classes, internships, and mentors what part of marketing you want to focus on. Is it marketing or is it PR (including crisis and internal comms)? Do you want to do sales? How about copy writing? Design? Analyst? Digital - is that social, paid, seo, optimization, strategy, email, etc? Once you determine what part you like the best (this will take trial and error) become an expert. That means doing relevant internships, work studies, any available certificates which can either be free or school might pay for, looking at job descriptions and seeing what related fields would be helpful to know on a technical level beyond just the requirement to take elective 101 (html, business writing, graphic design, python, stats, etc). \n\nI went the digital route and what really launched my career is internships and lots of them, certificates (Hubspot, google, hootesuite in college and Salesforce/adobe campaign out of college), technical courses (database, 3 stats, design, social media, strategy, web dev, python), and networking (again internships, career fairs, alum events, mentors, etc). I definitely have the least debt, best pay, preferred location, biggest title, and biggest company on my resume out of all of us - so if those things matter that\u2019s what I think did it for me",

I was fantastic at math and science, and I was even a crypto in the Navy. I started in Computer Science for the first year and a half of college. I then switched to Mechanical Engineering, then Aerospace Engineering, then Material Physics, then Applied Mathematics, then Engineering Physics ... you see where I\u2019m going here. I couldn\u2019t stay in one major. For years, I kept bouncing around non stop, and I was falling deeper and deeper in a dark depression. $40,000 of student loan debt later, and I was completely miserable and still without a degree. I dropped out. I kept up with dev skills and my network, and I eventually founded a startup in a field I actually *was* passionate about, experiences and the environment, not something I went into for the money or because my family pressured me into it. We\u2019re now on the brink of our first capital infusion, and I\u2019m finishing a degree now in Environmental Studies. Again, a field I\u2019m genuinely extremely passionate about. \n\nMoral of the study? Money doesn\u2019t mean jack shit if you hate everything about your life and are depressed beyond all hell. Your first choice, second choice, and even your third choice may not be right. Sometimes, you just have to take a step back.",

Then think about what sort of post college life you are looking for. Doing the same thing every day or more chaotic workplace of new things everyday. From that point ask people who work in the industry you like to interview. Most senior folks love talking about their industry and have the time to do it. They can tell you what its like.",

And I think many students are traumatised.\n\nMy advice to highschool students is take a gap year to identify which degree suits you and make sure that your are employable at the end of your degree.",

You essentially can\u2019t do much with just a bachelors, so you have to get a PhD to actually get a good job. You could be a lab PI but I believe that requires a PhD. You could also work as a lab assistant but again, grades and experience play a huge role. Other than that, it\u2019s pretty much it: grad school, medical school, entry level lab jobs and careers that don\u2019t have specific requirements for what to major in. You don\u2019t even need a neuroscience bachelors to go to grad school for it. It\u2019s just better to major in bio and take classes in the neuro department. You have a lot more opportunities this way. For instance, if you decide that cell messaging is more interesting to you, you would have a much easier time acquiring and doing a research position with a bio major concentrating in cellular+molecular bio than a neuro bachelors. Unless you\u2019re a super genius making straight A\u2019s in all of your classes, it\u2019s just best to major in bio with a focus on Neuro (if that\u2019s an option available to you).",

I don't necesarily regret it, because it taught me what I did wrong and what I could do better and what to focus on, but I did quit after half a year. \n\nI mostly quit because I saw how little job perspective there was, and I just wasn't interested in that sector anymore. The nail in the coffin for me was that I got an assignment back with an insufficient mark (didn't really bothered me that much, it happens), with commentary which basically told me no feedback but just said I was shit at academic writing. That's when I realized that they didn't want me to learn, but want me to know everything already. \n\nThat's the reason I switched from archaeology on an university to coastal marine management on an university of applied sciences. Now in my second year, I don't regret switching. I actually learn from the courses and see a future for myself in this sector (with a big variety of jobs).\n\nI still like archaeology and history, but I rather enjoy it in my spare time than studying it.",

The only people who think a psych degree, or any other degree for that matter, is useless are those who think that you have to apply a specific degree to a specific field. If you get creative about using your knowledge of psychology and applying it in other areas the sky is the limit! Of course, working in the psych field itself can be very lucrative.

Economics is a pretty broad degree, but its also pretty flexible one, since it tends to leave a lot of credits open for a minor or double-major.\n\nFrom my understanding if you dont go for a masters, you're undergrad should be a BS, unless you're double-majoring.\n\nApparently 13% of people working in data science are economics majors, with 21% being Data science.\n\nIts probably best to pair Economics with either some finance or CS  or political science depending on your intended career.\n\nA lot of Law students will study economics. The most common major among American billionaires is economics.\n\nI think an Econ degree has a lot of variability in regards to how good or bad it is, and I think part of that depends on how practical you decide the make Econ degree for you.\n\nI'm still a student, and this could all just me being confirmation bias telling myself I didn't pick the wrong major.

If you graduate EE with not-so-good grades and a lack of internships or research, it's going to be a struggle.

Maybe you'll be lucky, but a lot of people aren't. \n\n>My first job was washing dishes, and I don't doubt that my first career-job will be the EE equivalent of washing dishes\n\nI agree on this. Too many people have high expectations and don't think about technician jobs that pay 35k-40k/year. However, the guys I know have been applying everywhere. The issue is my school also teaches ESET (Electronic Systems Engineering Technology) as a separate major and they have priority for technician jobs. \n\n>I don't think I'll be switching, I'm so far in at this point that I'd rather just complete my remaining work. \n\nI agree with that logic, however if you want to do ML, you really need to be studying Math/CS/Stats. An Electrical engineering degree is not going to prep you for ML. I will note one of my professors who taught ML did a bachelors in EE but he also had a PhD in CS. It's very hard to get into ML with an EE background and no CS background. If you plan on going to grad school for CS that's fine, but just keep this in mind.",

Also is that 99% job placement or 99% placement in field? Cause those are two very different things (lots of coding boot camps brag about their 99% job placement when their grads end up stock shelves at Walmart). If the wording is \u201c99 percent job placement\u201d, that means any job, from chip design to chick-fil-cashier. In addition, is it all students, or only those who respond to the job survey? Since those with good jobs are the ones who respond to post-grad surveys, that also skews the percentage.\n\nFor instance, out of 50 students, if 10 get EE-related jobs, 10 get waiter jobs, and the other 30 don't respond to the optional survey, that's 100% job placement rate.\n\nYou say that Michigan Tech has a 99% ECE placement rate, but I'm only seeing 99% job placement rate when I google the department website. 99% job placement rate doesn't necessarily mean everyone got a job (since surveys are optional) or that they got an EE-related job (since it only says job placement).\n\nIt's like fast food saying made with 100% beef.

After graduation I took a job as an analyst at a commercial real estate firm. I wasn't super interested in commercial real estate but I did enjoy using my foundational knowledge in econ to excel at my job. Got bumped up to a regional role a year later, I got to apply my econ skills to multiple markets to compare them against themselves. Really fun but still didn't care about commercial real estate.\n\nNow I'm in consulting, getting paid to perform feasibility analyses for major real estate developers. IT IS AWESOME. If I weren't an econ junkie I wouldn't have had the ability to do what I do now. Still in commercial real estate, but the development side, and this aspect of it is incredibly interesting! If you're interested in the field then absolutely you should pursue a degree here. My one piece advice, minor in math and take as many high level stats oriented econ courses as you possibly can. Econometrics for example, an incredibly difficult but wildly fulfilling course every reputable economics program offers. Lucky for me my school offered it all the way up to econometrics III! Math is good for understanding the subject better, and even better for getting into a competitive grad school if you ever have the inclination.\n\nIf you can't tell, I'm a BIG TIME sucker for econ and will proselytize it to those who show interest. The subject matter took someone (me) who graduated in the bottom quarter of a 2,000 kid high-school class with no interest education to someone who is seriously considering pursuing a PhD in econ. If you're up for challenging yourself academically then you'll probably enjoy it! I thought I was decently smart until I started taking econ classes, it was a humbling experience to say the least.",

If you want to help people, but you dont want to be a doctor or something that takes a long time to finish, this is the field for you. There's a wide variety of fields/settings social workers can specialize in- military, child welfare, counseling, schools, hospitals, geriatric care, substance abuse treatment, prisons, and more. There's even a national code of ethics every licensed social worker has to abide by. The licensing requirements are almost the same from state to state (except for California), so if you move, you won't have to put too much effort into getting licensed in your new state, just might have to take a class or two.\n\nEdit: misread the title somehow. I used to be a biology major until I realized how much I suck at the hard sciences, so I regret the time I wasted on that.",

Both are work-intensive, but the work is different so it breaks it up in a way that is more tolerable. If I'm sick of reading and writing, I can do a problem set or lab report. It's less tiring than just doing the same kind of work all the time. \n\nI find that they complement each other really nicely. While taking my history of greek philosophy class, I was able to see a lot of the early work in math and physics and study how that impacted both fields. I also wish more STEM people would give more consideration to ethics. Physics has fewer ethical problems than biology or medicine, but science is done by humans and impacts humans, so it deserves consideration. \n\nSomeone once told me that philosophy was the original STEM field and that what we now think of as the hard sciences evolved from there. Initially, I was a little offended someone would even say that, but they're right. The thought process of philosophy is not any different than the scientific method and the line between theoretical physics (which is a hard science) and philosophy of physics is blurry at best.",

At that point you won't feel good and your students will suffer for it. Of course it's different for each person and could take years before it happens. Just think back to that high-school teacher that had clearly given up, I'm sure there was at least one.\n\nAlso talking to your professors regularly is one of the best things you can do.

Usually you won't find \"technical writer\" printed out in black ink because the role fits into many categories. You have to figure out if you want to get acquainted with coding or just writing programs, and what kind of company/institution interests you enough to learn about excessively. That's where the right certificate comes in handy.\nPersonally, I'm going to be taking an internship in the field. They're not hard to come by and experimenting with different companies to see which type of technical writing suits you the best is important. (And building a portfolio) \nThere's technical writers for almost every possible field out there. \nFor me, flexibility is what matters most, so I have no problem trying on a few beforehand to see what fits.",

It\u2019s also destroys the whole false narrative of \u201cwaiting for inspiration,\u201d you learn to produce, inspired or not.

              "text": "I'm going to copy and paste my reply from another sub.\n\nFirst, I went to IT for the wrong reason. I didn't know what I want to do and picked it because literally everyone said it's a good field, is easier than CS, high demand, high paying, you name it. But the reality is not that great. Yes, tech is in high demand but for the experienced people. The market is oversaturated with new graduates. It's not a guarantee to get a decent paying job right after graduation. I can always work at a help desk first to gain experience but then what the whole point of going to college when anyone can apply for that job with just certs? Now even we have to fight with CS graduates for the job.\n\nSecond, I feel like I didn't learn enough in school for any position. My degree is basically choose your own classes. I took a variety of database, programming, data analytics, social media management, bash, etc. It's a little bit of everything and not in depth in anything. Yes, college is what you make of it. I should have created my own side projects, done programming for fun, went to hackathon, get a few certs under my belt, etc etc. Buttt, like I said at the very beginning I don't like IT that much to spend all my free time dedicating to it. Doing homeworks was more than enough for me and would often make me rethink my career choice. As I also mentioned above, I'm tired of staring at the screen for hours trying to figure out why tf my code doesn't run like it should. I need something that I can use my brain, but also being able to move around a bit.\n\nAnyway, that's my experience. If you're trying to pursue IT then I'd recommend researching the branch you like to focus on like, databases, networking, programming, etc. Then teach yourself the materials and take the exam to be certified. Get experience, anything. Helpdesks are what people usually start with then work your way up. Get more relevant certs if needed. That way you would save tons of money, get a related job faster than going the college route. Seriously, I don't get the point of classes like social media management. You just post stuff on a page. Virtually anyone can do that nowadays.\n\nAs for my current career path, I am studying for the medical lab science/medical technology degree. I find it's more satisfying studying sample and working in the lab. I also don't have to update my skills every few years or so due to new technology coming out.",

But I wasnt interested in any specific field enough to dedicate myself yet.  \n  \nAnd that's why in another way I'm happy about it. While I dont have specific highly valuable technical skills, I have a degree which has a wide range of applications (at a lesser starting salary, that's the tradeoff) ((not a hard rule))  \n  \nIf I could go back in time, I would have added a 2nd major in philosophy and that's it. No other changes. But nothing is stopping me from teaching myself now.  \n  \nI deeply regret however I never got an internship which will make it harder for me to get a job. I guess I could've networked more as well. That was due to mental health mostly.  \n  \nI had no self confidence so I didnt feel worthy of anything and I was too depressed to ask for help from my professors. I lowkey thought I would have killed myself by now too so what would be the point *is what I previously thought*   \n  \nThat's the problem. Shoulda woulda could a. If I could go back in time with my few more years of experience things would be different. But I cant. I could have only learned by making the exact choices i say i regret .",

Some stuff on landfills. There\u2019s no classes on environmental remediation, no classes on air pollution engineering, none of our electives are earth science of any sort, no climate change adaptation courses. There\u2019s a lot missing and not all schools are like that, but it\u2019s been pretty terrible. \n\nMy school emphasizes water resources and sustainable buildings and those disciplines pretty much design stuff and ensure compliance with the bullshit environmental regulations we have in place right now. My school\u2019s career fair is this week and all of the companies recruiting environmental engineers are construction and civil engineering companies that need environmentals to clean up after them, and doing that sounds like my nightmare. \n\nI changed my major a bunch trying to figure out the perfect thing to do and I have to take 5 years now for a degree I hate. And I\u2019m going to grad school in atmospheric science, which builds on engineering but is different. It\u2019s just been a big waste of my time because I hate it and I could have graduated in 3 years if I\u2019d done something like physics and stuck with it. \n\nYou need to do research about what the schools you\u2019re interested in offer. There are a lot of disciplines of environmental engineering and my school did a crap job of exposing us to those different fields. And this is just my experience- I\u2019m more attuned to science than engineering. It also may just take you doing the major for you to know you like it- I didn\u2019t know I hated this program until I got too deep into it to change. Good luck!\n\nedit: I just got assigned a project about designing the sanitary sewer, water distribution lines, and stormwater detention on a piece of land under development. I have to determine which pipe sizes, materials, and fittings to use. I have to calculate major and minor losses in pipe flow and determine development costs. I hate this shit. If you\u2019re doing environmental bc you want to help the planet make sure you\u2019re going to a school doing the woke, new environmental stuff. This is important too, we need clean water and stuff, but whew I hate it",

              "text": "Sure!  So personally I enjoy the smaller scaled aspects of interior design, for example specifying finishes, space planning rooms, considering the functions of space, lighting design, etc.  The program at my school focuses solely on commercial interior design and about 90% of the professors / teachers are architects.  Once we got into our studio classes it wasn't acceptable to have \"inspo boards\" or anything like that for a project anymore, we had to have a conceptual idea, tons of conceptual sketches, 3D models, etc, of the entire building.  I totally understand that, even in interior design, it's important to consider the building as a whole when designing a space but in my experience in this program, if you didn't have a huge conceptual architectural move that broke apart the building and changed the way people thought, your project wasn't good.  It's probably just me personally, but I just struggled soooo much with this idea that each building had to have a whole philosophical concept idea behind it.  The professors encouraged big out of the box ideas at the expense of functionality and code. For example, we never actually designed a kitchen, instead we should consider how the kitchen would contribute to the larger design of the whole space. I think BOTH are important and it just sucks that a lot of the practicality got lost for the sake of a big pretty concept.  IDK man, I just wanted to learn about the psychology of feeling good in space, what materials are appropriate where, sustainability in design, lighting etc.  I feel my program tries too hard to have these beautiful Interior \"Architecture\" projects to submit for contests to be recognized and all that, and kinda forgot to teach the small things.  Working in the field now, I've had to teach myself how to do spec-sheets, something that should have just been an added deliverable per each project.  I've just felt totally in over my head the past two years but now that I'm working in the field I actually just feel frustrated that they tried so hard to make my degree into something it's not.  They even tell us, \"oh you're interior architects\", like no, actually the degree literally says BFA Interior Design lmao.  I mean I do have a pretty bomb portfolio from having gone through all the frustrations of these big projects, but looking back I think I would have chosen a different college with a shorter path and done more research into the faculty in each design department.  I have a ton of respect for architects, you guys take on huge projects and have such a complex way of problem solving!  Sorry for the long and somewhat ranty response.",

The three main scholarship categories from what I can surmise are Academic, Sports, and Need-Based, all of which have subcategories. My brother (straight white male) is in community college which is fairly inexpensive as far as tuition goes. His grades from high school were mostly average with standouts in visual art & music because that's what he loved. He didn't get school sponsored scholarships based on academics because of his grades but he did get a significant amount of need-based aid from the state and federal pell grant. He is also an undeclared major which excludes him from possible major-related scholarships or grants. As far as former SWM classmates of mine go, majority of them got at least partial scholarships in all three main categories, mostly based on academics and financial need. Either way most college students regardless of background, except the rich and upper middle classes, come out of school with some sort of debt.",

That is the extent of my design career Lmao\n\nIn addition to all the template technologies you can go on fiverr and find people making logos for dollars.",

              "text": "This gets long. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nArt was a passionate hobby of mine, and I never liked to do commissions. I was being forced to go to college by my parents when I wanted a gap semester to grow up more and figure out what I wanted first. On top of that we used my father's GI bill and it requires you to pick a major so you can't go undeclared. I picked it because I didn't know what else to do and I thought I was way too stupid for a STEM field so biology didn't even cross my mind.\n\nI was in my second abusive relationship during this. I went into academic probation almost immediately. I was very severely depressed and struggling with my abuser and that entire situation. I skipped most of my classes and just sat around in the student center since my parents had to drop me off back then. I hid my grades and everything but obviously the letters came that my GPA was so bad I was about to get kicked out from the college.\n\nI dumped the abuser finally and eventually my mental health got better. I finished up breaking out of academic probation and even got all A's. I graduated with my A.A. in Graphic Design and went into an online school to go for web design. But of course it always lingered in my mind that the truth, quite frankly, is that it does not bring in good money unless you hit the jackpot and become a big name to corporations. That, and my health began to deteriorate. I got a new disorder called Meniere's Disease and it destroyed my ability to do art. I gave away all my art supplies and destroyed all of my artwork in an emotional rage. I took some upper level STEM courses at the online school and did very well and that's when it finally hit me that I wasn't too stupid for STEM - I was stupid for thinking so lowly of myself to begin with.\n\nI had an itching for biology, but also astronomy and geology. I switched to a university an hour away and went full biology. It's a special program where biology is essentially your major and your minor. The more classes I took, the more I fell in love with the profession. I began to love it so much I volunteered repeatedly to be a lab assistant. I have done it three times including right now. My GPA overall has gotten better, but my institutional GPA is a 3.6 and I've gotten on the Provost List several times and the Chancellor List once. All of this done in terms, not semesters, by the way. And my Meniere's Disease doesn't get triggered so severely. Of course, I also found a way to merge my other interests into biology. I want to become an astrobiologist, but I adore epidemiology just as much.\n\nAs for my art hobby... I found other ways to go back to it. I do astrophotography, 3D rendering, and my significant other is getting very advanced at his 3D modeling/animating/texturing. Also... He wants to become an astrophysicist, and he was a huge part of me finally switching to biology. He helped me build up the courage. He's done so much for me I could make a huge large list on that alone. I wouldn't be where I'm at now without him.\n\nTL;DR: Got forcibly rushed into it, almost got kicked out due to academic probation because of depression and relationship abuse, left abuser and did much better and graduated, got a vestibular disorder, took some STEM classes, switched to biology with support from SO and absolutely love it ever since.",

And I also thought I was \"too stupid\" for a serious major, but now I'm about to transfer (haven't accepted anything yet) into either an earth science or social science major. And art is still my hobby. We are so much more capable than we think. :)",

STEM majors are usually higher paid when it comes to entry levels jobs as well. I was undecided my freshmen year with kinda a mid life crisis too since I just had no idea what I wanted to do. I just picked classes that seemed to be the most interesting and the science ones stuck with me. \n\nAlso, getting minors were soooo helpful in my commitment issues to a major. I am a biology major with a digital media minor which has allowed me to use both sides of my brain. Adding a minor is kinda tough when you are required to do labs and recitations but totally worth it if you put in the work. It's helped me get so many internships because I am more diversified as an applicant and makes me stand out! Hopefully that will apply to grad school as well!!!",

You use these more casual professional relationships to hopefully get an in at an employer for an internship and job while you're at school and after graduation. \n\nit can be daunting and exhausting but in a lot of fields it can be be a necessity for landing a job, especially a first job out of school. \n\nI'm not sure the specifics for communication and marketing but as a law student having to market myself just to get low paid or unpaid internships is taxing to say the least. \n\nedit: and the grind doesn't end there you have to network throughout your career to get clients and to land better jobs.",

You need to join a club and become an executive because companies want to see that you have \"leadership qualities\".

Make sure to develop a strong relationship with your professors. Make sure you go to networking events at your college with students of the same major. Sure it's important to get good grades and learn stuff but it's also important to send out 50 applications to find an internship or even get an interview. \n\nI don't think this will change in the future but I do wonder how college was before the internet and before college was oversaturated. Were students feeling the same pressure to always be active whether its going to events, posting on LinkedIn, or sending out 50 applications and filling out fields again and again? I can't stop thinking about how my prof freshman year talked about companies want/expect you to have 2 or more internships nowadays. I wish college was more: get good grades,  get internship because of grades, get good job. The competition is just pronounced nowadays.",

With MIS you'll be doing a lot of database management. I can't really inform you whether CS or MIS would be better until I have a clearer idea of what sort of job you want. For instance, if you want to do ML or Software Engineering, don't do MIS. \n\nIt's kinda hard to explain the difference between CompSci and MIS to someone who isn't technically informed (I'm an EE/CompEng which is a whole different story).",

I used to draw out a mechanism and purposefully omit either the reactant(s), reagents, or products and quiz myself accordingly. It\u2019s invaluable to be able to look at a reaction and immediately know what reagents can be used or what your starting materials should look like and not just what the product is. Identifying key disconnections early on is a really useful skill. For reference starting my PhD in organic synthesis in the fall.",

I never too OChem in college, only a class in HS, but we learned maybe like 40-50 reactions, retrosynthesis, basically most material Ochem classes go through. Similar depth, less content. It was one of my favorite classes (although I'm not majoring in any of the life sciences). My teacher always said \"understand, don't memorize\" and walked us through every step of the first reactions, then made us try to guess how future reactions would undergo just based on starting material or the first step.\n\n\nVisualizing things was a bit difficult but it ended up being one of the classes I did best in, and most people did well in it. I would take an Ochem class for fun to be honest, but unfortunately 1) I don't have the time in my schedule since I'm double majoring, 2) I need to take Gen Chem II as a pre-req and I *hate* Gen Chem, and 3) I don't want it to negatively impact my GPA if I end up eating my words :P",

Personally I went for a double major with one of them being in Supply Chain and so far(as a Junior) I feel like none of what it being taught to us is specialized knowledge.

Our target population is students who identify as first generation, low income, or affiliated with disability student services. Our program provided intensive support services to about 450 students. My caseload is 75 students, where typical academic advising caseload is 750-1500 students. I got lucky with this position, tbh. Most advisors have degrees in counseling, education, higher ed admin, or social work.\n\nWhile working on my MA, I worked as a grad assistant and gained relevant experience in a similar program at the institution I earned my degree at. Working with my students definitely influenced my academic interests, and my thesis ended up focusing on the shift from religious charity to government sponsored welfare transformed the early modern perceptions of poverty in Tudor England. (I was also able to make the connection to modern perceptions of poor people through the British colonization of the US and recreation of government).\n\nSkills I use in my position vary. When recruiting, I have to think critically about the data disparities I see in student records vs what they tell me about themselves, I need to be able to clearly document our meetings, I have an ample understanding of how our country's public education has consistently failed the students I work with, I have a cultural understanding of almost their diverse backgrounds and how that might influence their decisions, etc. \n\nThe degree to which your major is valuable to you is how you choose to apply it. With a BA in history, you need to be able to convincingly apply the so-called soft skills you learn to a position that interests you. I hope I answered your questions.",
