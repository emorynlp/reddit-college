  "text": "Hi, fellow Redditors! I am currently a STEM major (sophomore) and I have a serious difficulty *learning* (conceptual) in college. I genuinely cannot stay focused for a long time in zoom classes and as a result, I tend to skip the last hour of the lecture, promising myself that I will catch up by watching the recording. The weekend arrives and I pretty much end up bingeing 10hrs worth of lectures and not doing any of the assignments/supplement worksheets. So I'm almost always about a week behind (best case) for my classes. Now, here's the worst part - I have 5 classes this semester and I face the same issue in each class. Moreover, my GPA has truly hit rock bottom over the last 2 online semesters (2.5 GPA) and I think that the main reason for this is my current learning methodology (more specifically, the way I learn from online classes) and my poor time management skills. I'm about halfway through the term and I'm sure that this will only worsen as the term progresses. I wish to improve at the earliest. \n\nCurrent Learning Methodology: So basically, the way I'm currently learning is by (re-)watching lectures and taking notes in a physical notebook. Usually, the lectures aren't very helpful so I try to watch some youtube videos on the topic by which I usually get further confused. As for the tutorials, I have been seriously behind on my work, so I usually just attend them to get the answers and I *try to understand* the answers the night before my exam. More usually than not, I usually just google the questions which I don't know (very counterintuitive since I am supposed to think through the question first), taking the easy way out. As for test preparation, I start off by trying to read my notes but then I don't end up understanding anything so I go back to the recording to rewatch the lectures. Then, I tend to blank out while solving the past test papers, hence wasting a lot of time, and I have only been understanding the solutions to past test papers before the actual test for the last 2 semesters. I am aware that all these are terrible ways to learn, and I believe one reason for this is my lack of adaptability to online learning. I would like to know how to properly understand the content taught through online classes.\n\nTime management: I have tried using literally everything - from Notion to Excel Spreadsheets to Google Calendar to a good ol' physical planner but I somehow can't stick to it. Usually, I end up completing only 2-3/10 tasks. Those uncompleted tasks keep piling up towards the end of the week and every time I check something off, something new comes up. I'm not sure if this is a motivation issue or a discipline issue or an attitude issue (or even all three!)\n\nI would really like some advice as to how I can rectify the current situation I'm in (at the earliest), and how I can properly learn in college and be up to date with my classes as the term progresses (and how I can potentially improve my GPA). Thanks!",
