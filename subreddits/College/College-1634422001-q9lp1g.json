  "text": "Hello guys! Our team is currently working on a coding competition, and we need a dataset on students' performance which we can't find or obtain, because all of the students' info is usually well-protected\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you guys could take a minute and fill the form out, it would help us a lot! Feel free to leave as much or as little(much is better though) information as you want\n\nAlso if someone know where to get a dataset of students and their grades, please comment below :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://forms.gle/nySN2gzWSM9nrazp8](https://forms.gle/nySN2gzWSM9nrazp8)",
