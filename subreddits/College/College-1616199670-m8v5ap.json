I worked on the exam in word, but when I tried to convert the document to pdf my computer simply couldn\u2019t do it in time. The exam was locked and I hadn\u2019t submitted a thing.

Electronic exams are much harder to administer with without something going wrong, and I\u2019m sure your professor knows this. But if they do have a hard time believing you, if you have a way of screenshotting the technical issue and sending it to them that will help your case.
