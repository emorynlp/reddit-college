The fact that anyone needs to pay for homework help via assistance from other users is beyond ridiculous. I seriously can't believe an open-source solution has never emerged.\n\nWe live in an era where homework solutions can be easily found. Unfortunately, that technology hasn't resulted in access that's free and available. Businesses are taking full advantage of the demand and making tons of money off of it. There used to be yahoo answers which was a surprisingly good resource for homework solutions. Unfortunately, it was shut down along with all the homework solutions. Now every single alternative has a massive paywall. Even people that can provide the solutions from their own chegg memberships are happy to make you pay for it.\n\n I'm disgusted that a free alternative has never been successful. Free solutions would mean everyone has equal privilege for homework help. No site should take advantage of a students' desperation. That's why it's beyond necessary for there to be a free, community-supported alternative. The paid sites honestly need to die and a free alternative with enough users could easily destroy this greedy practice\n\nEdit: There is actually a subreddit called r/homeworkhelp. All is not lost",

A good explanation can come from potentially anyone. The fact that there are so few free resources is just astounding. I could probably help with homework problems myself. I'm not a professor but I know some basics. All I would need is the right platform. \n\nMost problems do not take half an hour to explain. The problems you're referring to are for advanced studies. it isn't that difficult or time-consuming to work out a problem on a sheet of paper and then provide a simple explanation. You don't need all this complicated writing software. Think about college professors solving and explaining multiple math problems in a single, one-hour lecture. It's perfectly reasonable to expect community-driven homework solutions for your typical college algebra or physics problem. It shouldn't be near this difficult or obscure.\n\nEven if the answers aren't always right, the Reddit community would correct or downvote the wrong answers. Besides, there's plenty of free online calculators that can help you verify the results. \n\nWhen college is already so expensive, any resource that helps students at absolutely zero cost should be celebrated. I really wish more people were aware of this and saved the frustration of being left to do a problem they had no idea how to solve",

                      "text": "As I said, teachers can explain multiple problems in a single lecture. it really isn't that complicated to explain a math problem. it doesn't really matter whether or not most of the problems are long and complicated. The short ones aren't easily accessible either. And believe me, even with the short problems there's still plenty of people who naturally have difficulty with any math problem. You also have to consider all the high school students or even middle school students who need help with their assignments. There's clearly a demand for even the basic math problems. \n\nNone of this stuff has to cost anything anyway. Especially if anyone can pitch in. If you go on the subreddit I linked, you'll see most problems are solved by someone. Clearly, it doesn't take much to help someone with their math homework",

I've spent almost 10 hours a day on Slader for a loooong time now and then this happens. \n\nSlader felt like a community with comments that we were able to vote up or down. People who answered got famous like BATMAN for calc.\n\nSometimes, the best answer wasn't clear enough but the second or third or even the comments gave the material a different perspective, which made it much easier to grasp. \n\nWhat is this Quizlet bullshit thinking they can make it better ?",
