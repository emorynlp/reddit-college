  "text": "i\u2019ve been at college for a month and a half, and i\u2019ve only ever had a few normal days. it\u2019s been fun, though. i see my friends everyday and we usually hang out until late at night. we party on the weekends and relax on sundays. \n\ni recently went home to visit one of my friends and she said it feels like she\u2019s in a sitcom and it made so much sense. \n\ni was even telling my friends how i keep forgetting that we\u2019re actually here for school. we unintentionally talk so loud in the dorm and forget that we\u2019re not living in our own apartment where it\u2019s just us. there are moments where something completely ridiculous happens and i\u2019m just like, \u201cyou\u2019re telling me this is real life and not part of a show?\u201d \n\nidk. it just still feels so surreal that i\u2019m here. does anybody else feel like this?",

I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to be trying to sleep or study when people the next room over are acting as you described. I promise you can have just as much fun talking at a normal volume",
