Just taking notes for those quizzes alone will take me so much time AND we normally only have one quiz a week unless there is a test (then it\u2019s the test and quiz).",

I guess it all depends on the culture at your college, I know holiday breaks are valued a lot where I go to school. But my semester also ends really early as well so there's only one more week of actual classes after Thanksgiving week, and then finals week.",

      "text": "Depends on school policies. Some schools say that you can't assign work over November, Winter, or Spring Break, but some are far less clear. You'd have to check your school handbook or something of that sort to confirm. It also depends on how long your thanksgiving break is. Some schools literally only give thursday friday, some include wednesday, and some are the entire week. So if you still have classes in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, I would say there is a definite chance of having homework due on those days if your classes choose to meet.",
