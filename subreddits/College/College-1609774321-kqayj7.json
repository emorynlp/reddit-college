My mother divorced her second husband (my step-father at the time) right before I started my freshman year of college.

Her new boyfried moved in earlier that summer. It was a clusterfuck, but worse for my brother, who was still in high school. Thankfully our actual dad (Mom's first husband) is still in our lives, it was a huge help to have him.\n\nIt's gonna suck ass for a while, but you'll adjust to the new normal eventually. Lean on your friends, because many of them probably also have divorced parents. Even if they don't, they want to support you, and they'll be good listeners. Seek out counseling if you think it will help; there's nothing wrong with talking to a professional. Your university may have free or discounted options for this. If you're living in a dorm or apartment away from your parents, be grateful; the distance will allow you to process things more peacefully.\n\nYou may resent one or both of your parents. That's normal. Just know that your feelings will probably change with time. If your parents are both slandering each other in front of you, just know that you will probably never know the whole truth. That's okay.

It sucks, it's hard to try to navigate adult relationships with your parents while they try to figure out the stuff between them and you're trying to create your own independent life. It's gotten worse recently because I moved back in with my mom after living in a different country for a few years years, so I feel like I'm in the middle of them more often and I talk to my dad less. Personally, I found it helpful to build a support system that's completely independent from my family and to just stay out of my parents' business as much as possible (much easier said than done, though!!)", "author": "Affectionate-Jelly-2", "created": 1609800479, "upvotes": 2}, "gi482u5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kqayj7/did_anyones_parents_get_divorced_during_their/gi482u5/", "text": "First: I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Even when it's clearly the best course of action, even when everyone agrees about what needs to happen and it's all handled amicably, divorce is awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved. \n\nMy folks announced their divorce a few days after I graduated from high school. My mom moved out the following weekend, into an apartment across town, and the summer that followed was one where we did more things as a family than we had for the last 18 years. We went to Disney World, to the beach, to the movies, out to dinner. It was weird.\n\nLeaving home is one of those \"line in the sand\" moments when, for better or worse, your relationship with your parents is going to change, whether you're headed off to college or into the military or joining the workforce or whatever. It's challenging to navigate that under the best of circumstances - not only do you have to figure out how to relate to your parents as a fellow adult, but now you have to consider them as individual people. It's \"Mom\" and \"Dad,\" now, not \"Mom and Dad.\" And someday it might be \"Mom and spouse\" and/or \"Dad and spouse.\" My parents have both since remarried, and I refer to their spouses by their first names or as \"my mom's husband\"/\"my dad's wife\" instead of \"stepdad\"/\"stepmom\" because they were never parents to me, I was already grown and out of the house when they married my parents. It's not meant as a slight, just an accurate description of our relationship.\n\nIt's been ten years since the divorce was final. While I was in college and it was all fresh, I think having that physical distance gave me the emotional distance to process things that I needed. I didn't come home to visit much during the semester, but during breaks I'd mostly stay with my dad and it was awkward for a while. I wasn't quite a guest and wasn't quite a resident anymore, but it also wasn't quite my house anymore, and the space became less and less familiar as time went on. Staying with mom was less awkward because I didn't have any memories associated with the apartment she rented.\n\nThis got kind of long but I hope something in there resonates with you.", "author": "tehzephyrsong", "created": 1609800102, "upvotes": 3}, "gi47zwy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kqayj7/did_anyones_parents_get_divorced_during_their/gi47zwy/", "text": "Holy cow, actually yeah they did.

At night, as I\u2019d listen, my heart would beat so fast, and I prayed and prayed that I wouldn\u2019t be forced to come downstairs and take sides and defend my mother, or be forced to say horrible things to my dad.\n\nIt was always so intense and dramatic and my parents were always screaming and saying the most horrible things they didn\u2019t care about shielding it from at all. I felt so afraid of them. I felt like I was in a kind of war zone. It never seemed to stop. And I had nowhere to go I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out most of the time. It was like living with two wild raging animals, I felt at any moment they might turn on me. \n\nI was so scared, all the time, I didn\u2019t know of what exactly, because I knew they wouldn\u2019t hurt me badly or kill each other, but the screaming and even mild violence (hitting, biting, throwing things etc.) made me feel so on edge. My dog would run away at any hint of conflict and I\u2019d comfort her in the corner just praying they\u2019d leave me alone.\n\nIt was like that almost everyday for some of middle school and all of high school.

They sold the house and My mom (who didn\u2019t work) moved to another state after they split up, to live with her childhood best friend and her family. So when I came home my freshman year of college it was to another stare and we were living with another family in a really different part of the world (verrry rural) than I was used to. I didn\u2019t have any friends there and I didn\u2019t fit in and I didn\u2019t love being a guest in someone else\u2019s house for three years (that\u2019s how long we ended up staying) and always feeing obligated to be perfect and helpful and just go with the flow and give up my old urban lifestyle (they were a big conservative Christian family) because they were letting us live there for free!

It's absolutely okay to tell one or both of your parents \"no, I can't deal with this\".

If you look up the Gottman longitudinal study on relationships, the 19-year mark is one of the two most common times for marriages to break up, because parents will often stay together for their children until they are out of the household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience is that I cannot remember my parents ever being together. While they never let me see what they were like together, I know that it was not good, even when they lived together platonically and put on a good face for me. That it is better for them to not be together might be small comfort for you though. Dealing with family drama makes college a LOT harder in my experience. That's why I dropped out the first time, in part. The issue comes if they are involving you in their drama. You're going to have to put up boundaries and tell them something like \"I understand that you need to vent, but I'm not the right person to do that to.\" It is more harmful for children to hear their parents speak badly about one another than for parents to say bad things about the child to the child. So ask them to not speak badly about the other parent to you, and say they should speak to their friends instead. Boundaries are super important and healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I would recommend is to find out if your college has mental health services and use them. The school therapist I had a few sessions with had wonderful advice that helped me get through college and work around my idiosyncrasies and despair. Join a study group (I did this via zoom), and meet every week (a couple of days after class having done the homework already, doing it early is the key here) to go over the material. Reach out to your professors to let them know you are going through some difficult times, and schedule a time to meet with them every week and go over the material if you can. Even if the meeting is just to say \"this is how I understood the work, is this correct?\" I know it sounds like extra work, but honestly doing this gave me more free time as I was able to not spend extra time stressing about work because I already knew I was doing everything I could.", "author": "Kisua", "created": 1609783772, "upvotes": 6}, "gi398o9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kqayj7/did_anyones_parents_get_divorced_during_their/gi398o9/", "text": "A close friend of mine at the time did...he was the youngest of 5 kids.

Assuming that it's at least somewhat amicable sit them down and talk about it. Ask them if they would both like to go and help move in, or if they'd rather one help move in and the other come visit later. If there's a list of things you need write it down and see if they want to split the list. No matter what, do not hold anything against either of them for what they do/ don't do right now - you're probably confused, and they're likely both fairly emotional right now even if they won't show it.
