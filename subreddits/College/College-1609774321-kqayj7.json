      "text": "Sort of! My mother divorced her second husband (my step-father at the time) right before I started my freshman year of college. He moved out in March of my senior year of high school, but my mother finally told me they signed the papers while she was literally driving me to move into my dorm in August. Her new boyfried moved in earlier that summer. It was a clusterfuck, but worse for my brother, who was still in high school. Thankfully our actual dad (Mom's first husband) is still in our lives, it was a huge help to have him.\n\nIt's gonna suck ass for a while, but you'll adjust to the new normal eventually. Lean on your friends, because many of them probably also have divorced parents. Even if they don't, they want to support you, and they'll be good listeners. Seek out counseling if you think it will help; there's nothing wrong with talking to a professional. Your university may have free or discounted options for this. If you're living in a dorm or apartment away from your parents, be grateful; the distance will allow you to process things more peacefully.\n\nYou may resent one or both of your parents. That's normal. Just know that your feelings will probably change with time. If your parents are both slandering each other in front of you, just know that you will probably never know the whole truth. That's okay. Things will never go back to the way they were, but that doesn't mean everything will be bad forever.",

Take it one day at a time, remember you will heal and any work you get done you will be happy to have done later. Make sure you have a safe space to go when you feel overwhelmed. And lastly, communicate with professors-for the most part, they are human and will understand the issues you are facing and want to help.\nStay strong ! You got this.",

They had been separated for years and everyone knew they were getting divorced, but my mom wanted to wait until all of the kids turned 18 so that they wouldn't have to try to settle custody arrangements in addition to everything else. I remember feeling relieved at the time because I thought that signing the papers would help settle some of the animosity between my parents - four years later this does not appear to have been the case lol. It sucks, it's hard to try to navigate adult relationships with your parents while they try to figure out the stuff between them and you're trying to create your own independent life. It's gotten worse recently because I moved back in with my mom after living in a different country for a few years years, so I feel like I'm in the middle of them more often and I talk to my dad less. Personally, I found it helpful to build a support system that's completely independent from my family and to just stay out of my parents' business as much as possible (much easier said than done, though!!)",

      "text": "First: I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Even when it's clearly the best course of action, even when everyone agrees about what needs to happen and it's all handled amicably, divorce is awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved. \n\nMy folks announced their divorce a few days after I graduated from high school. My mom moved out the following weekend, into an apartment across town, and the summer that followed was one where we did more things as a family than we had for the last 18 years. We went to Disney World, to the beach, to the movies, out to dinner. It was weird.\n\nLeaving home is one of those \"line in the sand\" moments when, for better or worse, your relationship with your parents is going to change, whether you're headed off to college or into the military or joining the workforce or whatever. It's challenging to navigate that under the best of circumstances - not only do you have to figure out how to relate to your parents as a fellow adult, but now you have to consider them as individual people. It's \"Mom\" and \"Dad,\" now, not \"Mom and Dad.\" And someday it might be \"Mom and spouse\" and/or \"Dad and spouse.\" My parents have both since remarried, and I refer to their spouses by their first names or as \"my mom's husband\"/\"my dad's wife\" instead of \"stepdad\"/\"stepmom\" because they were never parents to me, I was already grown and out of the house when they married my parents. It's not meant as a slight, just an accurate description of our relationship.\n\nIt's been ten years since the divorce was final. While I was in college and it was all fresh, I think having that physical distance gave me the emotional distance to process things that I needed. I didn't come home to visit much during the semester, but during breaks I'd mostly stay with my dad and it was awkward for a while. I wasn't quite a guest and wasn't quite a resident anymore, but it also wasn't quite my house anymore, and the space became less and less familiar as time went on. Staying with mom was less awkward because I didn't have any memories associated with the apartment she rented.\n\nThis got kind of long but I hope something in there resonates with you.",

They\u2019re still together and doing well now, but it was a close call.",

I actually got off the phone with my dad last night (I'm a junior now) and he told me that wanted to leave around the time I was in middle school but he was seeing how my sister was acting in her teen years and so he didn't want to leave my mom with me bc he felt like I would've been a super rebellious teen if he wasn't present.\n\nHonestly I was glad that they split because they were always fighting and the miscommunication was getting on my nerves. Not to mention the relationship with my mother is much stronger too since she's the one I've been relying on emotionally to get through college. As for my dad, he's a whole state away with his girlfriend raising two young girls (Idk if the kids are his but at this point I'm too afraid to ask) and I'm lowkey ashamed to say this but I mostly contact him only when I need money or there's something wrong with my car.",

I hated being in my house and sobbed myself to sleep many nights.Nearly every night they screamed and threw things at one another. I hated having to listen to the same thing every night. I am a sensitive person and it hurt my heart hearing them hurt each other like that. At night, as I\u2019d listen, my heart would beat so fast, and I prayed and prayed that I wouldn\u2019t be forced to come downstairs and take sides and defend my mother, or be forced to say horrible things to my dad.\n\nIt was always so intense and dramatic and my parents were always screaming and saying the most horrible things they didn\u2019t care about shielding it from at all. I felt so afraid of them. I felt like I was in a kind of war zone. It never seemed to stop. And I had nowhere to go I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out most of the time. It was like living with two wild raging animals, I felt at any moment they might turn on me. \n\nI was so scared, all the time, I didn\u2019t know of what exactly, because I knew they wouldn\u2019t hurt me badly or kill each other, but the screaming and even mild violence (hitting, biting, throwing things etc.) made me feel so on edge. My dog would run away at any hint of conflict and I\u2019d comfort her in the corner just praying they\u2019d leave me alone.\n\nIt was like that almost everyday for some of middle school and all of high school. I don\u2019t remember it being like that before middle school. \n\nAnyway, my life has gotten so much better since they divorced. They sold the house and My mom (who didn\u2019t work) moved to another state after they split up, to live with her childhood best friend and her family. So when I came home my freshman year of college it was to another stare and we were living with another family in a really different part of the world (verrry rural) than I was used to. I didn\u2019t have any friends there and I didn\u2019t fit in and I didn\u2019t love being a guest in someone else\u2019s house for three years (that\u2019s how long we ended up staying) and always feeing obligated to be perfect and helpful and just go with the flow and give up my old urban lifestyle (they were a big conservative Christian family) because they were letting us live there for free! But it was a million times better than before the divorce. I am a lot more sensitive I think than most but I still have nightmares and can still remember the feeling of dread.",

Since I live at home and go to a local university because of costs and all that, I'm not impacted financially by their separation. At the very least, it makes financial aid very strange, as divorce isn't exactly separation and they're technically married in the government's eyes, especially since they file taxes jointly through a tax assessor, but I have to point out that my father does not contribute to our family's expenses.\n\nIt's strange that you mention that it happens when the last child heads off to college because I'm the last child in my family. Divorce is not an easy thing for anyone, and I disliked my father greatly for saying it was something between him and my mother, ignoring the effect on the family as a whole. Going back to how I dealt with it, I wasn't impacted by their separation (though my mother was. Greatly.), and perhaps this may be an outlier. At some point, I did feel like my father would have tried to go to my university to try and find me to talk, but I left those thoughts behind.",

      "text": "You are right. If you look up the Gottman longitudinal study on relationships, the 19-year mark is one of the two most common times for marriages to break up, because parents will often stay together for their children until they are out of the household.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience is that I cannot remember my parents ever being together. While they never let me see what they were like together, I know that it was not good, even when they lived together platonically and put on a good face for me. That it is better for them to not be together might be small comfort for you though. Dealing with family drama makes college a LOT harder in my experience. That's why I dropped out the first time, in part. The issue comes if they are involving you in their drama. You're going to have to put up boundaries and tell them something like \"I understand that you need to vent, but I'm not the right person to do that to.\" It is more harmful for children to hear their parents speak badly about one another than for parents to say bad things about the child to the child. So ask them to not speak badly about the other parent to you, and say they should speak to their friends instead. Boundaries are super important and healthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I would recommend is to find out if your college has mental health services and use them. The school therapist I had a few sessions with had wonderful advice that helped me get through college and work around my idiosyncrasies and despair. Join a study group (I did this via zoom), and meet every week (a couple of days after class having done the homework already, doing it early is the key here) to go over the material. Reach out to your professors to let them know you are going through some difficult times, and schedule a time to meet with them every week and go over the material if you can. Even if the meeting is just to say \"this is how I understood the work, is this correct?\" I know it sounds like extra work, but honestly doing this gave me more free time as I was able to not spend extra time stressing about work because I already knew I was doing everything I could.",

I had been doing a lot of the work around the house and keeping things going. As soon as I left the wheels went off the bus. Ours was UGLY....so so so bad. My mom ended up leaving the country, leaving behind my sister with my stepdad (her bio dad) even though that was...a bad call (prior sexual abuse to me at that same age). My brother ended up dropping out of high school and committed in a drug rehab/mental health facility after making death threats. My mom really bounced. It was just so bad. This was when I started counseling, seeing the therapist at the school every week. I had a choice. I could leave college (a first gen student, this was my one ticket out...) and go back to raising my siblings. Or I could commit to college. I committed to college. Graduated summa cum laude. Eventually got a PhD. I\u2019m no contact with either parent and my siblings are quite troubled in many ways (and neither got a college degree). But I think it was still the right call for my life. I do what I can for them now but had to realize back then (and continue to repeat to myself now) that I am not their parent and I can\u2019t be.",

I\u2019m an only child so I mostly rely on my aunt with these type of things but sometimes I still feel like I\u2019m stuck between them.\nI would suggest you to focus more on yourself, friendships and college and stay away from the \u201czone of conflict\u201d. My parents are very stressed and sometimes they take it out on me, but apologize right afterwards. It can be a delicate time so don\u2019t take anything too seriously.\nYou can\u2019t (most of the times) do anything to prevent this divorce and even though the process can be chaotic, it really is for the best. They wish you to be happy and you should wish the same for them too (which I think you already do) \nThings will get better overtime, dealing with big changes can be hard in the beginning but then you will look back and be glad it happened.",

Honestly it felt kinda weird at first because I'm the only person I know of in my friend group who has/ had divorced parents, or at least ones who divorced at such an age. \n\nHonestly now might be a good time to step up and flex as an adult a little bit. Assuming that it's at least somewhat amicable sit them down and talk about it. Ask them if they would both like to go and help move in, or if they'd rather one help move in and the other come visit later. If there's a list of things you need write it down and see if they want to split the list. No matter what, do not hold anything against either of them for what they do/ don't do right now - you're probably confused, and they're likely both fairly emotional right now even if they won't show it. If one would rather visit later after move-in, or can't contribute towards your supplies don't hold it against them. Divorces are ugly emotionally and financially even in the best of circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, since you're a freshman now's a good of a time as any other to take advantage of your school's resources. There's a good chance that your school has therapists, counselors, or even a psychiatrist - reach out to the school for information on those people and schedule a meeting even before you arrive. It's a good, unbiased and safe place to talk, ask questions and get anything off your chest that might be bothering you, or which you might not even realize is bothering you.\n\nI went a couple times my freshman year and there was a lot that I didn't realize I had held in for a long time and the counselors helped me through it. Very worth it.",

      "text": "Yes, very common. Many marriages agree to stick together \"until the kids move out/go off to college\". Most of these marriages have already failed years earlier but we as kids never paid attention or truly noticed the signs and most parents just mutually agree to tough it out until the kids are old enough to move out or go to college before starting divorce proceedings. It's incredibly common.",

          "text": "I am an only child and this happened to me. Sort of. My parents say they \u201cstayed together for me\u201d even though I begged and begged my mom to divorce my dad for years. I hated being in my house and sobbed myself to sleep many nights. Every night they screamed and threw things at one another and said the most terrible vulgar things I could imagine to one another. I hated having to listen to the same thing every night. I am a sensitive person and it hurt my heart hearing them hurt each other like that. At night as I\u2019d listen my heart would beat so fast, and I prayed and prayed that I wouldn\u2019t be forced to come downstairs and take sides and defend my mother or be forced to say horrible things to my dad.\n\nI hated growing up like that, always living in fear, every night my parents became raging animals and I felt at any moment they might turn on me. I was so scared, I didn\u2019t know of what, but I couldn\u2019t stand their screaming, my dog would run away at any hint of conflict and I\u2019d comfort her in the corner just praying they\u2019d leave me alone. \n\nIt was like that everyday for years. My life has gotten so much better since they divorced. Its sad when my mom tells me she tried to save the family and she\u2019s sorry she had to leave him because all I ever wanted was for them to be apart.",

It's something that's not talked about that much: while some children have to suffer through their parents unexpected divorce, others can't wait for their parents to divorce, because they've already had to experience for years their parents' suffering and rage.",

One way that it sucks is that I never got to go home and see my highschool friends as many of them went home to work for the summer.
