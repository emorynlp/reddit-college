  "text": "I\u2019m in the same boat as many of you - being offered the choice to return to living on campus, or stay an online student.\n\nGoing back to campus I...\n+ Have independence/freedom\n+ Get away from my family\n- Might end up in a tiny dorm room 80% of the time since we can\u2019t do much on campus now \n\nStaying home I...\n+ Save money\n+ Have a car and more places to escape to (not just a dorm room) \n- Have to be around my family constantly for another 3 months \n- FOMO and lack of socialization\n\nAny input is appreciated, I really dislike both options and don\u2019t know if either is a winner.\n\n\nEDIT: This really took off, I was expecting maybe one or two comments. Thank you guys for being a great community, really nice to read the comments and know none of us are alone.",

My parents told me that if I go back, that I would have to quarantine for two weeks before being near them again, which isn\u2019t doable with how short breaks are and all of the hassle we\u2019d go through cleaning if I\u2019m isolating at home. I\u2019m trying to figure out of the classes I\u2019m signed up for can be taken solely online, or if I am going to look at an online degree with the college or have to choose a different college. Just keeping my options open. Haven\u2019t put any money towards housing in the fall so currently I hold all the cards, which is nice. The way I see it, I\u2019ve been isolating for about 4 months. Half a year when school starts up. Do I really wanna live on campus and go to class, risking getting sick and make the last half year of my life a waste of time if I was just gonna get sick anyway? No. It may be the more difficult option, but I\u2019m going to do my best to stay home and avoid getting sick. From the stories I\u2019ve heard, even without the risk of death, it\u2019s just not worth it. It sounds like it\u2019s torture to live in and deal with. No thanks lol",

I absolutely support that the school would be putting new regulations and routines in place like logging your symptoms on an app and mandatory quarantining before going into dorms, etc. and tbh I think that its a pretty nice plan compared to other schools that I've heard of. I think I'd just rather be safer at home to worry about corona (since schools would have to regulate a large population of students that honestly just want to see each other and hang out) and studying at the same time but that's just me. Ultimately, going to campus just seemed like it would be me and my roommate in a dorm logging into zoom every single day when I'm more of the type of person to like a physical change in setting when it comes to school anyways. Honestly, I want to be around friends and other students as much as the next guy, but the risk of that second wave hitting and resulting in the school telling us to stay in our dorms or go home for another \"2-3 weeks\" really just doesn't look appealing. All of this plus the fact that I get to save ten grand on housing (not to mention meal plans too) really pushed me back home.",

Parties simply aren\u2019t happening this fall semester. \n\nAll in all it\u2019s your call, but bear in mind that you will not be getting the traditional college experience that you and/or your parents are paying a lot of money for. If you go, it\u2019ll be unlike what you\u2019re used to. If you stay remote, you won\u2019t be missing much.",

If will have a car, def use it to get out of your house and away from parents (I do this). If saving money is something important, stay home.\nAlso, we\u2019re still in a pandemic with no real cure at the moment. (I\u2019m assuming college is away from home town) God forbids this ever happens, but if you fall ill, taken to a urgent care or hospital, chances are if your out of your hometown, insurance might consider bills out of network and won\u2019t cover for much of the bill. That\u2019s one more bill you gotta worry about. \nAnyways, you\u2019ve seen to be getting a bit of advice from everyone, hope you were able to make a decision! :)",

So, most of her days would be spent in her dorm room, taking her classes online.  And she can do that just as easily at home, but save $6500 in room and board costs.\n\nThe deadline to choose was about a week ago and I asked her today whether she had any friends heading to campus for fall.  She said all of her friends that have only online classes are staying home.  She has one friend who has one of the few in-person classes (140-some classes were deemed necessary to be taught in-person by the different departments) and that is the only friend who will be on campus.\n\nSo, if you stay home and take your classes online, you won't be alone in doing so.\n\nAlso, speaking as a parent, I wish it was safe for my daughter to return to campus as much as she wants to go back.",

When I suspected I had one of those highly-contagious stomach bugs, I made my share-a-bathroom roommate use the other bathroom for a week to be safe and sanitized the bathroom thoroughly.\n\nSome of my work colleagues at one of my jobs did get sick shortly before I did though, and one got especially sick, so I might\u2019ve caught it from them.",

My college was fortunate enough to be able to make it so each student has their own dorm room (enrollment went down a few years ago so instead of  shutting down residence halls they gave every student their own room). Since that's going on where I am I feel its much safer BUT with places that have 2 students per room its going to turn into breeding grounds. I imagine places will kept clean and mask rules will be followed for the first few weeks but then people will grow tired and begin to follow the rules less strictly.

We are returning a week earlier than usual though in order to help clean our floors common areas and do some extra training. We're required to do some training on kicking out guest since residence halls aren't allowing guest of any type after move in is over. We also have to work on planning activities without breaking the covid guidelines (I'm thinking a make your own tye-dye mask / other types of designs for the first event). The usual move-in days are Friday and Saturday with a few people on Sunday but now Move-in days start on Wednesday and last until Sunday so there's a lot of work thats going to go into that. Then there's training on what to do if someone on our floor catches covid... as for that we've been left 100% in the dark as to what the plans are but I'm sure they'll give us a plan once we come back. Basically it's theres been no cuts but a lot more work for us to do but I'm looking forward to it and trying to remain optimistic",

Luckily, our incoming freshman class (most non-freshman live off campus) is relatively small. \n\nWhat I'm hoping is that we're going to start enforcing serious fines for masks and visitors, we're not going to be doing in-person programs, and they're just going to lock the door to the lobby. Unfortunately, I doubt any of that will happen. \n\nGood luck, fellow RA's",

Greek life parties are a prime example. It's going to be March/April all over again with the sudden closure of dorms, scrambling to find a place to live, and stress of relocating. Especially for foreign students. If you're going to a small college with a mask mandate, very small class sizes, and intensive virus prevention measures, I think you would be fine living in a dorm. Honestly, it depends on if your college would allow small populations to remain in the dorm or not. If you think they are the type to take a heavy-handed approach and send everyone home, I think it would be best to save yourself the trouble and stay home.",

If I didn't have the money to be living on my own or where it made a strain on me then I probably would go live with my family then.\n\nI wouldn't go back to dorms though if that were my option, doesn't seem safe. When I was with my family I slowly found ways to connect with my network. That may be a better option for you to stay with family and find ways to connect with friends online. I do watch parties with friends for movies and random yt videos. Call them and catch up, hang out over the phone/video call to laugh over posts.",

I don\u2019t work. So we\u2019re not interacting with too many people. \n\nBut with the dorms, you have roommates and whoever they bring over, plus neighbors in close proximity. It seems like there\u2019s more chances for you to get the virus. I would stay home if I were you, both for your money and your health. It\u2019s only a few months, too.",

It\u2019s significantly less risky for me to live with my 3 friends who are all healthy 20 year olds. Also depends on how much that 3K means to you.
