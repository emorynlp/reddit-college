  "text": "Hello, my name is Crystal Fields, and I am an honors student at Georgia Southern University. I am currently in the process of collecting data for my honors thesis titled *The impacts of socio-demographics on sport preference*. The purpose of this study is to see which constraints affect sports participation the most in adolescents, how sociodemographic factors impact the type of sports adolescents choose to play, and if sport preferences change as adolescents enter adulthood. To collect the data needed for my research, I am conducting a survey where those who are 20-25 years of age are welcomed to participate. I would appreciate it if those who are willing to be a part of my honors thesis complete the survey that is found here [https://georgiasouthern.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_0qV3m66RVY4bPO6](https://georgiasouthern.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0qV3m66RVY4bPO6). I understand that I am asking you to recollect your previous background at one point of the survey. I ask that you be as honest as possible with these answers to improve the quality of my research findings. If you choose to participate, your identity will be kept confidential. Thank you all for your time!",
