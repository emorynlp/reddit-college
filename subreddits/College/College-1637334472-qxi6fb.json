  "title:": "Journalism Student Seeking To Understand Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)",
  "text": "Greetings,\n\n I\u2019m a university journalism student, who is currently in the process of writing an article based around seasonal affective disorder. With this piece, I\u2019m trying to acquire a better understanding, while also expressing a narrative of a **student** that battles with SAD. I'm having trouble finding a first-person account, so I thought I would post on this subreddit to see if any student was available to tell their story. Ideally, I\u2019d like to include the perspective of a college student, either undergrad or graduate. I can tell you that I take mental health very seriously and understand that this is a personal topic, so please feel free to reply down below, or **message me directly**, only if you are comfortable. I\u2019ll be checking this post regularly and reaching out to the some who are interested in being interviewed, through direct message. Thanks.",
