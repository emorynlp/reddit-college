  "text": "I'm graduating this semester and I need to take this class in order to do so. Yesterday, my professor assigned us two big projects and 2 homework assignments due on Monday. In addition, I have two large projects due on Tuesday for another course. Do you think it would be crazy to ask for an extension for at least one of the large projects since I already have so much to do? I've started on the homework and three of the large projects but feel like I'm rushing them because my professor just gave us so much new material to work on. What do you suggest doing?",

      "text": "I would ask your peers what they think. College is all about time management, but as a senior, I'm well aware there are some profs who think their class is the only one/the most important.\n\nSome of your peers may agree that there's just too much work at one time, so perhaps you all can go *together* to office hours and ask for an extension. Your prof will be more understanding if more people ask for an extension. It's not crazy at all, and you have nothing to lose.",
