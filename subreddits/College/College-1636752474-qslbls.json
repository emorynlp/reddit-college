  "text": "okay so im retaking my chem class next semester. i handed in work and did my best but failed a test horribly and was never able to recover my grade. \n\nthe professor is very intelligent but he doesn't do the best at actually explaining material. like he knows it but he's not that good at laying it out. i just bought the textbook for the class and i plan on studying it over winter break and teaching myself the fundamentals and some extra stuff so i have a solid foundation for next semester (this was my first ever chem class)\n\nthere's another professor who teaches the same course and ive been told that he has a different teaching style and my friend said i should try registering for his course instead.\n\nso here's my question: do i repeat with the same professor since i already know what to expect from him + i have the textbook for his class and can approach the course better or do i take a gamble on this other professor?",
