  "text": "ok i\u2019m a freshman attending a very big, public, research school.\n\ni\u2019m in the pre-nursing major and have to wait until until winter 2023 to apply to the actual nursing major. my school in notoriously horrible about major admissions and the chance that i\u2019ll even get into the nursing school is less than 8 percent.\n\nhowever getting into the nursing school isn\u2019t what\u2019s bothering me. it\u2019s that i know i will be a horrible nurse. i have hyperhidrosis so i have the sweatiest palms on planet earth and i\u2019m just a generally slow person with little motor skills or hand coordination. on top of that i have little confidence in myself and i have no idea how i\u2019ll insert iv\u2019s or catheters, etc.\n\ni\u2019ve worked as a nurse assistant briefly over the summer and i absolutely love caring for people, but deep down i feel like i\u2019m going to be horrible at this.\n\nto sum it up, im not sure whether i should change my major and focus on getting an office job outside of medicine, or sticking to nursing and seeing where it takes me.\n\nmy family is sick of my bimonthly panic attacks over my future and they tell me to stop being so anxious but none of them have studied stem  or work in the medical field so they don\u2019t really understand.\n\ni would just really like some advice about where to go from here.",

Very few people have \"hands\" and are just good at all of that from the get go.\n\nDo as much practical work and volunteering a you can in different things to see what you like.",

I teach med students - some of them love trauma and ER rotations (the adrenaline junkies, lol) ad some of them like less war zone atmospheres.  \n\nAnd look at all the other people around you there - there are speech pathologists and social workers and hospital admin etc \n\nTalk to those people as much as possible and find out what they like and don't lie and what their day is like.",
