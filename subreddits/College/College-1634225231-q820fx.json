  "text": "Im an 18 year old girl. Do I bring my own alcohol? Is it rude to just show up and drink their alcohol without bringing any of my own? It's not a huge frat party or anything like that, 2 friends of my friend are hosting it. Does that change anything? And how should I keep myself safe? Should I bring something entertaining over (like a drinking game) or is that stupid/something that people will judge? My guess is there will be around 15-ish people, maybe a little more, if that context matters.",

Bring chips or popcorn too!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo stay safe, drink a coke, eat snacks, then drink 1 beer... repeat.  Alternate beer with non-alcoholic drinks.  Hold you beer can in your hand at all times... in front of you is best. If you want to dance, finish your drink first, throw away the can in the recycles... then enjoy.  ( Don't accept an open drink or drink in a glass from anyone.  You open your own beer can!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalk back to the dorms with a friend; or call the campus ride service.  Enjoy and glad you asked!",

      "text": "agree w just ask the hosts on what to bring. \n\nas for keep self save, obv walk home with someone and if your drink leaves your sight, get a new one. also always pour your own or if you dont, make sure to watch someone pour yours from start to finish (ideally as physically close as possible to them). don\u2019t be afraid to say less alcohol if you want. \n\ni actually have my own starbucks cup i bring to parties so i know exactly what cup is mine, as well is it has a screw on lid and straw so its harder for someone to put anything into it without me seeing somehow. but hopefully since your friends are hosting, the crowd should be decent. but always better to stay extra cautious than not. \n\nand drink lots of water!!!! ideally at least a 1:1 ratio of drinks:water per hour.",
