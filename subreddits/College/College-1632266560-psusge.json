I had to take an exam 2 days after I got back busting my ass off to try to get caught up to get a 61% on it and it counting as a Non Proficient grade as a grade in my Calc I class. I am currently stressed over all the work that I have to do. I am doing fine in my other classes (passing) but I am worried about my grades this semester if I will make it or not. Any tips or advice on my current situation to help me out?", "author": "yutize", "created": 1632266560, "retrieved": 1632946614, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdsb7te": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psusge/doing_bad_1st_semester/hdsb7te/", "text": "learn the material and shoot for an 80 ish on your following exams to pass and get the same peice of paper as everyone else who got 4.0s", "author": "bigzim420", "created": 1632270285, "upvotes": 1}}}
