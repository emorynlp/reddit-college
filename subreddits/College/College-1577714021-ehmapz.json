  "title:": "What started the American college \"tradition\" of having shared 2 person college dorms?",
  "text": "Many countries like the UK and Australia mainly have 1 person dorms and they think making students share dorms with other students (who they probably don't know) is extremely strange. So how did the US normalize 2 person college dorms? Who started this common US college practice that many Americans now call a college tradition?",

      "text": "It's because the aims of American universities are very different from the rest of the world. The USP of university in the US is that the college experience doesn't stop at the classroom. \n\nUniversities practise holistic admissions that factor in individual personalities. In the classroom, liberal arts requirements encourage students to explore outside their own field and promote intellectual diversity. Outside the classroom, too, there are individually-driven learning opportunities like extracurricular clubs, internships, and research. The social aspects of student life are shaped by the university as well, through things like college sports culture and Greek life. And it doesn't stop at graduation, even, thanks to alumni networks. \n\nUniversities in America don't just want to teach students the course material, but encourage their humanistic development in certain ways. You may make arguments as to how effective this is or how it arises from impure, capitalistic motivations, but that's not my point. I'm simply explaining that the concept of college in the US is to put students through a certain kind of overall experience, while reserving my own judgements.",

The book doesn't dive into this particular living arrangement deeply, but does mention that it was common for young men in families to sleep in the same room while they were growing up in the colonial United States, suggesting that this arrangement may have been adopted by Harvard to reflect familiar living spaces.\n\nColleges and universities likely copied this for awhile as it was preferential, and have maintained it over the years because it has become a social norm in the United States and (at least in thought) offers a more economical living arrangement.",

So the school has a high self image and charges accordingly while the surrounding town maintains less absurd pricing. Out in west Texas, dorm prices are competitive but why live in a cramped 2 bed/1 bath with no yard or garage for the same price... TU is similar in Austin. There are rental homes in downtown Austin that are ridiculously priced for only offering 1000 sq. ft. for a 3 bed/2 bath. Or you can go another 10 minutes away and find a 1500 sq. ft. 2 bed/2 bath for a better price.\n\nAnd if you try to find a rental house outside of the summer time, you can sometimes find them even cheaper because no one wants to own an empty rental home.",

Additionally, universities have to increase their prestige via research and as a result have to hire many grad students which is also expensive. Also universities increasingly market themselves to potential students to up their applications and get more competitive applicants to increase prestige things like a new rec center or better cafeterias are more expensive but they gets students to apply. \n\nSo no tuitions costs are not going up cause every universities is owned by money grubbing bastards but instead due to many different changing circumstance in regard to how people apply to uni and how prestige acts as the main incentive for them",
