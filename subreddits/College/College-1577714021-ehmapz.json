The USP of university in the US is that the college experience doesn't stop at the classroom. \n\nUniversities practise holistic admissions that factor in individual personalities. In the classroom, liberal arts requirements encourage students to explore outside their own field and promote intellectual diversity. Outside the classroom, too, there are individually-driven learning opportunities like extracurricular clubs, internships, and research. The social aspects of student life are shaped by the university as well, through things like college sports culture and Greek life. And it doesn't stop at graduation, even, thanks to alumni networks. \n\nUniversities in America don't just want to teach students the course material, but encourage their humanistic development in certain ways. You may make arguments as to how effective this is or how it arises from impure, capitalistic motivations, but that's not my point. I'm simply explaining that the concept of college in the US is to put students through a certain kind of overall experience, while reserving my own judgements.", "author": "gkkiller", "created": 1577788797, "upvotes": 2}, "fcmlv13": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ehmapz/what_started_the_american_college_tradition_of/fcmlv13/", "text": "In Greece we have only one-person dormrooms which are only for the less fortunate students so they are free.
