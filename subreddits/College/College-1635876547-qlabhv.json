  "title:": "I am beginning to get stressed and overwhelmed trying to maintain a 4.0 GPA anyone else experience this?",
  "text": "So as the title says I have a 4.0 GPA, I\u2019m a junior and set to graduate in the fall of 2022. I currently have all A\u2019s in my classes but it\u2019s beginning to be mentally exhausting, I\u2019m losing sleep and it\u2019s just stressful. I am currently taking a math class which I hate math. After which I have to take 3 sets of classes that stack on each other, which means if I take a summer class I can graduate next fall. The last 3 psych classes are the hardest classes of my major. So thinking of that is also stressful. I want to maintain a 4.0 but is it worth the stress? I want to be competitive for grad school. I would also like to not have a mental breakdown attempting to do so though.. any thoughts are appreciated!",

      "text": "GPA is a requirement for grad school, but it isn\u2019t the most important. I would argue research, volunteer and/or work experience related to your program of interest are more important. When you go to grad school and you decide to go the thesis route you are expected to conduct your own research. The program is looking for your potential in carrying out research. Writing skills and research skills are crucial. Aside from grades, you also want to build strong relationships with professors who could be potential references. From your course history it is clear you excel at dealing with the content in your field, but it is time to develop other areas.",
