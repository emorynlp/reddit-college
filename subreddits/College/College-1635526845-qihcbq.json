  "text": "Hello all, with permission from the moderators I am conducting a survey for my senior class on how aware college students are of their posture and their posture habits. No personal information will be collected, all responses are anonymous. The survey should take about 10 minutes and there is no incentive for taking it other than helping a student and my thanks. \n\nAll college students 18 and older can participate.\n\n[https://forms.gle/EJm9PzEDCFaLBeZD7](https://forms.gle/EJm9PzEDCFaLBeZD7)",
