  "text": "I am from one of the well known Engineering colleges. First year went by I partied, got high, wasted most of my time. My grades were really low, didn't really had many close friends. I wasted my freshman year. \n\nThen covid happened, I was back home, online classes, I did not get in any of the technical clubs in college, couldn't do any project, I have below average grades, no friends in college, nothing to show on my resume. And yeah no internship for the summer. I feel like everyone is getting ahead in college. \n\nIts not like I'm dumb either, I have a good logical mind and can grasp complex concepts  easily.\nI understand I need to work hard, but I'm stuck with a major I don't love, no friends, no network. I don't have anything worthwhile to put on my resume, so I can't apply really for any internships or anything.\n\n When I start getting on track I start studying everything, finance, maths, CS (all the things I am interested in and none of them are my major) and it gets back to the old situation soon after.\n\nI am clueless, what do I do?\n\nEdit-\n\nA lot of you have been mentioning about changing my Major, that is out of the picture as my uni doesn't allow that.",

      "text": "This sounds like a lot of excuses and not a lot of solutions. Get up, dust off, and get back at it. Your grades are a direct reflection of how much effort you put in. It has nothing to do with intelligence. You just need to make a schedule or some sort of system to better spend your time. For lack of friends we have all been there but thankfully there is a simple solution. Get involved! Talk more in groupmes, join a club or org, join greek and be apart of the campus life. Even if you can only attend virtually you can still make friends. This is your life and college is the same as everything else, it\u2019s what you make of it.",

Similarly, one of my friends had a 1.25 coming out of freshman year and is now preparing to graduate only a semester late (after failing 13 hours of classes)\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s all totally applicable to you, but you can get through this. I\u2019d love to DM if you want any kind of supportive outlook on this. Sophomore year is still a learning stage as far as I\u2019m concerned :)",

      "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore too. I can definitely related to some of this. Freshmen year feels like a long lost dream compared to how shit sophomore year has been due to the pandemic. I used to love school and now it feels like it\u2019s only purpose is to take away my happiness. I feel like the business in colleges has really taken over during the pandemic and it\u2019s become obvious that quality education is not a priority. I like my major but I hate the way my school teaches it. Ultimately I am stuck as well. I can\u2019t afford to transfer to a better school and this is the best fitting major for me at this school.\n\nI\u2019ve been coping recently by finding a group online that shares my interests. I\u2019m in design and I found a design discord and made some really good friends through there. They\u2019re from all over and all ages but it\u2019s a good place to go to and vent about school and then get support for learning on my own (since my degree barely covers half of what I want to learn). Hanging out in the chat feels like what college was supposed to be if we could socialize on campus. I\u2019m not really sure how I\u2019m going to last another two years but I\u2019m glad I have a group that I found. Hopefully you can find yours too!",

I was so depressed. Every day was a battle, I took one anthropology class and that was literally the only thing I had the will to get out of bed for.I had a literal 1.1 GPA I was failing so many classes. The next semester I had one design class, and I genuinely loved it, even through I still had zero motivation and excitement for living. One of the guest lecturers noticed how incredibly depressed I was, and how I seemed to only light up once the lecture started. She talked to me after about the department I was in and the department she was an advisor for, and she told me that my happiness and excitement for life are more important than my income. \n\nI transferred out and now I am in such a small design field everyone knows my professors, I'm in one of 15 accredited programs in the entire US, and my post-uni outlook is maybe 30k a year at the start. I have to pay for my certification exams too, they aren't provided by the school for free. 200% would do again! \n\nIf you're unhappy in engineering, then get out! There's so many engineers already in the job market. And finance is incredibly well paying! CS is incredibly well paying! CS is actually a better field to enter right now than engineering! \n\nYour happiness and excitement for life are MUCH more important than your income.",

It\u2019s good that you have an idea of your interests and career paths even if they aren\u2019t your major, some people don\u2019t realize their degree is the wrong fit until their last year or after graduation, so Id say you\u2019re in a good spot. \n\nIt seems like you got the hard partying out of your system, and have a better idea of how to manage your time, it\u2019s better to stay in school because often motivation is lost after a gap year. \n\nThis Summer I would reach out to the department chairs if programs you\u2019re interested in, after you look up the course requirements ask what kind of internships are usually required, and if the program requires grad school for a stable career. Ideally you can combine the courses you\u2019ve already taken with some Summer or winter course to be finished only one year later than expected. Less than half of students who start college finish in four years at the school they started at, and as someone who barely finished a degree in time last year, I now realize switching fields and taking some extra time would\u2019ve been a better solution.",

Your lack of motivation to complete your assignments, feeling the need to party excessively, and feeling disconnected from others. Did you have these issues before you entered college? Sometimes the structure created in high school or by our parents makes it easier for us to function in life. When we get out on our own it can be depressing or anxiety inducing because we have to create our own structure and the stakes are very high. When you have to pay bills, make good grades, and 100% responsible for your own chores and career, it can be overwhelming. Sometimes you just want to give up. It also doesn't help if you're stuck in a major you don't like. \n\nI think you should take this upcoming break to work through these issues with a mental health professional and talking with friends/family members who are also in college. Feeling unmotivated and lonely will not stop once you leave college so it's better to get a handle on it now. I hope that things get better for you.",

                  "text": "IDK how OPs University works but at mine you're not allowed to change your major after you start Junior year, and many of the colleges require certain pre-requisite classes to just be eligible to apply for transfer. If you haven't already completed those classes and you're at the very end of sophomore year, you're basically stuck in your major (since you apply at the end of the freshman or sophomore year for acceptance the following year). Also for some colleges (business, engineering, nursing etc.) you have to have a certain GPA and good extracurriculars or you won't be accepted to that major since its really competitive. For instance when I transfered to the business school I had to have already taken Macro & Micro economics, Calculus 1 and Calculus 2, have a 3.7 GPA, and extracurriculars. \n\nA few years ago when my sister was at the same University you were allowed to change your major whenever you wanted, but they recently changed it so you can only apply to change your major Freshman or Sophomore year in order to keep their 4-year graduation rates high, since people who change their major Junior or Senior year will likely end up staying a few extra years. I guess it helps with their rankings.",

Like using my example for transfering to the business school, you can't take Calc 1 and Calc 2 at the same time, you need 2 semesters worth of taking those prerequisites so you had to have known you wanted to transfer by at the very least before your fall semester of sophomore year so you could take Calc 1 fall of sophomore year and Calc 2 spring of sophomore year. \n\nYou apply to transfer at the end of sophomore year and if you get accepted you can start your new major at the beginning of junior year or you are stuck in your current major. At this point it's too late to take any pre-requisite classes. Not to mention whatever major you want to transfer to would be looking for extracurriculars related to that major (like business organizations) and it's too late to join those now, unfortunately.",

People may think you\u2019re a \u201cbetter fit\u201d for engineering or whatever but you should do something you won\u2019t end up resenting later. You could also talk to someone in a department you\u2019re interested in like finance and see if they have any advice. Usually you\u2019ll find that you do better in classes you enjoy vs. those you don\u2019t, so if you can put in the work and get good grades in those classes then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to make up for your freshmen year.

Psychology is the number one major for people to \\*not\\* be employed in their field after graduation.\n2. Any job worth having in psychology requires an advanced degree. Seriously. \n\nThere are some \"outside the box\" things you can do with psychology, but almost all of them require a double major in something else. \n\nMy husband was 10 years out of school making $28k when we met. Fortunately, he went back to school and got his MBA (he didn't want to go into social work or counseling). He now makes 3x what he made before going back to grad school. \n\nJust something to be aware of. He worked at a care home for children with behavioral issues as a \"counselor\" and made 28k, had to work horrendous hours, and when we got married they tried to tell him he couldn't take a whole week off. It was ludicrous. That was pretty much par for all the similar jobs he was eligible for with just a psych major. \n\nNow he says, \"Friends don't let friends major in psych unless they plan to go to grad school.\"",
