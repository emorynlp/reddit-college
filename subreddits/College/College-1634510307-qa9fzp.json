I can\u2019t make any good advice but try talking to your classmates like the person sitting next to you. I talk to them mostly about homework tho but at least you can talk to somebody.",

My high school was screwed up because of Covid. It\u2019s so hard because all my friends in high school went off to university and I\u2019m in college.",

      "text": "Join a club or two. Go to study groups whether you need help or not. Ask a classmate who seems like a kind person if he or she would like to study with you. If you\u2019re especially good in a subject or have a special skill, offer to help or tutor other students. If you see someone else who seems to be lonely or struggling, introduce yourself and strike up a conversation (don\u2019t be creepy \ud83d\ude01). Keep in mind that there are many students who feel just like you!",
