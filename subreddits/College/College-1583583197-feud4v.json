I just am generally sad and empty, and I get my work done but I\u2019m just scraping by and as an engineering student, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to do it.

It's suppose to be hard. Its a new experience and during the second year the shiny novelty has worn off but the bureaucracy has worn in. College is the grinding stress that shows you the worst side of yourself and puts you in a position to do something about it. \n\nTen years ago I did nothing. Went for an easy associates and dropped out when I ran out of money. I sought no help and moved to my home state. Now I've had a decade of amazing adventures working for minimum wage and barely surviving. At 31 I'm back in school and kicking ass because all of the growing you are experiencing took place for me in dangerous neighborhoods and living by my wits. College is still hard now. Statics is rediculous. All I want is to get to zero! Why is that hard! But it is.\n\nYou are going to go through many of the steps I did but maybe you will finish it like I didn't the first time. You have the choice to persist and win or find a different path. That's your choice. You are an adult and that is your right. From the older folks I'm in classes with and myself I suggest persistence. In the long run you come out with a piece of paper that gets you through the hr bots grinder. Also talk to your professors and network. Those are both hard things to do but they will get you further than a 4.0.\n\nCheers, we're all pulling for ya.", "author": "EngorgiaMassif", "created": 1583875683, "upvotes": 1}, "fjww9cs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/feud4v/just_feel_like_a_failure_and_like_college_is/fjww9cs/", "text": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re struggling.
