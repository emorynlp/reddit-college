  "title:": "Just feel like a failure and like college is bringing the worst out of me. How do I get better?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve a sophomore in college, and although I\u2019ve sort of found my place, I still don\u2019t have really any solid friends from college and they all feel very artificial. I\u2019m cool with a lot of people it\u2019s just that we won\u2019t hangout outside since I commute and I\u2019m just at a dis connection.\n\nNevertheless I\u2019ve been going out more, drinking more, and today I drank a little too much, felt sloppy and messy, and got into a little scuffle with a friend. I just am generally sad and empty, and I get my work done but I\u2019m just scraping by and as an engineering student, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to do it. I guess in asking how do I just turn my life around for the better and take school more seriously. I\u2019m probably doing pretty shit in some of my classes right now, but have a meh gpa, but I\u2019m not failing out.",

      "text": "Hey I'm super late to the party but consider this. It's suppose to be hard. Its a new experience and during the second year the shiny novelty has worn off but the bureaucracy has worn in. College is the grinding stress that shows you the worst side of yourself and puts you in a position to do something about it. \n\nTen years ago I did nothing. Went for an easy associates and dropped out when I ran out of money. I sought no help and moved to my home state. Now I've had a decade of amazing adventures working for minimum wage and barely surviving. At 31 I'm back in school and kicking ass because all of the growing you are experiencing took place for me in dangerous neighborhoods and living by my wits. College is still hard now. Statics is rediculous. All I want is to get to zero! Why is that hard! But it is.\n\nYou are going to go through many of the steps I did but maybe you will finish it like I didn't the first time. You have the choice to persist and win or find a different path. That's your choice. You are an adult and that is your right. From the older folks I'm in classes with and myself I suggest persistence. In the long run you come out with a piece of paper that gets you through the hr bots grinder. Also talk to your professors and network. Those are both hard things to do but they will get you further than a 4.0.\n\nCheers, we're all pulling for ya.",

In fact, the social groups I\u2019ve been a part of have led to a lot of drama and tears and hurt feelings, some of which is my fault and some of which falls on other people. I also find academics to be very draining and even discouraging at times. I get the sense, though, that to be a college student means to always feel like your life is a mess. It\u2019s a turbulent time with a lot going on. Try to keep your spirits up and don\u2019t sweat the small things. Remember the bigger picture and don\u2019t forget self-care! \n\nSincerely, \n \nA college student who is bad at all the things he suggested you do (lol)",

I ended up with MDD and I drink a lot more now, and I\u2019m a sophomore too. A lot of stuff is changing. I feel like people think the change is freshman year but it\u2019s actually sophomore year when things get shaken up. I would just keep going to classes and spending time with your friends. Maybe visit the counseling center on campus and have a chat for a bit. But what you\u2019re feeling is normal and there are lots of people feeling the same way everywhere.",

              "text": "Not gonna lie, sounds like depression. And while self medicating with weed and alcohol is probably easiest, it\u2019s not healthy. My absolute highest suggestion would be to talk to your doctor about seeing a therapist. It wouldn\u2019t have to be forever, or even super often. But learning healthy coping skills would really help. Maybe find something productive to do, like writing, or art, or going to the gym. Another thing you could do, and it depends on how your relationship with your roomies or friends are, but let people know how you\u2019re feeling. Once I told my roommates I was feeling like crap they made the effort to make me get out of bed and go out more. For months all I did was sit in my bed thinking \u201cthis is how I cope. I need to relax\u201d and my bed went from being a coping tool to a place for my depression to fester. So just try to go out and find new places to chill out. Mix up your routine as much as possible. But I highly suggest looking into therapy.",

If there's a particular group of people you like hanging out with maybe just try to hang out with them a bit more. It's not just the partying but like having coffee and lunch together day after day and watching the latest episode of a show together it something like that is just as important for building that bond.\n\nGood luck mate, hope you find what you're looking for.",

I graduated 3 years ago and I'm still trying to figure my shit out. There's a thing Jordan Peterson's hot on his website too called the Self-Authoring and Future-Authoring program, I haven't done it yet but it's literally designed to help you figure out what you want to do with your life. I'm planning on doing it next week or maybe the week after. Maybe look into it if you like the book, it's pretty affordable and sounds interesting.",

Ask what restaurants people like to go to, go get coffee before/after a class, see if they wanna study for a test, etc. Junior year and senior year it gets better because you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of familiar faces in smaller class sizes. Eventually your labs and capstone will be filled with the same 30 people or so. \n\nAnd, if you\u2019re really bored, you can do what I did and go get an Australian Shepherd and have a furry best friend that will love nothing more than to go anywhere and everywhere with you.",
