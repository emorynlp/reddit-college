It's just such a complex area with massive amounts of information. This class gave me much respect for people who work in cybersec.

The religious motives that inspired the school\u2019s foundress Mary Lyon. The methods of fundraising and student chores that made MHC financially accessible to more women. Prayer closets. Race relations and how a northern school (and basically everything else tbh) is somehow connected to slavery in how money invested was earned. PE, rational dress, and concerns about fertility and education. Missionary training and narratives shared in magazines of the day. Lives of early Black students. Lesbian suffragettes being awesome. Ceremonies and revelry on mountaintops.\n\n(p.s. I basically feel like I just inadvertently typed out a decent chunk of the syllabus but with less organization)",
