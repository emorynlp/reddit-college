I like to make 2 to-do lists. The first one has all the big things I'd like to get done over the day, and the second one is full of every little step for those projects and other small tasks.

Even if my classes are asynchronous I do work for that class at a set time (like a regular class lecture). This helps me avoid procrastinating work for that class\n\n3.

I also love planner stickers and colored pens. The stickers help things be more obvious on my planner/calendar.\n\nEach subject in school/ area of my life has a color attached to it that I use on my planner/calendar. For example, if I have a meeting or appointment, it\u2019s written in brown on my planner and calendar. Work is in red, church is in pink, etc. \n\nI make lists each day of all of my assignments that are due soon in my planner. I use the course catalog numbers instead of the names (for example ACLL 101 instead of \u201cLatin I\u201d).Each of these courses is a different color. For example, that course is light green. \n\nEach big assignment for courses has their due date written in the \u201ccourse color\u201d on my calendar for both my desk calendar and my planner calendar (I have 2 separate calendars). I take these directly from the syllabus as soon as I get it. I also do ALL assignments in the syllabus, even if they aren\u2019t necessarily \u201cgraded\u201d. I feel like this is important for understanding the material.\n\nI write down all the important information from the academic calendar on my schools website onto my own calendars in its own color, such as the date when registration opens and the last day to drop without receiving a W.\n\nI use Outlook calendars as well to keep track of all my appts and zoom classes. This has been especially helpful because you can schedule zoom meetings straight from the appointment box. Plus I color code that as well. \n\nI create alarms for right before something is about to begin (ex. An alarm for 5 minutes before a zoom class begins, or even earlier than that if I need to make coffee or do something beforehand)\n\nI keep a strict sleep schedule during the semester, taking required medications at specific times (I have alarms for them), going to bed at 11:30, and getting up between 7 and 8 depending on how tired I am and how busy the day is.\n\nI drink water and take breaks!!!!!!!! So important. I struggle with mental health issues and if I\u2019m dehydrated it makes it 1000x worse. I also get burnt out so taking breaks is important.\n\nWell this is the main things I have and how I succeeded last semester. The color coding is probably the most important thing that I learned after going online last semester. It really helped out.

You can open an account for free and you can create tasks to check off for literally every assignment for every class. \nWhat I did was create a project page for each class and in it I would literally just put in every assignment as tasks and put in it\u2019s due date. I separated those assignments in week and everyday I would just go down the list until the semester was over. Such a good way to visualize and make sure you aren\u2019t missing any assignments. \nAsana will also give you a daily emails on what due each day as well as reminders of when things are due. It was truly a god-send for my summer classes because I was able to check of assignments for each week. Will definitely be using it for the fall and recommend anyone to use it.

You can create subtasks on it as well. My University posts Assignments onto Canvas which I can then \u201csubscribe\u201d to on the TickTick app so that it loads in all the assignments due dates for my classes automatically on my phone.\n\nI also use an old-school physical calendar on the wall too.", "author": "JonathanL73", "created": 1597696929, "upvotes": 3}, "g1wlqfh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wlqfh/", "text": "i basically do what you do, when i get assignments i put them in a little sticky note on my desktop with the due dates, even if they aren\u2019t due for a while. i separate assignments and exams. i use the sticky note app that\u2019s built in on macs. then every day i go into the notes app and write down everything i need to do and schedule a time for it, and i try to give myself more time than i need just in case. if i don\u2019t finish everything that\u2019s okay, i\u2019ll just add it onto the next day. also for big assignments i\u2019ll sometimes make a separate note planning out how much i\u2019m gonna work on it each day. i\u2019ve been doing this for 3 years now (i was super unorganized in high school lmao) and my it\u2019s helped me not forget things. plus i\u2019ve noticed keeping a note that syncs with my phone and computer and everything makes me more likely to keep up with it because i\u2019m way too lazy to take a planner out of my backpack and look at it. also my online classes seem to have a lot of assignments for the week written out in paragraphs, so whenever i get those i will simplify it into short questions on a piece of paper like it\u2019s a worksheet. it especially helps for discussion boards and writing assignments. this just helps it look less intimidating and helps me not leave anything out by mistake. also, if you have to use a few different videos and articles for an assignment write the notes for each one in a different color in case you have to cite it later", "author": "lasagnaisgreat57", "created": 1597695967, "upvotes": 3}, "g1wljz9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wljz9/", "text": "Imagine not being a professional level introvert", "author": "SpyFromtf2_but_again", "created": 1597695904, "upvotes": 13}, "g1wjcwl": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wjcwl/", "text": "take a shower, get dressed, and act like you are going to actual class", "author": "lnflnlty", "created": 1597695156, "upvotes": 25}, "g1wik9p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wik9p/", "text": "Create a work zone at home!

I don't have friends so I go to discord servers that are dedicated to studying together. What has helped me the most is screen sharing, although you do have to be careful with sensitive information. That's why I use my TV as a second monitor to drag things on there and share my screen without worrying too much about the info on it. But there are also people who turn on their cameras, and they'll either have it recording their face or desk.\n\n2. **APPBLOCKERS**\n\nI'm good with routines but not if my phone is filled with distracting apps. I'll most likely delete them when school starts. But I love Reddit so instead I download an app blocker called AppBlock. There are more but this one has been the best for me. There is also Forest, but honestly, at the beginning, I could care less for a virtual tree dying. Now, however, I enjoy growing my own little trees with people on the discord servers. The apps are free to download but they do have a pro version and it's not that costly (they are worth the money.) I believe that on both apps it's a one-time payment. (I use Android btw)\n\n3.**WEBSITE BLOCKERS** \n\nNow that my phone is useless for distractions my laptop is still filled with distracting websites. I personally love LeechBlock! It is completely free and on Firefox and Chrome. It is almost like AppBlock but for your PC.\n\n4.**PROMODORO**\n\nPromodoro is when you study for a certain amount of minutes and relax for a couple after that. I personally like doing 50 minutes of work and then 10 minutes of rest. There are so many ways to do it. I also saw this girl begin with fifteen minutes of studying every day and then she went to normal time like 50/10. My favorite app to do this is Focusmeter; it's completely free. You can personalize the alarms, the times, and make multiple promodoros, and it tells you how many minutes you've studied. I love it! \n\n5.**BINAURAL BEATS**\n\nI know sometimes it can be very difficult to get started on homework; so, I like listening to binaural beats, but careful because apparently some are for beginners. I've seen that it is very effective. I recommend [Jody Hatton's Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqKQACO4HAk&t=68s) (don't know why the link makes it start at 1 min 8 sec).\n\n6.**LIVE** **STUDY STREAMS**\n\nAt the beginning of online school I watched live study streams on Youtube. I know its a distracting website but if you interact with the streamers and the people on there, it can be very fun knowing that you are studying with others and you can share your struggles with each other too. I loved doing this, but I stopped when school ended. I might pick up this habit again soon.\n\nPS: I can recommend some discord channels and youtube streamers if you want.", "author": "Fearless-Swan", "created": 1597694043, "upvotes": 46}, "g1wfhzo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wfhzo/", "text": "Have a water bottle right next to you!\nAnd have a planner to write quick daily notes, you never know what your professor could change!\n\nAlso, I personally like to have a weekly schedule because daily lists give me \"tunnel vision\" (and I save paper).", "author": "ratsratsracoon", "created": 1597693845, "upvotes": 33}, "g1wcpjk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wcpjk/", "text": "i love to do lists and (online) studying with friends is great too! what works well for me too is study in an environment that kind of *forces* me to. for example the (university) library or a coffee place with loads of other people working/studying there as well", "author": "chairnr18", "created": 1597692845, "upvotes": 3}, "g1wbv86": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1wbv86/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1597692516, "upvotes": 20}, "g1w60pb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ibeluo/tips_for_online_classes/g1w60pb/", "text": "Once I receive my syllabi, I make a master schedule of everything due each week of the semester for each class.
