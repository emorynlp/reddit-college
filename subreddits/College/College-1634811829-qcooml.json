      "text": "I'm not first gen for undergrad, but I am the first in my family to go to grad school. Something on \"how to apply to grad school\" and \"what you should be doing to prepare for grad school\" could have been helpful, or maybe \"how to choose a grad school.\" I suspect that there are a good number of first gen students who want to go to grad school who don't know how to get into research as an undergrad, for example. Anything on any of the norms related to grad school and grad school apps would be useful. Obviously not everyone wants to go to grad school, but usually you have to start preparing earlier than many students realize so an overview on that would be good.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a FGCS but my family was already exposed to the dynamics of college after my sister attended. \n\nBased on her experience, FASFA workshops would be helpful to teach families how to properly fill them our. My mom struggled almost trying to help my sister fill out her FASFA which almost resulted in my sister not receiving any financial aid.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important for FGCS to understand students loans, debt, and the different ways they can pay for college. My sister decided to apply to attend an out of state school and unknowingly subject herself to graduating with $80k by the time she graduates. I\u2019m fortunate enough to avoid as much debt by attending CC after learning from the experience of my sister and listening to the advice of others online.",
