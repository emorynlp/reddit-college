  "text": "I am currently a freshman (this is my second time trying to start college) i started last year in 2020 as I was supposed to start then and i had to withdraw due to being kicked out and other unfortunate situations and decided to work full time up until Fall 2021 semester. \n\nI am currently in school but failing once again. I am not currently homeless but my mother is. She has been stressing me out this entire semester with her drama and negativity to the point where I haven\u2019t gone to school in about 2 weeks now. \n\nNot that it\u2019s an excuse but when your mother threatens suicide and says goodbye to you through text right before going to work kind of shakes you up a bit? I\u2019m constantly worried for her being and she only contacts me when she needs money. I don\u2019t make much because i stopped full time to do school but now I\u2019m in this rut. \n\nI want to withdraw again what i don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen to me/will i get FAFSA? because currently they already wanted me to do a SAP for my financial aid since I withdrew so I paid out of pocket this semester. What should I do? Should I email my teachers to see if it\u2019s worth staying or withdraw and go back next semester when things have calmed down a bit. Thanks to whoever read this.",
