  "title:": "I am falling behind in class due to being down on my luck. How can I talk to my teachers about this?",
  "text": "Hey everyone, so I am wondering if its appropriate to email a teacher to see if I can find out how I'm doing in the class and possibly be given some time to make up missed work.  You see, I am usually a great student however this past semester everything bad and stressful that could happen to a person, literally happened to me. First my partner and I seperated so I have been having to deal with the ins and outs of that, then my job had to let me go so I needed to find new employment, then I also had to deal with moving mid semester which, if you've ever moved you know it just really sucks, AND then my mother had to be put into assisted living so I had to travel back and forth across the country back to my hometown to try and help with that. I have literally never worked so hard in my life trying to keep all the balls from dropping. I am constantly sleep deprived which has affected my school work because I feel like a zombie and there are not enough hours in the day to get everything done.  Oh and I still had to work full time during all of this.\n\n\nSo my question is how can I relay all of this to my teachers and explain that it's not me not giving a shit about my classes... In fact I care a lot and have sacrificed a ton to stay in school (hence the failed relationship) \n\n\nThanks for reading this and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I can make clear, fair \u201cdeals\u201d with them that work with the class needs (like lab practicals you have to take on time but the weekly quizzes you can have leeway on).\n\nEven if only SOME of your profressor do this it is massively better than not telling anyone.\n\nBear in mind though, that you will have better luck in general if you approach this from an \u201ci am having these issues and I am not sure how to make sure I can keep up in the class\u201d  kind of way then what kind of extensions can you give me kind of way.\n\nYou aboslutely didnt  do it the second way in your post, but it bears repeating becasue a lot of professors have sob story overload right now.\n\npractically is there anything at all that you can do ti reduce the time (can you take even a few less hours at work can anyone else in your family help with your mother even for a few weeks till you get your head above water).\n\nmental health center.  Can\u2019t say this enough\n\nLast I really am sorry you are going through this and I hope it looks up for you",

      "text": "You should tell all of this to your professors, but you need to frame it a certain way. You need to say you know all of this isn't an excuse, but that you wanted to let them know that you care about their class and how hard you're working to stay in school. Professors are uses to getting tons of sob stories and excuses, and many of them are made up and exaggerated in an effort to manipulate them. You can say, \"if there's anything I can do to make up work or show you I am meeting the learning objectives, it would really help. But I completely understand if this isn't an option.\"\n\nMore or less, you want to communicate that you care about class and learning not grades (so you aren't grade grubbing), let them know what's going on but without placing an expectation on them. Sorry to hear you're having such a tough time. I hope it gets better soon.",
