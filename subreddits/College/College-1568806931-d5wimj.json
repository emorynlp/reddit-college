Depending on what you're doing, I've had some online learnings that would include video lectures and virtual practice labs, but it's amazing how much harder it seems to pick up information when you can't actively engage or discuss the information. It could be worse tho. I'm always surprised at how many people have had that one professor who spends the whole lecture talking about something off topic so you have to spend extra time catching up.
