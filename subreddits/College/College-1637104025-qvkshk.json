  "text": "I\u2019m currently finishing community college trying to decide which school to transfer to. One is a state school, around 40 thousand students, and the tuition is 8k. The other is a small private all women school, less known, around 2 thousand students, tuition around 15k after scholarships. I was told that this second school also really puts the effort to help students get connected in terms of employment after graduation. Both gave pros and cons and I\u2019m having a really hard time to decide. One is cheaper, but the other has smaller classes, which in my opinion is a lot better to learn. I\u2019m also 27, so I don\u2019t care about partying or any of that. I\u2019m pending toward the state school because is a lot cheaper, but my husband seems to think that the second option would be worth it in the long run. So I ask you Reddit, what would be your choice and why? Thank you!",
