  "title:": "Should I stay in my BBA program or switch to one of the arts/humanities degrees (e.g. English, philosophy, etc.)?",
  "text": "I could really use some advice, please. I am currently a BBA major (planning on specializing in marketing), as I assumed a business degree would help me run my small art/jewelry business full-time. As a fallback, I thought I could market for a NGO, non-profit, or Christian/religious organization.\n\nAfter completing almost half the program, however, I have found very little helpful or applicable to my small business; this course is more suitable for managing a corporation. Further, I feel cramped in the program as there is limited creativity and critical thinking (especially with accounting, stats, and finance).\n\nI am not interested in the rat race or sitting behind a desk all day. I need something creative and/or intellectually stimulating. I\u2019ve considered switching to English and/or art to help me build skills for my business (and because I love art and writing), but I am also fascinated by subjects such as philosophy, psychology, or even political studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Here\u2019s my question:*\n\n**Should I stay in the BBA program and finish 1 year early, or switch to a degree I might enjoy more, but which may require me to stay another 1\u20132 semesters and which may not be as directly employable?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros for BBA/Cons for Switching:**\n\n\\* I\u2019m about halfway through the program and could graduate next year (1 year early), which would allow me to start pursuing my business full-time, or else move on to grad school or other work.\n\n\\* I\u2019ve finished most of the \u201cmind-numbing\u201d classes; I\u2019d only have about 3 more, and then mainly HR and marketing courses.\n\n\\* Humanities degrees often require grad school to get a job in the field, whereas BBAs seem more employable at the undergrad level.\n\n\\* I could still pursue a master\u2019s in something I\u2019m more interested in, and potentially have a 1-year head start.\n\n\\* I\u2019ve heard employers don\u2019t really care which degree you have, so I could potentially work my way to enjoyable jobs in other disciplines.\n\n\\* It might help with some of my business\u2019 admin work.\n\n\\* I could still learn about other subjects I\u2019m interested in on my own time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros for Switching Majors/Cons for BBA:**\n\n\\* My business credits would count towards a minor or concentration, and I could isolate for a few more courses of particular use to me (e.g. marketing), while bypassing other, less applicable ones. (The business conc. would likely help my employability prospects too.)\n\n\\* I\u2019m a big-picture thinker who values critical thinking and creativity. Humanities courses have challenged me significantly more in this regard; the BBA makes me feel kind of shoved inside a box.\n\n\\* Improving my writing, thinking, and/or art skills would be valuable assets for content and product creation for my business.\n\n\\* I could always hire someone for admin work if needed, or get by on what I already know.\n\n\\* I don\u2019t really like marketing, especially for corporations. I\u2019m not a huge fan of social media, I have moral concerns with psychologically manipulating buyers, and my professor said it\u2019s becoming increasingly data-driven.\n\n\\* Business lacks the soul, purpose, and spiritual aliveness I feel when I study other humanities subjects, or things like art or psychology. These subjects are simply more fulfilling and interesting to me.\n\n\\* I feel very different from most people in my business classes, meaning I likely wouldn\u2019t enjoy the jobs they are going for either. (I really don\u2019t want to work at a desk job or crunch numbers for the rest of my life.)\n\n\\* I resonate much more with people in my humanities classes (especially English), and love having intellectual discussions with them.\n\n\\* My school offers a prestigious internship program I could take at the end of my degree to gain job experience with places like NGOs.\n\n\\* It seems most employers don\u2019t really care which degree you have, so long as you have one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, I want to do something I love and am proud of with my life. Perhaps a BBA could help me achieve that with my artisan business, but it\u2019s hard to feel the purpose in it right now. If my business doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019d like to pursue something such as journalism (especially for humanitarian causes), social work, art therapy, or humanitarian law. I want to care about the work I\u2019m doing; I don\u2019t care too much about money so long as I can get by.\n\nPlease help! **Should I stay in my BBA program or switch majors? If so, is there a degree which sounds most suitable?** I would greatly appreciate any advice or relevant life experience!\n\nThank you!! :)",

      "text": "I think what's going to help you most here is to nail down your goals, especially your plan for employment if you can't sustain yourself on the business. The back-up careers you mentioned vary widely in the training you'd need, and particularly if you're shooting for something that would need grad school, you need to plan accordingly. \n\n\nA couple other thoughts:\n\n-it isn't necessarily true that humanities and social sciences are *only* employable with a master's. It depends on the job you want. They're generalist degrees, so you *can* go out and get an entry-level job. The main down side is that depending on where you live, that may mean extra leg work (ie, internships and such to build a resume) to make yourself competitive. If you switch, you want to be pragmatic about your plans and how you will make yourself marketable.\n\n\n-you don't HAVE to work a corporate job with your business degree. Some folks I'm close with used their (social sciences) degrees to work county jobs, but a lot of what they did was stuff like statistical analysis and grant applications for programs. 501c orgs also have value for folks who can manage their business side, especially smaller orgs who need someone who can find money for them. If you stuck with the BBA, it could be worth looking into those kinds of jobs if you don't feel comfortable working for corporate.",
