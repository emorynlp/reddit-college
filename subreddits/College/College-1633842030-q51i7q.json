  "text": "Hi, I'm currently a high school senior applying to colleges and I'm having a hard time choosing what major I should apply for.   \n\n\nI'm currently in the STEM program at my school and enjoy computer science a fair bit. My mom wants me to pursue the medical field which is fine, I like helping people. Keep in mind that I don't particularly have a set career that I'm super passionate about, so I'm flexible in that regard.  \n\n\nThe problem is, I'm trying to find a career/major that merges computer science and the medical field together. Preferably something that involves hands on medical procedures and coding like computer science. I'm pretty sure nothing like that exists out in the world, but if anyone has any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.",
