  "text": "So, I'm a student who lurks in r/Professors a lot. I sometimes see posts in the subreddit from professors who are worried that they're behind in grading, or feel like they aren't doing enough. These posts aren't as common as posts complaining about dumb students and/or administration, but I digress. And honestly, all I want to say to the professors who feel they are worried about being behind or that they're not doing enough... it shows that you care. And my best experiences with professors have been from the ones who genuinely care and want to do their best for their students. I love the professors who do their best to organize their classes and make sure the material is understandable to the students who want to put in the effort. They try everything to make sure each student has ample resources and the ability to pass if they do the work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the professors who genuinely care, and who do their best for their students, thank you. It means a lot, and your students are likely grateful to have you.\n\nAnd to show my appreciation to the wonderful professors out there, I want to share some stories of some professors who... are less-than-stellar. This post is r/Professors inspired, except instead of me talking about students... this will go the opposite way, and will talk about the \"professors\" I've had that made me even more eternally grateful that good professors exist. : ) My goal with this post is to give other professors who are doing everything they can some encouragement, by showing off some bad eggs who... well, aren't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Example A: **I am half-way through a class, and my professor has not graded** ***a single thing.*** Now, you might be thinking to yourself, \"This student is just exaggerating, this professor's probably a few weeks behind in grading and this student is simply complaining about it.\" Nope, I mean this professor has literally not graded a single assignment half-way through the course. We had an introduction discussion the first week of class, which simply asked what your name and major are, and guess what remains ungraded lmao. My entire grade at this moment is comprised of 20 points, which each come from two auto-graded Canvas quizzes. There's over 100 points in the class at this point from assignments that aren't auto-graded by Canvas that remain ungraded by my professor. I have no idea if I'm doing the assignments to my professor's liking or not half-way into the damn class haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Example B: **The Professor who put nearly no effort into their course.** So, this is a professor I had about a year ago. It was a political science course about the American government, so the book was pretty hefty and most of the course was just reading. Now... for a course which requires a lot of reading, you would expect a professor to lecture on each chapter or at the very least provide some power points, you know something to guide students through the reading and let them know which information in each chapter is important and that they should pay attention to, and which is not. Kind of standard stuff from most reading-hefty classes I've taken. But nah, this professor ain't doing any of that shit! He's got it made. Here's how this professor structured their class:\n   * Each week goes over one chapter. This part is pretty standard for most reading hefty courses.\n   * Each week there are 5-6 assignments due. They are usually multiple choice quizzes, canvas discussion boards, InQuizitive assignments (InQuizitive is one of those homework websites, and honestly my favorite that I've used so far lol), things like that. Now, for 5-6 assignments, you would expect the assignments to be up all week... no, they open up at midnight on Wednesday and close on Friday at *noon.* ***In this class you had two and a half days to do 5-6 assignments every week.*** Holy shit. I would understand this if each assignment needed to be hand graded, but all the assignments except for the discussion boards were AUTO-GRADED BY CANVAS. Why give your students two and a half days to do assignments that you don't even need to hand grade? Why the asinine time constraint??\n   * Every 3-4 weeks or so there's an exam. The exam consists of one open-ended essay question that you must write about. The topic is chosen at random and students have 60 minutes to write the essay. I believe there were three of these the entire class.\n   * The final exam was a 50-question multiple choice exam that the professor did not have to grade at all because Canvas automatically did it for him.\n\nSo, basically this professor put very little effort into their course during the semester (the most hand-grading they had to do came from the three essay exams), and put the brunt of the work and learning onto the students to scramble on. Now professors shouldn't spoon-feed their students, some of the learning is on the responsibility of the student. But holy shit, this professor gave students nothing to work with to guide their learning. He expected the book to do all of the teaching and Canvas to do 90% of his grading, while giving his students very little time to do the assignments for seemingly no reason at all (again, if he had to hand-grade the majority of the assignments I would understand, but he did not). He gave students no resources, no power points, no lectures, nothing. I came out of that class having no idea what my professor looked or sounded like, or even what his personality was. It seems this professor basically just spent a few weeks structuring his canvas to include the discussion posts and homework for each week, and then kicked back and relaxed for most of the semester, leaving it to the students to do most of his work for him.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nI have some more stories, however this post is pretty damn long already so I'll end it here for now. All I want to say is, thank you to the professors who do their best to make sure students can understand the material, especially for asynchronous courses where this task is more difficult. I'm eternally grateful for the professors who post power points and/or post lecture videos or other resources for asynchronous classes because they make the classes a lot less painful. I really **really** ***really*** do not like asynchronous/online classes where the professor doesn't post anything related to the material on their end and just expects only the book to teach their students lol. I understand that for asynchronous classes posting material on the end of the professor isn't necessary, so believe me when I say that I'm really grateful for the professors who do put in that extra effort for their asynchronous courses, because without the extra resources those classes are very hard to learn the material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm also really grateful for the professors who grade relatively quickly. I've been seeing some posts in r/Professors \\- though not as common - from professors worried that they're behind in grading. Not only does that show that you care, I highly doubt you're as far behind as the professor in my first example lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post isn't meant to kiss ass or whatever. Just thought some professors could use some encouragement from all the negativity going around in r/Professors. Plus, it's always fun to do some light banter. : )",

      "text": "My favorite along these lines is a professor I had who would speak around 10-15 minutes of the class and expect the students to discuss the rest. now this could potentially go well if the students were deeply diving into the topic, but instead the time was monopolized by 2-3 students who shared their personal life stories (w/o tying them into the course)   --- think  along the lines of if we were discussing infant development, they would talk about their opinion about babies and how their friend had a cute baby etc. --- for about 45 minutes or MORE per 1 hour class. This wouldn't be a back and forth thing, a student would actively talk 10-15m at a time, even if people were waiting to discuss.\n\nThey  would never ask the students to save the stories and would encourage more of it. My initial theory was that due to some participation points, and the expectation you would say or type several things per class the students just wanted to get the points, but later I believe it was more about they had a captive audience.\n\nI tried to address it with the teacher who just said, \"What do you expect me to do, spoonfeed it to you? You guys are adults. I'm not going to teach you everything.\" When I followed up to ask him about a project, to just get a better idea of how he wanted the material presented, he said I was trying to get him to do the work for me. I truly believe he was going through some mental health issues related to covid, but I didn't appreciate my concern was dismissed.\n\nadd: Quite awhile back I dreamed of becoming a professor. I also read /professors and it has definitely helped me appreciate that based on the comments, it's something unsatisfying, stressful, and that I wouldn't want to pursue. I rarely see positive posts about students or discussions about how much they love teaching. It really makes me wonder what my professors think of our classes.",

      "text": "Some professors are just terrible. One semester, one of my professors called my dad to talk about me. It was illegal due to FERPA. It was bizarre because most professors hate talking to a student\u2019s parent about the student and will refuse to answer any questions from parents. I don\u2019t know how my professor got my dad\u2019s number. I reported my professor to his supervisor (the head of the department), but I don\u2019t know if he was ever disciplined.",
