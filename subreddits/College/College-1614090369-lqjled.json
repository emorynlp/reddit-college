  "text": "I\u2019m a first year university student. I study chemistry and I have to write 4 exams in this semester. 3 of them are already behind me, while I don\u2018t particularly feel like I did good in any of them, I at least felt like I could pass them. I had a really hard time trying to motivate myself to study and it felt really hopeless but now I have my first result. My first exam was physics and I failed miserably.. Like I was miles away from the passing grade (maybe they even gave me the worst grade, I don\u2019t know the grading system yet.) \n\nI was never any good at it but now I feel really stressed out and wonder if I\u2018m even made for this. I used to really like studying for chemistry in high school but now I can\u2018t even bring myself to enjoy the classes that have more to do with it than e.g. physics. Now my head is full of negative questions like what if I fail all the other exams too? Will I have to drop out? I know most of this is my fault because I just didn\u2018t study enough. \n\nBut I\u2019m really desperate right now. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nedit; thank you to everyone who answered.  I don\u2018t really have anyone who would have comforted and helped me this much. my parents would have just said I didn\u2018t study enough and that it was the obvious result which would have dragged me down even more. So I\u2019m really grateful to all of you :\u2018)",

You still have potential to be a great chemist and graduate with a stellar record so try not to let anxiety and intrusive thoughts put you off. \n\nI will also say that foundational chemistry classes are always a nightmare (I struggled more in gen chem than graduate level biochemistry because the class was so badly organized and taught) and personally, I have never met someone who was good at/comfortable with both chemistry and physics.

I think they just require a very different style of critical thinking and very few people are competent in both. \n\nSo hang in there! You\u2019ve got this",

I would not think too much about the question whether you are suited for this major and just try to do your best for the next exams. Don\u2019t think about consequences or anything but just study (maybe even take on a mindset as if you had passed all the past exams). If you successfully do that and really concentrate on studying you will probably succeed (as you said that the main reason for failing that last exam was because you didn\u2019t study enough. Not because you had major problems understanding the content). I think a good grade or a pass will be the thing that will bring back your joy and motivation for future exams. \nSo give yourself another 1 or 2 semesters before thinking about quitting!\nI think it\u2019s definitely worth a try!! :)",

Start a study group with others and really ask for help from anyone when you need it, it's okay to fail,  but it's not okay to stay down, you need to get back up and really go for it dude. You can do it, you just need to work hard at it. If you think you get something, keep working at it, some teachers and classes are harder than others and can be deceiving in making you think you know the stuff, when you don't.

You need to learn not just how to arrive at the answer, but why (and why not something else). Understanding the nature of the problems more deeply before trying to answer them will help with that.",

What is the worst that's going to happen from this? You realize this isn't what you want to do, and that means you can spend your time focusing on stuff you actually enjoy doing.

Although it definitely sucks (I failed a class so badly I didn\u2019t bother showing up for the final), you should be able to take the class(es) again for grade replacement. \n\nMy advice would be don\u2019t give up, one class (and especially not one or two exams!) doesn\u2019t define you as a student. Take a break, come back stronger and more motivated if you need to. Take a look and see how badly you want it, and if it matters to you then you can take that second chance. But, the point is, there\u2019s always a second chance, TONS of people fail exams and classes. It\u2019s the ones who come back from it that get the degree, that\u2019s why it\u2019s worth it to employers. \n\nKeep your head up!",
