  "text": "Hi guys I hope you are doing well :) I am just posting this looking for advice or similar stories, (doesn\u2019t have to be success.) Just to preface this, I was luckily able to receive a free scholarship to a community college due to a program I followed in high school. This entire semester however my mental health has not gotten any better than what it was my senior year of hs, (pretty bad) and I am basically failing every one of my classes. I just don\u2019t think pursuing my education right now is something I want to do, instead focusing on work and finding a therapist, friends and whatnot. There\u2019s not much to this. I was really looking for if any of you were/ or are in a similar situation. Thanks",
