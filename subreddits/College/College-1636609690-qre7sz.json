I wasn't really bullied in HS like I was as a kid, but there was always so much drama and some ppl were just straight up mean. I managed to get to a place where I mostly cruised by on the sideline of it all while still participating in sports and going to school dances and stuff, but it was impossible to avoid all the drama and sometimes I just  had to put up with it. In college you get to choose the people you interact with and you get so much freedom. I can sit in class and do anything I want whereas in HS I always had ppl telling me I had to pay attention and telling me what I'm not allowed to do.",

That keeps you on your toes and gives you some sense of responsibility.\n\nOn the drama thing, it was fairly minimal in my case but when it did exist, it was so interesting and entertaining, im not going to lie.\n\nAs for freedom, well, i already could do almost everything i wanted to because my parents always trusted me. I said \"literally\" because i skipped classes quite a lot in my school years. My grades weren't all that good, mediocre with the odd great grade here and there. Managed to get into a top college in my country due to doing amazing in the final exams.",

Way less freedom to do what you want than you get as an adult, so the responsibility feels worth it. As far as friends, your experience sounds different than mine, but I felt that most of the friends I had were friendships of convenience, whereas the friends I've made in adulthood are folks I chose to be around and feel connected with.",
