  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman computer science major who currently works at Walmart and they\u2019re just killing me. I\u2019m pretty decent at writing so I feel like this could be a solid money making opportunity. I have enough money right now that I can afford to not work next semester so I was contemplating quitting my current job to try and focus on writing. I\u2019ve already written a couple of articles and published them on Medium so I\u2019m thinking I can possibly create a portfolio from there. \n\nDo I have a good chance of getting into the market? I understand that I probably won\u2019t make that much in the beginning but I absolutely despise Walmart with a passion and want to escape. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

          "text": "Buyer beware of SNHU. It\u2019s different because you\u2019re in NH, where they have a brick-and-mortar campus, but their ads, marketing campaign, and online presence makes them look very, very similar to for-profit unis like UofPhoenix, Devry, etc. I know SNHU is a totally normal, legit non-profit uni, but they\u2019ve soiled their name quite a bit because their marketing is EXACTLY like the for-profits.\n\nAnd unlike other legit schools with huge online offerings, like ASU, they haven\u2019t had any real brand name in the US before their online marketing presence. So now everyone knows them as the college you see on TV.\n\nPerception is reality, and their perception is not well in most of the US. This is something to take note of.",

Taking their certificate courses, and am workin on document research of families, unit, person etc. People do the title search on their house to find out who owned it (same story).\n\nSo I can find it work, publishing in local county newspapers and work on bigger work. My DAR chapter has me on the research team for a book to be published in 6 years or better. (coinciding with the 2026 250th of USA).",
