Im in my second year. I was supposed to apply for jobs and secure a paid internship before September.\n\nI never had a job of anykind before barely have anything to put on the resume. Took me a good 2 weeks to figure out what I could put on my resume to apply for some internships.\n\nI thought maybe i could tech myself to build some apps or bots so atleast i'd have some kind of relevant experience. I finished my resume at the end of july and had only a month to apply to places. The pressure took over and i procrastinated for the whole month thinking first i'd do something then i'll start applying. But things just kept happening and i had to keep dealing with them.\n\nI got diagnosed with ADHD midway through August. My work place did a layoff and gave the rest of us who was still working extra time. Got busy with that so kept putting applying for internship off till late August and then i just gave up because what were the odds that i would even get one even if i applied.\n\nEverything was online asking for help had slow responses. Which was the most discouraging part. I know i am putting myself in a victim situation even though i shouldn't because it was my own doing.\n\nI received an email saying i have to opt out of the co-op program. I want to ask for an extension but i don't know what to write. Anything i say just sounds like an excuse. Theres no refund for it either. 1000$ down the drain. All i got from it was 3 resume reviews.\n\nAnyone have any advice for me?
