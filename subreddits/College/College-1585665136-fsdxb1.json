  "text": "My anxiety is a bit through the roof right now as I'm fairly sure me as well as both my parents have it since we've been living with & in close contact with someone who just tested positive and we're starting to show symptoms. Should I email my professors if I turn out positive or is that unnecessary? I'm not sure if I'm overreacting/hysteric right now sorry I'm just shook\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the suggestions and well wishes, you\u2019ve all made me feel validated and a lot more at ease & I appreciate you all. I\u2019m going to email my professors and let them know I\u2019ll keep them updated with the situation. 2020 has been weird as fuq but we\u2019ll get through it together.",
