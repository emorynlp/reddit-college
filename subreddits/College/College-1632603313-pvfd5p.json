I'm not religious or anything it's just that I had strict parents growing up. I do think that drinking and doing drugs is a slippery slope and I never want to be the girl who needs to drink or do drugs to have fun but I am having serious FOMO, especially on the weekends when all I see are girls going out, having fun, and meeting guys. I have made friends at college but when I try to make plans about going to football games, go to parties, etc. they don't want to bc they don't drink either or they don't think it'll be fun.

One thing I'll say is you don't have to drink to have a fun time and besides this group most ppl won't pressure you into it\nBut as another commenter said there's other ways to have fun. My friends like to go into the city and eat at restaurants, have game nights, watch movies, get ice cream, and just hang out. Hope everything works out and you have a great year!!", "author": "violet_tea5", "created": 1632683436, "upvotes": 1}, "he9w2sh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvfd5p/advice/he9w2sh/", "text": "Start drinking.

It's perfectly normal to feel as if you're missing out and it really is just a bad case of FOMO. Honestly, I feel like I'm missing out on quite a bit too because most of my days are stuffed with schoolwork, but comparing yourself to your friends will not help you. I know this and I've done this, and my own personal wellbeing has paid the price of having such negative thoughts.\n\nWhat you should do is find your niche area. If you honestly don't like the party scene, don't go out and party. There's tons of other people out there that like to do fun things in clubs and other orgs. If you're not part of an org, try joining one. If you can't join an org, try asking your friends if they wanna go out and do other things that don't involve getting wasted and high at midnight. Hope that helps, but one more note.\n\nRealize that college is just one chapter out of the many that will happen in your life, and you'll have time to go out and do all the things you want. And in case nobody has told you yet, you're not missing out on anything by not attending the party scene in college. Taco runs are way better and less risky anyway.", "author": "TAMUVIBEZ", "created": 1632604647, "upvotes": 5}}}
