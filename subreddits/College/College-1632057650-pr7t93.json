Honestly, I'm already thinking of transferring,  which is a scary thought on its own that I could make another post about. However, the art classes here are really lacking. They are boring, they clearly put no funding into the program, they have no major options, and the professors are not that good at art.\n\nI am very interested in art (drawing, painting, fashion) and science (environmental, bio, chem). I didn\u2019t want to go to an art school because I didn\u2019t want to miss out on science courses. I\u2019m looking for a good college that has science and a strong art department.\n\nDoes such a school exist that has good academics as well as a recognizable art program?\n\n(I hope it's okay to post this here!)", "author": "endme420o", "created": 1632057650, "retrieved": 1632801467, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdgv0wf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr7t93/college_with_good_art_and_science_programs/hdgv0wf/", "text": "Look up schools with  interdisciplinary programs", "author": "renebeca", "created": 1632062777, "upvotes": 2}, "hdgm6c1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr7t93/college_with_good_art_and_science_programs/hdgm6c1/", "text": "> at a pretty tiny liberal art school\n\nThis is your problem. Usually if you want to mix majors like that your best bet is a large flagship school, because those are the schools that are most likely to large/robust programs in many areas, whereas small schools tend to simply not have the funding or quantity of people necessary to invest that much into a broad number of areas.\n\nYou can probably find a school somewhere that has strong academic and art programs, and although I unfortunately don't know specifically which schools, I'd start out by looking into schools that are much more on the larger side and are thus more likely to invest in both.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632058627, "upvotes": 2}}}
