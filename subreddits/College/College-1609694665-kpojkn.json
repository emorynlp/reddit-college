As someone that works professionally in Higher ed, and as someone who got their masters in student affairs and higher ed have a pretty strong understanding of how universities operate at their core. For you students out there, my plan is to lay a pretty decent foundation here to help you understand many different aspects of how your university probably operates, since you pay for it and are the reason these institutions exist. I\u2019ll say, I\u2019m not the expert on everything or every type of university, and my experience is entirely in the United States so that is who this will be most relevant to, but I\u2019m hoping I can bring some interesting info to you on this Sunday morning! \n\nFirst and foremost, universities are businesses at the core. Just like Target, Walmart, or Amazon, they have a bottom line that needs to be met. Your tuition and student fees pay this bottom line, alongside federal and state funding if your institution is public. The more students a university has, the better faculty they can hire, the more research they can pump out, the better alumni they can get who will hopefully donate, and the cycle continues. Your money is being put into a long term investment by the university to sustain itself. The biggest expenditure of any university? Faculty and staff. Let\u2019s break those down. \n\nFaculty are your professors and researchers who teach courses, contribute to scientific papers, and experts of a given field. Thing is, any bit of discovery or research faculty yield, their intellectual property in other words, belongs to the university. If I were a cancer researcher and made a massive breakthrough in cancer treatment, that belongs to my employer, not me. This is not an exclusive practice to higher ed, but consider how faculty are paid and tenured up front and how it is part of a larger system for an institution to protect their investments. \n\nStaff are everyone else. These are your custodial staff, dining staff, residence hall employees, student activities peeps, diversity center staff, etc. If the faculty are left brain, staff are right brain. Their job is to keep amenities usable, create safe environments for all on campus, and create learning/social opportunities outside of the lecture hall. I fall into this category. \n\nLet\u2019s stick with this left brain and right brain analogy. Left brain are your academic affairs team, they are focused on the classroom experience and your enrichment in the field you have specified. Your advisors, faculty and program chairs are gonna work to develop your academic capital.  Your right brain, student affairs, will work to adjust you to being a strong functioning member of a global society, helping you network and meet people you would never normally meet. They\u2019re focused on your social capital. These two parts of the brain are meant to work in tandem, but at many universities they grind up against each other. Some in student affairs view those in academic affairs as pretentious or uncaring. Some in academic affairs see those in student affairs as wasteful or unnecessary. I\u2019m not here to say who is right or wrong, but instead advocate that they need to work together to create the best experience for all. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about how your money breaks down further: your fees pay for all the above staff and faculty, as well as dining halls, programs on campus, sports and clubs. Sports are seen as big money makers on campus: this isn\u2019t always true! Sure, some very large programs (think Alabama or UT Austin) turn a profit on their sports programs, and usually the profit from these programs go into paying for other sports on campus. Usually though, sports programs break even on their costs or even subsidize the costs across the whole student body. Sports have become their own worst enemy: they need to fill seats and charge fees to sustain themselves lest they fall apart. \n\nAnother important thing to know about your money: it doesn\u2019t always pay for what you think it does. Some departments or offices on campus are auxiliary services. What that means is that they do NOT receive federal funding. Housing is a great example of this. All money that housing uses is *usually* only what is earned by students living in the halls. So your money goes into paying for the maintenance of all buildings, housing staff, programming etc. Parking is another auxiliary service. This is not to defend they high prices of living on campus, but instead to help explain why some of those costs are the way they are. \n\nOne last thing I\u2019ll cover here is power. The head of your university may be titled President, Chancellor, Dean etc. You may believe this person holds all the power on campus: this isn\u2019t necessarily true. Most heads of universities are tasked with two big things: build strong alumni relationships to get more funds, and build strong political connections on behalf of the university. These presidents or chancellors are truly political figures at the core and they have lots of different people in their ears telling them what to do: student governments, faculty and staff associations, alumni, parents, and the biggest of all, board of regents/directors. This board is where lots of power rests. I\u2019d recommend you learn who is on your board and what their backgrounds are: this can help you understand a lot of decisions made on your campus. Ultimately though, the power is in the consumer, and that is the student body. The ability to make changes as students cannot be understated. \n\n\nWhew. That is a lot. And it doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface of all that is there. I\u2019m hoping that this helps provide some interesting information of how funds are allocated, how systems operate, and where the power rests in any given institution. As a student who is paying to uphold all these different things, I believe it is your responsibility to know how your money is spent and how you are being advocated for on multiple levels. My career is in supporting students through their higher ed journey and I love it to death. Because I love it so much, I really believe that it is my duty to be honest and transparent with those who pay my salary.

You aren't paying for *your specific* lodging and meals, you're subsidizing part of the cost to provide those services to everyone. (Just like your tuition isn't paying *your specific* professors' salaries.)\n\nSome schools (like the one I work for) have partnered with outside companies to provide housing and/or dining services, so issuing refunds may not even be up to the university, but rather Sodexo or Aramark or whatever company they've contracted with to provide these services for you.

The left/right brain analogy is. . crude. \n\nTo add context, in the past universities mainly consisted of faculty. Faculty taught, mentored, advised, administered. They did it all, except cleaning and preparing meals. Over time there was a need for people to specialize in certain areas and institutions found that parents expected them to take care of their students in many various ways. This is called \u201cduty of care.\u201d Duty of care is the reason services at universities and colleges have expanded so much over the 20th century, and most especially in the last 40 years. Institutions are expected to provide for the mental, physical, and social health of their students in order to provide an environment that is conducive to learning. \n\nThese expectations coupled with dwindling state funding are two major forces in the rise of cost of attendance. In 2011, it cost an institution on average $12,000 per year to educate one student ($14,000 for universities, $9,000 for colleges). That\u2019s the price to educate them (teaching, student support, and administration). Not the price to provide counseling, health centers, student activities, or sports. \n\nInstitutions must offer these other services. It\u2019s both expected and can be contributing factors on whether incoming students decide to attend the institution, which yes, does affect the caliber of student and alumni population and the cycle of donations to keep the school operating and growing. This is all not to mention the institution\u2019s responsibility to their community. \n\nYes, institutions must keep business practices in mind for continued operation. But don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking education is exactly like any other business operation out there.
