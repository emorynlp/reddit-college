  "text": "i\u2019m a first year, first semester student and a state uni and i really feel like i\u2019m going to pass my chem 2 class with either a low C or D or just out right fail. i already failed my first midterm and my quizzes we have every week i do not do well at all. we don\u2019t get classwork to boost our grade and homework doesn\u2019t really help much. The class average was also very low so i know it\u2019s not just me and that my professor is horrible. in all my other classes i currently have As and 1 B that i may be able to bring up if i do well on my midterms. i do not want to withdraw from the class which may sound stupid but i just really want to try and push through it. i\u2019m honestly fine with a C because i don\u2019t think here\u2019s anyway for me to bring my grade above it",

      "text": "If GPA alone is your primary concern: Depends on how many other courses you\u2019re taking. You can average out all your other course GPAs including the 0 for the failed class. It\u2019ll probably drop it quite a bit, but if you\u2019re getting A\u2019s and B\u2019s in your other classes, your GPA might still be decent. \n\nIt\u2019s important to know that some programs require you to not have any failed classes/classes below a certain grade, or to have a minimum required GPA to stay in the program. I recommend finding out if anything like this applies to you just in case.",

      "text": "The answer cannot be given due to missing information.  Any attempt to answer would require your grade in each class, and the number of credits each of those courses are worth.  \n\nAs an academic recommendation, doing some \"back to the basics\" math studying will help your GPA.  GPA what-if scenarios are fairly simple math problems, which most 8th graders should know how to do.  Getting your math skills up to college level will help in almost all of your classes.",
