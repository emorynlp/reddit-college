  "text": "I (f23) am technically spending my first year on campus at a school I've been attending for the last year. I was taking a gap year when the pandemic hit and started at a new school last school year. The school kind of teased us on whether or not we'd be in person so people would move into the area and onto campus housing. We didn't come back in in-person until this school year. I'm a senior now and know absolutely no one. It's an urban campus so it's fairly spread out in the city we're in, and there are no chances to socialize. I've never experienced a school that doesn't put on events or wants the students to get to know each other. Because of the virus, we have to wear masks in class and not sit directly next to anyone if possible, so socializing in and around class is out of the question. My school has clubs, but they're not interested base, but instead, identity-based (race, ethnicity,sexuality,) and they urge you to only join if you fit whatever identity they're based around, and there are very few clubs and I don't fit any of the molds. I brought this issue up in a student Facebook group and got absolutely roasted. People told me to get out if I don't like the school and that I'm obviously a rude person if people aren't talking to me. One said to see a therapist because no sane person doesn't like this school. I got recruited by two sororities on campus and I'll be meeting with some of the girls for coffee to chat, but my school is not a greek school at all and therefore the sororities are not as fun here. I've heard of people urging not to join the sororities here because their rules are crazy and controlling.I just feel like I'm stuck and I'm going to have a lonely year? Any advice?",
