      "text": "Generally we want to have a release from the student, but a subset of information about you is directory information, which we are allowed (but not required) to share without release permission. Common directory information is: \n\n* Name\n* Address\n* Email address\n* Photo\n* DOB\n* Major\n* Dates of enrollment\n* Degrees received\n* Enrollment Status\n* Anticipated or actual date of graduation\n* Height & weight for athletes\n\nThere's often more, but those are really common. And again, we are PERMITTED but not required to. If someone emailed my office looking for a photo of a student, I would 100% not share that without a release.\n\nSource: I'm a registrar",
