  "text": "I'm so sad right now.  I'm in a relationship but my partner is currently hours away so it's just me and my daughter (8 years old).  I have a midterm that is due on Monday (6 essay questions with references), a paper due on Sunday, 2 APA formatted discussion posts that were due yesterday that I am just now getting to.  My daughter gets out of class in 2 more hours and I'm just feeling so much pressure.  I really don't like doing school work while she's at home with me because I'm the only one she can engage with since she is an only child.  \n\nLast weekend, family watched her so I could get started on the first half of my paper so that was really helpful.  I feel extremely guilty when I have to ask someone to watch her so I know that I won't be asking for help this weekend.  I plan to wake up early and stay up late to do my midterm but with an overwhelming amount of work to complete, I'm sure I'm going to end up having to do some work while she's up.  \n\nIt's so hard to be a parent in college :( I just want to spend time with her because we've been so busy lately.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not a parent but I would prioritize my schoolwork first. Just make sure your daughter is fed, clean, and occupied while you are doing your work. \nYou\u2019re going to have to do your schoolwork in the end and that means sacrificing time with your daughter. You can minimize that though by having her in the room with you doing something on her own and chatting with her now and then. Just being able to have the other\u2019s presence nearby is a lot on its own. \nI doubt she will remember the days where you focus solely on school when she grows up, and if she does, she will understand what position you were put in once she is in school herself. \n\nDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing a great job. The fact that you are worrying about the time that is not spent with your daughter is already a sign that you are at least trying.",

          "text": "Thank you kind stranger. It\u2019s really hard not to feel guilty. I want to provide a better life for her which is one of the reasons I\u2019m in school in the first place. It\u2019s just been overwhelming trying to do it almost alone. \nWe had a good talk about it. She understands but says \u201cI wish I knew how to do your homework so I could help you.\u201d  Love her <3",

      "text": "It is really hard to do this.  But you can keep a couple things in mind.  You daughter sees you modeling responsible behavior and you can explain to her that some weeks suck but the next week will be fun again.  She may not totally understand but these lessons are still quality time and she will grow up to also be dedicated and work toward making herself more sucessful becasue she saw you do it.",

My midterm was extended though so we played a few games of operation and went on a nice walk before I began cooking dinner :)",

      "text": "I would let your daughter know what\u2019s going on (that you have homework). I know she\u2019s 8, but maybe you can make part of it a study date with her if she has homework or wants to read or color at the table next to you. Also offer to sit with her while she watches her favorite movie but tell her you\u2019ll also be finishing your homework while you sit.\n\nThen reward her good behavior this weekend by taking her out the weekend after or something. Good luck!",
