  "text": "For the first two weeks of class I didn't feel motivated and still a little burnt out from spring semester and a really hard summer program. I have to apply to pharmacy school by november 1st, I have an exam due at 9pm tomorrow (Cell bio), and another due wednesday (biochem) and I work 8 hours at a hospital that same day too. I work 16-24 a week on average to pay for classesThen an another exam the week later (Anatomy and Physiology. Then this biostats class has been punching me in the gut everyother day\n\nI don't need much, I just need a bit more encouragement. I do better and feel stronger when people do that. I remember what people said and that's part of what has been keeping me going, even if my mental health isn't the best",
