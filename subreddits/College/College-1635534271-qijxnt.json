  "text": "My friends from high school and I are still super close, and we talk to each other almost every day. My roommate and floor mates think it\u2019s weird that I still have friends from high school, and keep telling me that I need to \u201cgrow up\u201d and \u201cmove on\u201d, and that we\u2019re in college now and shouldn\u2019t still be talking to our \u201ccliques from high school\u201d. They completely dropped all of their old friends and cut off contact with them to be \u201cmore mature\u201d and to move on with their lives rather than being \u201cstuck as a high schooler\u201d. Obviously I\u2019m not going to drop my friends, but do most people stop talking to their high school friends when they get to college? Is it weird that I still talk to all of mine?",

And if they aren\u2019t already, they\u2019ll be college aged friends. It\u2019s one thing to live in the past and never meet new people, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having lifelong friends. It almost makes me sad for them that they are denying themselves friendships for\u2026a status?",

      "text": "I'm late 20s and still talk to some folks I grew up with, although it's not an every day thing. My parents are nearing 60 and still have friends from their high school.\n\n\n\"Growing up\" and keeping connections aren't mutually exclusive. Being an adult *can* mean that you grow apart from people, either due to change or because you get super involved in your own things and can't catch up as much. But it also means maturing socially and forming life-long connections with folks you care about. You don't have to sacrifice old connections to make new ones!",

Your roommate and floor mates are the opposite of being \"more mature.\" That sounds straight out of a clich\u00e9 movie what they're telling you to do, and honestly a bit childish. There's nothing wrong with keeping in touch with your friends, just because they were from high school doesn't matter. It's basically the same as saying you shouldn't hang out with your college friends now because you need to be more mature for your 9-5 job as a \"real\" adult in my opinion. I still talk to my best friend since 3rd grade and I'm not having any problems over here. It sounds like they're trying to conform to some weird standards.\n\nKeep talking to your friends!",

Cultivate and grow your own social relationship based on your own needs. Don\u2019t base your choices on what someone else says. Cutting off someone does not create maturity. I can not guarantee any of your friends will be around when your my age but if they are you can reflect on how you have matured together. Be blessed that you have a good number of friends from all avenues of our life it is important I think in college. Each creates a unique support system to help you along your way I used mine in college and now in grad school. Good luck!",

I actually had one of my old buddies live w me for a year and my college friends loved her. Also my friends often get excited when their friends from home are coming around. I\u2019ve met so many of my co workers and class mates old school friends. That doesn\u2019t sound like a friend group I would like to be in. Cutting off all of your old friends because you\u2019re moving isn\u2019t mature. It\u2019s the opposite. what do they do when they go home? I visit my old friends. I was a senior in high school when my bff was a sophomore in college and I would hang out with them and they were so nice to me and we always had a great time. moving away to college and cutting people off does not make someone mature.",

Right now, I\u2019m making more than 90% of them, but I remember how they were treating people, who doesn\u2019t wanna talk about career, and talk about something else, as if I was immature and needed to grow up and start looking for good internship and get 70K per year job from 9am to 5pm. Therefore, if you feel that you close, and you guys support each other, try to keep it up and don\u2019t listen to such douchebags.",

I think the logic is ridiculous, along as they are good mature people that you can trust than ofc it's not problematic",
