It\u2019s very simple to make : just a tortilla and a bunch of your favorite shredded cheese (slice works to but I always use shredded as it melts better) pop that baby in the microwave for 30 to 45 seconds and boom! An easy snack! Dip in some salsa for extra flavor. You can make a whole plateful to. Takes less than 2 minutes to make and it\u2019s super good!",

It settles down after a few weeks I think.\n\nEgg fried rice is a really great meal to do on the cheap as a student. It\u2019s got veg, carbs, protein, all the good stuff. It\u2019s healthy. And it\u2019s cheap.",
