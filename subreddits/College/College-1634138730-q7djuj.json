  "text": "My CC recommended enrolling for second session classes, and despite knowing they were condensed I took their advice. They didn\u2019t warn me or anything so I figured my worry about it was irrational.\n\nI am now taking four 8 week courses. I\u2019d like to know if anyone thinks this is attainable? Honestly, whether it is or not, there\u2019s no going back. \n\n++ Someone for the love of god share good textbook reading strategies that don\u2019t involve sitting at the computer for 4 hours straight.",

              "text": "Yeah thats going to be a tough workload :( is it too late to drop one? I\u2019m sorry nobody warned you! My only suggestion us to make sure to follow the usual textbook reading recommendations e.g., scan ahead, read the headers and titles to get an idea of where youre going. And id also recommend using the pomodoro method for studying to limit burnout (set a timer for 25 minutes and thats work time, then you have a 5 min break for example, adjust the time as needed but dont overdo it)",

      "text": "I'm only taking one 8 week class (it's GOVT) and so far it is okay for the most part but I'm only taking one other normally scheduled course. So I can't even imagine taking four 8 weeks at the same time.\n\nYour best bet is to analyze syllabus and schedule out all of your reading and stick with it. Also when you're doing your reading make sure you have a system to get through it. It could be a playlist- location specific or other things. I have adhd so I have a lot of planning to deal- I eat jolly ranchers lol and use a timer to give myself breaks- for example read for 45 minutes and take a 10 min break and it is all on timer. And I made special playlists to get through it. I use flash cards directly after a chapter to quiz myself on key terms. \nSo far I am making an A because of this.",
