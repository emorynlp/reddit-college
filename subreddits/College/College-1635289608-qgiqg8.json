  "text": "Hello,\n\nI didnt do great in high school and felt I wasn't ready for college when I was 18. I've been in sales for the past four years, and now I want to pursue a business degree with a focus in finance.\n\nI know I could begin at a community college and transfer, but that's only in state.\n\nIs it possible for me to attend a university like Yale, or Stanford for undergrad as someone in their mid 20s? If so, how.",
