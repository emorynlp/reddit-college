  "text": "I would only really want to study it to help me be a better entrepreneur... \n\nBut in my working life I'm a engineer tech with a 2 year degree in mechanical. \n\nSo should I 2+2 my degree with a bachelor's in engineering or an applied business degree?\n\nConsidering my situation, wouldn't it be wise for me to just stick to engineering and learn business from books in my free time?",
