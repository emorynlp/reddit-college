My lab partners are subpar at best and the lab reports are always due at the end of the class and they take awhile to complete. Not to mention they are at 7:30 so I am asleep when I get there. Im not even halfway done with these labs for the semester and already hate this. I enjoy the lectures and material but the labs alone are enough to ruin my whole experience. How the hell can I get through these labs? Some of them are insanely complex too and require hours of prep before to understand what I\u2019m doing. \n\nTLDR: the whole experience around my chem labs make the class a living hell.", "author": "Fan_Commercial", "created": 1632882816, "retrieved": 1632945406, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heoyczo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxlxqf/how_to_get_through_a_lab/heoyczo/", "text": "Caffeine or maybe doing exercise like running or just doing jumping jacks to get the blood flowing might help.", "author": "FamishedHippopotamus", "created": 1632896024, "upvotes": 1}}}
