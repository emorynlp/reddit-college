  "text": "Applying for an internal scholarship. How detailed is this expected to be? There's no word limit. \n \nMy plan is to go into graduate school and aim for a PhD. My career goal is to pursue research. The fact of the matter is that my major is broad, and there are many different fields I could potentially go into. I plan on using my undergraduate years to explore and find an answer to that.\n \nIf it would help my chances, I could pick one of my current fields of interests and throw out a relevant university option as my dream school. Though if I did that, my answer wouldn't be entirely genuine. And is it a good idea to talk another school when writing an essay for my current university?",
