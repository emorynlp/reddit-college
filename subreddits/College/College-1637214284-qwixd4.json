  "title:": "Etiquette For Bumping Into Past Fling On Campus",
  "text": "I (21F) was seeing someone (22F) for roughly a month before the pandemic started. We never even officially split, over the pandemic as the months went on we just silently both went on to date other people. \n\nNow, all semester long I\u2019ve been bumping into her on campus - 99% of the time she\u2019s with her new BF. We both immediately look away to avoid an awkward conversation. What\u2019s the etiquette? \n\n1. I don\u2019t particularly want to talk to her, it\u2019s just impolite to see someone you know and not say hi. \n2. I don\u2019t want to make things awkward between her and her BF since 99% of the time I see her she\u2019s with him. \nThanks!",

I spent years running into my boyfriends ex girlfriend, who always seemed to have a million friends around her and looked cool and fun while I would be looking like a pajama monster and eating cereal alone.\nIt honestly stressed me out so much for so long. My recommendation would be to politely smile and wave (then fade that into just a wave, and finally just a nod.)",

Love is hard, and things like this don\u2019t always have an immediate solution.\n\nYou could always text her or call her and explain this to her, she might feel the same way.",
