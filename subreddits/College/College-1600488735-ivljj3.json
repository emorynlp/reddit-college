Of course, feel free to ignore this if you think you\u2019re fine without them! That\u2019s also totally understandable. \n\nI\u2019ve found a couple of things that have helped me take notes over the years. Most of these are for handwritten notes but they may work with digital as well:\n\n1) Not writing down exact quotes\n\n2) Developing a very minor shorthand such as: esp (especially), w/o (without), w/ (with ______) and this is more specific to my major\u2014m/b (mind-body), consc (consciousness)\n\n3) Having free-flowing notes. Rather than bullet points I write down a sentence and if a word triggers the next point (which it usually does) I\u2019ll draw an arrow downwards and write that, and so on and so on. If the thought stops, I add a bullet point. I also have hierarchies like bullet point is main point, l-shaped arrow right under is a sub point, straight arrow is sub-sub point.

Find what works for you! \n\n3) Cursive writing helps a lot with taking notes as you don\u2019t have to take your hand off the page for too long and you go a lot faster \n\n4) Use a pen and not a pencil and eraser.
