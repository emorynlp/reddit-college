  "text": "I work as an accountant for a CPA firm. I got a masters in accounting. I wanted to try life sciences(like P.T or PA) during college, but I always thought that it would be too difficult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've decided to take a couple online science classes while working full time, and if I can get As, I may quit my job and go into life science instead.  I was surprised at the class averages tho. The average on the last 2 tests is about a 67  or a 68. The first test was about a 80. I've talked to ppl in anatomy and the averages there was about a 60-69 on most tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn acct. under grad, the class averages range from about a 75-82, with the average being around 78. In my general business classes they were around 80 or so. Psy. classes also have a much higher average(like 80ish)\n\nThoughts?",

But I'm not sure it is fair or true to say those things.\n\nOne interesting thought that occurred to me, is that these majors tend to be more overstuffed with people who feel \"obligated\" to be there. Parental pressures, people chasing a high salary, prestigious job titles, high profile companies, job security or \"practical\" skills etc. No offense, but most people that major in history, or art, or education, or English aren't chasing dollars, and may not even know exactly where they hope to end up for a career, just that they are interested in learning more about that topic at a high level. Or some of them may know exactly where they want to end up as a career, like museum curator or freelance illustrator, they are just careers that people may find more enjoyable, fulfilling, or passionate about, rather than a desk job.\n\nAnd just to be clear, there's nothing wrong with that, it takes all types to have a well rounded and high functioning society, neighborhood, country, or even family. It's why GEs are important, even though they felt really obnoxious sometimes.",

              "text": ">if you let the wrong person become a doctor, people will die\n\nI would like to contest that. This argument is overblown. You do not need to have a high level of intelligence to perform a doctor's duties. One of the main problems with health systems is the undersupply of doctors so we should be allowing more people to become doctors. This helps prevent overwork, lowers salaries to a reasonable amount (say $100k for the average MD specialty) and makes health systems significantly cheaper and better. If people can become successful artists, scientists or accountants, why shouldn't they be given the opportunity to become a doctor?",

The people who can't hack it get weeded out eventually, but they certainly usually stay pre-med for a while and even often complete all the pre-med coursework before they change paths.",
