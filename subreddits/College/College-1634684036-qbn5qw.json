  "text": "Anyone that has fallen behind in a class before, did you manage to catch up? Today I was taking a quiz and realized the quiz had material from previous chapters that I didn't look over enough. I would say I basically remember nothing from that chapter. I'm also behind maybe 2 chapters for another class. Do you think it's doable to cover all those chapters in maybe a weekend? How do you stop yourself from falling behind/getting lost in class? How can I improve my study methods? I don't browse reddit or do anything else that takes a considerable amount of time away aside from a few hours of work.",
