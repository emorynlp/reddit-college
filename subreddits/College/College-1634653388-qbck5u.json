  "text": "Like the title says, I had the great luck of getting sick the day before the start of my midterms which kind of sucks ass since I already prepared so hard for them and am dreading have to restudy everything. Additionally, most of my classes are ill-equipped to handle possible remote learning meaning I will most likely have to self-study a crap ton and do guesswork on top of all the shit I need to makeup. Potentially have to be in isolation except I have three other roommates and a shared bathroom which means I can't isolate here. Don't think I can go back home and can't room in a dorm since I live off campus and this is only an option for housing students. So I'm left with the vague \"other suitable\" housing options. Have to miss a fun trip (probably the least important but still sucks) with friends planned this coming weekend.\n\nBeen trying to rack my brain for where I could have gotten sick (and potentially COVID). The most at risk things I did were eat with 4 friends and then attend 2 school clubs (fairly large group I'd say 30-50). Definitely on the riskier side but with a pretty high vaccination rate and a good 99% of people are masked so I thought it'd be okay. This is coming from a person who did not meet up with a single person outside of my immediate family for 14 months, not even once. I know that just because I was strict then does not mean I'm better protected now but it sucks that after all the loneliness I put myself through (although I know this is not a unique experience since a lot of people feel that way), I still might get COVID in the end.",
