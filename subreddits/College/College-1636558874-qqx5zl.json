  "text": "Pretty self explanatory. I'm not intending on asking anything about the admission process: applications, letters of recommendation, early admission, etc. I'm just curious if I can ask questions about the subjectively viewed quality of some colleges, if that is allowed. Like \"How do you feel about x college?\" or \"does y college teach a good z course?\" I'm not looking for help or someone holding my hand through choosing a good college, I'm really just curious how people view/feel about certain colleges and their courses.",
