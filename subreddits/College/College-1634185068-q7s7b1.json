  "text": "\nhey guys,\ni applied for an RA position at my university. typically when working in retail or fast food I call the job to ask for an update on my application.  Have two other on campus jobs and for both of those I was contacted within 4days so I didn\u2019t end up calling. For this RA position idk if I should call to check on my application since I haven\u2019t had to for other on campus jobs? I applied 4 days ago. Anyone think I should or shouldn\u2019t? Why? Thanks!\nAlso any advice for this specific interview lmk!!!",

My school doesn't even look at the new hire applications until the day after the application closes (I'm an RA who helps with hiring). I'd give it some more time, you'll likely have an interview and possibly a group process you'll have to go through.",

For the standard interview I'd suggest practicing standard questions (why do you want this job, tell us a little about yourself, etc). The group process is all about seeing how you interact with other people. Just stay calm and be yourself. My school has 4 activities that they have applicants go through. I'm not going to tell you what the activities are (just in case your school has similar ones). As long as you show you can interact with other people you'll be good. Don't say nothing but don't be talking the entire time.",
