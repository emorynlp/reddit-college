  "title:": "Is it required to email your professor about missing their class if attendance isn't considered mandatory?",
  "text": "Last week I had to travel across the country to celebrate Thanksgiving with my family and I missed the recitation for one of my classes because of it. My class is about 300 students and the recitation section is about 30. My professor always told us that while she recommends we attend recitation in order to get extra help with the assignments in there, it is not actually required and that she never takes attendance.\n\nBecause of that and the fact that I had no questions about the assignment and was able to successfully complete it on my own, I didn't think there was any need to email her to let her know I wouldn't be there that day. So I didn't.\n\nThe problem is this professor knows my face and name because I ask a lot of questions during lecture, so now I'm worried that she noticed I wasn't at recitation and is going to be offended that I didn't let her know in advance.\n\nObviously it's too late to do anything about this now, but for the future, do I need to email a professor in advance to inform them of my absence if they explicitly state that they don't care about attendance?\n\ntl;dr: Professor told us attendance in recitation isn't mandatory but she always recommends we go. I had to miss a recitation due to travel plans and didn't email her to let her know. For the future, is it best practice to email a professor about missing a class where attendance isn't required, or does it not matter?",

      "text": "Prof here. Your professor stated attendance isn\u2019t required and especially with a 300 person class I\u2019m sure she is trying to avoid the email clutter. Don\u2019t email her now just looking for emotional labor (what response would you want from her? Probably something to make you feel better? That\u2019s not really her job and I\u2019m certain she is not offended you didn\u2019t go to class.)\n\nJust let it go. Attendance isn\u2019t required, you made a decision to prioritize something else with your time. That\u2019s fine.",

      "text": "So, once you have already missed the class don't email about it. I usually send emails out day before or day of missing (but before class time). Sometimes I have to send follow up emails with doctor's notes after the scheduled class time but since I notified beforehand I feel good. One of my professors always wants homework sent via email before the start of class if you are missing even with a note (I had one doctor's that semester and one E.R.)",
