  "text": "So first I\u2019d like to say that yeah I should\u2019ve held off on college because I\u2019ve been an emotional wreck. But that\u2019s not who I usually am. I know who I am now, but now it\u2019s the end of the first semester and I\u2019ve failed 2/3 classes. I\u2019m meeting with my academic advisor to explain everything. I know I can do the work and study. Everything was going fine the first few weeks but over the last year I have not been myself and a lot of shit has been on my mind. I feel I\u2019m getting better now, and want to continue to retake the classes I\u2019ve failed this upcoming semester and take summer classes to pick up as much as I can. Now I could go the medical route and blame bi polar for this, but there\u2019s other stuff that has had me in the frame of mind I was in. I don\u2019t know how to tell my family about any of it. They all had high hopes for me as I go into pre med. should I just retake and do the summer? Or try again next year and focus on me? Like I said I want to and know that I can, and I think I\u2019ll be better after winter break. But my grandma was probably right; I should\u2019ve cancelled this year and enjoyed some time to myself before pursuing. I feel like a huge disappointment rn. And my self esteem has been shit lately",
