  "text": "About a week ago I got 100% on my second quiz for my bio class and after going to my profs office hours to talk to her about my grade in her class (91 average but midterms are coming up and I wanted to make sure I\u2019m on track to keep my A- or raise it to an A) she told me that I was the only person to get a perfect score in all of her classes and congratulated me. \n\nThis gave me the confidence I needed to finally email her a day or two ago about research opportunities in her lab (they\u2019re usually reserved for juniors and seniors + I really respect her and was afraid of rejection.) \n\nToday she emailed me back thanking me for the email, saying that I\u2019m an exceptional student, and that she\u2019d be happy to show me around the department and talk about research opportunities in and outside of her lab.\n\nWas so fucking excited it took me hours to calm down and formulate a good response email and now we\u2019re setting up a meeting time. I\u2019m so fucking happy and I\u2019ve been having a bad day so I really needed this and wanted to share with u guys !!",
