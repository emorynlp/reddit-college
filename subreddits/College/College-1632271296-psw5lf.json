  "text": "I just started school at UCSD and quickly realized this is not for me. I\u2019m interested in applying for spring or possibly fall transfer to NYU for this upcoming year and am just wondering if this is even possible? Do people ever transfer as fourth years or is it too difficult to get in?",
