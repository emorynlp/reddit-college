  "text": "Hi, i\u2019m in my 3rd year of college and decided to also major in Marketing. I recently switched from Nursing to Public Health this Spring without doing much research on the major. Although the major itself is interesting, I\u2019ve come to find out that after a bachelors degree in Public Health it is hard to find a job unless you have your Masters in Public Health. I\u2019m super burnt out with constant work and school, so i\u2019ve decided not to get my Masters right out of getting my bachelors degree. I have been minoring in Business since freshman year and I have only taken Marketing classes which i\u2019ve found super interesting. \n\nI still haven\u2019t declared Marketing as my second major yet, because i\u2019m nervous. I feel like I won\u2019t be good enough for Marketing because I am really shy and quiet (also have really bad anxiety). I\u2019ve always seen myself in the business field, but the only thing keeping me back is my anxiety and my fear of presenting in front of people. I also have so many presentations to do in my Public Health courses that are coming up that i\u2019m super anxious about. \n\nAnyways, anyone who is a business major/marketing major have advice for me?",

College is an excellent time to work on getting over a fear of speaking to individuals or groups.  There are many opportunities in a college environment to work on your social skills.  Be sure to take a Public Speaking course.  If necessary, seek counseling as well.  Become active and participate in activities.  Those who are afraid to interact with others will be hampered in many careers, so start to fix that problem now.",
