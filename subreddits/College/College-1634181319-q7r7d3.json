  "text": "I\u2019m in my second year of college and my plan is to pursue a career in SCM. \n\nThe problem: I suck at school and I struggle passing classes. I show up and do everything that I can but I always find myself with C\u2019s and D\u2019s. \n\nSCM and business as a whole has always been something that I\u2019ve been very interested in pursuing, but my bad grades have me thinking I\u2019m wasting my time. Also I\u2019m so miserable in school. I don\u2019t think anyone really enjoys school but I\u2019ve been so unhappy lately. I guess I\u2019m just not motivated? Idk. \n\nI was thinking about taking a gap semester but everyone says \u201cif you take a break you\u2019ll never go back\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Should I keep pushing myself? Take a break? Or just find a different passion",

      "text": "Something that might help you is research on [Growth Mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/). Briefly put, it's science about people who've failed, recalibrated, and keep working until they succeed. You may need a break. You may also just need to change your approach. This research helped me when I wanted to quit. Good luck!",
