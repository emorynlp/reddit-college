  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at Utah state and I\u2019m really struggling right now. My classes aren\u2019t going well at all, I have no motivation for anything related to school even though my degree is something I really want to do. It\u2019s kinesiology if you\u2019re wondering, and I\u2019m just not sure if college is really right for me right now. My mental health has been going down and I feel like I\u2019m missing out on so many opportunities to go have fun but I absolutely don\u2019t want to get stuck doing a job I don\u2019t like or being paid less than I need. Does anyone have experience taking a few years off or any advice in general? It seems like if I say no to college altogether I\u2019ll hate myself later but if I keep doing it then I\u2019ll hate myself now, especially because I would be committed to getting a job as a physical therapist ASAP after graduation.",
