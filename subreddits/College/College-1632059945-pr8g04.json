Every \"genius\" accomplished what they did by working hard, and yes, they did have high baseline intelligence, but they also put it to good use. Many people have intelligence but don't bother to do anything with it, so it's not *that* uncommon to come across people who are intelligent but can't actually do much. \n\nLastly, intelligence is multidimensional. I myself tend to have high aptitude in things that many people consider \"hard,\" but low aptitude in things that many people consider \"easy,\" and I get many, many people who assume I'm good at everything just because I'm good at math. Fuck no. That's not how reality (or at least my reality) works. On the flip side, people sometimes assume I'm an idiot because I'm slow to process what they say sometimes. \n\nPeople need to stop with these stupid assumptions and start treating people like the individuals they are.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632060723, "upvotes": 95}}}
