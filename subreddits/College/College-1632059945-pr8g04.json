We have a lot of conservatives but not a lot of Trump supporters-- we had a huge (like 20 point) swing in my district from red to blue and it was almost entirely due to Trump (slightly due to demographic shifts though). \n\nThe town I grew up in tended to vote 50/50 which I think forced our community to be one where people could get along with people with different political beliefs but we (the US) are so polarized now it's like we live in different worlds. \n\nMinimum wage isn't necessary if there are other structures in place to prevent working people from being in poverty (like strong unions, universal basic income, or other social programs to make sure people have their basic needs met). The only problem is that our social safety net is not strong enough, so I support minimum wage in the sense that it's better than nothing, but I don't actually believe it's the *best* way of building a middle class.\n\nMy understanding is that the current inflation is caused by supply chain issues related to the pandemic is temporary. I live in a high COL area that raised it's minimum wage significantly but is doing it in stages and that itself hasn't had an impact on inflation, as far as I know. I'm not an economist, but my guess is that a large, sudden increase in minimum wage in an area where many people make close to minimum wage is going to have very different ramifications than a gradual increase in minimum wage in an area where few people make close to minimum wage.",

      "text": "As a grad student in a field that has a stereotype of being for \"intelligent\" people, I can tell you that this is because even smart people have limited brain resources and after spending all your hours in a day reading highly technical research you have barely any brainpower left to think about anything else. \n\nThat's my take, at least. \n\nMy other take is that generally speaking, people put \"intelligence\" on a pedestal like it makes you great at everything, when in reality that was never the case and it's absurd to think it's the case. Every \"genius\" accomplished what they did by working hard, and yes, they did have high baseline intelligence, but they also put it to good use. Many people have intelligence but don't bother to do anything with it, so it's not *that* uncommon to come across people who are intelligent but can't actually do much. \n\nLastly, intelligence is multidimensional. I myself tend to have high aptitude in things that many people consider \"hard,\" but low aptitude in things that many people consider \"easy,\" and I get many, many people who assume I'm good at everything just because I'm good at math. Fuck no. That's not how reality (or at least my reality) works. On the flip side, people sometimes assume I'm an idiot because I'm slow to process what they say sometimes. \n\nPeople need to stop with these stupid assumptions and start treating people like the individuals they are.",

What makes his way of speaking \"bad\" and \"proper\" English \"proper?\" It's because we as a society chose to make it that way, but why? Is it *inherently* better? Or do we place more value on the natural speaking habits of wealthy white people than of people from other backgrounds?",

Even if it's an English class or some other language class, when you're in a multilingual country, you'll expect even the professor will slip in one language or another when speaking.
