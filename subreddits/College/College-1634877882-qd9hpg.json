  "text": "I think the 10 multiple choices should be OK for me and I should get all of them, but the last trough question I integrated with disk (but I think integrating a wrong integral and getting its value will still give me the marks) and left 4 of the marks in the polar question blank.\nI think I can still get around 50-55/70, so is this OK? I think I have totally messed up and can only get C. The mean is likely to be very high...\nMy uni has a policy that even if you retake a failed class, the failed grade will still be included in your GPA, so it is very important to pass the first time.",
