      "text": "What are the housing details? Are they dorms/suites/apartments? There are different ways of doing gender inclusive housing. Some will put roommates together that are the same gender but have a mix of men and women dorms on a floor. Others will segregate the floors and a few will put anyone together in a dorm no matter the gender. If they're mixed like the 3rd, are you in a traditional dorm? or do you get your own small room? What are you worried about when it comes to gender mixed housing?",

I was asked what my personality was like and what my hobbies are. My roommate isn't the opposite gender of me but majority of the apartments are mixed. Majority of people here just want to go to class and work, study, ect. I haven't heard of anything happening so far but I wouldn't say for sure. It will all depend on the people around you and you won't know that until you start living there.",
