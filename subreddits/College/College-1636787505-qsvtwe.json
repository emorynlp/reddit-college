  "text": "I have no idea how to initiate conversation with girls in college. I have shit ton of boys but only two female friends in college. Like bruh. It\u2019s maybe because I\u2019m not the talkative type.\n\nI also was hoping girls would talk first but boi was I wrong. They never start the convo first especially in parties etc. I just don\u2019t know what to do and talk really. I would look like a total weirdo if I just appeared out of nowhere and said YO MY NAME IS tuduun. Plus, after getting their socials after first convo is stupid af. I also kinda feel intimidated by the surrounding people in class. Like they could hear what I am talking with her and they may judge me. \n\nI\u2019ll probably cringe so hard after seeing this post few years later but screw it",

      "text": "1) Don't talk in class. If you don't want to pay attention to the lecture, why be there? Just go to a bar or cafe or something, it's not like your professors care if you're actually in attendance or not. Hell, if they're in your class, just ask if they want to grab coffee after. You'll get a yes like, >50% of the time.\n\n\n2) Girls are just people, so just talk to them the same way you would your boys. Ask questions. Listen to the answers. Provide compensatory information about yourself. Listen to questions. Answer questions. Make a joke occasionally. Rinse, wash, and repeat, it's really that easy. \n\n\n3) Again, girls are just people: sometimes you don't vibe with people, even after getting their socials. It's a numbers game, if you keep going you'll continually keep on collecting the people who are the same variety of weirdo as you (at least in some capacity), and then talking to them is so easy that you'll never want to stop.\n\n\n4) YO, WHAT UP? MY NAME IS... is a perfectly acceptable conversation opener, but you need to continue talking after you exchange your names. This is customary in most cultures. You introduce yourselves, then you talk, usually in turns, normally regarding a shared topic. Ask them about themselves, people like talking about themselves generally. If you're at an activity, talk about the activity. See if either of you know anyone in common there. What you say matters about 1000% less than how you say it, which is where the Golden Rule comes in handy: think about how *you* would like/not like being talked to, consider how you're talking to the other person, and adjust accordingly. The name of the game is being open, enthusiastic, and attentive. \n\n\n5) Don't worry about it. Everyone is awkward, everyone is internally kicking themselves over dumb bullshit, and we all love talking to other people bc it gives us a second to not be trapped in our own heads, beholden only to the most annoying voice in existence, the one in our own heads. Just have fun, and other people will want to have fun with you. Thinking too much is definitely the less dominant strategy in this case, you're better off just launching yourself off the diving board rather than looking for too long over the edge. Humans are very literally born and bred to socialize, evolution has been cooking this shit up for like 4 million years. We have an intuitive understanding of how to do it well, but we trip up when we get in our own way and try to overanalyze the situation. So, just say fuck it, have a good ass time, do what feels right, and don't be an asshole! It's in your nature!",

      "text": "I'm a woman in STEM and I'm one of the only few girls in my classes and workplace full of guys. I get this same vibe with the guys that starting conversations may be intimidating and feel awkward -- this makes us feel excluded even more. Girls are usually pretty sensitive to other people's emotions, so if you feel awkward we know and feel it too. I guarantee you no one in college will judge you for talking to a girl unless you say something inappropriate or act weird around her. College is the time where it's pretty acceptable to talk to the opposite sex without being teased about it. College is preparing you for a job, if you don't learn how to talk to your classmates, you probably won't know how to talk to your co-workers or boss. \n\nI'd say the best way to break the ice is to find a similar interest and involve them in a conversation, either in a group or individually, no need for introductions right off. Parties are hard to do this as it's a mix of different people with different lives. In school clubs, classes, organizations, or workspace you know you already share at least one common interest, and that's a good starting point. As examples you can ask about their major, their thoughts on an upcoming project, or simply ask about their day.",

They do it without a vice.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say sharing a bottle of wine with friends or having a shot for someone\u2019s birthday is a bad thing. However, telling a young man who\u2019s scared to talk to potential love or sexual interests that alcohol is the answer (the question he asked is about talking to girls) is wrong. It can lead to someone feeling that it is a crutch, and the confidence you gain isn\u2019t earned and therefore easily goes away. If he works on himself and his self confidence and social skills, that is much better advice than \u201chave some alcohol, that\u2019ll do the trick\u201d.\n\nThere are people who get together and drink and have fun all of the time! That\u2019s great, because it\u2019s for an occasion such as a holiday or meeting up with friends for a get together. However, using it so that you can speak to your crush is a bad way to use alcohol, in my humble opinion.\n\nFurther, a great deal of people regret the things they did or said when drinking. The next day, they feel like shit. For some it may help grease the wheels a bit, but for others it leads to bad choices, whether that\u2019s just being off and looking a little stupid or saying something you possibly shouldn\u2019t have, or something on the other hand like hurting someone emotionally or physically. Or driving.\n\nLiquor and drinking and partying sometimes are fine of course, but this isn\u2019t the way to teach a young man to have the self confidence to be a man and be his best self when presenting himself to the opposite (or same) sex. Nor do I think it\u2019s the best way to model the reasons one might indulge in drinking. It\u2019s just bad advice to me, but I respect your opinion. I think what I\u2019ve said here pretty much sums up why I feel the way I do, but everyone is different.",

How do I find friends?\u201d Like talk to people, be awkward and sit next to them or something and you\u2019ll either become friends or not. It can literally just be searched, but there\u2019s still unlimited asking of these same questions.",

Back home i knew my whole hs, knew tons of females so I always had options to make moves. But since i moved to the US and gone to college I barely know any. Part of that was that I spent my entire freshman+sophomore year dating a girl from hs so my stupid ass was making literally 0 moves and 0 effort to get to know females while everyone else was. My dumb ass even turned down a bid from a frat that was paired up with some of the hottest sororities on campus\ud83d\ude2d And by the time i was single all the cliques had formed and it was too late. Trust me i punch myself in the dick as a part of my morning ritual every day since I realized how bad i fucked up. I genuinely don\u2019t have many regrets in life but thats one of them.\n\nSince all that dubstep shows have been my main move if I need some pussy, and in all seriousness mdma can definitely help with talking to femals\ud83d\ude02 as for class, i never made a single friend in class, female or male, it\u2019s just not that kind of social environment, don\u2019t even bother.",
