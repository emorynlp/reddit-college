  "text": "So last night about 1 AM, I woke up because it was freezing and I noticed the AC was full blast. So, I turned on the heat. About 10 minutes later, my roommate flips out, repeatedly calls me retarded and says hes gonna fuck me up. I immediately emailed Residence life asking for a room change, but it's gonna be tough since they are known for being a mess. Am I overreacting? what should I do? Also, he is a transfer and he's 27 and much stronger than me, so I really don't feel safe around him anymore.",

Roommate disagreements are bound to happen, but yours overreacted and if I were in your place I would feel exactly as you did. That\u2019s grounds for serious punishment.",

Let them both know about what happened and exactly how you feel. Like literally pour your emotion out and let them know so they know it\u2019s a serious issue.",
