      "text": "I usually offer this response to those who are seeing out a career in technology, but it really does apply here as well:  \n\n\nThe best and fastest path to high-compensation in your career is to be good at whatever you do.  \n\nNot kinda good, not a little better than your peers, I mean really fucking damned good.  \n\nThe best way to get that good at whatever you do, is to invest personal time and focused effort in the pursuit of your career and relevant academic/technical skills.  \n\nYour working career is going to last 40 years, plus or minus.  \n\nYou can easily lie to yourself and push yourself through a class that you hate. Or two classes.  \n\nIf you have strong self-discipline, you can probably even push yourself through an entire degree that you dislike.  \n\nBut now, to access the high-level of compensation that you want, you need to ALSO invest your personal time.  \n\nThat means joining career-focused clubs, and participating in discussion & activities at a focused & meaningful level.  \nThat means taking the tough classes and not just the bare-minimums.  \nThat means reading books, blogs and professionally-focused convention materials above and beyond whatever your professors assign.  \n\nThis will mean internships and/or Co-OP work experience and it might even mean undergraduate research to help unlock higher-quality graduate school opportunities.  \n\n-----  \n\nIt is really, really easy to underestimate the cost of the commitment you are signing up for when you focus on compensation, and ignore the critical self-discovery process to learn what the hell you personally enjoy.  \n\nYou can find happiness in all kinds of aspects of a job, but if you have to force the issue, if you have to lie to yourself or force yourself or emotionally injure yourself to pursue compensation over an actual career interest, then you're probably not going to make the right investments to unlock the compensation you are inflicting all this pain on yourself to try to access.",

      "text": "Figure out what kinds of jobs you might like. Pick the major that will get you there. Picking a major *only* because it has potential for lots of money (or because a stranger on the internet said it was cool) is a recipe for a soul-sucking career that you hate. \n\nIf you don't know, then it's time to start reflecting on that. What am I good at? What do I like to do? What do I find meaningful and rewarding? What is a job I would like? Maybe you can shadow someone for a day to see what their job is like. Take to career services and ask what types of jobs will fit those majors. Do some research and soul searching. \n\nThe one on the list that sticks out to me is psychology. While this is a very popular major, it really doesn't offer a lot in terms of employability beyond the fact that you have a bachelor's. If you really  want a job in that field, you should go for a Master's or PhD. I know lots of people with a bachelor's in psych struggling to get a big-kid job. If you're willing to sign on for extra school, go for it. Otherwise, best to go with something else.",
