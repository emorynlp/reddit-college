I\u2019ve taken 2 extended breaks from school due to mental health issues that made keeping up academically impossible.  The first time was in 2018, it was my 3rd year living on campus at my first university, I ended up taking a year and a half off after having a mild psychotic break and falling into a deep depression.  I quit in the middle of spring quarter.  Later I ended up going to a university close to home, but during my 3rd semester there I fell into another deep depression and had to quit (this was fall 2020).  I haven\u2019t been in school since.  After a lot of consideration I\u2019ve decided that physics just isn\u2019t for me and I don\u2019t think I could finish if I tried (my core GPA is bellow what I need to graduate).  So I\u2019m planning on switching to computer science.   The thing is, I really don\u2019t feel ready to go back to school anytime soon, and I\u2019m itching to move out of my parents\u2019 house.  I know the traditional path is that you go to college, get a degree, get a good paying job, and THEN move out, but I\u2019m wondering if it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if I tried moving out on my own, kinda getting my footing in adulthood more, and then going back to school?  I feel like I\u2019m not progressing much in life and I want to change that, but I\u2019m afraid if I jump back into schooling as I am now I\u2019m just going to hit the floor again.  Anyone have any thoughts or been in a similar situation?", "author": "zeurosis", "created": 1632542675, "retrieved": 1632800353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he6sur5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puz9kx/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_move_out_before_going_back_to/he6sur5/", "text": "I did the whole school/moving/full-time job thing backwards and I think my experiencemakes me a way better student than the traditional students. I did a semester of school, quit due to a bad relationship, joined America's and lived on my own, had an anxiety breakdown a year later, ended up living at home, working full-time, and getting better at coping with severe anxiety. I moved out, met my super supportive now husband, went back to school, and now I have a great GPA, strong references, and am graduating this May. My point is there are a ton of people that bounce around a little and end up with happy, successful lives. If you think you are emotionally and financially prepare to move out of your parent's house, do it. School can come later.", "author": "NeuroticMess95", "created": 1632548725, "upvotes": 2}, "he6lk2f": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puz9kx/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_move_out_before_going_back_to/he6lk2f/", "text": "ASU.edu has an online program that allows you to transfer in 75% of your degree (50%/60hrs lower level). Their ea.asu.edu classes are $425 and you only pay $25 upfront and the rest of you like your grade. You take 12 hours like that and qualify to get in. Getting the degree while you have parental support would make life so much better. I've been impressed with what my brother has done on this program. He was in a dark place, came home, and was made to take just one of these classes as rent for staying. It went ok. He got a job and took another class  and on and on, and he will graduate this year.\n\n I know I wouldn't go back if I quit, and I think you should look at ASU. They are really diverse and everyone has a story, so you wouldn't be different really from anyone else. You are obviously smart to even consider physics. My other brother went to a really high fauluting school for math or CS and majored in a real science instead. He got a job in cs based on his high school projects on his resume. Get the degree to show you can jump through hoops and stick to something. Then your experience will do the work on your resume.", "author": "CindsSurprise", "created": 1632544145, "upvotes": 1}}}
