  "text": " i am majoring in computer science in collge right now and im a junior i honestly dont feel like im good enough to get a job after college, im getting C's in all my classes and im just barely scraping by, i dont know if i'll ever be good enough to work in my field. And i find it incredibly difficult to study on my own because theres just so much to learn and i learn better by being taught. i feel like i get the concepts of the code i should be implementing but when it comes to actually writing the code i feel like i know nothing, i really just understand the basics and thats it. another reason i feel like i wont be good enough is that when i learn a concept whether it be the logic or the code i can pick it up pretty easily but i immediatly forget it. i dont know what to do because i do really like compsci but i feel like i will never be good at it. its kind of too late to switch majors, and i also have no idea what i would switch to. i cant see myself doing anything else probably because i've never really thought about it.",
