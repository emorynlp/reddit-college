The most common topic that has ever been on our subreddit surrounds making friends in college. I wrote up this little guide in hopes it will help some of you. If anyone else has suggestions- please leave them down in the comments below. \n\n\n**All posts related to making friends in college will be removed**\n\nInstead- redirect users here or if you have a question post it here. \n\n**Where did the Back to School Megathread go?**\n\nIs it still [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/92qjfg/back_to_school_megathread/) but I unstickied it because I think this thread is more important. I will add automod config to try to redirect users to this thread if they make posts about making friends and hope it will help much more with subreddit management\n\n----\n\n**FAQ About Friends in College**\n\n\n**What should I do when I arrive on college to meet people**\n\nOkay so the first week on campus- especially in the dorms- there is a bit of magic in the air. Everyone is nervous and while some people may have friends from highschool or from their childhood- pretty much everyone is looking to make friends. Take advantage of this!!!!\n\n* Be friendly and talk with people on your floor and in your building. Introduce yourself. Say your major, where you're from, what hobbies you have, etc. Its all small-talk but later on when you see them in the hall it will be easier to strike up conversation \n\n* Take Initiative. Instead of just saying hi to people- invite some people out to dinner. Or be that one person that organizes dinner with the entire floor (its not weird. Its college. Just fucking do it). If large groups scare you- find a few friendly faces on your floor and ask if they're up for dinner- or going to that cool, definitely not lame freshman event on campus. Or ask if someone wants to go watch the opening football game with you. Or ask if they just want to explore campus. It may be awkward asking people you don't know- but it will be worth it as the friendships grow stronger. \n\n* Keep your door open. Even if you don't take initiative other people probably will. But if you stay locked up in your room all day then no one will know you're there and you will feel left out. Keep the door open and I promise you there's a good chance you'll just get invited places. Even if you keep your door open don't just stay in your room staring at the wall. Go to the common areas- if you see people socializing just go them. Its not awkward. Its college. Just walk up and say \"Hi I'm chevy- where are you guys from\" or literally anything no one cares. You might meet some cool people, you might not. Might make some friends this way, might not. Still worth a shot. I made some of my friends in college the first week by just randomly talking about anime and CS with strangers- anything can happen. \n\n* Always say yes. If someone asks you to go to some random book event in the campus center SAY YES. When you start saying no and stop saying yes people will stop asking you to go places. You know all those lame sounding events in the dorms? Yeah no one really goes to them because they care about face painting. They go to meet people. Put yourself out there and don't reject opportunities to meet people\n\n**What if I go to a commuter campus, community college, or live off campus?**\n\nNot to worry my friend. Remember there are people in your shoes too and they want to make friends as well. \n\nThe main advice I would give for people in this situation is to try and stay on campus as much as you can. If you are a commuter student- don't just head home after class. Stay on campus! Engage in any club activities and set your study schedule around these activities. Or get a job on campus. Or just study at the library on campus or wherever! Its hard to make friends when you're never at school. \n\nAlso try talking to a lot of people in your classes. Obviously don't disrupt actual class time- but asking people in your classes if they want to study together or even just saying hi can start friendships. Don't be shy! \n\n**Its after the first week of school and I still have no friends. What can I do?** \n\nThere are many things you can do! Here are some suggestions: \n\n* Talk to people in classes. Since class is well underway- you can talk to people in class about current assignments, upcoming assignments, upcoming tests, etc. Its not weird- its college. People are nice! If it is farther in the semester you can ask someone if they want to work on an assignment together or study together. I've never been told no when I asked someone- you typically learn better when you work together anyways!!\n\n* Join a club on campus. Its easier to meet people when you share a common interest- and if you join the hiking club because you like hiking then surely you'll meet people there who also like hiking. Now you have a conversation topic of \"hiking\" you can talk to them about. Yay! If you have no interests you can always just join a club related to your major or career goals and socialize with people there (but if you join the club for your major you can't use the famous 'what's your major' question when first meeting someone). You can also join clubs if you have no knowledge of them and are potentially looking at a new hobby. \nIn any case- clubs typically advertise to (mainly) freshmen at the start of each semester- so if your school has an area where the clubs set up little information booths like my school did- just go and talk to some members and get a vibe for the club. If the people seem cool- just join and hope for the best! \n\n\n* Get a job on campus. I know, it sounds crazy. But a lot of jobs in college are social and I know I personally made a lot of friends through my job. Even the people working in the dishroom at the dining halls in my school typically talk to each other and work shifts with each other frequently- so its a great way to meet coworkers. And there's never a chance you'll run out of things to talk about at your job because worst case scenario just complain about how working sucks and everyone will agree with you! Win-win. \n\n* If you live in a dorm: Talk to people!!! A lot of freshmen take the same classes. If you see someone in a study lounge (or similar) and they are working on an assignment for your class- there's no harm in asking them if they want to study with you! Or if you recognize someone in your building from one of your classes you can literally just be like \"Oh hey aren't you in Accounting 101?\". Then you can progress the conversation into asking them if they want to work on class stuff together- and if they live in the same building it'd be super easy to do so!\n\n\n* Partake in random activities! At my school a lot of people would play pool/ping pong in the dorms and a lot of people would just ask to play or jump in and I got to meet some people that way. Or people play Frisbee outside, or random other games. Its not weird to ask someone if you can play- I promise you. Worst they can say is no- best they can say is yes and you end up with new friends (and have a cool game to play with them too!). \n\n\n* Go to parties/other social events. You don't have to drink/smoke/do anything you don't like. Parties have lots of people and its a very social setting- so obviously the potential to meet people there is possible. Even if you're awkward or introverted- plenty of people like that go to parties too. There are also just random events happening daily on campus- all of them can be good ways to find people to talk to!\n\n**I am a sophomore/junior/senior/ and have no friends can I still make friends?** \n\nOf course. People are looking to make friends no matter what year they are. I made new friends every year I attended college- people do not just stick with who they met freshman year. \n\n**I don't like my friends, what do I do? Am I stuck with them?**\nNo, Silly. You can always get new friends. If you don't like your current friendgroup- make sure you don't spend all your time with them. Try to branch out by meeting new people in classes, joining a club, getting a new job on campus, etc. Eventually when you make new friends- you can leave your old friends behind. There are other tips earlier in the guide- you can always follow those if you relied a bit too much on the dorm magic to make your freshman friends!\n\n**Do all your close friends come from freshman year?**\n\nNo. While its easier for friendships to become stronger if they start freshman year because you have 4 years to develop a strong bond with someone- close friends come from any year. The person I lived with for a few years I met freshman year- but the person I would call my closest friend I met my sophomore year in college. Some of the closest people that I remain in contact with after graduation I only met late Junior year or even senior year of college. You can make close friends any year- you never know who you may end up meeting!\n\n**Am I the only one that feels so lonely?** \n\nNo. \n\nLike I said- it is the most common topic on our sub. Lots of college students struggle with the adjustment. You are not alone. Stay strong and try to follow the tips I outlined in the rest of this little guide to make some friends. If you put in the effort I would find it very difficult to believe that you can't make a single good friend. \n\n\n**Still having trouble making friends?**\n\n\n**RELAX**. Making friends takes time and effort. You cannot expect to make close friends immediately. Continue being yourself and you will find friends eventually. No one likes someone who is miserable because they feel alone. Remain positive and remember that there are other people in your shoes too. There is nothing wrong with feeling lonely in college, I'm sure most people on this sub have experienced it at one point or another. Keep doing you, take a deep breath, and enjoy college! The 4 years fly by quick. \n\n\n**Is there anything I should avoid to increase my potential to make new friends?**\n\n\n*Yes*: \n\n* Avoid staying in your room all day. You cannot make friends if you hide from people \n\n* Avoid not talking to people. You cannot make friends if you are silent. I know I am a very quiet person but if I can force myself to talk to new people you can too. \n\n* Avoid remaining comfortable. Those 2 friends from highschool that came with you to college? Don't spend all your time with them. Branch out. Meet new people. Step out of your comfort zone. \n\n\n* Avoid not showering. If you smell bad people are less likely to talk to you \n\n* Avoid posting on this sub about not making friends. This won't help you make friends. Get off reddit and talk to real people instead. We can be your friends too but it probably won't replace the loneliness you feel in real life. \n\n\n\n\n\nI was by no means a social butterfly in college and felt loneliness plenty of times- especially being the only one at my out of state college from my highschool (ever!!). Stay calm, remain positive, and try to follow the basic advice outlined in this thread. Good luck!

Basically, I love to go out - drink, smoke pot, do coke, all that fun stuff. Problem is - none of my friends like to do that. Most of my good friends drink, but don't smoke. Some of my friends I only smoke with, but don't drink with (I never really get invited to drink with them). Barely any of my friends do coke and those that do never invite me. I thought coming to college would make it easy to make friends that like to drink, smoke, etc. Apparently, it's harder than that or maybe it's me. I have friends that do the things I do, but they never invite me... I don't know why and it's really freaking annoying. I've never been invited to a tailgate, I barely go to frat parties, I'm just not getting the college experience I wanted. Not to say I hate my college experience, it's just that I'm not getting what I expected, and it's annoying to see people doing what I want to do because they managed to find their niche.\n\nLet me clear - I don't want to make friends solely on the basis that go out, but I do want to make friends that go out.

It's so much pressure, it sometimes seems futile because there are so many people and so many names and you won't be friends with most of them, and it's fucking exhausting.\n\n This morning there was an activity to meet your profs and I met an amazing group of people but they're in none of my classes. I met a cute guy at a party and he literally disappeared into the crowd. There are too many people, too many things to do, too much all at once. For some people the trouble isn't talking to people, it's finding the energy to talk to people and then the energy to keep talking to them and maintaining the friendship.

I wish it were more common here, but unfortunately if you show up to a football game or a dorm party alone you're going to get some weird looks, and you're probably going to stay alone unless you run into an acquaintance willing to take you under their wing or someone else who is alone. It's something that's much more easier said than done. Again, I'm not sure how it is at other schools, but over here if you show up to something alone people will pretty much just ignore you unless they know you through some way, and it's considered weird to try and join a group of strangers. I've been to campus activities alone before twice- once, I met someone else who was alone and we stuck together until the end of the event, but we never became more than acquaintances (that's another thing- follow-ups/making effort after the event is a requirement, which isn't mentioned here!). The other time was really awkward and awful. I've also been to tons of campus events with friend(s), and there's rarely more than one or two people alone and like I said they're pretty much ignored. \n\nJust wondering if anyone here also thinks this part was a bit impractical? Or if someone here has managed to make friends by attending a random campus activity alone, I'd love to hear how you did it! Personally, I'd feel super awkward going to something alone when everybody else is socializing with other people so yeah, I'm curious to hear how people overcame that and actually met new people at an event where being alone is not the norm.

When I was at my old school as a freshman, I struggled a lot to make friends, and I only had like a few people who I would hang out with, except it wasn't even that often, and no matter how hard I tried, I was always like a last priority friend for them (the only times we hung out were either when I initiated it or when their other friends weren't free). Now I'm at a new school, and this school is even bigger (and my dorm is pretty far from campus), and I'm terrified that making friends will be even harder. I hung out with people opening weekend (other transfer students I met at a party), but they seem to somehow already be a solid group of friends, and they only invite me if it's something drinking related, which is nice, but they don't seem to want me as an actual part of their group (eating lunch together, group chat, etc.). I also feel really awkward because I'm a sophomore, and the only other kids as eager to meet people as me are freshmen, and all of that just makes me feel super pathetic, which doesn't help my situation at all. Today was the first day of classes, but I only had one class, and I didn't really end up meeting anyone from it. I have 3 classes tomorrow, so I'm hoping things work out better for me, but I honestly doubt it at this point.\n\nRight now, my beacon of hope is joining clubs, but the club fair is at a sports field on Saturday, so I'll probably end up having to show up alone, which I feel insanely awkward about and uncomfortable with since it'll probably be packed (and people are probably gonna make a day out of it).\n\nDoes anyone have any tips or suggestions that could help me?
