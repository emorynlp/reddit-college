  "text": "I have helped to run a website since 2016 called SnoQap where we publish written content from college students. We are a 501(c)3 non-profit and we've worked with over 100 college students across the US publishing over 600 articles. Our mission is just to give students more opportunities to think critically about their major or degree before they actually get jobs/internships working in the field. We have an editorial staff that will work with you on your articles. Run by college students and the board funds the program entirely.\n\nWe've recently started a recruiting push, so if this is something that might be interested in, check out this page: [https://www.snoqap.com/join](https://www.snoqap.com/join)\n\nEdit\\* We don't run ads either, none of the traffic is monetized",

Not totally sure what you mean by your point about students from all fields so therefore not aligning with future work/experience. \n\nWe try to focus only on students who are focused on economics, finance, politics and STEM and place them in those verticals on the site",
