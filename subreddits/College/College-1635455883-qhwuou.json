  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m at a weird point in my life and could use some help. \n\nI\u2019m currently a 3rd year Software Engineering student at a school in upstate NY. Long story short, I hate literally everything about the school and I want to find a new place. I honestly do not care all about the schools rankings or anything like that, just preferably a \u201cfun\u201d school that offers Computer Science/Software Engineering. I just want the school to be as CHEAP as possible and preferably somewhere in a warm climate. Im willing to go literally anywhere \n\nIm at a spot in my career where I\u2019ve been interning at a company for the last 8 months and they\u2019ve already practically extended me a full time offer for when I graduate at a very competitive salary, so I\u2019m just trying to get my degree for cheap asap at a place I\u2019ll enjoy.\n\nIf anyone has advice, please let me know.\n\nI\u2019m a NY resident by the way",
