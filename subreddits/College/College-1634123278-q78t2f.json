Seriously, this is super important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep your GPA up, but don't lose your shit over a B unless you're deadset on a professional school (e.g. Med School, Law School, etc.).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're thinking of any career in the Sciences, ask your professors about Research Opportunities starting in your Sophomore year.  Even if you're just washing beakers, it's still 'research experience' which Grad Schools LOVE to see.",

TRIO programs are federally funded academic support programs designed to help first-gen, low income, and disabled students stay in college and graduate. \n\nI work as a TRIO advisor in a community college and our program offers supplemental advising (often with a lower student to advisor ration than the school's advising office), free tutors, FAFSA assistance, college transfer trips, transfer application assistance, application fee waivers, etc. And all the services we provide to our students are free!",

      "text": "The best advice anyone is going to give you here is to find someone else to give you advice. No, really!\n\nIt's important to have a mentor or mentors who you can consistently talk to. Perhaps someone who graduated from your college and has a job in your field? LinkedIn is a good option for finding people, you should make a profile and start reaching out to newer graduates. Yes cold calling is popular on LinkedIn, you don't have to know the person at first.\n\nFor your issues with financial aid, visit the financial aid office. Health issues? Student health center. Confused about a syllabus? Professor's office. The key thing here is that you DO NOT want to be the person who never goes places for help or asks questions. You pay for all of these services to make college easier so you should use them.\n\nAnd always double check the information you are given when it's about any important decision. Some of us grew up without questioning adults. Our parents *never* questioned adults even if it was a doctor giving them a diagnosis they didn't agree with. You have to be comfortable questioning adults in the real world and asking them to defend their suggestions for you. Not everything you are told is going to be correct. Consult multiple people for each important decision you make.",

I did maybe two dozen DMs and ended up with two or three actual phone calls where people gave me learning suggestions and talked about their work. Networking and applications are really about high volume, you have to operate under the assumption that 10% of whatever you submit will get a response when you set a goal for how many responses you are wanting.\n\nFollow up with the people you talk with too. Initially it will be about taking their advice but eventually you will have followed that advice and be in a position where they have seen that and are willing to give you a referral for an internship or job. This is why starting to network early is important: you might not be ready for an internship but it will help to have people who have known you for a while when you eventually want that referral. If you start networking right when you are looking for opportunities, you won't have any history with the people to use as leverage.",

They will help  you and a parent (if applicable) fill out the FAFSA together so you can get the aid you need.  FAFSA is financial aid and will help you pay for college and give you scholarships/grants based on need. If you can afford it, do not work while in school (work during winter break or summer break instead). \n\nIf applicable, join the BSA (Black Student Association), LASO (Latin American Student Association), or Asian Student Association. A lot of the time you will get access to networking events, specific scholarships, and just comradery with other students that are from a similar background and go through similar struggles.  \n\nPay attention to your mental health. Being first gen can sometimes come with a lot of pressure. If your mental health is getting bad, seek out help in your college's counseling center. Your tuition pays for it and it is there FOR YOU. Do not be afraid to seek help.\n\nEveryone else commented some great tips! These are just some that have helped me personally as a first gen college student. Good luck!",

They are the exact opposite, this is time set aside to talk to students. You should go to them even if you don't have questions.\n\nStudy often, for short periods of time, and never late at night. Cram sessions don't help you. 2-3 30 min sessions do. Talk a walk in between to give yourself a break.  \n\n\nGet sleep. Lack of sleep will impair you thinking just as much as being intoxicated. You wouldn't take an exam drunk, nor should you on 3 hours of sleep. If you want to stay up late, that's what the weekend is for.",
