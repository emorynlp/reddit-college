But, in my math class, there is a classmate who constantly has her mic open, and it's very distracting.\n\nShe is constantly thinking out loud, mumbling, background noise, etc., and frequently asks off-topic tech-related questions for assignment submissions, etc. Today when a kind hint was given to her to mute, the reply was something like, \"I'm just engaging in the class\". She missed all last week and was relieved that she may have dropped, but shes back and seems to be engaging herself more to make up for the lost time. \n\nI'm wondering if this is something we just have to deal with while having live virtual meetings/lectures, or if this is something that should be addressed to the professor.\n\nthanks", "author": "DividedConscious", "created": 1632773927, "retrieved": 1632800141, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heiigng": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwplhn/classmates_with_open_mic_during_zoomteams_lectures/heiigng/", "text": "I'm in night-time classes because I work during the day and as you can imagine, lots of older people on these. I have a colleague similar to yours and honestly, people are just upfront and ask her to mute her sound. Or they'll just ask people in general to mute their sound without adressing her specifically. I feel like at this point people should know that those noises can really interfere with the class and if she doesn't understand then she's just selfish and at this point, talk to your professor. I don't know what platform you use but I think in most platforms the hosts can mute everybody so definitely adress it with your professor.", "author": "Imaginary_Ad7841", "created": 1632775354, "upvotes": 3}}}
