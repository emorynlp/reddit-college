      "text": "Most majors have a choice of one or the other, so just do whichever your major is (presumably accounting).\n\nAs far as whether there's much of a difference between an AA and an AS, the answer is no. Usually non-STEM degrees are more likely to be designated AA (the second \"A\" stands for \"arts\" as in \"liberal arts\") and the STEM degrees are more likely to be designated as AS (where \"S\" stands for science) but what matters is your major rather than whether it's an AA or AS. \n\nIf you are at one of those rare places where you can choose either an AA or an AS for the same major (like you can get an AA in accounting or an AS in accounting), then go for the AS. Usually the difference is one or two classes, with the AS having more STEM focus. STEM classes tend to be more marketable, which would make that the \"stronger\" degree, but again it's very unlikely to be something that actually matters. Even at the bachelor level (BA vs. BS) it hardly matters, and it would matter even less at the associates level. Just choose the major that best fits your goals and your good.",

      "text": "Depends on your Bachelor\u2019s goal like the other commenter said. In most cases, an AA is more useful because the classes you take are generally accepted as transfer equivalencies to your next uni. If you go the AS route then check whether your certain science focused classes will transfer over before you waste time and money.",
