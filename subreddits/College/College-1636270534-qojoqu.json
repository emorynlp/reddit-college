  "text": "...Several years ago.\n\nHe wasn't a close friend, and I didn't think much of it at the time. He was around for my first year, and after that, he was gone. At the start of my second year, there was a dorm room near mine marked with his name. But days, then weeks, then months went by, and I never saw him or heard from him. I never saw anyone enter or leave that room. That sign with his name was left up for almost the entire year.\n\nI'd forgotten about him until recently. One day, I randomly remembered and decided to Google his name. I assumed he dropped out and went off to do something else. I was interested, since this guy was damn accomplished, in both academics and sports.\n\nWhat I found was kind of eerie, and I don't know what to think of it. There are plenty of Google hits for him... for high school and his first year of college. After that, the hits abruptly end, and there's no mention of him for the next several years.\n\nI have no reason to think he died, or became a missing persons case. My school would notify students when this happened; it actually happened with a person I knew who died in a freak accident last year. Nothing on Google suggests this guy died. But now I'm wondering what the hell happened. He dropped out and went dark? He had a Facebook account, and we were friended, but as far as I can tell it doesn't exist anymore. That by itself isn't weird, but what about all the other stuff? What do you all think?\n\nMy fear is something terrible happened to him years ago, and it derailed the rest of his life. But there's no way I can know.",

      "text": "I mean, when I joined the privacy scene, all my social media was abruptly deleted and everything on Google about me gradually disappeared (it didn't just stop showing up, I was active about removing any mention of me). Recently, I've been far less social and don't leave my room unless necessary, so it's quite possible you never saw him enter or leave just because he left/returned at different times than you did.\n\nIs it possible something bad happened to him? Sure. Are there plenty of reasonable explanations that are simpler and more likely? Yes. I wouldn't worry, personally. After all, you said you two weren't close, and I doubt you'd be able to reach out easily (especially if he's like me and had made an active effort to regain privacy), so there's no point in worrying.",

      "text": "He probably just dropped out and also happened to delete his Facebook. The fact that his Facebook is deleted would indicate that he's doing just fine, or was when he deleted it. A kidnapper isn't going to deactivate your Facebook, and your Facebook isn't going to disappear if something happens to you.\n\nWhat sort of google search results would you expect? If he doesn't use googleable social media you're probably just not going to see anything.",

          "text": "Yeah I wasn't very specific about what kind of Google results came up for him. It wasn't social media. He deleted all of that, so none of it came up, from either before or after he disappeared.\n\nThe Google results for him are local news websites, athletics databases, the high school website, the university website, etc. He was into ultimate frisbee and he won a ton of academic awards/recognition, and all that still comes up.\n\nIt just ends abruptly after his first year of college.",
