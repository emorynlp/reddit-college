  "text": "I will be lucky to even get a 10/100. Files and loops are difficult for me for some reason and I just don\u2019t understand. Hell I\u2019m probably gonna fail this class all together since I can do class work and the labs without an issue but when it comes to exams I lock up. This is making me rethink my choice in pursuing a degree in computer science.\n\nEdit: like you know you\u2019re exam was such horse shit you just give up? That was me. I had such low confidence in my code I wrote my name down and put (I failed) next to it.",
