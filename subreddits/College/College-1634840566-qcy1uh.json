  "text": "I was late to my class by literally 3 minutes. My professors don't care, as long as you get to class regardless of the time. My dad made me feel like shit for wanting to go a little late to my class. He told me that I will regret it and it will make me into a failure and he will be waiting for that to happen. I don't think it's even that big of a deal if I'm late by 3 minutes. But I severely feel like shit now because of him. But I know some professors make a big deal out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it fine to be late? This is like my first time.",

      "text": "> Is it fine to be late?\n\nThis tends to be a very culturally determined thing. I think in most of the US, a few minutes late is considered okay but not more than a few minutes. If you're ever doing business in another country, though, you should look up their culture specific norms-- being late even by minute in a place like Japan is considered extremely rude but I've heard there are some places where the time a meeting starts is more a suggestion than anything and it's normal for everyone to show up late.",

Once you\u2019re out in the real world with a job being on time is incredibly important and shows professionalism. I\u2019d say try to practice being on time to establish good habits later on. Good luck!",

But today, I just wasn\u2019t feeling well because I usually go to class, go home and chill, go back to class, go home again and chill, go back to class again, etc. It\u2019s a whole thing and it gets tiring. I know I could stay on campus, but then I would do nothing for those 2 hours in between classes.",

But try to remember that if you are frequently late, they are going to catch on to the same person as late all the time, and then they might not be as willing to help you if you end up needing a reference or something like that. But otherwise, if your grades are good, why would it matter?",
