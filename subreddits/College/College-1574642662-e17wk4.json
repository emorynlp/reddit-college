  "text": "Basically I have a project and I am wondering if it would look weird or tacky to cite my fathers research. I have used plenty of different references in my project so far. My dad has a phd in the area I'm writing in, and he sent me some pdf files of some of the stuff he has written on the topic, and I feel like it would make my project better, but also make myself seem like I'm lazy or it's tacky.",

I\u2019m using his letters and audio tapes he sent to my grandmother during his service to help structure the project. My advisors said it works as long as there\u2019s no bias and it\u2019s used correctly for the project. So yeah I don\u2019t think it\u2019s tacky to use your fathers research as long as it def has a place within ur project",
