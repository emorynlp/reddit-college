  "text": "Going to study abroad in the spring. I'm a double major in anthropology and history. Both programs have courses for both my majors. \n\nAs a history nerd, Rome is basically paradise for the history buff. Imagine that \"I'm where (x event) happened in history. The architecture and art. The undisputed mainstay for the humanities.\n\nBut I also love outdoor activities and South Africa has more than you can imagine. I've run a few half-marathons and have always been fascinated by arid, exotic locales. You can interact with wild animals there. And summer will be in full swing when I start. And penguins \ud83d\udc27. \n\nHelp me decide?",

      "text": "Personally, I'd go with Rome, because you mentioned a lot of academic/professional/educational advantages, and you didn't mention any specifically for Cape Town.  Additionally, it's not like Italy is some remote isolated environment; there will be plenty of outdoor leisure opportunities for you to take advantage of, certainly more than one person could do in a single semester.  Some of those are the Mediterranean coast, the lake district, the mountains, plus many other great places in Europe are close by.\n\nSo I personally would go with Rome, as it seems to provide more of a winning combination of educational and personal experiences in my mind.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(Also, if you do decide on Rome, make the effort to learn some basic Italian phrases before you go.  Any trip to Europe is made even better when you can communicate with the locals.)",
