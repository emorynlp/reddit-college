  "text": "I\u2019m fucking desolate. I\u2019m miserable. It\u2019s been a month since the last time I\u2019ve spoken to someone. I\u2019m losing my mind. I have no one to talk to ever about anything. I can\u2019t keep doing this. And don\u2019t tell me to \u201clearn to be alone\u201d. I know how to be alone, but eating alone everyday for a month and having no one to even have a 10 minute conversation with is maddening. \n\nI\u2019ve joined clubs, I asked the people I know to hang out, I\u2019ve done everything people tell me to and it amounts to nothing. I chat with people at clubs and they barely seem interested in talking to me. I invite people to eat lunch or dinner and they\u2019re busy. I talk to people in my classes and it never goes anywhere. Wtf else am I supposed to do? 10  minutes ago I abruptly left a club meeting bc I was having a mental breakdown . No one likes me. Everyone just thinks I\u2019m the weird quiet girl. I\u2019m lonely and I hate this. \n\nI\u2019m not going home for thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to be alone and miserable. The dining hall is closed so I\u2019ll have to spend my day eating day old takeout in my room. How fucking pathetic is that. I can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m sick of this. I was so excited for college and it sucks. I got my hopes up and I\u2019m exactly where I didn\u2019t want to be. I tell myself I\u2019ll start over next semester but deep down I know it\u2019ll just be the same.\n\nI can\u2019t even reach out to someone when I\u2019m sitting in my room breaking down crying. I sat in my room bawling just now with no one to ask for help. I can\u2019t keep this all inside but I have no one to talk to. I feel like my RA doesn\u2019t like me, I have no friends, my counseling services at school suck, I can\u2019t afford therapy, my family have never been great emotional support. I\u2019m falling apart and idk what to do. I have nothing and no one. I really don\u2019t know what to do at this point.\n\nI don\u2019t even have a roommate. My roommate moved out after a month bc she wasn\u2019t adjusting well to having to share a space and got an accommodation for a single. I was told that most of the time (like, literally almost always) they give people new roommates within a couple of weeks bc they always over-enroll and don\u2019t have enough space to leave people without a roommate in a double, but of-fucking-course that wasn\u2019t the case this year! I feel like the universe is torturing me. I\u2019m out of options. I\u2019m constantly alone and I\u2019m going crazy. I can\u2019t keep doing this. I hate this. My depression and anxiety are through the roof. I keep falling back into self-destructive tendencies because I feel so hopeless. I\u2019m an absolute disaster and I\u2019m completely and totally lost and alone. I need help but that help doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m supposed to suffer\u2026",

Trust me I know college counseling is awful I\u2019ve had friends try it. My piece of advice to you: if you were the kind of person you\u2019d wanna hang out with, where would you be? Go there and I bet you\u2019d find people that vibe well with you. Let me know if you ever need someone just to talk to. Best of luck, you\u2019re not alone\u2014I promise.",

      "text": "You have started the path to self improvement: You have recognized there is an issue. In your social interactions, people seem to entertain your conversations but never want to move to the next step in friendship. Now, you must figure out what the problem is and how to correct it.\n\nI will say this, it can be very hard to figure out what you are doing wrong in social interactions without an outsider's view or some very blunt individual telling you (most people will smile and wave instead of being truthful). I know you mentioned that your school therapists suck and that you cannot afford other therapists, but I would strongly suggest going to one. Instead of focusing on your symptoms (depression, anxiety, self-destructive tendencies), focus on the root of them: it all ties back to your feeling of aloneness. Come to therapy with goals, maybe have a 'mock' conversation and see if they can notice anything you can change.\n\nSome common things to avoid in conversations:\n* Bringing up past trauma, depression, or anything deeply personal. This should be reserved for very close friends and will be off-putting and overwhelming to anyone that isn't.\n* Self-deprecating humor. It can be done well by some, but you must be VERY good at understanding your audience and reading their body language. I would not recommend this in a college setting (unless talking about notoriously difficult exams).\n* Politics. Very few people care about it in college because most are liberal and share the same exact ideas. Only talk about this if you're at a club or event with the specific topic as politics.\n* Not making eye contact. It makes people feel as if you don't actually care about them and they will in turn not care about you.\n\nEdit: reading other comments has made me think of something I forgot to put in here. If you go to a community college or commuter school, it is FAR more difficult to make meaningful relationships because most people are focused on going to class and then going home right after.",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through a rough time. What kind of college do you go to? I have been in similar places through out my life. I would wake up and everything would feel bland and I would try my hardest to find and make friends. I\u2019m naturally very extroverted but just didn\u2019t have a personality that was deemed attractive to most people. However, I never gave up. I turned to online friends, people who could cherish me and make me feel good as a person. For a very long time I played extensive amounts of video games, which from the outside pov might seem unhealthy but it wasn\u2019t because of the people I would talk with(social connection). At the same time, I would also still attend my school dance or football game to make real friends. \n\nI never changed who I am and eventually met people I will have for the rest of my life. Just remember it\u2019s not you that\u2019s the problem, you are just meeting the same shitty people. People who don\u2019t give you the time or day do not deserve your presence. At the end of the day, it\u2019s YOU who makes yourself laugh, it\u2019s YOU who makes your happiness, and it\u2019s YOUR job to find people who you fuck with. I know you said you\u2019ve tried everything, but trust me please keep pushing! Find the things you are passionate about. Write about it, think about it, and most importantly do it! People naturally recognize authenticity and passion, and will want to be your friend if they can visibly see your desires. The people I am friends for life with are people who all came from similar back grounds of feeling lonely, so naturally we were drawn together. \n\nFor context, I\u2019m a freshman in college.",

There, I could talk to people who had similar interests to me and also make art which was therapeutic.\nI\u2019m not saying you gotta make an art account, but like some sort of account that people would find interesting or joining a forum/discord server could help you at least talk to someone while you don\u2019t have anyone irl. It isn\u2019t a perfect replacement, but it may help deal with the loneliness while you basically play the waiting/luck game for an irl friend. And who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find a mutual you\u2019ll click with super well in the meantime.\nBest of luck, OP. Take things one day at a time.",

If you go to the same spot over and over again, you are bound to meet the same people, and with time, one of you will start a conversation. For me, I never really had to start any conversations as they just came to me. Ig I don\u2019t have any \u201cgenuine\u201d friends but I really don\u2019t expect to get any this fast. One thing though, just a hypothesis, if you are ugly, You will have a harder time people just coming up and talking to you. Also, I always eat alone too. But Ngl, I\u2019ve never actually eaten with someone for years so ig I\u2019m just perfectly fine with that. I find eating a good alone time. I recommend like the others in the comments, just do something you genuinely enjoy doing. Like painting, gaming, sports or what not. It takes ur mind off of trying to find people, while also giving you a chance to find people that have similar interests.",
