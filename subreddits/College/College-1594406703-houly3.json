Lol\n\nMy school already sent out a memo saying that we are going home after Thanksgiving (because they know kids are going to leave for their families, and there's a chance at least a few students will come back with something)\n\nAnd then they added that if you do get to stay in a dorm, you should be prepped to leave under any short notice.\n\nAnd we don't have any reduced prices for anything. Room, food provisions, classes, etc. Nothing\n\nPersonally I already signed up for housing, but I'm high key hoping I don't get it anymore because then I could get a refund and just step back for a semester or two. Or take online classes safely from my own home in my hometown. \n\nAlso, hell yeah college kids aren't going to social distance. The draw of my school are fun events, parties, their band, and their nursing program. Not only that, but even when there was no COVID I saw people hugging and kissing while coughing, sneezing, or even vomiting in or around each other. Plus sex and close cuddling are big here. COVID will definitely spread easy on my campus (gladly not to me because I don't like hanging out with others anyway). And then my town only has under 10 ICU beds, and we have a lot of immunocompromised students. It's most likely going to be a shitshow.",

      "text": "Professor here: I think you're 100% correct. The only way to prevent it will be peer pressure-- wearing masks and following distancing guidelines will work, but I have zero faith that students at my school will actually do that. This summer we've already had numerous cases from bars and student off-campus parties; some I've talked to are very angry that their friends/classmates are acting irresponsibly and they too feel this is a major threat to any plans to be on campus this fall.\n\nFaculty/staff and campus rules can only go so far. Students will have to police themselves and their peers. It only takes one big party or a few people unmasked in a crowded bar before spread starts on campus. After that it's just a matter of time before so many are quarantined that we get shut down again.\n\nStudents, it's in your hands. Either mask/distance all the time in keeping with guidelines, or there's indeed a very real risk you'll be sent home again in October and classes foced 100% online.",

I studied abroad last year in South Korea and was sent to London after 6 months after my Seoul study abroad was cancelled for spring then home after 2 weeks. I practically lost almost all of my money for online classes in a country I wasn\u2019t in (UK). I\u2019m going into my senior year and am supposed to be the president of Japan Club, supposed to be the head of the welcoming committee for the Tamagawa University taiko team. I was supposed to volunteer to help Kinki University students learn English. We were told classes online are the same price as classes in person.\n\nHow do I feel? I don\u2019t even care anymore. I spent 3.5 years crafting an excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and plan on going to grad school at Ewha Women\u2019s University. After that, I\u2019m staying in South Korea forever. I just have to accept that my last year in college is not going to happen and move on with my life. Now I have more time to prepare for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test with a goal of N2 by next July and if I feel confident, N1 by December 2021.",

There are a lot of smaller colleges that simply can't survive a fully-online semester, so they are going to do everything possible to ensure their revenue stream continues...including sacrificing students and faculty.",

The *only* way this works is for students to take it seriously. FFS, it's not like we're drafting you or asking you to do anything actually hard-- just don't be a dick and bring COVID to campus. Too much to ask? Apparently so based on what we've seen so far this summer. Fall will be *entirely* in the hands of the students. \n\nIn 1942 18 year olds were drafted and sent to fight fascism around the world...and they did it until the war was over. We're asking people to wear a mask, wash their hands, and avoid bars...and most assume it will never happen. So people will die.",

This spring my faculty (I'm a department chair) were putting in 2-3x the hours for the same classes. Over the summer we've put $500K of new tech into classrooms to support remote learning for anyone who has to quarantine, and have held endless training workshops for faculty, etc. etc. While I'm sympathetic to students wanting refunds if classes go online (I have a student in college myself) it's important to realize that the minor savings in labor from not having to clean the classrooms or keep the lights on is more than offset by the massive increase in labor necessary to run and support online classes.",

My school refunded lab fees for all the labs that didn't happen. But as with yours, not tuition for ensembles. Realistically they are right; you are paying for one credit but the total amount of instructional time involved is a lot more. We did refund individual lesson fees though.\n\nIt's tricky, and of course with a few exceptions (Xavier and Tulane after Katrina, for example) not many colleges have had precedent for sending everyone home mid-semester. As finance officers will quickly point out, those costs were already encumbered and with a few exceptions (dorm cleaning, meal prep) they weren't *saving* money not have students on campus.\n\nThings will likely be different this fall. I know my school has a whole set of plans to deal with fees, tuition, room, and board charges for various scenarios this fall.",

These are experiences we'll never get back, but even more importantly, I don't even want to imagine the danger of worsening an already terrible pandemic.",

          "text": ">colleges are businesses and the goal of businesses is to obtain the largest profit while minimizing losses.\n\nAll legitimate colleges are non-profits and their goal is to remain in business. For many tuition makes up the majority of operating revenue (52% at my school) and \"auxiliary enterprises\"  like room & board make up another huge chunk (20% at my school). So if they close dorms and cut tuition (even though online instruction costs *more* in terms of labor) they will have to make massive cuts, including eliminating faculty and potentially entire majors. Students don't want that- indeed, when we surveyed ours in May 85% said they wanted to be on campus *even if classes are 100% online.*   Admins are caught in an impossible dilemma: they manage a system that was literally designed and built to work in one mode to deliver a service that students want in that same mode. COVID has thrown it all for a loop, so the best and most logical choice would probably be to close for the fall semester entirely...but that would lead directly to the permanent closure of hundreds of colleges.\n\nIt may not seem like it to students, but margins are often very thin at all but the elite schools. My $$$ liberal arts college is 150+ years old and relatively stable financially, but pre-COVID the board finance committee in January spent half a day figuring out how to address a $200,000 projected budget deficit on a $100M budget. If the residence halls are closed that will result in a $12-14M budget hit; tuition reductions might push that to $20M. Not a lot of non-profits are prepared to take a 20%+ budget hit and still maintain services.",

          "text": ">My hope is that universities will choose to keep students on campus as a sort of community quarantine as opposed to sending thousands of people who have been exposed to COVID back out to their communities at home\n\nThat sounds good until you realize that many (most?) colleges have almost zero health care resources. My school has one nurse for \\~4,000 students. To my knowledge they haven't hired 25+ more health care professionals over the summer. So the plan for quarantine is almost certainly to group-isolate anyone who's been exposed (identified via contact tracing) in a single res hall, but anyone who is positive will almost certainly be sent home as we have no way to care for them. Who will bring them food? Check temps? Help them bathe? Clean their room? What happens to roommates? Very few schools I know have the health care staff available to actually care for anyone who becomes seriously ill; the exceptions are all big R1s with medical schools proximate to the main campus (and with partnerships like the Yale-New Haven medical center).  Your typical college? Maybe a nurse and a PA if you're lucky.\n\nPeople who get sick are going to be sent home. It will be possible to quarantine people who have been exposed, but once they test positive it's likely that housing policies will be written to require them to leave campus. In an outbreak that could mean sending hundreds of infected students back into their communities from a single school.",

But this was back when the UK was still in its \"complete delusion\" phase in April/early March, when it was just a couple of cases, only a few small pockets of old people, not in the community (because they only tested old people in hospitals). As soon as it seemed to be getting out of hand in the rest of the country, the university kicked us out. \n\nIn terms of the greater good, they should keep everyone on campus once they're there. But if people get sick, and especially if those people live in dorms, then they're the responsibility of the university. The university has to organise people to care for the ill in their dorms. The university is responsible for the possible death or permanent disability of those students. And it's much more likely to spread, even if they quarantine the sick or even *remove* the sick. We see this happening over and over with ships, nursing homes, and schools. Keeping people in place limits how far the virus spreads but it does practically ensure that everyone in that quarantine will get it. The university can't, and doesn't want to, provide medical care for that many people. If they make people leave then you can't be sure where you picked up the virus, you can't be sure you got it in the university dorms, and so you really have limited recourse.",

It's never going to happen. Administrations know it's never going to happen.

I studied abroad last year for 6.5 months. My school cancelled it for the entire year.

Many are going to have to sacrifice a year or two of the college experience whether that is studying abroad, in person classes, or parties at a frat (ALL of which are important to educational and emotional health and development). It sucks. It sucks hard. But the reality is we are living in a dangerous time and EVERYONE needs to make sacrifices to protect themselves and those around them.\n\nAnd professors who have to move to online instruction are making sacrifices too. I think students have this misconception that online teaching is easier to F2F which is why so many of us are pushing for it. It actually takes a lot more time to prep and facilitate online material. We don't get to have access to the same resources at home that we do on campus (e.g. I spent an hour yesterday scanning a document on my stupid little flat bed printer that would have taken me 60 seconds on the big xerox in the department office). And something else I think no one talks about is us missing out on the camaraderie with our colleagues. I miss chatting with my fellow profs in the hall over a cup of coffee, gossiping about the latest faculty meeting or whatever. I miss going out for drinks or meeting up for trivia night at the local pub with our university friends. \n\nIt's not fair at all but it's the world we're living in right now. If we were at war (like actual battles being fought in the US) we would have to make sacrifices too. But not enough people are viewing this pandemic as a war when they should be. When was the last time 130,000+ Americans died and everyone was just okay with going on with their everyday lives like nothing was going on? This is a war and one we could easily win and saves thousands of lives if everyone was just willing to inconvenience themselves for a while and make hard sacrifices.",

So half the class would come to campus and watch my giant head projected on the screen while the other half zoomed in and then they would switch for the second lecture of the week. It's so asinine. Why force the students to come to campus at all? I already decided that IF I accept the class I'm going to tell my students anyone uncomfortable on campus can just log into both lectures from home. There is absolutely no reason for them to be on campus.",

Young profs who are comfortable with tech and working online are trying to get out of F2F classes. But many of the older folks are too terrified of the whole process because they aren't familiar with it and don't know how to use online tools; some are just too damn stubborn to learn. But most just aren't being given the time or resources to learn. For instance, in my department when we had a whole weekend to switch our classes to online during the lock down, we had a number of faculty who had never even OPENED Blackboard. And all of a sudden they were supposed to get the classes they had been teaching traditionally for decades up and running online? And throw in Zoom or Yuja or whatever for synchronous lectures with 30+ students? Some didn't have computers with webcams, nevermind decent headsets or mics.\n\nThe other thing to consider is that administratiors (at least at my institution) want at least some faculty to be on campus so things appear \"normal.\" But there are departments here where at least 75% of their profs are over 65 and/or have high risks conditions. So now the chairs have to decide who is \"more at risk\" and get to teach remotely and who is \"less at risk\" and have to take their chances on campus. They don't want to have to do that. They shouldn't have to do that.",

It should be recognized as a barrier. Tbh, way more effort should go into making this as painless and maintainable as possible. :(\n\nI'm also upset about \"normal\".

There are just some classes that can not realistically be taught online. For instance, my university has a big aviation program. Can't really teach someone to fly a plane online (not if you actually want them to be able to fly a plane with humans on it someday). So those are the classes we should be focusing time and resources to plan F2F as safely as possible. But SO many classes can be taught online without detriment to the curriculum. My husband is an English professor. He admits that there are some things that are EASIER to do F2F (e.g. workshops), but it's totally doable online. I mainly teach introductory anthropology classes. We can just as easily discuss Boas and different kinship practices on Zoom. But nuance is not something most administrators have the time or patient for.",

Passionate and enthusiastic and very invested in his students. But we did not learn how to use any technology invented after 1969.  All of our field equipment looked like it came out of an antique store. It wasn't until 2008 when he got huffy that the international conference he went to didn't have a SLIDE PROJECTOR for his presentation that I was able to convince him to start taking digital photos in the field instead of 33 mm film. I had to show him how to use PowerPoint and he hated it. He resisted every new advancement until one of my cohort showed him GIS. Blew his damn mind.

Great teacher and the students love him. He's at the cutting edge of our discipline, is bringing in a lot of grants that are improving our department and its resources. He's part of a number of international research teams doing fascinating real world projects and he's using his role to get his students one-of-a-kind experiences. But he's been here for only about two years and I can already tell the red tape and institutional bureaucracy is wearing him down. And the university's response to the pandemic is making it way worse. We were chatting online yesterday and he's finally realized faculty have no real power in the system and that system is so entrenched it's never going to change. I'll be shocked if he sticks around another two years and it's going to be such a loss.",

They\u2019ve said one dorm will be designated as a kind of quarantine dorm for the sick/potentially sick, and another will be designated for students who wish to take \u201cextra\u201d precautions about socially distancing and staying healthy. \n\nPeople are pissed that guests and social gatherings won\u2019t be allowed in dorms, but personally I can\u2019t fathom what else they could\u2019ve expected. I understand students will be irresponsible no matter what and these restrictions are only followed by everyone in theory, but what\u2019s the other option? A free-for-all? I do *my* best to protect others and myself. If these very long few past months have taught me anything, it\u2019s that I can\u2019t expect others to do the same, and no amount of frustration or argument on my part can change that. \n\nDespite the fact that I\u2019m in a state that has seen a decreasing number of cases, I am also not hopeful at all about the fate of this upcoming semester. Other nations have done a relatively great job handling the pandemic, but those other nations are also willing to make sacrifices for a collective effort. Here, we unfortunately are seeing the adverse effects of \u201crugged individualism.\u201d",

But the bigger cudgel is simply the threat of closure: act responsibly or the school closes down again. It's in student hands. If they care enough they will act responsibly and urge their peers to do so as well. If not, October will end up just like March.\n\nAll faculty I know are planning for 100% online classes even when they are \"required\" to teach face to face, because few of us believe enough students will chose to act responsibly to prevent massive outbreaks in early fall.",

Instead most states didn\u2019t close down anything at all, or they reopened during the flattening stage so cases continued to grow. In my school I was shocked that their best idea for keeping students safe in classrooms is to put plastic wrap and signs over seats that they suggest you not to sit in, or to have bigger classes sit outside, and prevent students from showing up early.

The responsible ones will have to use peer pressure on those who won't wear masks, won't distance, hang out at bars, etc. While some campuses are planning zero-tolerance policies and will evict students who are caught having gatherings, etc. there's simply no way to enforce it other than socially.

My college has a contract with an apartment where I will be living (signed lease before I got my diagnosis).  I will be living with three unknown roommates and sharing a bedroom with one.  There is no way I can ensure there's safety or social distancing in my own living space, much less around the rest of campus.  Fingers crossed that disability services will at least enable me to negotiate with professors to do most of my work online.  Also, in a hairbrained move of epic proportions, they want to continue to hold wind instrument and music ensembles.  Because they're holding the ensembles but I opt not to participate due to my risk status, my frat is putting a lot of social pressures on me because it's \"safe enough\".  Guys.  I was so happy I didn't need heart surgery when I left the cardiologist.  Please don't make me need it.  Plus, the periodic cardiac diagnostic tests alone cost soooo much even with insurance....physically and financially, I can't afford for my condition to deteriorate until I have a job.  Sorry for ranting, your comment just tugged my heart.  There's so many people who believe that because we're young, college students won't be that badly impacted if they get COVID.  Well, that's a fcking lie if there ever was one.",

It makes absolutely no difference except I just can\u2019t go there between classes.
