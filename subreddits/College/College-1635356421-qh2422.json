  "text": "I\u2019ve heard of being able to raise your GPA while in college, is this true? I apologize if this is a dumb question\n\nI got sick junior year, had brain surgery and a stroke so my grades dropped drastically from A\u2019s to C\u2019s and D\u2019s. My GPA went from a 3.5 to a 2.9. I\u2019ve since got only A\u2019s and a B in one class so I have brought them back up.\nSorry if this is a dumb question but I talked to my counselor today and she made it seem like I wouldn\u2019t get into college at all and now I feel horrible. \n\nI\u2019ve done a few applications, all except one require a GPA of 3.0 so I\u2019m panicking. Granted I do have til the end of the school year to bring it up but I feel it won\u2019t be good enough.",

      "text": "If you mean raise it from your high school GPA, then it starts over fresh your first semester college. If you mean raise it from semester to semester, you also can. GPA is Grade Point Average, so it is literally average. Every grad you get above your current GPA will raise the average and every grade below lowers it.",
