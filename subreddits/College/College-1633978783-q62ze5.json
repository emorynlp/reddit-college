  "text": "When we moved into our dorm freshman year we came up with what turned out to be a very successful strategy.  We offered free Tang.  We made a sign and posted it on our door.  People would walk past, read the sign and inquire. We happily mixed them up a glass and had a chat.  They thanked us and went on their way.  It really worked well!",
