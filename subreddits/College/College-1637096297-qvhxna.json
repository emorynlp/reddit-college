  "text": "Hey everyone! I'm a researcher from a California university who is trying to see if there is a discernable relationship between time spent gaming and life satisfaction scores. I really need as many participants as I can get, and this survey should only take around 3 minutes, so if you could help me out, that would be amazing! This is an anonymous survey, and there are no requirements to take it. I'm also on an incredibly short time schedule, so participation is very urgent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO SUDY: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qr\\_tzcq\\_pEKNNfWzJtf89YvYtQ8z5j3DQUPuaFbS3lk/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qr_tzcq_pEKNNfWzJtf89YvYtQ8z5j3DQUPuaFbS3lk/edit)",
