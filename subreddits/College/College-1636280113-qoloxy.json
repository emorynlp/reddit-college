  "text": "I have heard from so many people that statistics is the worst and they all hate it. My coworker who loves math and is good at it said she loves Algebra and hates stats. She explained if you get one thing wrong, the whole rest of the problem is going to be wrong.\n\nI am required to take 2 statistics classes for my degree. In high school (8 years ago) I was always bad at math and I've never even taken Calculus or trigonometry before, only Algebra and geometry.\n\nI just took my math placement, as I start college in January, and I am starting with Elementary Algebra so I can work my way up and not get overwhelmed. (Just to clarify Algebra and Calculus are pre-reqs to statistics). I learn pretty fast and I want to actually learn the material not just get a passing grade. I'm kind of excited about it, but I'm wondering if it's possible I will actually enjoy statistics since I like comparing data? I'm hoping since I hate other types of math (Algebra, geometry) maybe I'll be an oddball who likes the math everyone else hates (stats)? I don't even know what to expect honestly lol.",

      "text": "I don't know what type of people said that about stats (math people or not math people). Stats is actually one of the easiest math classes you can take. It requires very few memorization, you just need to be focused when doing a problem so you don't end up using the wrong data in the wrong place (but isn't every math class like this?) \n\nTLDR: don't let people intimidate you, stats is easy and if you trust your mathematical skills, you will be fine",

      "text": "Which stats class? I'm a grad student in stats, and stats classes can range from very easy to very hard. If calc is a prereq for your stats class, then you may be taking a \"mathematical stats\" class, in which case it's probably one of the \"harder\" ones. The people who say stats is \"easy\" usually have only taken the watered down stats classes offered to non-STEM majors that don't actually teach much at all. \n\nThat being said, I have met many, many people who love stats but hate math. It's definitely a thing. Personally I love both, but pretty much anyone who likes playing around with data is likely to like stats.",

          "text": "Hi, thanks for the reply! It appears I was mistaken. Apparently the only Statistics class I have to take is Elementary Statistics and the only pre-req is an Algebra class, so I should be fine right? Physics however may be another issue lol.\n\nThat helps a lot, because I do enjoy comparing data. Thank you!",
