I feel I wasn\u2019t trying at all this semester and could pull better grades though\n\nWhat y\u2019all think? Get a W and try better next semester or finish rn and aim for the C?",

The whole point it you're going to take it again and they will look passed the W and see your (hopefully) A.  Do y'all really think people on admissions panels don't know that some times people need a break?  A W is by far better than a C, just don't go and drop a course each semester with a W.  One or two W's are fine, but beyond that you have a problem.",

People take W's for all sorts of reasons. A W looks significantly better than a D on a transcript. I've known people to withdraw when they have A's in classes because they just didn't have time for the class.\n\nWhether or not retaking is worth the extra tuition depends on the tuition cost at OP's school and how much money OP has. Like, in my personal case, I wouldn't think twice about retaking a class at community college prices, but I'd try to avoid it at all costs at university prices. Richer people might be able to throw money at either and poorer people probably can't afford to retake at either.",

For people just getting a four year degree there probably isn't much value for re-taking a C. For graduate school there potentially is if your program has a high average gpa. You should take the highest net-benefit option regardless of income class and low interest loans let you do that. I wouldn't re-take a class simply because I was wealthy, I would want to see a pay off.",

Many students overestimate their chances of \"pulling through\" by the end of the semester, and I think OP should consider how likely it is they'll actually pull through with a C in the end.",
