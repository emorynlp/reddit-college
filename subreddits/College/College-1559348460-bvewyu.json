Before I begin to tell my predicament I need to explain my current situation. So when deciding a college I was given a full scholarship to a university that I saw as a back up. The university is mainly an all girls school, but I was given a full ride to one of their programs which allows only a few men. I don't have an issue with it or anything, but for housing I asked to be placed in a shared dorm with another guy. Alas, with my luck I got placed in a single in the women's housing. \n\nUsually the men's housing will house 12 students all in doubles, but there were only 15 of us in total and I'm assuming I got the short end of the stick and was placed in a single on a different dorm. I felt that if I had a roommate I would have a destined friend to be with. \n\nI'm moving in tomorrow and I'm starting to get anxiety. I usually am alright with making friends and stuff, but I begin to get nervous trying to socialize with girls. I just need advice in trying to make friends/socializing with others in a single dorm room. \n\ntl;dr: I need advice trying to make friends in a single dorm room.

It's nice and has a compartment for my laptop, a main compartment which I can fit about 4 notebooks into with room for a little agenda, and a front compartment that I've put a bunch of random stuff in (stuff like gum, Advil, hand sanitizer, writing utensils, and a portable battery).\n\nMy question: should I be expecting to carry way more stuff for my freshmen year of college? Should I opt for an even bigger backpack? This might depend on classes too. My girlfriend told me that I should've gotten a bigger backpack since my new one, with all the stuff I mentioned, is pretty full now, but she also said to at least use it for the first week before deciding to return it.\n\nShe has a point but I also wanted to point out that there's only one day a week where I have 3 classes. The other days, I usually have one or two classes that are pretty spaced out, so I could leave certain materials in my car and run to get them if I really needed too.\n\nLet me know on what your opinion is regarding backpacks for college.

I have chosen my schedule except for an economics class which I am not sure what time to take. I have two options.\n\n#1: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bWUAwQEzhF6sg0eW8l9B8WLFdrgAEgyY/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nI would take the economics class in the morning and have my classes spaced throughout Tuesdays and Thursdays. The economics professor who teaches this class is rated a 3/5 on RateMyProfessors.com.\n\n#2: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19tLfGJhXo2zei0ZNjLZUY-7RIN8Kwh5i/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nI would have three classes back to back on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The economics professor who teaches this class, however, is one of the top rated professors from my college, with a 4.4/5 on RateMyProfessors.com. This spot just opened up, with the class at the moment having 69/70 people.\n\nAs an incoming dual enrollment freshman, could I get some advice on which option to choose? On one hand, having space in between classes to study would be nice, but on the other hand going with them back to back could be more efficient and also more successful with a highly rated professor. \n\nThank you!", "author": "ranttila", "created": 1565439501, "upvotes": 2}, "ewh6rim": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bvewyu/incoming_freshman_schedule_and_advice_megathread/ewh6rim/", "text": "1. Eat breakfast or brunch in your dorm room or on the go if you have early classes or breaks in between them. You can buy Styrofoam (throw away) bowls for cereal, mini cereal boxes, granola bars, or anything that you can heat up in the microwave by just adding some water (minute rice or mac n cheese). It'll really help you in the morning. You also won't have to waste a meal swipe at the dining hall. Also, you should add some food to your college list. Trust me, it helped me in the long run.\n\n2. To save space in your dorm room, only take seasonal clothes when you first come to college. Keep the winter jackets and sweat clothes at home. You can still bring long pants and a light jacket. I learned the hard way by keeping everything from winter until the end of the year. Go back home during the breaks to pick up your winter stuff and then go back home to drop it off whenever the weather gets warmer.\n\n3. At parties, if you don't want to drink, buy Gatorade, Powerade, non alcoholic glass soda bottles, or powdered mixers. You can also pour these drinks into an empty bottle and pretend that you're drinking. Just make sure that you always hold your bottle and don't place it down anywhere. For the glass soda bottles, tear off the labels and no one will know the wiser. I did this at parties with my old roommate and it worked out well for us. Most people will never get curious of you if they see any of these drinks in your hand.\n\nEven if someone does find out, then don't make a big deal about it. Just be honest with them and leave the party if they give you a hard time.\n\n4. Always go to parties with someone else or with a group of people. Never travel alone to parties if you have to walk quite a bit to a party. Even though that you might feel safe, you never know what can happen. Take a DD (designated driver) or the campus bus to a party if it's too far of a walk for you. Remember: DD's are Not only for drunk people. Bad weather, no bus services during that night, etc.\n\nEven if you're not a party person, just go to one for the experience. Apartment (off campus) parties and Frat parties usually have their differences. If you don't like it or feel uncomfortable, then do something else with your roommate(s) or friends. No one is forcing you to go. It's all by choice and personal opinion.\n\n5. To save space and time in the bathroom, buy a 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash bottle so you only have to carry one bottle. Also, bring your comb, tooth brush, shaving stuff, etc. all in your shower caddy. To keep all you stuff organized, buy a travel size bag or two to keep everything together. You can shower, shave, brush your teeth, and comb your hair all in one trip. On an extra note, make sure that you buy a big enough shower caddy to hold everything.\n\nP.S. Buying a tall mirror for your dorm room wouldn't be a bad idea as well.", "author": "sta3535", "created": 1565399399, "upvotes": 10}, "ewgwfho": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bvewyu/incoming_freshman_schedule_and_advice_megathread/ewgwfho/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1565391954, "upvotes": 3}, "ewgm0dn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bvewyu/incoming_freshman_schedule_and_advice_megathread/ewgm0dn/", "text": "good to see a post from another senior instead of the usual freshman posts that flood this sub.", "author": "texxmix", "created": 1565384909, "upvotes": -2}, "ewenwxb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bvewyu/incoming_freshman_schedule_and_advice_megathread/ewenwxb/", "text": "Going to be a freshman at at state university and I was wondering if this sounds like a bit much?
