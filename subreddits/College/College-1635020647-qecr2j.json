  "title:": "What should i do if i have constant fear of getting academic misconduct or expelling from college?",
  "text": "I guess my problem sounds really silly.\nI am a freshman from college and study computer science. Our CS department is pretty rough, and every midterm or assignment leads to about 20-30 people getting academic misconducts out of 250 of CS students, even if they study fairly. (Our department is kinda stupid and strict, getting 100 on test is already suspicious for them). I always feel like i will get an academic misconduct, and it leads to panic attacks and anxiety. What should i do?",

      "text": "How do you know your peers studied fairly? Because it's quite possible that they're just lying to you and that the department has reasonable evidence against them. \n\nThat being said, I understand your anxiety. Some people are paranoid and are convinced all their students are cheating, lol. Since it's causing anxiety, probably the best person to talk to would be a mental health counselor because they're experts at helping people handle anxiety.",
