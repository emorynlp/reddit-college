You can\u2019t just pick classes, either. You usually have to arrange your classes so you take 3 big ones in one semester, 1 medium, and 1 light. They honestly wouldn\u2019t let me take classes the way I did originally anymore, because I was taking core classes all the way into my last semester, especially the easy ones, since I have ADHD and was an English major. It\u2019s stupid for them to expect you to have 5 literature classes all at once in your final semester. So fucking stupid, especially if ADHD. How am I going to do that much reading all at once? Nah. Give me an American lit, a Brit lit, a writing course, ethics and journalism for the cool factor, and health concepts. All the homework is completely different and difficult to confuse, all classes are paced differently...ridiculous that they have this \u201cone size fits all\u201d advising these days.\n\nOh and I\u2019m a college English instructor so it obviously worked out (full time, not adjunct).",

But whenever I came back to our apartment, I\u2019d either find him sleeping, playing video games, or watching Game of Thrones. He still managed to pass all his classes with fairly decent grades though, so go figure. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t do it because I like the routinized structure of a five day class week, and I know I\u2019d be pulling my hair out when due dates inevitably start to coincide. But depending on the rigor of his course load and his ability to stay on top of things Tuesday-Friday, he *may* not be fucked.",

That would be very difficult because you would have to cram everything for that one day, or write several papers all due on the same day and so not have time to work on one and then the other.

My school had a rule that you couldn't take more than 3 a day, and the others had to reschedule them but it was extremely chaotic because aside from that rule there was no structure as to which tests you would take. So you basically had to explain your situation to all 5 or so teachers and they would have to make a special re-schedule for you which a lot of teachers were reluctant to do because they required a proctor and affected grading, and then each teacher would prioritize their test and try to get you to convince the other teachers to reschedule their test for you, so it's supppper annoying and lowkey unprofessional when it gets down and dirty like that",
