  "text": "I am sick with strep throat and I told my professor I could not come to lecture. He said that was fine but that I would not be excused from writing the weekly response to the lecture. I feel like, especially now more than ever, professors should not discourage kids from missing class due to contagious illnesses. Now I don't know whether I should go to lecture and risk getting others sick or just take the L on the weekly response.",

      "text": "If you can write the weekly response without attending the lecture (either by attending virtually or getting the notes or whatever), do that. If you feel like you won\u2019t be able to write the weekly response without coming to the lecture in person, take it up with someone of higher authority. Either way, your professor should have outlined these procedures in the syllabus or early on in the class",
