It\u2019s only worth 3% of my grade so I\u2019m thinking I might just let it go and not bother submitting it. My grade in this class isn\u2019t a big concern, I just want to pass. Have you ever just skipped a project?",

      "text": "Really just depends on the class and your grade standing currently. I've only done this once when I took one of the fluff easy A electives where I had a 106% in the class and I decided to skip doing the final paper so it dropped me to a 91%. I only did that because I calculated the grade knowing I would still get an A and we don't do + or -.\n\nIf its a class related to your major you should probably try to knock it out though, especially if its on something that you will use later on the final or another class down the road.",

      "text": "Seems dumb to skip it unless you have a ton of other work. Even if you do shitty on it (like 66%), that's still adding 2 points to your final grade, which could bump it up from a B+ to an A-. I would say to do a halfassed version, at the very least. All nighter if you're feeling ambitious.",
