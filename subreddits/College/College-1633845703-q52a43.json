I am behind on all my assignments for psychology. I haven\u2019t studied enough for my bone practicals. \n\nSunday I cram for my exam. Wish me luck \n\nI hope your weekend is going well.",

      "text": "I would probably suggest doing a little bit of studying on Sunday, or as much as you can without giving up sleep. After you study for a good bit just try to get a good night's rest. Sleeping can help you retain information better, and could help a lot more than you'd think! \n\nIn terms of assignments, just do what you can. While I'd focus on studying for the exam at this point, try to do some of the assignments daily, or little bits each day until you're comfortable with what you've done. \n\nI've got an exam on Monday too I feel unprepared for, but I'm studying in little increments and am trying to get some sleep too! Hope this helps you too, and best of luck to us and everyone else prepping for exams! \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a",

Clean up your desk, make a cup of coffee, write down what it is you have to accomplish in the block and start working.\n\nThat's my advice, hope it helps :)",
