  "text": "My friend was medium drunk last night (threw up a bit), and was hanging with this frat dude she had met that I was getting bad vibes from (not unsafe ones, just meh). Anyways I was trying to get her to leave but she just wouldn't and really wanted to stay. I made him promise to walk her home, and tried for a while to get her to leave and the guy was getting kind of annoyed that I was trying to get her to leave.\n\nEventually, I left her there. She spent the night there and was fine, but what am I supposed to do in that situation? I'm not her mother and I don't think it's right for me to drag her away when she doesn't want to, but I also don't want anything bad happening to my friends.",

Just let your friend know what happened that day when they were drunk and inform them that they should not drink to the point of blacking out. Say what could have happened and it\u2019s up to them to assess their actions and think about what they should do differently the next time you guys go out. BUT if they are still pulling this same drunk shit multiple times then just leave them.",
