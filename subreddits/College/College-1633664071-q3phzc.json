  "title:": "How do I study for a test?",
  "text": "I recently started college and I am 6 weeks in, so far my test grades have been pretty good, mostly As and Bs. The thing is I don't really study for the exams. I usually just do the practice exam if there is one, and look over the study guide if there is one. I attend lectures and ask questions, do the homework, sometimes I will read but most of the time I don't. I never studied in High School either. I worry that this will screw me over in the future since I don't even know what it means to study.",

      "text": "Sounds like you have a good basis. Your next step is to assess yourself - practice problems, practice quizzes, drawing & labeling (if it's a visual course). Then take note of what you got wrong, that tells you were you need to spend your time.\n\nThe easiest trap to fall into it so look over your notes/textbook and think to yourself \"makes sense\", and not realize you've misunderstood something. Testing yourself lets you know what you don't know!",
