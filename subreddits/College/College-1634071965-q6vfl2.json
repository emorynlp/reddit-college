  "text": "Theoretically how bad would it look if you withdraw from the same class twice? Human Anatomy & Physiology is killing me and I\u2019ve already withdrawn from it once at a different college, I\u2019ve now changed my major because of it and I\u2019m trying to finish it out but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to pass it again, right now I have a D- and I\u2019m halfway through the semester. I don\u2019t need the class for my new major but I\u2019m hesitant to drop it because I think that would look really bad. Thoughts?",

Two W's on your transcript in a class that doesn't matter for your major and career is *way* better than a D- in any class. You should withdraw ASAP.",
