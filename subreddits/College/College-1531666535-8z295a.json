According to them, every single person should go to community college first.\n\nCommunity college can be an amazing option for many people, but it is NOT as black and white as many of you make it seem.\n\nHere are just some potential negatives of going to community college\n\n- If you want to go in to a field that values prestige (say, finance) you will have a very difficult time getting internships your first two summers. In fact, most big banks now recruit Junior summer interns during their sophomore spring, so make that your first three summers. That will seriously impact career prospects out of school. Also, contrary to what some may adamantly say, almost every field values prestige to an extent. \n\n- Even if you only want to apply for an internship Junior year, employers will likely not like the fact that you only have a semester (or less) of grades to show at your school.\n\n- Networking is an important part of college. You are missing out on a lot of important opportunities to cultivate friendships your first two years if you aren\u2019t even there until Junior year.\n\n- Will be very difficult to gain leadership positions in student organizations coming in as a third year.\n\nSo, the reality is, Community Colleges are an invaluable asset to many students, but there ARE downsides. I feel that students are being misled by people on here claiming that there is absolutely no reason to not go to community college.\n\n\n\n", "author": "Ghartin007", "created": 1531666535, "retrieved": 1632947960, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 624, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"e2ij4vh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/8z295a/community_college_is_not_always_the_best_option/e2ij4vh/", "text": "As a CS undergrad I have worked as an intern and was offered a full-time position while going to CC at eBay, fast forward to now I have a year of work experience and am able to pay for the rest of my degree with the job bonus offered to me.

Some of the most successful alumni I\u2019ve seen from my surrounding schools, ucsd and Sdsu were transfers. You need to work hard to transfer. You save SO much money and it all pays off in the end. For anyone else reading this, keep doing research on the best option for you. \n\nInternships are necessary, but most uni students don\u2019t get an internship until junior year anyway. If you wanted, you could get an internship while at a community college. This would actually prepare you more for the prestigious internships you will competing against other students for once you transfer to your 4 year. Also you won\u2019t be denied for any \u201cprestigious\u201d internship because you only have a semester or two of grades to show. If you go to a good enough school where you get prestigious internship opportunities, show them your grades from cc and they will definitely still count that. If those college grades were good enough to transfer you to a prestigious school, then they\u2019re good enough for anyone else lol. Honestly no one overthinks it like that.\n\nLeadership positions are great. Again, a lot of people don\u2019t really get involved right away in university either so it\u2019s not like ur missing out. A lot of people don\u2019t consider this, but most of the highly successful transfers I\u2019ve seen were very involved in their community college. Do what you can before you transfer, that shows that you are hardworking and able to take on anything. After you transfer there are plenty of leadership positions! Be a student ambassador as a senior, make a club, be an RA your fourth year, be heavily involved in your major as a junior so that you can end your four years with a couple leadership positions. It will be totally fine.\n\nIn the end, you will get a bachelors degree right next to the same people who went into university right out of high school. Your diploma won\u2019t say \u201cUCLA but went to community college for two years so ehhhh\u201d it will say \u201cUCLA\u201d or whatever great school you end up at.

Also most community colleges offer classes during nights and weekends which is great for students who have outside jobs.

Also if you are a student who doesn't know what they want, it is easier to get gen eds out of the way at community college and decide what you want to do later.

However, I can not fully agree with the original posters opinions. As you mentioned many jobs require that you have a nice background, but they understand that some people do not have the same oppurtunities as others.   \n\n\nFor example, someone able to attend a state university/out of state university straight out of high school compared to someone that is facing other matters in life, which can limit their ability to attend a good school like others.\n\nI agree that networking is important in college, however, you really don't miss out on a lot of opportunities like you'd want to believe. You can still attend most of the universities job fair's and networking events and show that you want it as much as someone that is attending that college. If, you mean't networking between collegues, than yes you'd might miss some potential people. However, community college does not just have kids that are slackers, there's actually more variety (of all ages and all sorts of backgrounds) of people that you can meet as long as you try to network with them. I've met and networked with professors that go to teach at community colleges because they don't like the education systems that are built around universities. Networking is something that requires your time and energy invested on other people to create bridges.  \n\n\nFor example, if Student A that attends a 4 yr university just studies and talks to couple people he met from class of 80-400 people. Compared to Student B who attends a 2yr community college and gets to know most of his collegues from each class including the professor themselves due to low class ratio (15-30:1 people). I wonder which student would be networking more... If you chose Student A, you do have the chance to network with more people, however, in reality, you would not even talk to all the people in your lecture hall. Just like in high school, when you know almost everyone from a small classroom ratio, Student B would have an easier time networking.\n\nCommunity colleges have student organizations that anyone can join. Leadership positions are more obtainable at a community college then at a 4yr university. The clubs are small, but most clubs of community colleges have join't organizations with a local 4yr universities. So, you can stay in contact and transition when you start attending that university. Leadership position is obtainable, if you put in the effort. Leadership positions itself for a student organization is competitive, whether it be 1st yr, 2nd yr, 3rd yr, or 4th yr. Each yr, theres new students straight out of high school or other community colleges that are going to have the same challenging time getting any leadership positions.  \n\n\nOverall, I understand what the original poster is talking about for community college, but when I see the \"downsides\" he/she mentions, I can't agree with them. The only thing I missed from a 4yr university is the \"Frats\" (which I never wanted to be apart of),the Football games (Even though anyone can purchase tickets to the football games and tailgate as well), and amenities.

If you've received a full ride scholarship that negates the financial advantage.\n\n4. Your parents are rich enough to pay for school without any family financial hardship.\n\nFor people who don't fall into these categories, your 'potential negatives' don't really apply. Fields that value prestige (such as finance) aren't going to value your mid-tier school any more than they value Community College. Likewise, your mid-tier school isn't going to give you any great internship benefit over Community College - both are still only going to offer local internships in most cases. Similarly, 'networking' at your mid-tier school is no better because you're attending the sorts of places that Presidents and CEOs send their kids anyway.\n\nLeadership in student organizations is largely irrelevant. If you like such organizations, go ahead and involve yourself. If you don't, no one will care after you graduate.\n\nIf you're thinking about attending college, your first step should almost always be to take a look at the CC -> State route simply because it sets a baseline.
