  "title:": "Community College is NOT Always the Best Option.",
  "text": "I\u2019ve seen a lot of people here suggest that if you don\u2019t go to community college for two years, you are making a stupid decision since there are absolutely no downsides. According to them, every single person should go to community college first.\n\nCommunity college can be an amazing option for many people, but it is NOT as black and white as many of you make it seem.\n\nHere are just some potential negatives of going to community college\n\n- If you want to go in to a field that values prestige (say, finance) you will have a very difficult time getting internships your first two summers. In fact, most big banks now recruit Junior summer interns during their sophomore spring, so make that your first three summers. That will seriously impact career prospects out of school. Also, contrary to what some may adamantly say, almost every field values prestige to an extent. \n\n- Even if you only want to apply for an internship Junior year, employers will likely not like the fact that you only have a semester (or less) of grades to show at your school.\n\n- Networking is an important part of college. You are missing out on a lot of important opportunities to cultivate friendships your first two years if you aren\u2019t even there until Junior year.\n\n- Will be very difficult to gain leadership positions in student organizations coming in as a third year.\n\nSo, the reality is, Community Colleges are an invaluable asset to many students, but there ARE downsides. I feel that students are being misled by people on here claiming that there is absolutely no reason to not go to community college.\n\n\n\n",

I thought this was kinda fucked, as some of these students could probably get scholarships to 4 years or get into schools with financial aid. \n\nAs soon as I stepped on a large research university campus, I realized the huge difference between the opportunities offered here compared to my high school and community college. I have completely thrived and I accredite a lot of this by going to a 4 year. I'm lucky that I have a lot of scholarships to be able to do this. Not everyone has this chance but I really think community college should be more for people who messed up in high school and want to fix their grades and transfer, not for high achieving high school students.\n\n",

      "text": "If you got into a top school for a field such as finance, where prestige is important, don\u2019t turn that down. You have valid points here. However people in most other careers are fine taking two years at community. It\u2019s actually impressive to s lot of employers since a lot of people see it as a \u201cdead end\u201d. I think you assume a lot in this and it\u2019s scaring some people. Some of the most successful alumni I\u2019ve seen from my surrounding schools, ucsd and Sdsu were transfers. You need to work hard to transfer. You save SO much money and it all pays off in the end. For anyone else reading this, keep doing research on the best option for you. \n\nInternships are necessary, but most uni students don\u2019t get an internship until junior year anyway. If you wanted, you could get an internship while at a community college. This would actually prepare you more for the prestigious internships you will competing against other students for once you transfer to your 4 year. Also you won\u2019t be denied for any \u201cprestigious\u201d internship because you only have a semester or two of grades to show. If you go to a good enough school where you get prestigious internship opportunities, show them your grades from cc and they will definitely still count that. If those college grades were good enough to transfer you to a prestigious school, then they\u2019re good enough for anyone else lol. Honestly no one overthinks it like that.\n\nLeadership positions are great. Again, a lot of people don\u2019t really get involved right away in university either so it\u2019s not like ur missing out. A lot of people don\u2019t consider this, but most of the highly successful transfers I\u2019ve seen were very involved in their community college. Do what you can before you transfer, that shows that you are hardworking and able to take on anything. After you transfer there are plenty of leadership positions! Be a student ambassador as a senior, make a club, be an RA your fourth year, be heavily involved in your major as a junior so that you can end your four years with a couple leadership positions. It will be totally fine.\n\nIn the end, you will get a bachelors degree right next to the same people who went into university right out of high school. Your diploma won\u2019t say \u201cUCLA but went to community college for two years so ehhhh\u201d it will say \u201cUCLA\u201d or whatever great school you end up at.  Stay on the right path for you and it will work out \n\n",

I was taking having different class requirements. \n\nThe irony being, since WGU allows you to pass classes as quickly as you can complete mods and take the final, I would be about to graduate with a B.S. right now instead of wasting 1.5 years of my life at a community college. The only upside is Via grants and community college being cup of coffee cheap, I don't owe anything for the 3 semesters I went. The downside is I practically wasted 1.5 years of my life, albiet it I do have a dick ton of programming experience now. \n\nSo yeah, community college can be a great option, but in my case it was a total waste of almost 2 years of my life.

I\u2019m pre med, which is a crazy hard field to go into in general, but especially one that values prestige, so I totally understand the pressure to succeed.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not so unlikely to gain these positions you speak of. I just finished freshman year of community college and I\u2019m already in a research project through a prestigious four year university in my state (working with PhD. Doctors on a very huge nationwide project, and constantly networking), and I\u2019m constantly receiving leadership opportunities. Last semester alone I was literally offered four of five jobs with leadership positions, simply because I showed I cared. Also, I even won an award in the field my research project is in. I was just recently nominated as a student representative for the board of trustees, too.\n\nMoral of the story is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much about where you are, but more about what you do, and how well you do it. Some of the most unsuccessful people in the world go to prestigious universities, and some of the most intelligent, prosperous individuals come from humble beginnings.

They really don\u2019t give s shit about prestige for the most part. \n\nAccounting matters a small amount if you want to be in a big 5(?) but a lot more schools get recruited from the big companies compared to finance. It\u2019s not a top school only thing. \n\nEconomics and consulting are similar to finance. They will do similar things and prestige gives you a head up.\n\nHowever can you tell me, at all, how community college affects any of these things? You do know that when someone attends community college then they generally are trying to transfer to another university. You don\u2019t need to be recruited from the very beginning for ANY of those fields except finance. Attending community college and getting high enough grades to transfer WHILE saving a shit ton of money helps a lot for all of those fields. ESPECIALLY med school, you just saved two years of schools costs and you have competitive stats, you\u2019re in a great spot at that point.\n\nFor example: I have a few friends transferring from our local CC to UCSD, one of the best public schools in the country. Really well known for STEM. They have close to a 4.0 and they intend on applying to med school. They will also be graduating debt free because of their first two years at cc and saving for college. UCSD is such a challenging school that most students have a low 3,0 by the time they\u2019re a junior. My CC friends are coming in with higher GPAs and more money. WHEN it comes to applying for med school, the med school will see that my friend has a high gpa and another person from her school might have s much lower gpa. They aren\u2019t gonna pick the B- average student over an A student, even if they did know she went to cc for two years. People in that situation have an advantage and she will have four years less in debt that many of her peers.\nAlso, since you\u2019re arguing overall prestige of any school then you should know that a 4.0 student at a small state school will get into med school over a 3.2 student from a top school. \n\nTell me how community college puts you behind for any of those fields again, with examples ",

Usually community college students couldn\u2019t afford the schools they got into, or in some cases believed they can transfer to better schools than the ones they originally got into. While it sucks and we miss out on fun experiences sometimes, it really doesn\u2019t put us at a disadvantage unless we are in finance, apparently.  \n\nThe first two years are GEs, I think you know this right? Community college students are literally taking the same classes as four year students at this point. Do you have any idea how many times I googled my professor and found their syllabus for another class at a four year? I learned the same thing. \nOutside of finance, no one gives a fuck. Seriously. Google it. We get the same internships you do, took the same classes, except a lot of us won\u2019t have debt. \n\n\nIF YOU HAVE THE MONEY TO GO TO YOUR TOP SCHOOL, then go! I wasn\u2019t arguing that lmao. Literally NO ONE was, can you find an argument against that? No. There are perks to going to a four year university right away. We aren\u2019t denying that. What OP, and I guess you? Are trying to say is that we don\u2019t get the same opportunities. In the end, we do. However there\u2019s literally no reason to guilt and freak out high school students who CANT GO to a four year university right away. One extra shitty internship that you get as a freshman, if you know someone, is not worth 15k < in debt. \n\nI truly don\u2019t think you know what you are arguing here, do you? Do you genuinely think people are telling well off Harvard students to go to community college. Christ. How is your college education working out for you? Lmao\n\nCongrats? You just told me that there are benefits to being able to afford a four year university? Literally no one was arguing against that. However students who go to a community college shouldn\u2019t feel like they are less than. \n\nAlso: you are still holding on to this \u201ctier\u201d bullshit. You have *literally* absolutely *no* idea how community colleges work. Please use google before you response, no one is arguing that a four year is ranked higher than a cc. What I am arguing is that we end up at the **same** place. I\u2019m sorry if you are in debt because of college and you want to feel it\u2019s worth it. These community college students are transferring to higher ranked university than you and they aren\u2019t paying as much as you are. That\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended.\n\nAgain, reread everything. Take a break, read again. Cool off for a bit. Read again. You\u2019re proving my point further. If you had read any of my posts, you would see that I\u2019m trying to say that you are still able to be as successful as non cc students. There\u2019s no denying there are benefits, but how much are those benefits worth to you? Are you going to pay me 15-30,000 at the very least so that I can get one internship and meet more friends as a freshman. Lol you don\u2019t get it, man.",

No. If my friend goes to my local cc then transfers to a well known state or uc school, then they get the same exact opportunities as the other students there with less debt. No one here is saying a person with an Ivy League education is not at an advantage, they are. However other than that, community college students as transfers are just as smart and hard working as their other students and will achieve the same things.

The community college I went to was STEM based, and not much in any other field. While I wanted to explore some majors, I wasn't really interested in STEM and was dissuaded by advisers from majoring in anything else. It wasn't until I transferred and suffered for a year in a major that wasn't for me, that I finally got the opportunity to switch majors at the end of my junior year. So now my gpa is shit, and I'm here for a 5th year. I can't get internships, and professors are hesitant to give me a chance as a TA or RA because they don't know me as well as other students. I also won't be taking the brunt of my major classes until my 5th year. This is becoming an issue because I plan to go to grad school, but I'm not entirely sure which subfield I want to go into because I haven't gotten to explore them in undergrad. And my gpa dropping due to being all but forced into the wrong major is putting me at risk of not getting field placement, internships, good rec letters, and grad schools not being interested. I've also had to take summer classes every summer since I started community college just to catch up, and they're even more expensive at university, though less expensive than staying into a 6th year.

However, it isn't available for transfers and there isn't really anything comparable available to them either. In my case at least, the savings in tuition from the CC wouldn't fully cover the amount I'm saving through that scholarship.  \n  \nI am paying more in total because of living expenses for those two years (vs just living at home with my parents if I went to CC), but I think getting out of your hometown and living on your own is a pretty valuable experience for a lot of people and it's difficult to put a monetary value on it.

If you are a top student and can attend a prestigious 4 year school, I mean obviously community college isn't going to be the answer for you. \n\nHowever, I think for the average student, community college is a great option. First of all, you can save a ton of money. Now, money is not a concern for some people and they are willing to pay a premium for a 4 year experience. Good for them but as college costs rise this is becoming less and less viable for many students. Also most community colleges offer classes during nights and weekends which is great for students who have outside jobs. Second, the great thing about community college are that they tend to have smaller class sizes and are an easier learning environment than many state schools that have huge lecture halls of hundreds of people. \n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of surprisingly employable programs offered at community college. For example, respiratory therapy or nursing or things of that nature. Also if you are a student who doesn't know what they want, it is easier to get gen eds out of the way at community college and decide what you want to do later. And yes, there are many cases where credits do not transfer between schools but many community colleges have articulation programs which make it easier for transfers. \n\nAs far as finance goes, there are a very limited number of target schools and the average person is not going to attend one of these.

Some people rag on CCs and give them a bad rep but there are times a CC professor may be more accredited and holds a higher degree than a Uni. professor (if you actually have a professor, and not a TA).\n\n-Yeah, 4-year places off more in terms of clubs, but gaining club leadership isn't everything. If you went to a 4-year, the chances of you gaining club leadership depends entirely on how much effort you put into it, and that goes for all 4 years.\n\n-CCs are often much closer to home than a 4 year, so you can take classes there a or much cheaper, and not have to pay room and board.\n\n-Although social life in school is important, it's not like it's impossible to make good friends in a CC. Yeah, a 4 year has more of a \"community\", but your social life at any place depends on you.\n\nEither way, both schools want to see their students succeed and will provide ways for them to do so, whether it's for jobs, networking, whatever.  \n\n",

Merit scholarships, need-based grants, etc. My school costs 70k a year if you include housing, and I'll graduate with just 4000 in debt that I took out my freshman and sophomore years before my sister entered college too. I have enough in savings right now from working during school to pay that off immediately.",

How many freshmen are going to get an internship in CIVIL engineering when competing against juniors and seniors? \n\nWhen you go to a CC, you're essentially taking the same G.E. courses and lower-division major courses that other in-state, public universities offer. \n\nUnless you got into a well-know college like Harvard, UCLA, Berkeley, Stanford, Cal poly, etc, where the names of the school may actually make an employer look at your resume twice, you're over paying for options that may not even be beneficial to you at all.

      "text": "As someone that has attended a community college (due to family matters), I understand some of the downsides. However, I can not fully agree with the original posters opinions. As you mentioned many jobs require that you have a nice background, but they understand that some people do not have the same oppurtunities as others.   \n\n\nFor example, someone able to attend a state university/out of state university straight out of high school compared to someone that is facing other matters in life, which can limit their ability to attend a good school like others.\n\nI agree that networking is important in college, however, you really don't miss out on a lot of opportunities like you'd want to believe. You can still attend most of the universities job fair's and networking events and show that you want it as much as someone that is attending that college. If, you mean't networking between collegues, than yes you'd might miss some potential people. However, community college does not just have kids that are slackers, there's actually more variety (of all ages and all sorts of backgrounds) of people that you can meet as long as you try to network with them. I've met and networked with professors that go to teach at community colleges because they don't like the education systems that are built around universities. Networking is something that requires your time and energy invested on other people to create bridges.  \n\n\nFor example, if Student A that attends a 4 yr university just studies and talks to couple people he met from class of 80-400 people. Compared to Student B who attends a 2yr community college and gets to know most of his collegues from each class including the professor themselves due to low class ratio (15-30:1 people). I wonder which student would be networking more... If you chose Student A, you do have the chance to network with more people, however, in reality, you would not even talk to all the people in your lecture hall. Just like in high school, when you know almost everyone from a small classroom ratio, Student B would have an easier time networking.\n\nCommunity colleges have student organizations that anyone can join. Leadership positions are more obtainable at a community college then at a 4yr university. The clubs are small, but most clubs of community colleges have join't organizations with a local 4yr universities. So, you can stay in contact and transition when you start attending that university. Leadership position is obtainable, if you put in the effort. Leadership positions itself for a student organization is competitive, whether it be 1st yr, 2nd yr, 3rd yr, or 4th yr. Each yr, theres new students straight out of high school or other community colleges that are going to have the same challenging time getting any leadership positions.  \n\n\nOverall, I understand what the original poster is talking about for community college, but when I see the \"downsides\" he/she mentions, I can't agree with them. The only thing I missed from a 4yr university is the \"Frats\" (which I never wanted to be apart of),the Football games (Even though anyone can purchase tickets to the football games and tailgate as well), and amenities.

If you're accepted to an elite school (Ivies, University of Chicago, Stanford, etc.).\n\n2. If you're going to a service academy.\n\n3. If you've received a full ride scholarship that negates the financial advantage.\n\n4. Your parents are rich enough to pay for school without any family financial hardship.\n\nFor people who don't fall into these categories, your 'potential negatives' don't really apply. Fields that value prestige (such as finance) aren't going to value your mid-tier school any more than they value Community College. Likewise, your mid-tier school isn't going to give you any great internship benefit over Community College - both are still only going to offer local internships in most cases. Similarly, 'networking' at your mid-tier school is no better because you're attending the sorts of places that Presidents and CEOs send their kids anyway.\n\nLeadership in student organizations is largely irrelevant. If you like such organizations, go ahead and involve yourself. If you don't, no one will care after you graduate.\n\nIf you're thinking about attending college, your first step should almost always be to take a look at the CC -> State route simply because it sets a baseline. Far too many people attend the 100th best college in the country at ludicrous expense when they would have been far better served by going to Community College first.",

It sucks, but I saved some money so it is what it is.\n\nMy only objection is employers don't always dwell to much on the fact that you've only had a semester or two of grades at the Uni. All you need is a foot in the door. If you kill it in your first couple of semsters employers are often willing to give you a shot anyways.",

Are there any companies you admire that would you like to work for? If so apply to those. Customize your resume/app to each job. Some of this is numbers if you put in a good effort on your apps and you apply to 20 you should at least get 1 interview. Look at local employers do a search by your city to see who\u2019s out there. Find a mentor, do informational interviews, network with your majors department head and ask them if they know of any internships. You got this! :) I looked at the Fortune 500 and circled every company I thought made the world better. Then started at the highest ranked and worked my way down. You could also look at cities you would like to live in the future and select employers who have a presence there. You could also look at the highest rated companies to work for list. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/07/the-25-best-companies-to-work-for-in-america.html\n\nhttp://fortune.com/fortune500/list/\n\nExample of top companies to work for in Oregon\nhttps://www.oregonbusiness.com/100best/companies/item/18223-the-2018-100-best-companies-to-work-for-in-oregon\n\nYou could do a search by the city you want to live in. \n\nTop 50 internships list doesn\u2019t look too bad\nhttp://www.vault.com/internship-rankings\n\nAnother strategy I used was picking an employer who was global and had satellite locations in low cost states. I took a job at the more expensive state where the pay was higher but the cost of living was high. I lived with roommates to keep the cost down. I worked there for two years than applied to low cost states. I got to transfer and keep my top tier city pay but live in a low cost area where my money goes farther. I still work for the company I had similar values with and gave me purpose but I work for them for a higher value to myself going that route. If I could do it over again I would have done the same but waited for another level up so my saturation in pay was higher. Hopefully, that makes sense. ",

Like I said, when I apply this fall I have a good shot at getting into schools I would have needed like a 4.4 and a 2100+ to get into out of high school.  I definitely think that while I worked my ass of in cc, the general workload was less than what it would have taken to pull that off.  I know so many kids that were terrible students in high school (like myself) who went to fantastic schools because a 3.0-3.5 in cc gives you a ton of opportunities whereas that gets you in mediocre state school out of high school.\n\nBUT, where I think cc really does hinder people is if their goal is to go to like a top 10 program.  Want to go to Berkeley or UCLA out of cc?  Great.  Get a 3.6 and you\u2019ve got a good shot.  Want to go to MIT?  Penn?  Stanford?  It\u2019s basically impossible.  They take like 4 cc transfers a year.  Other than that and the internship situation, I\u2019d say community college actually is sort of a more practical way.  But who says you have to be practical?  Some people\u2019s practical is living the college life, moving out, etc.",

Employers have partnerships with the top schools and you can apply after you get some experience. The path is longer and more complicated but it still can be done. Right now I could go to Stanford online and Columbia online if I was willing to put the effort/energy in. Stanford has online masters for example computer science and statistics. Columbia has online masters in Engineering, Applied Mathematics for example. The thing is for those programs I would need to go back and take some classes to meet the requirements but those classes don\u2019t require prestige. Funny thing is I could go back to community college to get differential equations requirement. It would probably take another 2 years to meet the requirements for the technical masters and then I would have to take the difficult masters itself. It would be hard but it would be possible to have the most prestigious schools on my resume with the path I took if I wanted it enough.",

The thing is, that Community College or Junior College is a great way for some students, not all to find their place. There is more to community college than transferring to a 4-year school. Many who attend community college does so they can earn either a diploma , certificate or terminal A.A.   \n\n\nCommunity college is also the place where a lot of first year college students end up, because they are unsure of how to even apply to a four-year school. I know I was, that is why I started at a community college and then transferred to a four-year school.   \n\n\nSo instead of screaming that everyone needs to go to community college then transfer, it should be, does everyone even know how to apply to to college?

So for me, a CC cannot even touch going to a top ranking or good ranking school. \n\nFor a very large portion of people, I honestly believe CC *is* the best option.

For example, this[ summary article from Standford](https://collegepuzzle.stanford.edu/are-elite-college-courses-better-not-really/), or the similar one at [Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/11/09/study-questions-whether-elite-college-courses-are-higher-quality-others). The findings certainly echo my own experiences though, as a student and a professor at a range of schools including some elites. The issue is with the emphasis on teaching vs research-- great researchers abound at most elite schools, but you'll often find better *teachers* at teaching-focused institutions like liberal arts colleges.\n\nWhat really matters, in either case, is who is sitting in the seats next to you and how engaged they are. Research also shows that the impressive outcomes associated with elite schools are often due to networks that exist among the students/alums, which stem from their being \"elites\" in the first place. Not a result of 'learning' but of leveraging one's existing advantages in most cases.",

You have provided zero evidence to support this. From what I have seen working in universities and in the private sector the opposite is true. Because when we ask for transcripts we only check GPAs and in some cases the grades for certain coursework. The engineering students who start at CCs frequently have higher GPAs. No one drills down to see why that is the case, it is just accepted. The only reason I take notice of it is when my kids were in high school they took CC classes instead of AP classes so I had a personal interest in seeing how that is perceived. \n\nI have a family member who works in finance. When he was recruiting for his company he liked specific colleges. So he only met kids at UCLA for example. But he never cared if those kids were transfer students and in many cases chose transfers because their resumes looked better. In his experience those kids usually were able to work and go to school and he always took students who had work experience over those with perfect grades but hadn't ever had a job before. \n\nIn this thread there are a lot of people justifying their choices about what makes them \"happy\" at this point in their life. And that is certainly a consideration, but another consideration is if those same people can be \"happy\" making large salaries paying of big student loans while living in high cost of living areas. \n\nNo matter what path you choose, it is probably important to take advantage of all the opportunities the schools offer. Visit career fairs, talk to recruiters, go to the career center and see what your school is doing to get their graduates hired. ",

Not to mention unparalleled access to industry research, Nobel winning professors, and an in depth, balanced curriculum that undoubtedly prepares its students for higher education.\n\nThere exist a certain discrepancy among community college kids and the students in elite schools. I would argue that the brightest minds in CC are probably just as good or better than the average of elite schools. However, CC\u2019s have more of a range of students: from the most gifted geniuses you e ever met, to burnouts who are being forced to go to a college: there is a wide range of students at a CC. However you can bet that nearly (i stress nearly) everyone at Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc. is going to be the top 5% with regard to academic caliber. These students are self selecting, but being surrounded by likewise brilliant people, with a higher concentration of prodigies and bright people. This is what attracts top firms in both the private and public sector to favor graduates from elite schools: there is less risk that you are hiring someone incompetent when you hire people from top schools. This is all fairly obvious. And either way, all of our talk has been speculation, none of us have cited anything while using a lot of anecdotal evidence.\n\nMy father works in finance. Goldman Sachs to be exact, so I\u2019m aware of the recruiting/admissions process.\n\nTo be honest, I think you are trying to push a certain agenda, most likely a personal one. And while doing so, you are being willfully ignorant, the worst kind of ignorant if I may add. \n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people from community college do just fine, but I think I\u2019m not alone when I say I think you\u2019re being unreasonable. But this is reddit, and I\u2019m just trying to have a dialogue with you.\n\nI ask you to answer some questions: how do you feel about elite schools accepting virtually no community college transfer students? How do you feel about the fact that much of society (even at my current university) heavily looks down upon community college students? Have you attended a community college before?",

Stanford accepts something like 2% of transfers and that is from all schools. I personally know 5 kids who were homeschooled and when they were accepted to Stanford they had all of their GE completed through community college. Stanford did not accept any of those units. So that is a really bad example because planning the CC transfer route to Stanford isn't very practical. \n\nMy experience is in California and that isn't representative of the rest of the US, but I know several kids who didn't get into UCs and instead of going to CCs and trying to transfer, or going to a CSU, they decided to go out of state or to private schools and ended up taking on debt that they are now struggling to pay back. \n\nIf it makes people feel better about taking on that debt to convince themselves that CCs are a bad a option then there isn't much I can do about that but the reality is being happy at 18 and taking on loans is going to prevent someone from being happier at 28 when they have to delay buying cars, houses and traveling because they have to pay them back.

You can still get research positions at cc and your grades will be high enough to get into med school if u were able to successfully transfer to a good school. No one here is saying that cc is the only solution. Obviously we can recognize that and no one recommends it for someone who got into a top finance school with funding to attend.\nAll of his points are just soooo specific that it can only affect one type of person but since it\u2019s a top post in this subreddit, it\u2019s gonna confuse a lot of freshmen who aren\u2019t even close to being affected by any of these points. I can\u2019t think of any career that cares about prestige as much as finance? Can you? He hasn\u2019t mentioned literally any other career. You said med school but that\u2019s completely untrue.  The type of person this post targets has never been recommended to attend CC over their top school. Pretty much no one is ever recommended to not attend a top school in the first place? Unless it will put them in an amount of debt they could never pay off ",

Companies like Musks companies I would think would be the more prestigious route. Or even NASA would be the top route. I have a friend she  interns at NASA and she went to my state school and went to a community college. Granted she went to a pretty prestigious grad school but she got the first internship based on our state school results. I would think building something that makes our world better would be where the top students should want to work for. ",

It's a lot more difficult to achieve certain things, but almost nothing is really ruled out by your decision to go.  Even with interships and what not, you can always sort of work your way up the hierarchy.  I personally know a couple community college students who intern with some very good companies involving finance and business.  Granted they are not the norm, but there's almost always an intership job out there for anyone if you look hard enough.  So maybe you have to start at a place that's less selective.  Then next summer, you get in somewhere better.  You can also intern during the school year if you're very driven.  I'm sure someone applying for an internship who's already got 1-2 under their belt but is at a cc looks better than someone from some private school without any.\n\nPoint is though, I agree with you.  I'm actually in this spot, and I regret not working harder in high school.  But then again I would have had to get a 4.4 to get into some of the schools I might get into with a 3.6 college gpa.  4-year is the better route, but I wouldn't say there's much anything at all a 4-year student can do that a community college student just absolutely can't, it'll just be more difficult for them.",
