They're the standard 'recorded lectures, note taker, extra exam time, etc', so all classroom based.\n\nNext semester, assuming we don't all go virtual again, I have two school trips planned - one for my capstone, one for a club. Both are ~a week long and out of state, so we'll be staying in hotels. Both are also competition/research based, so I'll need to be 'on my game'.\n\nAdvisors for both trips said we'll be booked 2 to a room. With my disability, I really rely on having a private place to retreat to after school (I go to a tiny college without dorm rooms, so I don't have roommates or any housing accommodations). What's the chance I would be allowed a private room, either as an accommodation they provide or just letting me pay for my own room (which I'd be totally fine with)?", "author": "SirAlthalos", "created": 1632462740, "retrieved": 1632800472, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {"he56fd1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pudjpr/overnight_trip_accommodations/he56fd1/", "text": "Just ask\n\nLiterally none of us can know.\n\nYou have to start taking to actual people.", "author": "PersephoneIsNotHome", "created": 1632519950, "upvotes": 1}, "he2ci7i": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pudjpr/overnight_trip_accommodations/he2ci7i/", "text": "I do not think you would get your own private room since you have no housing accommodations. \n\nAsk them if you could rent your own hotel room because of your disability.
