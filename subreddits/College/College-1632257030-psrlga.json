  "text": "so long story short, i had 5 questions left on an exam with roughly 2 and a half minutes left on the clock. then, out of nowhere, my computer decided to be a little shit and lost connection at the worst timing possible and automatically got submitted because time \u201cran out,\u201d which made me unable to answer the remaining questions. \n\nshould i even email the professor about this? i don\u2019t really see what he could do, or what /i/ should even say, but those two minutes definitely could\u2019ve been a game changer for me (note: this was an exam with 17 questions and no backtrack)\n\nedit: thank you to those who replied! just sent him an email about this!",
