I thought college would be the path. I didnt realise how true that was. \n\nI'll always remember the day it hit me. I was leaving my English class and heading home for the day. The sun was starting to set and the wind blew gently across the campus. It was sometime in september and just started to cool down, southeasterner here too. The light was fading lighting the dying leave an even more brilliant orange than could be imagined. The wind carried the scent of the library through the center of the campus. I had everything planned out for classes and it wasnt such a whirlwind of chaos. I was able to take in what I had been missing before. I knew then I had to make it a part of my life.\n\nI also wanted to add that im not sure if I would get this feeling at any other school. For as much of a pipe dream as it sounds it would be amazing to find myself at home instructing. Something abiut that campus. Plus they just built a new building for art, my major. ",

I don't know what advice you are looking for exactly. I'm not a medical doctor. As long as you are getting in your shadowing, volunteering, research, high GPA and high MCAT, that's the formula for med school. Have a back up plan just in case you don't get in. I see a lot of \"good\" candidates get passed up and need to use their plan B options. If you are getting anything below a B in organic chemistry, you need to turn back and pick something else, I've rarely seen those students get in anywhere other than the Caribbean diploma mills. It's a more competitive market than a few decades ago where you could retake classes and have a good chance of getting into med school. I don't know the curriculum you are in. Biomed doesn't really mean anything to me because I've never seen a school with a program like that. Is it similar to a biochemistry curriculum? ",

Dunno how applicable it is to dual-degree programs, though (I only know about them cos my wife's in one). Reckon they'd want your work to be more integrative in nature, though!\n\nYou can probably chat with your college advising office (especially if there's an MD-PhD program on campus) or check forums and stuff for more info. :]",

There are a lot of grad schools that will take people with a low GPA that other schools won't touch, because the school itself isn't attractive to the better applicants. Students at those schools have a harder time finding high paying employment (by discipline standards) and end up having student loan debt from grad school. That isn't saying you are a bad professional in your field, it's saying you weren't competitive to the better schools when you applied because of your GPA, and that's okay. It is what you had to do to redeem yourself in your field. I have a few students I encourage to get an MS at those schools first because they wouldn't be competitive for a decent doctoral program (in chemistry we don't usually get a master's first). It's a great stepping stone for some people, but I wouldn't recommend it to a student who could get into a bigger profile program; that matters in graduate school.",
