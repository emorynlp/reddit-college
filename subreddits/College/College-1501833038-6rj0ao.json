I thought college would be the path. I didnt realise how true that was. \n\nI'll always remember the day it hit me. I was leaving my English class and heading home for the day. The sun was starting to set and the wind blew gently across the campus. It was sometime in september and just started to cool down, southeasterner here too. The light was fading lighting the dying leave an even more brilliant orange than could be imagined. The wind carried the scent of the library through the center of the campus. I had everything planned out for classes and it wasnt such a whirlwind of chaos. I was able to take in what I had been missing before. I knew then I had to make it a part of my life.\n\nI also wanted to add that im not sure if I would get this feeling at any other school. For as much of a pipe dream as it sounds it would be amazing to find myself at home instructing. Something abiut that campus. Plus they just built a new building for art, my major.
