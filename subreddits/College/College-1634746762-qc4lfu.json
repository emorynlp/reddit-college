  "text": "I came to college because I realized that I never went out much as a kid and spent too much time on studies. So I wanted to put more effort into creating a social life. But things have been really hard in that regard.\n\nI'm currently a junior and an entire semester and a half was taken from me because of Covid, and in the time that I have had on campus, I've only made 3 friends, that I barely have time to hang out with and I don't really feel all that close to. I've been struggling with my classes and it's been taking up almost all my time including weekends. I go out as much as I can= (despite not having a car) and try to go to clubs at every opportunity, but the same people don't always show up. Not to mention, the fact that my only real interests include games and anime doesn't help either\n\nAnd to top it all off, my campus is two states away from where I live. Which means once I graduate, I might end up losing the friends that I have. Even the smallest progress that I've already made will fade because I'm on Twitter and they're on Snapchat (yes, apparently everyone on campus here uses Snapchat)\n\nIs there something wrong with me? Why is my social life just trickling away like this? Why can't I get a second chance at having friends, hanging out and being happy?",
