  "title:": "Won\u2019t have enough savings to live off of past the end of this year, what are my options?",
  "text": "Currently I\u2019m a junior in college with about a year left of school as I plan on graduating early in Dec. 2022. Originally my plan was to use the money I had saved up to live off of in order to give myself more time to focus on school and career related things (I\u2019m a computer science major) The idea is that I want to maximize my chance of getting a full time job after graduation. But after a bit of frivolous spending through the Summer and my family recently deciding to get a new dog (I currently live with my parents), I realize my savings may only last me through the end of this year. I honestly don\u2019t wanna go back to breaking my back at a retail job and I attend a public commuter college for the purpose of not taking out student loans. Thankfully so far, I have none. Do I have any other options to help me live until the end of next year when I graduate?",

      "text": "I would recommend getting on a budget and only keeping necessary expenses so that your savings last longer. You could also find a way to make money with out getting a retail job. You could donate plasma, Babysit, wait tables at a restaurant. Good luck, and try to make those savings last.",
