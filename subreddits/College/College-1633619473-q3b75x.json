  "title:": "Won\u2019t have enough savings to live off of past the end of this year, what are my options?",
  "text": "Currently I\u2019m a junior in college with about a year left of school as I plan on graduating early in Dec. 2022. Originally my plan was to use the money I had saved up to live off of in order to give myself more time to focus on school and career related things (I\u2019m a computer science major) The idea is that I want to maximize my chance of getting a full time job after graduation. But after a bit of frivolous spending through the Summer and my family recently deciding to get a new dog (I currently live with my parents), I realize my savings may only last me through the end of this year. I honestly don\u2019t wanna go back to breaking my back at a retail job and I attend a public commuter college for the purpose of not taking out student loans. Thankfully so far, I have none. Do I have any other options to help me live until the end of next year when I graduate?",

      "text": "I would recommend getting on a budget and only keeping necessary expenses so that your savings last longer. You could also find a way to make money with out getting a retail job. You could donate plasma, Babysit, wait tables at a restaurant. Good luck, and try to make those savings last.",

      "text": "It could help to find some sort of income that is easy for you. Many college students donate plasma and get a decent amount for it. or you could look for a remote job that lets you work from home so that it doesn't disrupt your school schedule. It could also help to budget and make sure that you are using the money that you do have or end up making properly. Find your necessary expenses and cut out all unnecessary spending. It might help to use a budget tracker of some sort, personally, I like Buxfer.",
