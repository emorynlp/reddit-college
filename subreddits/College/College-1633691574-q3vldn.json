  "text": "So just like title says I am starting my first year today. Unlike high-school where I knew it will be hell, I am not so sure what to expect about college.\n\n My expectations so far are that everyone I meet there won't be my type. We definelty won't get along. We will be fake friends that bearly talk to eachoder at best. Then I expect that the change depends on me the most. I feel like i have to do some stuff I was never brave enough to do before. I want to do and try new stuff but it is making me feel anxious. \n\nI am not used to feeling this way as I usualy don't give a single fuck about these type of things. Anyways I only hope people don't treat me like shit there, idk If I could stand being bullied for the third time when starting a new school experinecs.",
