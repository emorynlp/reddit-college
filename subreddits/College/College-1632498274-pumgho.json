I am a senior in college and I am having trouble understanding physics. I did so well in chemistry, organic, biology, etc., but Physics is killing me. Does anyone have any tips for me? Maybe good a YouTube channel that breaks everything down into its most rudimentary parts. Or maybe a good textbook? Any help would be appreciated!", "author": "CRISPR-CasNine", "created": 1632498274, "retrieved": 1632946048, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he4qfin": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pumgho/trouble_with_physics/he4qfin/", "text": "Try the organic chem tutor on youtube.
