I want to try going to parties and making friends but I\u2019m socially awkward and can\u2019t really just do it alone. Whenever I ask my friends they either have other plans don\u2019t want to go do something or do something at like 4am when I\u2019m asleep.\nI\u2019ve also tried doing other stuff like just chill but honestly it hasn\u2019t been that fun. It definitely doesn\u2019t help that everyone gets drunk constantly. Everyone tells me to find new people to hang with and I have tried but I\u2019m bad with meeting people and the majority of people I talk to also just want to get fucked up. \nI really don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I\u2019m kind of just hoping things get better and am studying to do well but would love some advice or for similar people to share their stories.", "author": "Yetitech_", "created": 1631991764, "retrieved": 1632801529, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hddjl9y": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqscpx/how_to_have_fun_at_college/hddjl9y/", "text": "Hey I\u2019m freshman college, bio major\nI literally have no friends dude, i know a few upperclassmen and we got drunk and smoked for the first few weeks a bit, but I don\u2019t hit them up anymore.
