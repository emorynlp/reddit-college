But if you want to interact with other people try to challenge yourself to do something social every couple days, like eating with someone instead of by yourself or going to a club. It doesn't have to be partying. For instance, next week I'm going to spend an afternoon with a friend exploring our college town, getting dinner, then going to a club. We met during orientation but I don't have any classes together so I don't think we're going to end up super close, but I like spending time with her so we planned this. It takes effort for me to do social things but when I do it makes me happy so I try to make some time for it on days I don't have a ton of homework. That said, if you don't need friends to be fulfilled, then you don't need to. During the first week I was upset bc I got close with a few people in orientation and barely saw them anymore and it felt like they were doing so much without me. But ultimately it doesn't matter what they do without you because everyone doesn't do everything stuff with all the people they know and you don't have to be best friends with every person you hang out with. The most important thing is that you find the right balance between classes, extracurriculars, hw, and a social life. I'm still working on it and it's only been 2 weeks but I'm in much better shape than high school.
