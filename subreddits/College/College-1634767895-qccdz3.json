  "text": "I'm a senior in high school that needs some help narrowing down my major,  as I'm starting to apply for colleges this year. I was intending to graduate next year but some complications due to COVID happen so I was fast-tracked to graduate this year. I've chosen a college that I like and it provides a lot in the way of internships and job experience, I  just need to figure out what to major in.\n\nI  was originally planning on focusing on biomedical engineering, but I  have been considering taking something other than STEM.  I have a big personal interest in criminal justice, but I hear it's not a very useful degree in terms of getting jobs because it's sociology. Being a police officer or working in the field is not a good option for me because I'm a  small (5'4\") female and I'm not very intimidating or athletic lol. I  was hoping if I majored in this I could work in youth outreach or do some work for the government. Would majoring in law instead help my job prospects? I would be interested in being a paralegal or doing something like that as well. Some people suggest doing forensics instead as a way to do STEM in the CJ field, is that a good option? Chemistry is not my strongest subject, so it may be too heavy of a major for me.\n\nIn terms of Biomed, I have good grades for it and have been a 90%+ student for my whole high school career, but my main concern is limiting myself too much to one field and changing my mind partway through. I am a bit nervous about committing to something like a masters in biology and I have heard that's required to have a good shot at most jobs. The college I'm going to is not super competitive so I don't think I have any problems getting in. My most ideal career for this would be being a pharmacist or working in pharmaceuticals in general, I wouldn't mind being a nurse or lab technician. I would assume there are a lot of biology majors because it's a popular STEM field, is it very oversaturated?\n\nTL;DR:  need help to choose a major, I have good grades and my interests are criminology/biology/law/medicine, I'm going to a college that is not that competitive and good for internships/job experience, I have good skills in English and technology, I would prefer a job that doesn't involve customer service etc, what would be the best choice for my interests and give me good job prospects? Be brutally honest. A lot of the websites I've looked at make it seem like every major is great and have tons of job opportunities but I doubt that lol. Thanks in advance, I'm really stressing about this.",

      "text": "Cj major here. The job opportunities are endless for this career path, literally. You can work in local law enforcement, federal law enforcement (FBI,DEA,ATF&CIA), work in probation, be a victim advocate, go to law school (at my school if I choose to go into law the schooling will only be 2 years instead of 3 bc i\u2019m a CJ major), the list goes on, and this is only including careers with just a bachelors, more options open up with a masters/PHD. (you also don\u2019t need to be this big buff person to work in CJ, there\u2019s people of all shapes and sizes in my classes) \n\nI\u2019m personally a double major in psych & cj, and some of my peers are doubles in social work/ CJ. The demand for GOOD people to enter the cj system is also high right now so the starting wages have gone up drastically in large cities. It\u2019s a great major and I have zero regrets about picking it. let me know if you have any questions about the type of classes you would take etc.",

          "text": "Thanks, that helps. I was wondering how many of the courses include things other than criminology? I have heard some people say it might include some of forensics, psych and biology etc. and other people say it's more focused on law and sociology only. Besides that, just anything you were surprised by or didn't expect about your major (if anything) would help",

      "text": "From what you said here I would be the most inclined to encourage you to do a law degree.it seems like that would interest you because you are English and technology inclined compared to medical stuff which is prob mostly math and sci and I agree that just a cj degree is pretty specific so if you don\u2019t want to be police or like fbi or forensics I might not recommend that. Even if you just get a bachelors degree in law maybe that would open up the same govt door for that as cj or something. Just my personal opinion good luck",

      "text": "Medical student here. You\u2019ve displayed interest in the healthcare field but you seem very keen on making yourself employable. Healthcare is in dire straits right now. We are so understaffed (nurses, technologists, and other support staff). It has never been this bad. My mother is a radio-technologist in Connecticut. She makes around 41-52 dollars an hour depending if it\u2019s days or nights. If you have any affection towards the health-fields, I would recommend you pursue an associates in a technologist pathway (sonography, radio, etc.). If you really want or need the bachelors for family reasons, pursue nuclear medicine (4 year degree) and a guarantee of 80-90k+ starting out. You\u2019ll always be employable. You\u2019ll lead a good life (at least where money is concerned) and the best part is you\u2019ll be able to start in your early 20\u2019s. College years will be hard I won\u2019t lie, but you\u2019ll reap the benefits for life with little stress about your financials.\n\nEdit: grammar",
