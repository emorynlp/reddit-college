For those who don't know, Academic Bankruptcy is for returning students after a certain period of time that gives you a clean slate with your GPA after a trail semester of getting good grades. Your grades are still on the transcript but are not calculated into your GPA.\n\nThat being said, I'm 24 and have been going back to school with loans for a year. In this year I've gotten straight As and filed academic bankruptcy. I'm now sitting at a 4.0 GPA.\n\nI'm trying to find scholarships but am struggling as I dont know if the academic bankruptcy will throw off my eligibility. All of scholarships I've reviewed do not mention anything about it.\n\nI was wondering if there are any resources for adults going back to school, who have filed academic bankruptcy, to find scholarships?", "author": "KoldGlaze", "created": 1632422238, "retrieved": 1632946156, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
