I wish I had taken a picture of the gift before I gave it to him (pretty standard though, a green Christmas mug that I filled with a hot chocolate thing and a handful of loose, wrapped chocolates). I spent well over 30 minutes standing in TJ Maxx trying to decide on which mug to get him (because I\u2019m dumb and indecisive), but I found one that said something about the North Pole or some shit and was a good size to fit treats in.\n\nI also included a little card, basically just saying how much I appreciated his enthusiasm and friendliness, especially since being a student can be really rough sometimes. I didn\u2019t write *too* much because I didn\u2019t wanna pour my heart out and write some long thing about my mental health and the fact this semester has been unbearably hard at times, so I basically just left it at \u201cthanks for being cheerful and making it easier\u201d or whatnot. \n\nHe seemed super delighted and thanked me like a thousand times. I promised I\u2019d continue to stop in next semester and just... thanks y\u2019all. I can be a really anxious person and I overthink things a lot (i.e. spending an ungodly amount of time looking at mugs) and if y\u2019all hadn\u2019t been so encouraging and helpful on my original post, I probably would\u2019ve been too nervous to get and give him a gift. \n\nHappy holidays everyone!", "author": "coolfishes", "created": 1576801850, "retrieved": 1632947190, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1490, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fbzlppz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ed27re/update_i_gave_the_older_man_who_works_in_the/fbzlppz/", "text": "Dont worry i spend an ungodly amount of time looking at pens", "author": "kyleclay25", "created": 1577250972, "upvotes": 1}, "fbgt0uy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ed27re/update_i_gave_the_older_man_who_works_in_the/fbgt0uy/", "text": "So happy you followed through with this!
