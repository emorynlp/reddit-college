  "text": "Just had my third one today. Have five major papers due next week in addition to two exams that are worth more than a third of my grade. I\u2019m trying to stay calm and collected but the pressure is really starting to get to me. I\u2019m terrified of all the hard work I put in this semester going to waste. Does anyone have tips to cope with the stress of finals?\n\nEdit: Thank you guys so much for all of your encouraging responses! Although my eyes are swollen from crying yesterday, I woke up early and completed an outline for one of my papers. I\u2019m feeling much better now. Good luck to everyone else who\u2019s going through finals right now! \n\nSide note: I didn\u2019t wait to start my papers until this week. I have outlined at least or have a rough draft for all of them except one. I\u2019m just stressed about them being good enough.",

You should not be comfortable when doing maths. \n\nBeyond that, it's about recognizing that you already have all of the resources and information you need right in front of you, it's just obscured or hidden. Like an escape room, your job is to follow the clues and solve the puzzle. Making mistakes and being clueless is Step No. 0 in that process, and if you always balk and quit the moment that you get lost, you'll never progress in mathematics.",

If maths is seriously that much of an issue, you should drop to part-time so that you can focus on those 1-2 classes in isolation. For most students working part-time and studying full-time, it's enough for them to carefully plan their semesters so that they always have a mix of easy and hard classes. I structured mine so that I'd only ever have 3 classes that I really had to put effort into, and leave the other one as a bit of a bludge.",

Taking maybe just a repeat of a beginning algebra class while knocking out easier subjects like English or some other non science class. At 35 and no kids or relationship to speak of, I'm not too worried about how much longer it will take like the younger generations. At this stage in my life, it'll get done when it gets done. It's more or less one of the few goals I'd like to accomplish before passing into the night.\n\nIf I retain knowledge well enough to pass the tests on the umpteenth time, I feel like accomplished something. I recently took an algebra class last semester and felt I had a better grasp of it thanks to a seasoned instructor and things like Khan Academy that made the whole, Mymathlab experience less atrocious. \n\nThat said, college, let alone school as a whole, has always been an intimidating and forceful environment for me. I was never big on the online-only format either, so I settled for night classes on nights I wasn't working. 1-2 classes a semester is about all I could mentally handle. Of course, that all depends on those night classes not getting canceled by the instructor due to low enrollment.\n\nDidn't mean to ramble on.",
