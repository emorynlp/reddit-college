  "text": "Hi, so i\u2019m 21 and i\u2019ve been going to community college for 3 years now. In high school I did pretty well, averaged around B\u2019s and some A\u2019s, but once I started college I became the worst student possible. i\u2019ve dropped out of numerous classes, failed 3 and changed my major 4 times, and I run into the same problem every time- I get overwhelmed and anxious to the point I\u2019m frozen and feel like I can\u2019t even look at my computer. I was dismissed from the first community college I attended for dropping too many classes and a low gpa. Since COVID, i transferred to another community college and began online classes. i\u2019m about 10 weeks in and i\u2019m extremely behind in 2 out of the 4 classes. I managed to finish one rushed course, but at this point in the semester I start crying as soon as I look at my assignments, grades and what I need to do to be successful. My major is Art, so I keep questioning why I\u2019m putting myself through this stress and anxiety for something that won\u2019t necessarily help me in the future. i\u2019ve been wanting to go to cosmetology school to become a hair stylist, but I get so much pressure from my dad claiming that I would regret not getting at least my associates degree. At this point I don\u2019t know what to do and it\u2019s affecting my mental health so I could use some help. thanks",

I wouldn\u2019t say I regret my decision, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was necessarily the right decision either. You\u2019ve got to take care of your mind first and foremost.",
