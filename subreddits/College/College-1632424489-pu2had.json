I have a lot of acquaintances but no true friends. I don\u2019t have a group either. Is it normal for everyone to just do their own thing most of the time and spend most of your time alone? I don\u2019t get how some people have their best friends here or groups all the time. And I\u2019m in a few activities and stuff but still haven\u2019t found \u201cmy people\u201d it\u2019s just difficult it feels like nothing really develops. I feel that I really desire deep friendships where I can rely, confide, and feel chosen by someone else. Maybe college is mainly just surface level friends? Are people actually happy emotionally in college or is it typical to be kinda stressed and lonely? I feel I could always look to the future of things being better later but I am very thankful for what I have right now.

It\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll make anymore.\n\nThink of your parents.
