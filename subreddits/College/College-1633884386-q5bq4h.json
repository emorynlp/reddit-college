  "text": "I hate lectures, I love participating and learn more effectively in small groups of people. I can't concentrate if it's a lecture. Do you have any tips?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I\u2019m doing pretty well, I don\u2019t have any problems regarding success. I currently have a 3.7 GPA. I\u2019m a language major so most of my courses are discussion heavy in small groups of people (like 20-30). I just really don\u2019t like lectures and was asking if anyone had any tips to make them more bearable and efficient.",

Read the material first so that you have an idea of what the lecture is about. Or say that college simply isn't for you. There's no shame in that either.",

That way you can also ask each other questions. And if you ever have to miss class you know you have people to count on. Of course, if you get easily distracted then this might not be the best method.",

      "text": "People learn in different ways. Some people absorb everything in a lecture and can recall it. Some people can get what they need from the texts. Some people get it from the discussion groups. You're asking how to get better at something you're bad at and there's no problem with working to shore up any weaknesses but you can also spend time figuring out how to get the most out of your strengths. You're good at small groups, find or form a study group for your classes. Meet with your professors during office hours, tell them that while you will be attending them, lectures aren't your best thing and see if you meet them every week or two for a very quick overview of areas from the lectures to focus on. Getting better at learning from lectures is fine but your need to understand things won't go away while you're doing that.",
