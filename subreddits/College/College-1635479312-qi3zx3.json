  "title:": "Is Music Going to Destroy My Academic Career?",
  "text": "I just started college in August and entered as a music major because I got a good scholarship and thought I would have the chance to take a class or two outside of music to explore my options. Unfortunately that didn't really happen. At this point I've decided that after this semester I won't continue as a music major. I will lose my scholarship but that is fine because I have other sizable financial aid. However, my music classes, especially theory, are absolutely destroying me. I do not understand theory at all and feel no motivation to do literally any of this work. It feels like pointless busy work. It is so difficult and I will never use this information. I can't drop these classes because I won't be a full time student if I do and will lose all of my financial aid and housing. I can't just fail all of these classes either. I have a meeting with my academic advisor tomorrow but she isn't some sort of magician. I'm a first gen college student so I really don't have anyone in my family who would understand this predicament. I really am feeling so hopeless right now.",
