  "text": "I\u2019m taking 4 classes this semester and have a 4.0 gpa. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get an A in 3 classes however I\u2019m failing the fourth one. Will this have an impact on my gpa? I\u2019m only one semester away from transferring out of community college and I\u2019m concerned this will affect my ability to transfer, as well as scholarship opportunities.",
