  "text": "Recently I\u2019ve been thinking about studying abroad. I was wondering if any Americans here have gone to Europe to get their masters degree. I\u2019ve seen a bit online about free public universities in Germany, Norway, Switzerland and I\u2019ve also seen there\u2019s a good chance I could get fafsa to help with my cost of living while I\u2019m there. Has anyone here done that? What was it like for you? Is there anything you wish you\u2019d known or done prior to going over there? Any advice is much appreciated! Thanks.",
