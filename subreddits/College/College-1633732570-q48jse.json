  "text": "I\u2019ve kinda lost motivation. I\u2019m actually studying in a uni that is quite expensive and is costing my family to work and spend all that they earn for my tuition so I want to work hard in return. I\u2019m aiming for med school and I just got a very low mark for a project  in a core unit which is worth nearly half of my whole grade. So yeah, should I continue on? Exams are next week and I\u2019ve been grinding so hard this week studying everyday but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll be worth it.\n\nI\u2019m quite burnt out already, honestly.",
