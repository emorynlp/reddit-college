  "text": "I\u2019ve had class with this one girl throughout the whole semester and this past week we finally talked for the first time. After that class she brought up to me that she\u2019s always in the library and that if I ever wanted to join her that I could do we exchanged snapchats and ended up meeting that same day to study and talking each day after class. We haven\u2019t really been texting each other aside from like little questions about class but I really want to ask her out to dinner or something sometime this week. I\u2019m just nervous about it potentially being too soon or it blowing up in my face. What do you guys think?",

This\u2019ll make your date less awkward, because you\u2019ll know quite a few things about each other and are comfortable around one another. After a while, ask her face to face, it\u2019s better, but please make sure that she doesn\u2019t have a partner :)\n\nMake sure to keep things a bit flirty before asking (like when you hang out), so she gets a hint that you\u2019re into her and your question doesn\u2019t catch her off guard.",

If she says no then it doesn\u2019t really give any indication about anything but if she says yes then it\u2019s a win. Of course don\u2019t do this like 30min into the study session. I also agree with what @ZackLilack said other than that you got this \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
