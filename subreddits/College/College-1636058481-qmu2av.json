  "title:": "What kind of food should I have at my apartment",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first year and still kinda figuring out what to do about food. There\u2019s the dining hall, which is fine, but it\u2019s a two mile walk to it or I can take the bus, so either way it\u2019s a whole ordeal to get there. But everytime I buy food, I find it going to waste. I buy chips, or sandwhich stuff, or whatever, but the problem I have is that I don\u2019t eat at my apartment enough, and it all ends up going bad.\n\nI\u2019d like to have food in my apartment for when I\u2019m hungry and don\u2019t feel like going all the way to the dining hall, but it feels like such a waste to buy food that I know is most likely gonna go bad before I get even halfway through it. So what are some foods I can buy that won\u2019t go bad so quickly? Besides the obvious things like soup, etc. Preferably things that take low effort to prepare.",
