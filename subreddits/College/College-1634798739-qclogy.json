  "title:": "Will transferring back to my old college restart my gpa?",
  "text": "I started college 2019 and after my first semester the pandemic hit and everything went online. I went through a rough time (getting laid-off, falling behind in bills, struggling in school) and I ended up failing a lot of classes which tanked my gpa below a 1.3. After taking a year off of school I decided to transfer to a community college to finish my general education classes (it was a cheaper option). Now I\u2019m near the end of my Gen Ed classes and I\u2019m thinking of transferring back to my old university.   My question is if I transfer back to my old college will I stay with the first gpa (below 1.3) I had at the time or will it start over.   \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just transfer to a new college\u201d I really do like my old university because of their programs, clubs, and events but I don\u2019t want to have a crappy gpa.",
