  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m currently a pre vet major taking General Chemistry and I\u2019m having a really hard time with a lot of the theoretical concepts. I\u2019m kind of at a disadvantage, as in high school I only took agricultural \u201cchemistry\u201d (horrible class, learned nothing, constantly hating myself for not taking AP Chem) and I\u2019m extremely stressed and burnt out from studying and trying to keep my grade in that class up. I\u2019m currently using ClutchPrep but I honestly don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s helping. Any advice would be amazing, thanks so much in advance!",

      "text": "If it\u2019s conceptual and theoretical stuff you\u2019re having trouble with try creating a mind map. Focus on practicing problems and putting those concepts into action instead of focusing on reading and watching videos. Chemistry classes are less about memorization and more about application. If you can, go to office hours or ta sessions for extra help. Also I was at a disadvantage too, I failed high school chemistry lmao but I did great in my general chemistry classes and even TA and tutor for general chemistry now! You\u2019ll be fine!",
