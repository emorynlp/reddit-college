When I talk to others who are also in a negative headspace, one of two things happens: 1) we have a meaningful conversation and feel less alone or 2) we end up bringing each other down even more due to our negative outlooks (unintentionally). So yeah, I think therapy is the better option, just make sure you find one that actually helps you.",

This risk may be less likely the smaller the age difference, but I'm friends with someone younger than me who needs to vent sometimes and I straight up had to tell her \"you cannot vent to me\" because some of the things she was venting about actually pissed me off because of the entitlement involved. It would have taken someone with the ability and skill of a therapist to both help her feel better and get her head on straight, especially since my take on it was insensitive and potentially not 100% accurate.",

I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to achieve, but I think this is a frankly unethical way to go about it.\n\nCommiserating can be good for catharsis but if you constantly vent and complain to people who share your same issues, it could distort your worldview and make you feel like it\u2019ll never get better. This format might prevent users from seeking out real treatment and could end really poorly.\n\nI\u2019m sure that some people are self-aware enough to know that an environment like that wouldn\u2019t be good for them, but I\u2019m sure others would not know that (esp if they\u2019re teenagers). I\u2019m not a professional but I do not think you should make this app, or if you do at the very least you need to include aggressive, constant notices that if someone is feeling hopeless or suicidal they need to seek out real treatment.\n\nInstead I would maybe suggest an app that allows users to anonymously recommend mental health counselors/therapists/etc. And maybe you could add tags to reviews where people list the specific problems they struggled with that the therapist helped them with. Just a thought, idk",

I find that the idea of \u201ccreating an app for problem X\u201d, to be a new-age infatuation with the potential of social media apps with seldom a basis in reality. Though I admit, I am not too knowledgeable regarding what the app may accomplish with regards to any studies that you\u2019ve read.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to discourage you, but this may be a case of the blind leading the blind, in addition to a conflict of interests; there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s discouraged for an attorney to represent themselves, a doctor to treat a family member, or a therapist to treat their family.\n\nWhile I\u2019m aware of support groups, many of them still have professionals moderating the group. My experiences offline and off had led me to believe that while venting is perfectly acceptable among mentally healthy and resilient individuals, it\u2019s those with longstanding issues that I am concerned about, those most likely to use your app, and for whom therapy should be the primary option.\n\nObligatory not a professional. I also apologize if I misunderstood you.",

And then there are people who yes, have struggled, but are still intentionally manipulative (likely because it\u2019s what they\u2019ve learned they have to be in order to survive). Bonding over shared trauma can make it hard for you to see if who you\u2019re talking to is actually someone who has good intentions.\n\nObligatory also not a professional",

The other person will start to absorb that negativity and be dragged down with you, you'll start to be obnoxious, and it will wear down whatever relationship you have with that person. \n\nSo it's good to do it, but don't do it often.

You should not ask your friends to do this though as it is a heavy burden. A good friend would also try to sift your mind to positivity after the venting is done.",
