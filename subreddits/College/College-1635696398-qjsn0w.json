  "title:": "Should I retake a couple of classes I already have credits for to get a better understanding of them for my career?",
  "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I was a year ahead in math in highschool, and then I decided it would be a good idea to skip ahead another math class. I was completely lost in that math class, and I didn't put any effort into trying to learn the bits that I missed out on learning. \n\nThis led me to grow an aversion towards a subject that I found rather interesting and fun. \n\nFast forward to college, where I had to take calculus. I ended up barely passing (on my second time taking the class) but I never really had a deep understanding of what I was doing. That lack of understanding was partly because I, again, didn't put much effort into learning the material. \n\nI ultimately ended up dropping out of that college.\n\nFast forward a couple of years to now. I'm studying computer science and I'm actually putting in maximum effort towards my learning. I'm actually interacting with my professors and getting help when I'm stuck on something as opposed to just ignoring it as I have done in the past. \n\nClasses are going well, and I'm really enjoying the material. \n\nEven though it isn't required for my major (because I'm taking discrete math instead of calculus) I have a strong feeling that I will someday want to learn calculus as I've heard it's pretty much mandatory for machine learning, a subject I would love to learn. That and the need for calculus in other realms of computer science and science in general, seems rather apparent. \n\nThe thing I'm stuck on trying to figure out, is whether or not I should retake college algebra (as I've forgotten a lot of important aspects of it over the many years I haven't been using it) even though I have a credit for it or if I should go back to trig or just the calculus that I wasn't willing to put the time into. Or whether or not I should do any of this and just focus on my computer science degree.\n\nI've talked with my discrete math professor about this and she suggests not taking college algebra, as it's one of the most failed classes and if I really wanted to, I should just retake trigonometry or differential calculus. \n\nI feel like I should retake college algebra, because it should mostly just be review and it's basically fundamental for every math class after it. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "I graduated this past May with a degree in mathematics. I am working in retail management and have had no issue with the transition. My point is that you will be trained for any job you pursue. You are not expected to remember everything you learn in college. I could sit down and do some basic calculus, but if it started to get complicated I would need some review (and I loved all of my Calculus classes). \n\nMost jobs use computer software to do any difficult math as well. You would not be sitting down to do advances calculus, you would just need to know enough to punch in the right numbers. \n\nYou teacher is right about college algebra. A lot of people fail it. Also, calculus doesn\u2019t really build off of algebra. In high school algebra is the basis for all math. In college that is just not the case. Calculus is definitely more closely related to trig so that wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to retake. I personally think that retaking algebra would be a waste of your time. \n\nMy suggestion is to just focus on your degree. If you feel the need to retake something go for trig or calc",
