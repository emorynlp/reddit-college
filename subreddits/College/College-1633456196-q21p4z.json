  "text": "I submitted an application for undergrad research to a professor\u2019s website. He\u2019s never taught me but he works at my college. He told me he wanted to meet with me in 2-3 weeks over zoom, to email him then, bc at the time he was super busy as the semester just started. I emailed him 2 weeks later and he didn\u2019t reply. It\u2019s been 5 days. Should I contact him again? Also worth nothing that I emailed him the week a lot of professors gave unit tests.",
