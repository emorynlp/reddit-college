  "text": "I mean in terms of a lack of energy and just so fatigued all the time. I manage to get a good amount of sleep every night, yet I'm still tired throughout the day. It's been harder for me to do my assignments without me feeling drowsy and just wanted to crawl back into bed and do nothing. \n\nI have an exam tomorrow morning at 8am and I just don't have the energy to study for it even though I wrote notes on the chapters that will be on the test and I also studied previously. But I just feel so burnt out and tired that I don't want to do any more schoolwork.\n\nI know for a fact I'm not the only one experiencing this, but I figured I'd just throw this on Reddit and see what others have to say.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Classes I used to love are just bland, and classes that used to be bland are now miserable. I've literally watched my grades slowly slip away as the year's progressed, and now I'm doing notably worse in classes I was acing last semester. I feel like I've become an entirely different person.",

Get out and walk for an hour every other day.\n\nMeditation is more beneficial than you might know. There is moderate evidence that meditation improves symptoms of anxiety. A 2014 review of the literature found that mindfulness meditation programs had moderate evidence of improved anxiety, depression, and pain, and low evidence of improved stress/distress and mental health-related quality of life.  Just go on YouTube and search for 10 min guided meditation.\n\nNutrition. Being tired all the time can also be a sign of vitamin deficiency. This could include low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-12, iron, magnesium, or potassium.  Eat well-balanced meals and take vitamin supplements.",

At least 20 minutes of sunlight everyday and at least 20 minutes of excercise everyday. As well as 20 minutes of self-care, whether it be doing your nails, yoga, journaling, or pampering yourself.",

And being the stupid computers they are, they will do *exactly* as you tell them. MATLAB in particular has a rather horrid little habit of doing what you tell it to even if you tell it to do the impossible - it doesn't throw an error or a warning, and sometimes it gives results that seem pretty reasonable if you don't already know what the exact answer should be. Your calculator will do the same. Every single calculator is capable of doing this.\n\nThat's why you **really, REALLY** need to learn to graph them by hand. When you move on from this and do end up using nothing but computers to do the grunt work, you'll have an intuition for what's possible, what's going to cause issues, and what the rough answer should look like. This is **NOT** a pointless exercise or worthless hoop to jump through. It is a fundamental part of your education.\n\nI experienced an example of this literally this week. I passed zero into a sine function and then passed the result of that into a logarithm. Log(0) is undefined. The result? Energy and the r component of magnetic field undefined over my simulation, making it useless and costing us a fair bit of money and time. That stupid little error has cost me days of debugging, and it's all because the computer did what I told it to do. The only reason I didn't lose more time/money is because I understand these functions and I could immediately see the problem of passing a cylindrical radius through a log function.",
