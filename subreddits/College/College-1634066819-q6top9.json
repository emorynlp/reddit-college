  "text": "Not sure if this type of post is allowed. If not, I will delete.\n\nMy wife (non-reddit user) is a Doctoral Candidate and is seeking participants for her dissertation on the college student\u2019s experience of loss during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes not just death, but loss of certain college experiences, relationships, dreams, etc. \n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare college students\u2019 attachment styles, levels of disenfranchised grief, and the severity of reactions to loss during the Covid-19 pandemic. We feel this is important research relating to mental health effects of the pandemic that will hopefully help in the future.\n\nData collection is being conducted by survey research. The survey is completely confidential and anonymous.\n\nCriteria to participate are college students who were enrolled in a 4-year college or university in the United States during 2020 and are between the ages of 18-30.\n\nThe survey takes about ten minutes to complete. It\u2019s completely confidential and voluntary. Please pass along to the college students who qualify for the study. If you have any questions, please comment.\n\nHere\u2019s the link to participate: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3DB2CXQ](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/3DB2CXQ)\n\nThank you for your time and consideration!",
