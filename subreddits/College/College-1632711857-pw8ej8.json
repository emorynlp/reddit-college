  "text": "I mean the issue is that my procrastination habits ended up destroying my chance of doing well when the class if more difficult. Sometimes I sometimes tend to procrastinate on stuff that's I suspect that I would struggle on or that is tedious until the last minute (believing that I could figure it out later), and then I run out of time to ask for help. \n\nI also ended up doing something at the last minute, just to realize that theirs's something that I missed or something that I don't get.\n\nLuckily I'm taking easy classes this semester, but next semester is going to be more difficult and I know this procrastination habit is going to kill my GPA and my chance of mastering anything. I know I need to finish my studying and learning early and do the homework and quizzes early so I have a chance to ask questions and seek help about something that's too complicated or over my head. I know that I can't just put things off all because I don't get it or can't figure it out. \n\nHow do I stop doing this?",
