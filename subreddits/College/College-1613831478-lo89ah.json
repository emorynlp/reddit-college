After welding i plan on going for an hvac diploma as well, to pick up as many trades as i can.\n\nIve been poor most of my life so i cant really afford a normal college or uni but a lot of these trades are only 1 year so I wouldnt be paying for much to begin with, i think it would also save me a lot of money if i get my own house and something goes wrong with my plumbing. \n\nYou guys got any suggestions or warnings i should be prepared for when i do go back to schooling?", "author": "Panterafan316", "created": 1613831478, "retrieved": 1632947241, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1311, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gon9ulj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/lo89ah/after_2_years_of_graduating_high_school_and_doing/gon9ulj/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1614212038, "upvotes": 1}, "go8hnca": {"link": "/r/college/comments/lo89ah/after_2_years_of_graduating_high_school_and_doing/go8hnca/", "text": "Fantastic my friend!

You don\u2019t have to deal with shit (literal) that a plumber would and won\u2019t blow your ass to pieces like a lineman could do. You can take it at a community college for like 2k a year and it\u2019s only two or three years long. You mention being poor, there is grants and stuff for poor people that pay your school. \n\nExample: I am paid $42 an hour at 35 years old working on military aircraft, can\u2019t complain about anything really. There\u2019s always options as well. Even commercial airlines will value your skills if you want to get out of military aircraft. If you\u2019re willing to work military contracts overseas etc get ready to become (what I consider) rich at a young age, there\u2019s people making 200k+ and they have some tax exemptions.\n\nNow maybe I\u2019m just unlucky and worked with assholes my entire life. You mention social autism, idk what that is but if it means you\u2019re a pussy and can\u2019t handle talking a lot of shit you are in for a rough time. Every skilled labor trade worker I know talks shit fairly routine, even if it\u2019s just for fun if you\u2019re weak or offended easily it\u2019s something you need to be able to handle. Men talk mad shit and bust each other\u2019s balls especially in a more \u201cgrunt\u201d industry. You may be a woman in which case idk how they\u2019re treated, I work with nearly no women.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to what I\u2019m talking about.
