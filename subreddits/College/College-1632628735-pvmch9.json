I create small breaks to relax but for the most part I\u2019m always working on something. I hate when assignments pile up so I starting on projects early and use my weekends. I\u2019m just afraid that I could develop burnout because I\u2019ve been told to enjoy my weekends but having multiple big projects due at the same time in the next few weeks scares me so I start on them early, I\u2019d rather do that than wait for it to get overwhelming. Also the way my classes are structured, I have to work on them a little bit every day otherwise I get behind fast. \nWill treating every day like a work day actually be unsustainable if I\u2019m balancing my days?\nYeah some days I wish I could not do school but at the same time life is quite boring without school (don\u2019t have a ton of friends) so in some ways having stuff to do is easier. Most days I am in a good mood especially if I\u2019m productive with my classes.", "author": "QuickEquivalent0", "created": 1632628735, "retrieved": 1632800264, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hef4yq1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvmch9/homework_on_weekends_and_burnout/hef4yq1/", "text": "Honestly, it really depends. For me, doing what you did works best for me. When you get ahead, you give yourself more flexibility in terms of taking a break if needed. When you only look at one week at a time you end up with insane weeks where you can't take a break even if you wanted to. Imo the former is better.  The semester tends to get busier as the semester goes on so the more cushion you can give yourself the better.
