  "text": "Hey all\n\nI went to college for a 4 year BS degree. I failed a calc class my last semester and it took me 3 years to finally finish it, so I graduated in 2019 instead of 2016, one of my bigger regrets. \n\nI didn\u2019t do great in school (started working part time in my field which was hard to ignore for boring classes), graduating gpa was below 3.0. \n\nCan I get a masters? I\u2019ve been wanting to get a masters in computer science for a while now, but I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t be accepted since I did so poorly in my undergrad",

      "text": "Yes. As long as you're paying, someone will accept you. Worst case scenario, you may have to retake some of your undergrad classes to boost your GPA or take some more advanced classes and do well in them to show to schools you're applying to that you have what it takes. You can do this by signing up as a non-matriculated student somewhere. However, you can probably apply to master's programs right now and get in with \"probationary admission\" which means that you aren't \"fully\" accepted until you complete a semester or two with a good GPA (and if you fail to get that GPA they'll kick you out). Again, schools don't like saying no to money, so many are willing to at least give weak students a shot.",
