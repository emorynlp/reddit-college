  "text": "This is my 4th week back after a gap year and I\u2019m so behind. I\u2019ve forgotten everything. If I started trying, do you think I could pass with a C in all my classes before Dec 15th?\n\nI just feel hopeless. I just want to finish this semester with at least a 2.0 so I can drop out but still be in good standing with my financial aid if I ever decide to come back.",

      "text": "There really isn't enough information here to say. It depends on what your current grades are, whether or not you can make up any missed work, what classes you're taking, how much prerequisite knowledge you need, etc. \n\nWith 11 weeks to go, though, you probably have a good shot. Start going to tutoring. Most schools have some free tutoring options.\n\nDiscuss your concerns now with professors and ask if they feel it's doable.",
