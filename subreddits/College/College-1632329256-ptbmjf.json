How to I bounce back and stay motivated in order to transfer out to a top competitive school?", "text": "I didnt know what to expect for my first chem test in college. Now, I know. It wasnt too bad, it was easy I just didnt remember ALL of the calculation steps to get to an answer. If you dont remember one step, your answer in the end will be wrong and we submitted our answers online. I want to do better. But having that be 60% of my grade scares me a lot. I still have 4 large exams like this to go for the semester but with harder material. My professor is the type to tell you what most of the exam is on, you think I can bounce back to an A? Chem is my worst subject, this is why I worry a lot especially since I want to tranfer to Umich after my first year here.\n\nI dont even get half credit back for somewhat correct answers because it was all online!!! I know I messed up but my percent for this test is absolutely horrendous.
