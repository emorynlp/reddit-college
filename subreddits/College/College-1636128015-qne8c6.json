  "title:": "Should I double major in Electrical Engineering and Environmental Science?",
  "text": "For context, I started uni as a sophomore because of college credits I earned in high school. \n\nI was majoring in Environmental Science my 1st year but switched to Electrical Engineering after learning about GIS. Now I\u2019m about to finish my first semester in that major and I honestly love it (plus I find myself not struggling as much as my classmates) but I find myself missing my old major. Because of this I decided to switch back to my old major but I miss Electrical Engineering despite still taking classes for it. \n\nA factor for switching to environmental science again is math. I learned online during Covid so do I really know math? \n\nI was thinking of possibly minoring in creative writing to build my soft skill (because my writing is REALLY rough) while I major in Environmental Science but I\u2019m not sure. \n\n It sucks because I\u2019m equally passionate about both majors and I can\u2019t decide which I should choose. I just know I want to focus on conservation (with engineering I wanted to work at a firm for the environment/GIS to make life easier for scientists). \n\nShould I double major despite how long it\u2019ll take me to graduate? Does the combination make sense? \n\nI was think alternatively I could major in environmental science and minor in electrical engineering and creative writing. But does that work from a career standpoint and is it worth the extra time I\u2019ll be in uni? \n\nI\u2019m just really confused and would appreciate any insight/opinions on the situation. Also I apologize for how confusing and long this post is.",

      "text": "Electrical Engineering is generally considered one of the more difficult of the STEM Majors. It's extremely math intensive and the coursework can get pretty abstract.\n\nDouble majoring in two Liberal Arts subjects is already a large amount of extra work for not that much payoff (Double majoring is mostly pointless) Double majoring in something that includes EE is extremely difficult. Additionally, there isn't much overlap between EE and Env. Science, so I guess career wise I'm a bit confused on why you need two complete majors in them.\n\nIf your goal is to do engineering work for environmental companies, I can promise you that just having an engineering degree will get you in the door.\n\nPerhaps if you have time in between your EE classes (spoiler, you wont) you can take some environmental electives that will help round out your interests.",
