  "text": "Withdrawal deadlines are due by November 5th, and I'm considering to take the W for my Calc class. I'm not doing so well and after re-taking the course three semesters, I give up. I looked through the the catalog for my major which is Computer Information Systems and found that I could take elementary statistics for the math course. I wanted to know how the coursework is for Statistics. Do I need to memorize a lot of formulas or is the work word based?",

      "text": "Intro stats is way easier than calculus IMO. Just make sure it\u2019s algebra based statistics. At my school comp sci people have to take calculus based statistics. Just make sure that calculus isn\u2019t listed as a prerequisite. But yeah the introductory statistics with no calculus is super simple. It\u2019s lots of formulas but I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019ll have you memorize them. I\u2019m a stats minor so I\u2019ve taken like 4 levels of statistics now and I\u2019ve always had a formula sheet.",

          "text": "Well, calculus was a prerequisite for my Computer Science Major however I switched to Computer Information Systems. With that major, I'm not required to take Calc 1 & 2. The elementary statistics catalog doesn't list any calculus. I'm planning to talk with my professor about this but I think I made up my mind. Thank you.",

      "text": "I took both calc 1 & 2 and I can firmly say stats is to my knowledge easier for understanding. It seems more straight forward like oh yeah that makes sense or it fits the puzzle kind of. For stats, I think it depends  on the professor but my intro is a little memorization of the formulas but a lot more focused on the HW applications so you can practice it. The work can be word based but really it\u2019s just understanding the x bar or y bar and y variables in the word problem and applying them to formulas like finding residual. Usually it was not too complicated. There may be some union and intersections and disjoint but just pay attention to the professor at that point since it gets a little weird but not too difficult, there is also a lot of material online for intro courses so there\u2019s a good in that too if you have trouble understanding some topics.",
