  "text": "Hey there, so I recently moved out for uni and I'm struggling quite a lot to eat. I am not a bad cooker it's just that I'm too lazy to cook and even too lazy to buy food. RN I just have 3 eggs on my fridge but I am extremely behind the term so I have no time to lose to go and buy food. What should I do? IK it may sound stupid but I am dead serious.\n\nThank you so much!",
