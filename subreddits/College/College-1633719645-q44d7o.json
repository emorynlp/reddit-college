  "title:": "skipping class for a concert with these stakes, yay or nay?",
  "text": "There's a concert for a band that that my friends and i have been waiting to see live for the last two years ( their first show here was originally cancelled by covid ) and when they announced tickets for the tour this summer , i immediately bought them knowing that the concert date ( a TUESDAY night . . . . . ) would be during the school year and i would be most likely be missing class for it and whatever. My school is \\~1.5 hours away from the city where the concert is held, which is why im missing class in order to actually get there and whatever. \n\nWhat i did NOT plan for ofc, was for a fucking test to be scheduled on the concert date, and my instructor made it clear in the syllabus that there are no makeup dates and i cant take it earlier / later than the date . Our tests are worth 20% of our grade, and there's only four of them, so in my final grade calculations, taking a hit of 5% is already such s huge gamble, not to mention general grade fluctuations and whatever. I'm pulling 9.5/10 , 19.5/20 on my quizzes and assignments (this is an upper division language course, which explains why my professor is so strict when grading, but i love her!!), so when doing a final grade calculation with that-5%, i'm just barely grazing 89% before the final exam (also 20%). My last two tests have been average, 44.5/50  and 41.5/50 , and i have another one (technically my \"last\" one if i continue with my original plan) in two weeks that i'm planning to really bust my ass for to max out what i can of 15/20 grade points . With stakes like this, should I still skip that last test and go to the concert?\n\nIn a perfect world, I could leave school directly after class (ends at 3:15) and immediately start driving to the city because the doors only open at 7:30, so \\~4 hours would be enough time to factor in possible traffic and getting ready imo. Sadly, I don't have a car here and it feels a little fucked up to make my friends drive down here to pick me up and immediately drive back for the concert. \n\nI'm weighing my options because I'm not just going to school for the sole purpose of expanding my knowledge, but I hope to go to medical school in the future, and this class was kind of like my GPA padding(?) / easy A (of course, made much easier when im not actively skipping a test) for the semester. I'm doing decent in my other classes and I just aced my last two midterms, so my final GPA might not be as bad as I fear it could be, but I try to be realistic hahaha. I'm a sophomore, by the way\\^\\^\n\ntl;dr \u2014 should i skip a test worth 5% of my grade ( putting me at an ending grade of around 89 before my final exam ) for a concert ive been waiting two years for . . . . ?",

Take the exam then go to the concert. \n\nAlso, if they're your friends they should understand. And hopefully they'd be willing to drive to get you and then go to the concert. Offer to pay for gas? (But I also totally get not wanting to put that on your friends)",

      "text": "When in positions like this, always ask yourself, \u201cwhich one will benefit me long-term?\u201d\n\nYes, that test is only worth 5% if your grade, but it\u2019s also an opportunity for an easy A. If you fail another class in the future or don\u2019t do too well, that A can help you. Lower grades affect your GPA more than higher ones. And your GPA is clearly very important if you want to get into med school which is extremely competitive.\n\nPrioritize the test then go to the concert. You\u2019ll be thanking yourself in the future.",
