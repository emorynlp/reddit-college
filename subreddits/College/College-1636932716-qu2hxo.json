  "title:": "Hs Niece\u2019s mother is squashing her kid\u2019s future tech theater college dreams",
  "text": "17yo Niece is in 11th grade and had dreams to go to a theater tech program at one of several colleges. Those she is looking at are located in the north and Midwest. She lives in the south and has a passion for her hs theater, takes several AP classes, and has about a B + average. \n\nMoney isn\u2019t an issue because aunt and grandma have plenty and will pay for tuition, room and board. No strings attached.\n\nHowever, mom keeps saying to niece there isn\u2019t enough money and niece is now scared to go out of state. \nMom wants niece at home because mom is lonely and wants company. \n\nNiece gets along with her mom and believes everything she says.\n\nAs an aunt it saddens me to see this. \nI get along with both mom and niece but I walk on eggshells being very careful not to step on moms toes and say anything that might be construed as negative. Mom has mental health issues and wastes money like water which is why she can\u2019t afford college.\n\nBut I never said a word about that or anything negative.\n\nI\u2019m about to take a 5 day vacation trip with niece (mom didn\u2019t want to go- I asked several times). Niece and will have time to talk. Normally when I see herwe can\u2019t because mom is always there butting in and I or other family members do not get a word in edgewise.\n\nI want to make it clear to niece that she truly has a choice to go where she wants and money is really not an issue.\nI know she is afraid of going against her mom even if it keeps her from following her longtime dream of going to a theater tech college program. \n\nIf she\u2019s happy staying at home living with mom she should do that, but I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what she wants. She will do that If her mom tells her to because she always tries to please her mom. \n\nHer mom has been through three divorces and had a lot of issues and niece has always believed it was never her moms fault for anything bad that occurred even though her mom has made so many big mistakes that affect her kid. One example is her mom pulls her out of hs classes she needs to be in for her own benefit - niece was actually missing assignments and failing one math class (enced up barely passing) as a result. Niece had been living apart from her mom (boarding school) the first two years of hs, was thriving, never missed classes - but then mom got divorced again, got lonely and moved by the school to have her kid live with her. \n\nThere is more but that gives you the general idea. \n\nOther than stressing to niece the fact that I will pay for all her college and she truly has the choice is there anything else I should say to her? I want her to realize it\u2019s her life, her choice, not her mother\u2019s, before she gets older and looks back regretting she did not take advantage of this opportunity to go after these theater school dreams she\u2019s said she\u2019s wanted for several years. Living with mom would let her do some local theater now and then, but not go to a school that specializes in what she really wants.\n\nWhat else should I say if anything aside from that to her? I want her to make an informed decision based on the facts not the bs.",

          "text": "Why not lol?! I never took theater and was an Econ. major but she seems set on either theater management or tech or similar. Is very involved in theater at hs. \n\nAlso she is non-binary but uses any and all all pronouns and I\u2019ve usually called her she out of habit- switching to he or they at times- but theater seems to have a ton of lgbtq students which is also a huge plus for her. If she wanted a different major that would be fine and I expect she will change her mind about majors like many people do in college but who knows.",

                  "text": "I was not allowed to major in theater due to that exact reason. My dad said it was a waste. This was decades ago.\n\nIdk if I\u2019d have pursued it, but I would have thought about it as a minor if I had not been influenced by him saying that. My dad had many issues but that advice was actually good for me because it led to classes and jobs where I learned a lot about financial topics. Dad died penniless, and I now have money I earned and invested well as a result of his advice. But I always had a partial interest in investing and business even in hs. My niece is really bad at math ( has a LD called dyscalculia) and has no interest in Econ or other money topics. She is smart in many other ways including writing.",

After my college was paid for, I worked some overseas, came back, worked, had a lot of financial issues and built from nothing-  really I was in debt a few years, until I built on what I'd learned and worked in business jobs to build a career. I can not say what would have happened if I'd been a theater major. My job does not require a degree but I did learn a lot of communication and business skills from college that I've applied to work and life. \n\nIt is really hard to say for sure.",

I had quite a few jobs after college that i didnt need a degree for , technically,, but I did need some of the skills I learned during my degree. \n\nI double majored in stem and creative writing.  Writing I did for fun.   I would not have been employable in any of the jobs I had after college with those skills only.\n\nGet some numbers.  My ex was in theater and all his friends and like 2 of them had jobs in that field in a way that could even remotely support themselves.  All the others eventually did something else.  \n\nAnd that was a long time ago when the something else\u2019s existed .  Some of those jobs aren\u2019t even a thing anymore.\n\nIf your niece is thinking of a private 4 year school this is a lot of money and if she has no real experience for theater tech she may not even really like it.\n\nAt best she should go local and get some hands on with stuff like that.",
