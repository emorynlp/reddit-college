  "text": "I used to have scholarships and enjoyed learning but I\u2019m now in my junior year and it\u2019s my first time failing two classes. It\u2019s mainly my fault because I either wait until the last minute turn anything in or I don\u2019t turn anything in at all. My advisor thinks I should change my major bc of what my grades reflect but I want to keep it as such. Maybe it\u2019s because my classes are online, so I didn\u2019t treat it was mandatory and now I\u2019m facing the consequences. Is there anyone else having this problem?",
