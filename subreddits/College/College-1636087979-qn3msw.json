          "text": "Well, I am also failing three classes, and I don't think I can do anything to bring my grades up, and my school policy only allows you to withdraw one class or withdraw the whole semester, which is technically all of my classes. I am doing well in the other three classes, but I don't think I can continue doing my assignments. I am feeling extremely depressed, and I started going to the Counseling and Psychological Services to therapy to help to stop these thoughts of having suicidal thoughts.",
