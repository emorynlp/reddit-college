It's always been my plan to go straight to college afterward, but in a recent conversation with friends it came up that the main chunk of my friend group is seriously considering taking a gap year... Thoughts?\n\nI think the pros, for me, would be:\n\n\\- I'm enrolled in a head start program, so I'm taking classes at the local CC. As of right now, I'm on track to graduate high school with my AA degree. So when I graduate high school, I'll be 2 years ahead to begin with, so there's not really a rush to go to college.\n\n\\-My partner (16nb) is a grade younger than me, so taking a gap year would mean we could avoid the dreaded high school-college long distance.\n\n\\-I would have more time to save money, because college is not cheap. Bonus- I have a job that I really love.\n\n\\-It would be so hard to be the only one of my friends to leave. The college my best friend was going to go to was 20min from the school I would be at, but if she stays and I go we'll be several hours apart. I just feel like I'd be lonely and left out.\n\n\\-I'm not very worried about losing motivation to go to school after the year. I've had the college I want picked out since I was 15, and the job since I was 13. I've also always been pretty academically motivated.\n\nI think maybe I could take a couple elective classes at the CC over the year that I'm staying, that way I don't completely fall out of practice with being in school. And then I could spend a year taking classes I'm really interested in before I go off to study in college. And with a gap year I wouldn't have to be the only one of my friends leaving.\n\nBut the whole 'one gap year turns to two turns to never going to school' narrative freaks me out a little bit. Any insight would be appreciated.

But I think the stories about gap years going on forever come from people who aren\u2019t motivated and go into their gap year without a plan\n\nI think taking a gap year and doing nothing that whole year is generally a bad idea. But if you have a job you enjoy and will be taking CC classes, I think you\u2019ll be spending your time pretty well.\n\nIMO, the most important thing is whether you truly want to take a gap year *for yourself* or for your friends and partner. It sounds like you only seriously started considering it after your friends all told you they were taking gap years. Staying close to friends/partners should not be the biggest reason why you take a gap year\u2014it has to be a decision you make for yourself\n\nIf your friends/partner were all going to college immediately after high school, would you still be so keen to take a gap year? If so, then I would go ahead. If not, then don\u2019t take the gap year\n\nIs it possible for you to simply defer your start by one semester instead of a whole year? If you\u2019re really on the fence, I would just do that. That way you can re-evaluate how things are going after a few months (if you want to wait more, you could just extend it to a full gap year, otherwise you could start classes in the winter)", "author": "SkunkStriped", "created": 1632878980, "upvotes": 3}}}
