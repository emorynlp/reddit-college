  "title:": "Should I take a gap year or are they are hard to bounce back from as everyone says they are?",
  "text": "I'm (17) currently in my last year of high school. It's always been my plan to go straight to college afterward, but in a recent conversation with friends it came up that the main chunk of my friend group is seriously considering taking a gap year... Thoughts?\n\nI think the pros, for me, would be:\n\n\\- I'm enrolled in a head start program, so I'm taking classes at the local CC. As of right now, I'm on track to graduate high school with my AA degree. So when I graduate high school, I'll be 2 years ahead to begin with, so there's not really a rush to go to college.\n\n\\-My partner (16nb) is a grade younger than me, so taking a gap year would mean we could avoid the dreaded high school-college long distance.\n\n\\-I would have more time to save money, because college is not cheap. Bonus- I have a job that I really love.\n\n\\-It would be so hard to be the only one of my friends to leave. The college my best friend was going to go to was 20min from the school I would be at, but if she stays and I go we'll be several hours apart. I just feel like I'd be lonely and left out.\n\n\\-I'm not very worried about losing motivation to go to school after the year. I've had the college I want picked out since I was 15, and the job since I was 13. I've also always been pretty academically motivated.\n\nI think maybe I could take a couple elective classes at the CC over the year that I'm staying, that way I don't completely fall out of practice with being in school. And then I could spend a year taking classes I'm really interested in before I go off to study in college. And with a gap year I wouldn't have to be the only one of my friends leaving.\n\nBut the whole 'one gap year turns to two turns to never going to school' narrative freaks me out a little bit. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019m only a freshman and I have no real experience with advising college students, so take my advice with a huge grain of salt. But I think the stories about gap years going on forever come from people who aren\u2019t motivated and go into their gap year without a plan\n\nI think taking a gap year and doing nothing that whole year is generally a bad idea. But if you have a job you enjoy and will be taking CC classes, I think you\u2019ll be spending your time pretty well.\n\nIMO, the most important thing is whether you truly want to take a gap year *for yourself* or for your friends and partner. It sounds like you only seriously started considering it after your friends all told you they were taking gap years. Staying close to friends/partners should not be the biggest reason why you take a gap year\u2014it has to be a decision you make for yourself\n\nIf your friends/partner were all going to college immediately after high school, would you still be so keen to take a gap year? If so, then I would go ahead. If not, then don\u2019t take the gap year\n\nIs it possible for you to simply defer your start by one semester instead of a whole year? If you\u2019re really on the fence, I would just do that. That way you can re-evaluate how things are going after a few months (if you want to wait more, you could just extend it to a full gap year, otherwise you could start classes in the winter)",

      "text": "I think your true main reason for staying is to be with your friends. I don\u2019t think you should. Your friends will always be there. In addition, your electives may not keep your brain as sharp since you probably only need a few for the whole entire year. You will certainly make new friends and that doesn\u2019t mean you have to say goodbye to your old ones. Also, your boyfriend and you will work if it\u2019s meant to. Distance is hard but sometimes distance is inevitable or necessary to build a stronger relationship.\n\nI graduated 12th in my class, with college credits all the way through Calc 3, and I ended up taking a 4 year gap after my freshman year. I tried to go back 2 years ago but even when your history shows you know what you want and you\u2019re motivated, life happens. Once you start paying for things, bills and fun things, it\u2019s a lifestyle.\n\nI would instead, ask your advisor at your prospective college about online classes. That way you can be productive towards your goals, be comfortable by staying near friends and family, and yet still having the opportunity to easily transition to in person university.",

I appreciate the offer for more information but I'm not comfortable private messaging people on such a big site, especially being under 18.
