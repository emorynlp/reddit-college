  "text": "I\u2019m talking about any computers/laptops, and such. I\u2019m asking this as I want to get a laptop soon but I don\u2019t think I can find one to do game development on. If there is a laptop that can do game development and graphic design, please tell me. Also it would be very helpful if you are from a California college as-well, as that\u2019s what I\u2019m applying to (CSUs, UCs, Privates).",
