  "text": "Hi \nI live in England, and due to having to retake some exams I\u2019ve been put back a few years \nAnyways I turn 19 in may and that\u2019s when funding for subjects stops \nYou can get funds from school etc but only if you are low income (which I am I live with my single mum who is disabled and unable to work), I also haven\u2019t been able to get a full time job to help save up to fund it, only been able to get a Saturday job which is barely minimum wage which wouldn\u2019t even cover half of  it \n\nWhat do I do if I get refused it ? How do I fund it as without it I wouldn\u2019t have a good future (need a levels to go to uni) \n\nMany thanks \nEmily",
