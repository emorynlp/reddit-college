My parents make all this money, buy all these expansive things, but yet decided not to put any money down for college. My parents told me that they\u2019re not going to help. That I have to pay for my own tuition. Yet, they can afford it, but refuse to. And I just want to know...why. Why don\u2019t they want to help their children? My brother had to drop out of college because he couldn\u2019t afford it (even with getting loans) and now he\u2019s working two jobs trying to pay off his debt, provide for himself, and save up for college. And when I see him he just looks so sad. My sister is the same. Lost when it comes to college and all 3 of us are just tying to figure it out. My mom told me \u201cWhen you leave you\u2019re not going to make it. And you\u2019re not going to succeed in school either\u201d. And it hurt. And being in your early 20s has to be so confusing.

I've had multiple teachers ask me why I'm going to the air force before college and it's like.... because I need money for college in the first place, lol. The air force/other branches offer the Montgomery GI Bill to veterans; it basically pays for your entire (or most of your) college tuition, and I believe it can also include housing and book costs. I know that joining the air force or any other branch may not be for everyone, but it might be good to look into it?

Got pregnant the first time because the father didnt wear a condom or the mother didnt take pills? Still doesnt explain the 2nd and 3rd child. The moment you have children, you no longer live just for yourself. You begin to prepare everything to pass the torch onto them. Even if the parents were aware of their bad parenting that led to the children becoming spoiled and taking everything for granted, putting them in debt doesnt solve anything. Suddenly forcing them to live a destitute live does nothing. Either they're sick in the head or not your parents.\nMy father scraped every bit of money he could after the divorce after coming to the states. What little money he made while attending community college to learn english and get a degree, was all sent as child support. He ate from homeless shelters at either a low cost or for free so he could send as much as he could to help. That's what a real parent would do. Unlike my mother, who never spent any of that child support on me, let me walk around in tattered clothes, buying top ramen and Vienna sausages for food while eating pizza or other sorts of fast food. No school supplies, no kind of toys or investments in hobbies. Instead, leasing 3 bedroom houses for a single mother and child, unable to finance correctly and gambling the rest away at a sick attempt to bring back her days as a child. Addiction to multiple things, never on time, never fulfilling promises. Hell she even took a knife to her son a couple of times. She was sick, very sick. So yeah, either there is something fundamentally wrong with your parents or they're just not your parents. Any sane parent would go to great lengths for their child(ren). What's messed up is that they might be like this because their parents treated them the same way..\nBut, fuck em. I wont say to hate them. It gets you nowhere, I know. But stop thinking about them and focus on your own life. Some big goals and many small goals that will help you achieve the big one. You're lucky, you have siblings, stick together. Rely on each other. For school, community college. Universities are overrated. You can transfer later after doing well and securing a scholarship or three. Schools that have a high tuition, you're not paying for the education, you pay for their connections. Right now, you just have to focus on standing on your own two feet and stabilizing. If you want to access a network, that can come after you get your basic needs in order. Also, take breaks. I get it that you want to get out of the situation as soon as possible but sometimes, being too hasty results in defeat. If school is overwhelming you, take a breather. Take a semester off and find a part time job (or full time, only bite off what you can chew). That way you can give it your best and get good grades, gpa, scholarships. What's your dream? Is it feasible? Do you yourself truly want it? Does it make you happy? Dont be rigid, be fluid. What you want right now might not be what you want 3 years from now. Be open minded and take every opportunity that you come across. Also, search for these opportunities in addition to the ones that present themselves to you. You will never truly know until you try for yourself. Like reading a book or trying a dish.  One man's trash may be another man's treasure. USE COMMON SENSE, for most things. Most things are what they seem. But do trust your instincts as well. Your body is set so self preservation. When your gut tells you something is wrong, it's because it is. Unless you're just an untrusting, paranoid, looney who has some kind of trauma and is constantly restless. Then I would seek help before anything else. Also, speaking of help, last but not least! Dont be afraid to ask for help. The worst anyone can say is no. Humans, we aren't perfect. There are many things that most of us cannot do on our own. We all have our own situations and circumstances. And by helping one another and making those connections, life will become easier. It's the little things in life you should enjoy.", "author": "MasterGilgamesh", "created": 1590346617, "upvotes": 1}, "frovc0s": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gpkgii/cant_afford_college/frovc0s/", "text": "Hi!

The first thing I would suggest you do is contact the financial aid department at your school of choice. \n\n1. Check your local community college/trade school and the university for what credits transfer. My community college is only $1500 per semester, full time.  Nearly all of the college level courses transfer. For pre-nursing, the only class that I have to take at the university is Spanish. If you can live with your parents and work part time, $1500 a semester is doable.\n\n2. Look into other scholarship options.

I saw and still see many students in similar situations to yours. Parents like yours mostly infuriate me. They have enough money to assist their children but just refuse to do so. Why have kids if you aren't going to support the kids right through college or trade school?\n\nThere are numerous ways to pay for college - paying for it yourself with cash on hand, financial grants or aid from colleges, federal and state grants, federal student loans, private student loans, scholarships, tuition reimbursement, participation in ROTC and the GI Bill. Let's go through these so you completely understand your options.\n\n**Paying for it yourself** - This is probably the most difficult option in today's climate. If this is the route you take, then start at community college. Community colleges are less expensive. You can take \"the basics\" there along with learning a trade or skill. I encourage you to visit your local community college to see what your options are there. \n\nAfter you have taken 60 credits, you can transfer to a state school. 60 credits is usually the maximum a university or college will accept so don't take more than will be accepted in transfer. Also many community colleges now have academic advisors to help students plan their schedules to prepare for transfer to university. Shoot for the best state school in your state. If you can't leave your city, then go the state school closest to your home. \n\nAlso, if this is the route you take, plan to take 2 - 3 classes a semester and go year round. You will need to work close to full-time to cover all of your expenses. It will be difficult to attend school full-time and work full-time. 3 classes a semester is better than 2 classes a semester for making progress to your goal but doesn't overwhelm you so that you feel you need to drop out. Going year round also gets you closer to your goal. In addition to traditional semesters, many community colleges have \"mini-mesters\" during the gaps between semesters. \n\nOnce you've finished at community college, do the same at the college or university you attend, go year round, take 3 classes a semester, take advantage of any unusual scheduling options available. Just keep plugging on and you will get your degree.\n\n**Financial Aid or grants from colleges** - This is usually known as institutional aid. It is almost always reserved for students with financial need based on the FAFSA. At this time, it does not sound like you would qualify for this based on your parents income. Once you turn 24, you can apply for aid based on your own income and this category may open up for you. \n\nThere are other ways to qualify as an independent student. You can google them. Those that are feasible for you all require huge life changes that I would not recommend for a college student such as getting married and having a child.\n\n**Financial Aid or grants from federal or state sources** - Federal grants are all based on financial need and would not be available to you in your current circumstances. However, some states do have grants for students that are based on merit and not need. Without knowing your state, I can't tell you about any specifics for you. You will need to do some research to see if there are any in your state.\n\n**Federal Student Loans** - Federal student loans are available to ALL students in the United States regardless of financial need. Even if your parents will not pay for any of your college education, you can still qualify for federal student loans. I know student loans are not popular but if you only take out federal loans to the maximum allowed, it is still less than $30,000 over four years. This is a monthly payment of somewhat less than $300 a month. Where students get into trouble is when they agree to pay back their parents' ParentPlus Loans or when students take out private loans as well as their federal loans. Then the loan burden gets too high. \n\nIf you do take out federal loans, don't do it for community college, if you can help it. Save your federal loans for university. This will keep down your loan burden and, I believe, you still qualify for four years of loans even if you have some credits already. You would need to speak with a financial aid officer at your school to better understand this. \n\n**Private Student Loans** - Don't, just don't. There may be some truly unusual circumstances where someone needs a private student loan but they are few and far between. Avoid these at all costs. Most loan horror stories involve private student loans.\n\n**Scholarships** - They are out there but can be hard to find and harder to get. Start looking for smaller local scholarships. Many community organizations give scholarship. Try local Chambers of Commerce, service organizations like the Elks Club or Kiwanas or American Legion. Churches, synagogues, and other religious organizations sometimes have scholarships. This is where asking your high school counselor can be helpful. Community colleges also should have a good sense of local scholarships. You just have to keep looking.\n\n**Tuition Reimbursement** - There are companies out there that reimburse their employees for college classes. I know UPS is such a company. There is at least one major grocery store chain in my state that also offers tuition reimbursement.\n\nBut the employer most likely to offer tuition reimbursement is, no surprise, a college. Colleges have many different kinds of jobs, many of which require no more than a high school diploma. Start now to apply to all of the colleges, both community colleges and four-year colleges, in your area for administrative positions, clerk positions, janitorial positions, grounds crew, whatever you think you might be able to do. Colleges don't always pay as well as other employers but they do provide decent benefits. At the college where I worked, there were numerous people who got their bachelor's degree from our school and then went on to get master's degrees paid for by the school. \n\n**ROTC participation** - this route does not necessarily pay for all of your tuition. If you went this route, you would need to investigate exactly what the program would provide you. However, ROTC programs have advisors devoted specifically to their students to help them navigate both the academic and financial aspects of college. Obviously, only go this route if you have an interest in military service after college.\n\n**Military Service and the GI Bill** - and that leaves us with going into the Armed Forces then using the GI Bill to pay for college when you leave the service. When I worked at the college level, many of my former students were former military. Their tuition was paid along with receiving a monthly stipend to pay for living expenses and other costs related to school. Military students were also considered as independent students so they could also apply for financial aid on their own income, if needed.\n\nMany of my current high school students are considering this option since even with the extensive financial aid many of them could receive (I work primarily low-income students), they just feel it is a better option so they can begin to make money to help their families while also getting the benefit of the GI Bill after they leave service.\n\nSome of the services also offer extensive educational options. The Air Force has their own community college system. The Navy will provide extensive training for some of their jobs with some of the credits for that training transferring after  leaving the service. I don't know about the other services. You would have to do the research. Again, only pursue the military option if that is something you can truly see yourself doing for at least four years.\n\nI hope you find this helpful. I believe strongly in the power of education to transform lives. Unfortunately, our current system can make that difficult for many people.

If you play your cards right, You can get a job at a restaurant or something to make money. One of my friends goes to a community college right by my house. Classes are about $500 each and they are wicked flexible when it comes to schedules. You can take night classes, weekend classes, morning classes. Whatever you need to fit your schedule they have.\n\nThe reason my friend is doing community college is because the university that I go to and the community college she goes to has an agreement/partnership together. She can go to the community college for 3 years, transfer to the university for year 4 and graduate with a diploma from the university, not the community college. \n\nOther simple things like not buying lunch from a restaurant or whatever can also help. A pound of lunch/deli meat from the store and a loaf of bread is $10-15 and that can feed you for about a week. A single meal alone at a restaurant could be $10-15. \n\nAnother fantastic way to cut costs is by commuting to school. I dont know where you go to school, how far away you live, or if you're staying on campus, but commuting can save a ton of money. The parking pass at my university (most of the students commute) is about $200. If I fill up my gas tank sunday night for $40 (gas prices were a bit higher lol), I can go to school 4 days a week plus work about 2 times on the weekends on a single tank of gas. Even though the price of gas adds up, it's still cheaper than the room and board costs at my school which is about $10k a year.\n\nYou can figure this out. Just keep applying to scholarship wherever and however you can. There are some really dumb scholarships out there. I'm sure one exists where you have to make a meme to get it. I've seen a zombie survival scholarship where you have to write a paper on the apocalypse and it was like a $5000 scholarship if you were chosen. \n\nYou can do it.
