  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore nursing major and I know nursing is a difficult major and all and I\u2019m trying the best I can in my difficult prerequisite classes such as Organic Chemistry, but I can\u2019t seem to get my dad to understand. He thinks I\u2019m not motivated enough in school and thinks I prioritize other things and says that I should be studying ALL day and earn a 4.0 which I\u2019m pretty sure is unrealistic for me. I understand he\u2019s trying to push me to stay motivated but it\u2019s lowkey overwhelming me. My mom on the other hand understands that I\u2019m trying the best I can in Chemistry and if I don\u2019t do good this semester I will retake it next semester. How can I get my dad to understand that I\u2019m trying and showing improvement and that sometimes I just feel depressed and unmotivated with school?",

If you are paying your own way, thank him for his concern, but tell him, you\u2019ve got it covered. \n\nSchools have a lot of support services that students don\u2019t always know about or use. Your school probably has a learning center that you could utilize to help you study better. They also have free tutoring services. If you haven\u2019t been, you should take advantage of some of these resources. Then you could tell your dad you are doing everything you can to be successful.",
