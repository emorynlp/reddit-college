I had to write some essay for my freshman seminar class which I spent a couple hours on and I was positive I would get a good great but I did not. I failed because I only wrote about 50% of what I was supposed to which is exactly what I was trying to avoid. \nI read the directions like ten times and I still missed what I was supposed to do. Anyways, I\u2019m beating myself up right now because I put a lot of effort into this assignment only to get a 4/10 and I have no one to blame but myself.\n\nI didn\u2019t think a freshman seminar class would be so hard but it\u2019s only a semester so I\u2019m gonna try my best to power through it.", "author": "Mirror_Opposite", "created": 1632186161, "retrieved": 1632800984, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hdqcqrv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps82yv/just_failed_another_college_assignment/hdqcqrv/", "text": "Attend office hours and ask your professor what you can do to improve in the class.

Writing is my strong suit and I've always been able to manage As without much difficulty. However, this professor seems to despise every paper I produce. She had 2 for each course that make up a large percentage of the grade, and the rest consists of smaller writing assignments. I've always gotten As on the smaller ones, but I just cannot seem to win with her on these main papers. It's definitely a check to the ego, and maybe that's the point. Or maybe she genuinely cannot stand me beyond 500 words. You're always going to have that one assignment you would have bet your life you nailed, only to find out your professor is obviously drunk. If I let this one get in my head, it would ruin my work for all my other classes.", "author": "Mammoth-Title-2102", "created": 1632204480, "upvotes": 2}, "hdof6pi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps82yv/just_failed_another_college_assignment/hdof6pi/", "text": "Don't feel bad, I've failed my fair share of assignments. And believe me, it was a blow to my self-esteem. Hell, I was placed on academic probation because my grades dropped. But my advice is to try to expound on what you are writing. Even when you can't think of anything to put down think of something. What I generally do is I'll look at how many pages I need and my topic.\n\nSo if I need two pages I'll start typing as much as I can (single-spaced), with each paragraph building off the last. I'll try my hardest to get as much detail as I can into the paper. And once I reach the bottom of page one I'm done. I'll highlight everything and double-space it, boom two pages are done. I'll then run it through Grammarly to check for errors and make sure everything flows right. I'll reread and make sure it doesn't sound weird and then ill submit.", "author": "LowDownnDirty", "created": 1632195600, "upvotes": 2}, "hdo7bkr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps82yv/just_failed_another_college_assignment/hdo7bkr/", "text": "I know the first few times failing are rough, especially if you\u2019re used to getting A\u2019s and doing well. Trust me, the sting of getting a poor grade lessens as you continue your college experience. Don\u2019t let it ruin your day or week, just learn from what you missed and move forward.
