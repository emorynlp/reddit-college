  "text": "It was just the awkwardest thing this morning. The professor was going over answers to an assignment and asked the class a question. We were all confused on the question so nobody volunteered to answer for the first few seconds, but somebody finally guessed.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what was so funny, but the professor just started laughing. Like, full-on laughing as loudly as he could. It made no sense because the answer was just a number, and the correct one at that. We laughed along with him for a few seconds, but it quickly turned to confusion because none of us knew what was going on.\n\nHe continued laughing for about a minute, and then the class continued as normal. I\u2019ve taken classes with the professor for years and I\u2019ve never seen him do that.",

(Embarrassingly, it happened recently when I was trying to ask a question in class but that\u2019s a story for another time) It\u2019s a psychological reaction to stress for me.
