  "text": "I live in a double and the people who live next to my side of the room NEVER turn off their alarm in the morning. It usually goes off around 6:30 or 7 am depending on the day and stays ringing for 30mins to an hour. They\u2019re also in a double so I don\u2019t understand if they BOTH manage to sleep through it or??? I\u2019m a relatively light sleeper and the constant ringing is just enough to keep me awake. I\u2019ve tried leaving notes and even contacted the RA but it usually stops for a few days before starting up again \ud83d\ude43 Why the fuck do I hate to plan my sleep schedule every day around someone else\u2019s alarm? It\u2019s so frustrating and I\u2019m losing my mind lol",
