Through under hand methods he explained how it's an elective and there's only 5 people in the class and basically if I may paraphrase said no one takes it serious and it's just for credit, and I also see how I can blindly click through the quizzes with out studying and get at least a 90% every time.  I dont like your attitude (assuming, derogative.)  Let me guess, you teach?  Or, you're teachers lil pet, hm?  Line leader?  Fuck off if you're not trying to help, I left my bootstraps back in my dorm room.",

The only instructions were, \"1-2 page summary on the topic of \"Minerals.\"  Nothing else.  So, I went to the this chapter's module and was reading about \"park rangers.\"  So, I found an article about 2 people who went to a national park that doesnt get many visitors looking for certain types of rocks and minerals when they were murdered, me being a Forensics major and taking this class out of interest I summarized the article and elaborated about it's applications to park rangers and forensics/detective work/and more.  The only notes the teacher left on my 50% grade was, \"Sad, but irrelevant.\"  I emailed about it since it's a remote course and I have no other way, he refuses to do anything even though I elaborated further in these emails.",

The reference to rocks and minerals seems tangential in this case; you could have probably swapped that out for \u201cpine cones,\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t have really changed the story.",
