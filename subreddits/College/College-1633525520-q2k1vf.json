  "text": "For context:  \nI was discussing some stuff with a professor in her office hours, and she mentioned I was a High Performance Student and that other professors agree with her.  \n\n\nI search on Google what it means, but the only information that appears is how to be one, programs about it, videos, etc.  \n\n\nSo... what does it means to be a High Performance Student?",
