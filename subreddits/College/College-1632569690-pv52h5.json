I've been living in a dorm room for 3 weeks now, but I still couldn't get used to it. I'm always stressed. I just can't transition from living in my own room to living in a different room. I can sleep well, and I have a good relationship with my roommates. I'm just always so anxious to go back to the dorm. I don't like it at all. I don't feel safe.\n\nWhat should I do??", "author": "nerdforeverrrrrr", "created": 1632569690, "retrieved": 1632945999, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he9ll38": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv52h5/i_have_some_troubles_with_getting_used_to_living/he9ll38/", "text": "I\u2019m an RA at my college and I would recommend you talk to your RA, their job is to make sure you feel safe and if you don\u2019t they can help you.", "author": "bossandy", "created": 1632603952, "upvotes": 1}, "he9jpe6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv52h5/i_have_some_troubles_with_getting_used_to_living/he9jpe6/", "text": "I think that you might benefit from adding some decorations, and working towards making the room feel nicer. Maybe move furniture around so that your bed faces the other way or is/isn't pressed up against the wall. It took me a few different furniture placements to find one that I found comfortable. Get extra pillows, posters, and other things that you find cozy and aesthetically pleasing. If that isn't enough you might benefit from one of those privacy pop bed tents or an accordion room divider. Negotiate with your roommates to make it so each of you have time alone in the room, perhaps when they are in class, clubs, or studying in the library. You could also see if either of them is willing to swap beds/sides of the room so you have a corner.", "author": "Katherington", "created": 1632603108, "upvotes": 1}, "he7ks14": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv52h5/i_have_some_troubles_with_getting_used_to_living/he7ks14/", "text": "Take ownership of your space.  If you have a bottom bunk, consider making yourself a little hideout with blankets hung from the top bunk.
