  "text": "I never liked changes. I've been living in a dorm room for 3 weeks now, but I still couldn't get used to it. I'm always stressed. I just can't transition from living in my own room to living in a different room. I can sleep well, and I have a good relationship with my roommates. I'm just always so anxious to go back to the dorm. I don't like it at all. I don't feel safe.\n\nWhat should I do??",

      "text": "I think that you might benefit from adding some decorations, and working towards making the room feel nicer. Maybe move furniture around so that your bed faces the other way or is/isn't pressed up against the wall. It took me a few different furniture placements to find one that I found comfortable. Get extra pillows, posters, and other things that you find cozy and aesthetically pleasing. If that isn't enough you might benefit from one of those privacy pop bed tents or an accordion room divider. Negotiate with your roommates to make it so each of you have time alone in the room, perhaps when they are in class, clubs, or studying in the library. You could also see if either of them is willing to swap beds/sides of the room so you have a corner.",

Even if you get along well with roommates, it is important to have your own space.  \n\nYou could also try putting family photos or personal items up around your desk and walls to make the room feel more homely.",
