  "text": "Just met with my advisor. I\u2019m currently studying food science (emphasis on business) and Food Service Business. I entered college with quite a bit of credit, enough for me to be technically considered a second year. Career wise, i just want to be a chef and eventually an owner. I chose Food Science because I\u2019m particularly good at math and science, and the foodservice world is notoriously hard and unforgiving. \n\nI\u2019d like to say too, her claiming I\u2019d have to stay an extra semester is kinda BS, because of summer courses, but I want to get out and work ASAP, so I was hoping for 3 or 3 1/2. I\u2019d like to hit Executive chef by 26 or so. I\u2019m considering dropping the Food Service degree, because it\u2019s kinda just there. A lot of the stuff you learn is focused on corporate stuff, which I am not interested in. Also, with food science, I already have the business accreditation. \n\nI\u2019m just wanting to see what others think. Is that extra degree worth it? Am I rushing to graduate? I just love the restaurant world and food. I feel like Food Science will help me understand cooking more and development process.",

      "text": "If you want that degree for that major no. An extra semester or summer classes aren\u2019t bad for a double major. If it would help you in your career line I see no problem with it. I was a double major and double minor, I had a biochemistry and molecular biology major along with an anthropology major and then a general sociology minor and a global health minor which was in the anthropology department so the three overlapped beautifully but my hard science major did no and there were a lot of labs for it. An extra semester IMO isn\u2019t that big of a deal to have degrees in both subjects.",

      "text": ">her claiming I\u2019d have to stay an extra semester is kinda BS, because of summer courses,\n\nare your school's upper level food science and food service courses taught over the summer? because if not, it's unlikely that taking your general studies courses in the summer is actually going to help you finish any sooner. The critical path is usually through the prereqs in your major, and sometimes those are fall only or spring only or at smaller schools might even be offered just once every other year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>but I want to get out and work ASAP\n\na lot of students work over the summer, which is why summer courses isn't always the default advising recommendation.",

      "text": "Out of curiosity if you\u2019re looking to be an executive chef and own restaurants, why are you seeking a 4 year degree? \n\nThe best training is working on a restaurant or culinary school. My dad has been a chef his whole life and own his own restaurants before retiring. \n\nHe has an 8th grade education and focused on cooking and training at a young age. Not being in the field now is probably hurting you. Make a list of the best restaurants in the area and try to network with their head chefs. Pick their brains and eventually apply for any back of house position you can get.",
