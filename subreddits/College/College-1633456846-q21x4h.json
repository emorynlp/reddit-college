  "text": "Recently I started studying in a private institution. I have always wanted to be a game designer but the college I am going to does not offer that as a major. So, instead I chose digital communications. Is there anyone in this sub who can help me, ie a current DigiComm major? It seems like the major is extremelt broad, I never get clear answers im the internet. Would this major help me get a job in \u200f\u200f\u200e gave design or web design? If not what are good jobs in this field? The major does cover coding and specific design skills so I am not exactly sure where it can lead me",
