      "text": "MIS is the more in-demand degree, and should give you better and higher-paying job options after college.\n\nI work in a minimally technical IT role, and it's a great career field overall. Lots of good jobs, high pay, work from home opportunities, flexible schedules, etc. \n\nA lot of marketing majors go into sales, so if that's not appealing to you, I would be hesitant to major in marketing. There are good jobs in marketing, but you'll likely be competing for those jobs with other marketing majors but also people who majored in business management, communications, advertising, and a variety of liberal arts fields. Marketing jobs require soft skills more so than technical skills, so you don't necessarily need a marketing degree in order to be a strong candidate for an entry-level marketing job.",

              "text": "IT is a very big field where some jobs are very technical and some jobs are minimally technical. \n\nMIS majors typically go into less technical IT jobs, like IT business analyst, IT functional analyst, business intelligence analyst, ERP analyst, IT project manager, or IT trainer. These jobs usually require you to understand technical concepts, like how software is written and maintained, but you wouldn't be tasked with actually writing new software. \n\nYou might instead, for example, be the person tasked with collecting business requirements from the sales team so your company can buy a new software tool for customer relationship management, or you might be the person who manages a project to roll out that new CRM tool to the sales team and make sure everyone is set up with access and trained on how to use it.",

              "text": "If you mean why to the personal preference, because I'm more mathematically minded and prefer data-driven small team work, as opposed to marketing which is more creativity based with open ended work for an audience. If you mean why there's no right answer, because everybody has different preferences for one, but secondly because most jobs stop caring about the specific degree once you have experience, so any business (assuming that's the field you want) degree is fine, internships and research/projects are more important.",
