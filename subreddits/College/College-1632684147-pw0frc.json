There are good jobs in marketing, but you'll likely be competing for those jobs with other marketing majors but also people who majored in business management, communications, advertising, and a variety of liberal arts fields. Marketing jobs require soft skills more so than technical skills, so you don't necessarily need a marketing degree in order to be a strong candidate for an entry-level marketing job.", "author": "clearwaterrev", "created": 1632754706, "upvotes": 1}, "hef114e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw0frc/business_majors_information_technology_management/hef114e/", "text": "I would pick Info Tech but that's just personal preference.
