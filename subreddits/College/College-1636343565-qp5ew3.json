  "text": "I just finished working a seasonal job that helped pay for a lot of my expenses in college, but now that the job is finished I am in need of something else. I have to work part-time because of school, but I'm also trying to find something that isn't necessarily just a dead-end job. Obviously, job opportunities differ depending on location and schedule, but does anyone have any ideas of a job that is manageable during school yet pays somewhat well? Hoping to find something other than just a telemarketing position too.... maybe that's too much to ask though.....",

      "text": ">a job that is manageable during school yet pays somewhat well?\n\nDepends on what your definition of paying well means. Plenty of fast food joints paying 20 bucks an hour and they are desperate for people.\n\n>I have to work part-time because of school, but I'm also trying to find something that isn't necessarily just a dead-end job. \n\nThis part confuses me, does it matter? You're in school pursuing a degree for a certain job and since you need a job then does it matter what it is? Find a job that caters to your school and pay needs, the opportunities shouldn't matter since you'll be leaving the job anyways once you start doing internships. It's a temporary part time gig so I'd go with the highest paying if that's your desire, or go with a job that's more flexible with scheduling or allows you to do school work during slow times. Part time job that pays well and doesn't require qualifications doesn't exists.",

      "text": "Most part time jobs are fairly dead end. Sorry.\n\nWhat's your degree in, aim in that area first. Ask around, try to get internships, try to get networking started and find something close.\n\nIf you can't, think what other good skills you'll be able to spin from other jobs. \n\nYou going to be an CPA? Congrats, working in an insurance call center is proof you both have wonderful customer service and experience with legal requirements, privacy acts, and working with numbers. \n\nYou are going to be a Network Admin? Your bakery job is proof you can work shift work (at 4 am! Impressive) and balance time sensitive projects. \n\nYou want to be a nurse? Your job as at a summer camp is proof you can work long hours on your feet, take care of kids medication requirements, keep up with licensing and courses, have your CPR cert, can work in a fast paced chaotic environment.\n\nHonestly, if you can't get a job that's related get a job you like for one reason or another. I knew people who liked working the movie theater cause it was late. One dude who worked at a paper making plant listening to podcasts all day. Many who worked food jobs for free meals. Find something good about it and just, talk it up.",
