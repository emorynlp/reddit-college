  "text": "Does any else feel like they don't have enough time to do the work for all their classes in a reasonable time? I'm taking 6 classes at the moment and one of them is an online math class that assigns tons of homework. I'm usually at my school from 6am to 6pm because I work there and then from 6pm to 10pm I'm usually feeding and putting my son to bed. From 10pm till 2 or 3 am I'm working on my chem homework or lab reports and major papers that feel like they get assigned every week.\n\n By the time I get what I feel to be the important work done I still have Math homework but if I work on it I will not get any sleep. The math homework is assigned and \"due\" every 3 days but it still allows you to do it after the due date so I have been getting what I can done on the weekends but I know this will not be a reasonable strategy in future classes where the due dates are solid. Any tips or is this just what college is like?",

      "text": "Bad schedule. \n\nColleges have a recommendation of 5 classes per semesters \\*max\\* and that is usually aimed towards the young teenage freshman coming in with no other schedule or responsibilities. You have a job AND a child AND I am assuming your own home to take care of. That is way too much. Have you ever seen an advisor at your school? If you were honest with them, they should have given you a more realistic recommendation and not approved so many classes. Are you even learning and retaining anything at this point? Not being able to retain what you are learning now could bite you in the ass for later classes. \n\nUsually older students with lives outside the classroom are recommended 4 classes per semester at most, if not only 2 or 3. \n\nAnd as for homework load, yes that is normal. Expect homework worth extra hours of work at home after every single class.",

This means if you're taking 12 credits, you can expect up to 36 hours of work per week outside of classes. This is in addition to any extra studying you feel you need to do to stay on track to get the grades you want.\n\nEdit: wow! Thanks for the upvotes :). Some people in the comments have pointed out that classes and workload depend heavily on majors. For reference, I'm a premed biology major with chem and history minors, plus I'm in two music ensembles. I'd say I get around 2 or 3 hours per credit per week for my stem classes and about 1 or 2 for my non stem core classes (rhetoric, philosophy, etc.).",

Then I had two homeworks, which each took at least 4. Last week the pre-lab took about 15 hours, for sure, with similar hw times. That's not including class times + studying, etc. And this isn't a separate lab class either, this is bundled into the same 4 credits.\n\nThis class is known for being absolutely awful, but funnily enough, we've already reached hw 7/12 at this point in the semester, so I guess the prof just can't pace a class to save his life.",

You have to both prove you theoretically know how to make the thing, and then you have to wire it up for real, documenting each stage of the process heavily. It's an electrical engineering based class, but not just electrical engineers have to take it.\n\nI couldn't explain how they take 10-15 hours, I just know usually they take me literally all my free time one day and most of it another, if I have to do it last minute.\n\nI should mention that labs are actually just where you take a 2 hour quiz roughly based off the material from the pre-lab, and you submit the pre-lab for grading. So it's not a traditional pre-lab, more like a really long project you have every week.",

If you have rigorous classes, or you need to spend more time on the material, and you spend the 3 hours per credit hour, you are putting in 36 hours of work OUTSIDE of class. Which is comparable to a full time job.\n\nI'm also in STEM. Some of my classes push me closer to the 3 hour mark in how much work I have to put in. Some are closer to the 1 hour mark. It really just depends on the class and how successful you are at learning the material. Hence why schools give that 1-3 hour timeframe.\n\nAlso, 18 credit hours is fairly high. At my community college & my university require an advisor sign off to enroll in over 16 credit hours. Though I realize every school & major program is different.",

Glad to know most places it varies between 1 and 3, that honestly makes sense with the school I'm currently at.  I feel like most weeks it's close to 1 hour per credit hour and it's much more manageable with a job for me.  I can actually do some hobbies.",
