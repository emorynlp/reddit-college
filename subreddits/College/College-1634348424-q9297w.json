  "text": "I am a 23 year-old transfer student from a community college at my home who transferred six hours away and I fucking hate my life. I transferred here in January 2020 and have lost my college experience due to COVID-19 and deferred to stay home during the distant learning phase of school. I am here for the first time since 2020 and I am absolutely miserable I have absolutely no friends and I am missing events and trips with my friends and family back home and it\u2019s making me feel like shit. You will not make friends if you\u2019re a transfer student if you do it\u2019s rare you will not relate to any of these kids so stay local.",

I moved 16 hours away from home when I was 18 & I\u2019m 20 now as a transfer student & I don\u2019t mind it. You can create a whole other version of yourself just by going through experiences like moving away from home. I like to see it as an opportunity to better myself by \u201cstarting over.\u201d",

      "text": "You have a shit attitude, friends at home don\u2019t count, you\u2019re not at home, putting it on being a girl easier is a cop out that\u2019s not true whatsoever, it\u2019s the same for any of us transfer students no matter who you are.  \n\nI\u2019m a transfer students and it was the best decision I ever made, making friends in college is not easy, you\u2019re starting completely over and during a time when trying to maintain anything social is a chore. I did it all during COVID as well, I went to one university, transferred, had a semester got sent home for covid, and the next time I went to in person class I was a senior, and I still made a great group of friends and have exactly the college experience I want. We\u2019re the house on the block that throws block parties for frats every football game, and I get great grades and work my ass off in school and run track and participate in clubs and do everything I need to do to be successful and to have fun. The reason why is because I didn\u2019t have a garbage attitude about moving away from home and treated making friends and having fun like a job, because that\u2019s what it is. I went more than out of my way to make sure I made friends, I never shut up and talk to any one and everyone about anything, I made it a goal of mine to eat breakfast at the dining hall with a new person who I\u2019d never seen before at least once a week. I joined clubs and would ask people to come get lunch or dinner after meetings every day we were there and that\u2019s how to make friends. Friends and fun do not come to you, you need to make yourself opportunities to have fun if that\u2019s what you want. \n\nThe reason I transferred in the first place was because I could not make friends, i did not fit in at the school I was at with anyone I met and I knew that I did not have any future opportunity there to have the life that I wanted, so I needed to make the change, not just wait around for it to happen. If I transferred and never put in the work I did to have a social life then there would have been no point, what would have been to point from moving away from a school because I couldn\u2019t make friends to another school where I wouldn\u2019t make friends cause I sat around and waited for them to magically appear.\n\nPeople don\u2019t just magically get chosen to have \u201cthe college experience\u201d they always have one thing in common, they choose to do something that puts them in a constant social environment, Greek life, a club, a sport, literally anything where they\u2019re put in the same room with the same people more than once a week outside of class time. \n\nForget about your friends and family back home, they do not care, you are where you are and they are not there with you, so do something, it is never too late to make friends, join a club that\u2019s probably the best thing you can do, particularly some sort of athletics or activity club that has some sort of team element to it, if you don\u2019t do something about it then you shouldn\u2019t cry about it. Not having a good experience is your fault and no one else\u2019s, if you want to sit there and feel bad for yourself like so many other students do because they hesitate or are too picky about what they\u2019re going to do to try and have fun, transfer or not, feel free, no one\u2019s stopping you, but the solution is right there.",

I have walked into places alone, completely alone, doing my thing, and I have met people. That has been my experience. I\u2019m not saying you will have the exact same experience. But if you don\u2019t walk into a bar while being alone, how can you telI that you won\u2019t meet anyone? Maybe it won\u2019t happen the first or second time, maybe it won\u2019t happen at a bar, maybe you decide to go somewhere else and you meet cool people there. The key is in how presentable you look and how much of a positive, cool, honest and kind attitude one presents. I don\u2019t want to insult you, but, your attitude (maybe whole personality/outlook on life) really isn\u2019t the greatest, of course, there is not a one-single-correct attitude, but yours isn\u2019t really helping you. If you think you are a looser for being unable to have a good time by yourself, then you are a complete looser, not because you don\u2019t have anyone to go to a bar with, no, you are a looser because of your attitude. Maybe learn how to have a good time while alone at a bar. Maybe, if you have a good time by yourself, other people will notice and join you. Or maybe not, but probably yes, some drunk pole are really friendly and polite and just cool and fun. Again, I\u2019m not trying to offend you, I\u2019m simply trying to convey an idea. I hope you well, I really, really hope you resolve your feelings, because feeling like shit, not matter for what reason, isn\u2019t nice. If you feel sad, mad, depressed, or unmotivated, I hope that those feelings go away. That way you can be happy. If you try to be happy and nothing seems to work, maybe move back home and finish your major there. \n:)",

Did you check if a class was transferable before you took it? Did you check all of your classes before you enrolled? Community colleges don\u2019t just decide to screw someone over. There is a system. Granted, I don\u2019t know what state you are in, and I don\u2019t know the full story, but saying \u201cmy community college screwed me over\u201d isn\u2019t believable. I have been reading your responses, you blame everything on other people, they are the shit people, they have the \u201cgarbage\u201d clubs, they don\u2019t talk. My fellow human, maybe you are the problem, maybe not entirely, but maybe you are looking at things the wrong way. How can you make friends if you call everyone shit? They probably don\u2019t want to be your friends because you are the crappy one. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not trying to be mean, but your comments say all. Maybe try to be more open minded and look at things differently. If you classify the people back home as the only ones that can be your friends, and if you deem the people at you current college as \u201cshit\u201d, as unworthy of your friendship, of course you won\u2019t make friends. You have already decided not to make new friends because you already have friends, that\u2019s how your thought is coded. Have you met every single person at your current college? Different majors? Different years? If you haven\u2019t met every single person at your college, you have not right to say that everyone is shit. \nI\u2019m not saying that you have to try to meet every single person at your college, no. I\u2019m conveying the idea that there are more people at your college, that you haven\u2019t met everyone, and that people are different, not everyone is the exact same \u201cshit\u201d person.",

I came here in 2020 looking to make new friends because my last two friend groups were absolutely shit and Covid hit so I went home I met a brand new friend group Who genuinely care about me and go out of their way to do nude siding things we are considered family at this point and I\u2019ve only known them for a year and a half and I love them I miss them My attitude stems from that I was kind of forced to come back here because everything is in person and I didn\u2019t wanna come back. My apartment complex kind of fucked me by putting me with three other dudes that I got to know and then moving me at the last second my new roommate is a total fucking mess who doesn\u2019t clean up after himself he just gets stoned all day and my other roommate is a phantom who doesn\u2019t even talk to us this is a recipe for disaster for a starting semester I tried to branch out I\u2019ve gone to bars and parties with this girl and I just haven\u2019t met anybody a lot of the people here just don\u2019t even wanna make new friends because different rooms are already set in stone and I\u2019m in a depressive state where I miss my friends and family and I just don\u2019t feel like going to clubs because they\u2019re just not my thing I\u2019m supposed to go barhopping today with my girls sorority and a couple of frats but now I woke up with Covid symptoms.

To add difficulty to meeting people, i live off campus 15 miles away so i dont have access to all the people i could be meeting and be making friends out of at the dorms. Luckily the climbing club at my uni is pretty open so i\u2019ve found a nice community there where i\u2019ve made a few friends so far & am still working on building others with people i keep meeting through the club. I know its cliche man but joining clubs really does the difference. Usually in lectures im not one to initiate conversation, sometimes i do but 9/10 time i wont. & when people initiate conversation, i try to hold that conversation until class starts so that next time that person can feel comfortable sitting around me as there\u2019s already some history there & some thing has been established. Idk man every experience is different",
