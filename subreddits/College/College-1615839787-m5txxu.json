  "title:": "COVID made me realize it's fine to not make straight A's and it feels good",
  "text": "In the past I received a lot of pressure from my parents to make A's in everything, even going into my 3rd year of college. Then COVID hit and we all did the online school thing, which dropped my grades just like everyone else. And you know what? B's are fine. Aiming for B's still keeps my scholarship. Grades shouldn't dictate my sense of self-worth anyways, and industry-wise I've realized hiring managers care more about experience in my field than they do straight A's (having gone through the hiring process with a high GPA and not a lot of experience myself multiple times). They want to see projects, past job experiences, and a dedication to sharpen your skills, not someone who spends all their time making A's. It's really opened my eyes lately, especially with college burnout coming at me faster with these digital online semesters. I don't want to expend all my energy just doing school all day everyday to make perfect grades, and it doesn't help me in the long run to do that, so I won't. I'll just study and try to understand the material best I can, and if my effort can only earn me B's at best, so be it. At least I'll know how to do my job and will be involved in clubs and events where I can exercise my skills--not to mention having better mental health.",

Like, just because someone has a lower GPA than me in another school (or hell, another professor of the same college) by no means guarantee that they understand less material.",

These days I'm feeling kind of stuck, cause on one hand I don't want to dedicate all of my time to studying, but on the other I don't see many opportunities to improve in other areas academically, for example gain experience or even some volunteering or clubs (my major is quite unusual, and because of going back to my small hometown amidst COVID there is nothing to take up here connected to it). I want to improve but I don't know how, so these days I'm mostly dedicating my time to studying/improving myself (exercising, reading books etc.) I'm kind of worried that when I finally finish studies, there will be nothing on my cv to stand out to employers. Any advice would be appreciated lol (btw, I'm a student in Poland).",

Memorizing information for a test or exam doesn't mean you've understood the material and can interpret it. It just means you've learned to take it.  \n\n3) **You cannot quantify your strengths**. Grades only cover a set range of abilities and will never give you a good look at your intelligence, skills, and talents. \n\n4) **There are different kinds of intelligence**. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. A person can get straight A's in favorite subjects but achieve unremarkable grades in the rest. \n\n5) **Intelligence is not static.**  According to the Incremental Theory of Intelligence, training and exercise can help develop your intelligence over time. \n\n6) **Your passions matter the most**. A person who has the drive and passion for something is more likely to come out ahead of an unmotivated genius.",
