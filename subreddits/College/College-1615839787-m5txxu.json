Then COVID hit and we all did the online school thing, which dropped my grades just like everyone else. And you know what? B's are fine. Aiming for B's still keeps my scholarship. Grades shouldn't dictate my sense of self-worth anyways, and industry-wise I've realized hiring managers care more about experience in my field than they do straight A's (having gone through the hiring process with a high GPA and not a lot of experience myself multiple times). They want to see projects, past job experiences, and a dedication to sharpen your skills, not someone who spends all their time making A's. It's really opened my eyes lately, especially with college burnout coming at me faster with these digital online semesters. I don't want to expend all my energy just doing school all day everyday to make perfect grades, and it doesn't help me in the long run to do that, so I won't. I'll just study and try to understand the material best I can, and if my effort can only earn me B's at best, so be it. At least I'll know how to do my job and will be involved in clubs and events where I can exercise my skills--not to mention having better mental health.", "author": "K3yB0ard5eizur3", "created": 1615839787, "retrieved": 1632802112, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1099, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gr6dn6o": {"link": "/r/college/comments/m5txxu/covid_made_me_realize_its_fine_to_not_make/gr6dn6o/", "text": "If college was the last step of my educational career, I\u2019d 100% agree with you.

Memorizing information for a test or exam doesn't mean you've understood the material and can interpret it. It just means you've learned to take it.  \n\n3) **You cannot quantify your strengths**. Grades only cover a set range of abilities and will never give you a good look at your intelligence, skills, and talents. \n\n4) **There are different kinds of intelligence**. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. A person can get straight A's in favorite subjects but achieve unremarkable grades in the rest. \n\n5) **Intelligence is not static.**  According to the Incremental Theory of Intelligence, training and exercise can help develop your intelligence over time. \n\n6) **Your passions matter the most**.
