  "text": "I\u2019m a very very nostalgic person to start off with. I always miss the past and have had some important people in my life die recently and it\u2019s been really hard. I\u2019m a freshman who started in the summer semester and I felt homesick then but I feel so much worse now. I didn\u2019t have a roommate over the summer and that was amazing but now I have a roommate from hell and gives me anxiety daily. I\u2019m moving out in December but until then I have to tough it out and I miss home more than anything. I\u2019m an only child and have been really close with my parents always and love being at home more than anything. I have so so many treasured memories to look back on and love being with my parents. They\u2019re also older and I worry I won\u2019t have much time left with them. Idk what to do. I\u2019ve tried making friends in college by talking to random people in class and my dorm and even joined a sorority, but I haven\u2019t found anyone to click with. I also have a bf in college and we\u2019ve been dating for over 2 years so he\u2019s been super supportive but idk what to do! Should I avoid going home? resist the urge? I want to just go home every single weekend I can and spend time with my parents but Ik I shouldn\u2019t. I just feel awful and always down and empty. I don\u2019t want to do anything but lay in bed and cry in my dorm when I\u2019m on campus",

      "text": "It really depends on how far of a drive your home is. My freshman year was also difficult because I had some difficulty with my roommate and I was very homesick. I would say to try to go home as often as you can since you are getting depressed being away from your family but you also have to balance homework and academics with spending time with your loved ones. Whenever you have the time you should definitely go see your family because your mental health is very important.",

          "text": "I\u2019m doing very well in my classes thank God. The drive home is annoyingly far. It\u2019s about 6 hours and my parents don\u2019t like me putting miles on my car so they\u2019d rather spend $150 for a plane ticket. I don\u2019t want to spend too much money on plane tickets tho since $150 can add up but I think I\u2019ll drive home for longer breaks. I also want to make friends but it\u2019s so hard when I\u2019m always feeling down or anxious and it\u2019s too tempting to just hang out with my bf. His friends are all guys but they\u2019re nice and like it when I hang out tho at least. Idk how to make friends here and I thought my sorority would give me some friends but I don\u2019t relate to anyone there. They\u2019re all basic party girls and I can\u2019t drink or smoke without throwing up I hate it. Seems like everyone already has their friend groups established now that it\u2019s October idk how to meet peeps",

      "text": "I can relate so much:)) I used to cry every evening and would go home even if we had only 1 week vacation. Failed 2 subjects in 1st term and I became overweight because I ate so much. I started studying extremely hard even though I found Science hard. I marked the calendar every day and eventually the day came when school was finally over. \nI believe you too can get through this! The day will come . Fighting!!",

I also want to enjoy my time in college but idk how. I really don\u2019t like drinking or drugs like partying. I\u2019m also Christian but haven\u2019t really like the people in the Bible study so I left after 1 time. My sorority isn\u2019t good either and I\u2019m about to quit. Everyone seems so basic. In high school I had kinda weird friends tbh but they were great and idk how to find that in college. Seems like everyone already has friends and I\u2019m too late",
