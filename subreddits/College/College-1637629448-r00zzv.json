  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI have roughly about 3 weeks left before the fall semester is over and I feel like I\u2019ve lost most of my motivation to do assignments and study. I know I need to do those things but I just have that feeling of not wanting to do anything. I want to finish strong but dang it\u2019s hard \ud83d\ude2b",
