  "title:": "I'm so damn lost in this class, I have literally no idea what is happening",
  "text": "I'm a senior CompSci student. The homeworks in this class I'm taking are fucking incomprehensible to me, like I've been looking at these instructions and they make zero sense. I understand the high-level general concepts of the class fairly easily, but when it comes to actually doing the hands-on programming assignments and actually implementing things I have no idea what is even happening. And I know that if I don't understand the assignment now, they're probably only going to get more difficult and incomprehensible from now on. My grades have been fine so far but this assignment and (I assume) all of the future assignments are not going to go well at all for me either.\n\nSo I guess my question is what I should do moving forwards, how I can make a comeback in this class if it's possible.",

There are several upper division topics that are confusing like this and not easy to understand until you have someone explain it to you individually.\n\nTypically in your senior courses there are at least one or two where a once/twice weekly study group is immensely beneficial.",
