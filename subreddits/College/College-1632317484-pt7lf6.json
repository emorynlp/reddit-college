I was coming home from school and as I was getting off the highway, this guy rear ended me. It was pretty minor, the back of my car is dented but nothing major is broken, and I have whiplash. However, I\u2019m not sure if this guy even has insurance, he didnt even have a license, so I cannot seek medical attention until the accident report comes in (which takes 3-5 days). If he doesn\u2019t have insurance we might have to sue him. But if he does have insurance I have to file a claim in order to get medical insurance. \n\nOn top of that, my classes have been really busy and hard. I\u2019ve been really stressed out as I am still trying to get adjusted and all of the assignments I have due I do not understand them at all. I haven\u2019t told any of my professors that I was in an accident because I feel like they would not care. None of them accept late work and attendance is mandatory. I have at least 4 hours of class everyday and Monday through Thursdays I\u2019m on campus for 12 hours (which is another story.) \n\nSo I am really stressed and I have no time to get medical treatment or deal with the trauma. Because I\u2019m still waiting for the report, I\u2019m in pain, and everyday I have to drive to school, I cannot relax.  Last night I was driving home at 8:30 pm and this guy tailgated me in the dark, windy neighborhood for 20 minutes straight. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I can deal right now. I am so stressed and behind.", "author": "denver_rose", "created": 1632317484, "retrieved": 1632946168, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 144, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hdy761m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt7lf6/it_has_been_the_worst_week_of_my_life/hdy761m/", "text": "Consider calling your insurance company to verify if you actually have to wait five days before you seek medical attention and if they are saying that is the policy ask them 'what if I need medical care now' and I'm sure there is some loophole they will help you with.", "author": "nikkiemt", "created": 1632394617, "upvotes": 1}, "hdxr0l8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt7lf6/it_has_been_the_worst_week_of_my_life/hdxr0l8/", "text": "I would see if your school has any type of student assistance center that could help you.
