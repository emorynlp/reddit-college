  "text": "On Monday I got into a car accident. I was coming home from school and as I was getting off the highway, this guy rear ended me. It was pretty minor, the back of my car is dented but nothing major is broken, and I have whiplash. However, I\u2019m not sure if this guy even has insurance, he didnt even have a license, so I cannot seek medical attention until the accident report comes in (which takes 3-5 days). If he doesn\u2019t have insurance we might have to sue him. But if he does have insurance I have to file a claim in order to get medical insurance. \n\nOn top of that, my classes have been really busy and hard. I\u2019ve been really stressed out as I am still trying to get adjusted and all of the assignments I have due I do not understand them at all. I haven\u2019t told any of my professors that I was in an accident because I feel like they would not care. None of them accept late work and attendance is mandatory. I have at least 4 hours of class everyday and Monday through Thursdays I\u2019m on campus for 12 hours (which is another story.) \n\nSo I am really stressed and I have no time to get medical treatment or deal with the trauma. Because I\u2019m still waiting for the report, I\u2019m in pain, and everyday I have to drive to school, I cannot relax.  Last night I was driving home at 8:30 pm and this guy tailgated me in the dark, windy neighborhood for 20 minutes straight. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I can deal right now. I am so stressed and behind.",

Or better yet, YOU draft that up and send to professor and Dean. \n\nMy point here is, you gotta advocate for yourself a little bit or you\u2019re really just hurting yourself for the benefit of others.
