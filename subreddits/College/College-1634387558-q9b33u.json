  "text": "Title, I just got a $2000 and some change check as a surplus tuition refund or something (Honestly not sure how or why I got it but I think that's what it is)\n\nI assume it's best to spend this on school things, but what I'm unsure of is if the surplus check will be added to my tuition? Like will an extra $2000 charge be added to my total loans if I don't funnel the surplus back into tuition or what?\n\nThanks to anyone who can give advice, sorry if the question is poorly worded I'm bad with economic bureaucracy stuff",
