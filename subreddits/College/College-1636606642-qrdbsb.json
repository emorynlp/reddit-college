  "text": "I\u2019m finishing up a hard class on December 10th, I have a second interview next Wednesday and I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have the third interview either later that week or the week after. This throws my possible start date into my last week of class. How do I politely mention that I may need flexibility until dec 10th? Also I will be having a few very necessary medical things popping up and will need some time off for those.",

      "text": "don't worry about your start date until you actually know what the start date is. at that point, if it conflicts, let them know and ask for flexibility.\n\nin fact, you might not even start for another few weeks after the third interview. you probably have onboarding to do like submitting background check and drug test and blah blah blah.",
