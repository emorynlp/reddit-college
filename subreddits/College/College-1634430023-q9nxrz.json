  "text": "Hear me out. One of the classes (philosophy) i am taking right now is asynchronous. The prof just gives as a bunch of readings with no lectures explaining it. There is this one module where the prof for my class used another professor's youtube video.\n\nHere's the thing. The prof for the class hadn't done anything other than upload readings and pasting the few youtube videos (not his lectures). None of the assignments have been graded (these assignments are repeats from last semester). \n\nI'm lowkey considering emailing the youtube professor for help instead of the prof of the class. The thing is that this professor teaches at a university in Europe. I'm going to college in the U.S. So yeah, my professor in the U.S. is essentially using a Europen professor's youtube videos for some extra \"help.\" My classmates and I have also tried to communicate with the professor but didn't get a response. For the few times we did, it was essentially \"look back at the reading and refer to module 2 to understand how tk approach philosophy.\"\n\nSo yeah, am I crazy for even considering emailing the European professor? I can't get help for the class bc the professor isn't helping and there are no tutors. Emailing the European professor is literally me going to a last resort.",

And all of my 100% online classes are just like this. We never meet and just read from the book and watch YouTube videos on the topic. Based off all of the online classes I\u2019ve ever had at my school, that\u2019s pretty normal. If it is supposed to be asynchronous, I would definitely contact the dean or somebody in charge to see what\u2019s going on. And they should at least be answering your emails.",

      "text": "Hopefully, the prof is actually okay. The weird thing about online classes that are already developed is they kind of go on auto-play. We had a case last year where the professor had a mental illness issue and wound up hospitalized but no one let the school know (I think he didn\u2019t have close family), so just\u2026. No one was manning the class but no one knew that until students contacted the dean and they also couldn\u2019t get through to the prof. (If he\u2019s not somehow incapacitated though, agreed that\u2019s a whole lot dereliction of duty right there).",

Usually asynchronous classes are supposed to have prerecorded lectures or PowerPoint slides with lecture notes. I would suggest asking the department head if they could do something. This professor leaves a lot to be desired.",
