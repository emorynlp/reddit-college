  "text": " so, im currently done with my alevels, and it just occurred to me the significances of the issues that can arise from mismatched dates of birth between certificates. all of my exam certificates are registered to 2001 (when i was actually born), but my birth certificate and passport has it as 2002. don't ask how. anyways, fear struck me, and i'm afraid as well confused and anxious. what problems may arise when i try to get into university or work/study abroad? the implications seem less than optimistic, if this very slight difference is taken into account for assessing a myriad of opportunities. if it causes a lot of problems, how to solve this main issue?",
