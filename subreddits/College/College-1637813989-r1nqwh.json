Easiest to quickly take notes in since you can make messy graphs and keep indentation.\n\nMy personal route,\n\n* Before school, glue in copy of syllabus, file original. I like knowing what topic we are covering.\n* Before class, Google topic, read wikipedia page or similar brief overview, take quick notes. If shitty names ~~Classics~~ write the names down on post it for reference.\n* Class. Take notes, personally I use a sort of outline method with some of the cornell method. By which I mean there's a lot of question marks and arrows about what to study and was important and stuff yelling and me to expand later. \n* Later. Rewrite notes from messy chaos to readable. Google to check the questions or things I needed to expand. Take this and make flash cards. \n* If you get PDFs, you can set them to print with space for taking notes. I didn't find that helped me.",
