  "text": "Yep- mold. In my dorm room. Ive been so sick this past month, horrible sore throat, congestion, drowsiness, the whole shabang. So of course first time i go my school\u2019s (not afraid to name them-BRADLEY UNIVERSITY in illinois) health services was sent away in 5 minutes and told to \u201cfigure it out\u201d. I go home for 5 days for a short fall break and im magically feelin great again. Come back to school and within the first week everything comes back at full force! I try taking new over the counter shit and drink a pack of emergen-c every day. Just keeps getting worse and worse to the point where i cant sleep at night as i wake up every hour gasping for air through my sore throat. Go back to health services and actually get help from a good doctor who runs a some tests (strep, mono) and everythings negative. I get some random prescription for a decongestant but he gave a lot of great advice and was genuinely concerned. This past weekend I opened a slot on my ac/heating unit in the dorm and it was COVERED IN MOLD. Everything finally clicks. Reached out to other students in my building and see others have had mold cleaned out their rooms\u2026but no notice from the university\u2026\nSo uh- what should i do about this? I reported my mold to an ra and tey said theyd \u201cput in a ticket\u201d \nAnyone else have this problem?",

It will be prioritized.  \nIt's not as serious as water flooding from a busted pipe, but it's serious and will be prioritized appropriately.",

      "text": "Email facilities or residence life and tell them about the problem. I say email, not call, because mold is a health issue and you want to establish a paper trail that you were asking for it to be removed.\n\nYou can and should ask for them to cover any expenses you incur as a result of the mold. The doctors visit, any medicine, etc. Keep the invoices for that stuff.\n\nIf they don't respond in a week or don't start to fix it by then, you should contact the city/county health department or housing authority. Tell them the university is aware of the mold issue, it's substantial enough to be a health hazard, and they haven't responded to you about it.",
