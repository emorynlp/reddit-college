  "title:": "Changing my major for parents",
  "text": "I (20M) was supposed to finish my associates this year, but I got into an argument with my parents about my ideas in the workplace (I want to be a police officer) I didn\u2019t need an associates for the department that I wanted to work in,  but they wanted me to go to college. Now that I started applying for the police academy my father started to voice his concerns, saying that I should change my major to electrical engineering and no son of his will be a police officer, I have always wanted to join the force and now it just seems like everything is crumbling down. He has threatened to take everything I bought (car in his name for insurance reasons) and disown me. What\u2019s annoying me is that this entire time he hasn\u2019t said a thing about it and now all of a sudden he comes out with this, I don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "So the nice thing about being an adult is you don't have to listen to him. Obviously there will be consequences (for example, if you \"disobey\" and are still living with him, he could kick you out), but there are ways to mitigate this. Start planning for moving out, getting a used car to replace the one he has claim to, etc. Once those pieces are in place, go apply to the job you want.",

It just takes a lot of work, and not the physical (straightforward) kind.\n\nAside from math, your parents don't know if being a police officer can provide you with a good life. They know that electrical engineering will. EE jobs require no overtime during regular week or during holidays, no risk of getting shot or hit and possibly dealing with permanent disability, nobody will hate your guts solely for your profession, you enter your first job with a really decent salary, no mental trauma, and you will probably never get laid off in a depression. Even if you happen to hate EE job, your parents figure that you will at least be comfortable at home and be able to purchase things to enjoy without having to worry about money.\n\nIf the only thing standing between you and that nice of a life is math, you can and should work through it.",
