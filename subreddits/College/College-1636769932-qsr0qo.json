  "text": "Apparently the class is supposed to build or total fitness and achieve leadership. It\u2019s a recreational class so I assume we are going to be doing physical work and similar to military boot camp. I just want to know what im about to get myself into, I\u2019m trying to look for people who took the class but idk. So anybody ever taken a class like this ? \n\nI thought I would take it too help my anxiety and step more out of my comfort zone but idk military boot camps seem extreme I\u2019m a scaredy cat. I won\u2019t step out yet though. The class is next semester.",
