Beans are good to have around also. Granola/oats are another good snack. Be sure you\u2019re drinking enough water daily, that may have an effect on how full you\u2019re feeling.",

As for shelf stable, quick fulfilling food, beans, specifically chick peas, so easy to fry up on a skillet. Rice of course, don't be fearful of cooking on the stove, it's so easy, just follow instructions to a T and your set.",

For perishables, you want eggs and bacon. Eggs go with basically anything and you can prepare them a number of ways. Bacon is a good meat option since it cooks so fast.",

If not, a mini-fridge/freezer is a good purchase to consider.\n\nAnd once you have a mini-fridge, eggs, milk, and cheese would top my list of must-haves for affordable, microwaveable ingredients.\n\nGet a basket for fruit also.  If you're on a meal plan, your cafeteria will probably let you take a piece of fruit with you from each meal.",
