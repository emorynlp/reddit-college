  "text": "I'd probably change one of my majors for history. All my favourite classes since I started college three years ago have all been from the history department, I've known that I love history since I was like 11, but just decided to not study it. I am, however, pleased with both my majors, I don't regret anything, but I'd love to take history courses when I graduate and if I could study it, I would",

I really like learning about history too, but I hate writing papers and I don\u2019t want to be a history teacher or anything else that you can do with a history degree. \n\nIf I could go back I\u2019d just tell younger me exactly what classes to take, when to take them, and which ones will suck the most.",
