  "text": "I just started applying for 4 year colleges. I have my associates from a community college (I'll be a teansfer student) but did not have to apply since I had been enrolled through a trade school when I was 16. So applying to these 4 year colleges is new to me.\n\nAfter the application has been submitted and they have received my high school transcript, how long do they usually take to make a decision? Will they tell me if they decline my application?\n\nI am applying to public colleges with higher acceptance rates if that makes a difference.",
