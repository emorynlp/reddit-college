  "title:": "Am I gonna regret this 8 week course?",
  "text": "I signed up for an online, 8 week race and ethnicity course that starts oct 11th for my last semester in community college  (unless this class kills me then I can drop and graduate in the spring instead). It\u2019s not required for my major but it\u2019s a CSU requirement which I\u2019m trying to transfer to and also it helps me meet the credit requirement to graduate with my ADT this Fall. I\u2019m in an in person history class that started last week which shouldn\u2019t be too hard, a  full term Intro to sociology online course, and another late start 1 credit weight lifting course and also working 22 hours a week. My professor keeps emailing saying it\u2019s going to be intense. Are 8 week courses really that hard? I\u2019m good at liberal arts courses but if this is the class that\u2019s gonna kill me id rather drop and finish my credits a semester later since I\u2019m applying to transfer to a CSU for fall 2022 anyways.",
