So approximately 10 days. My only midterm is for History. It is a 10-question, short-response exam that is also proctored. I\u2019m planning to go over all 4 units we have studied so far in the course, but what are some key tips for retaining and studying before exams/midterms like this? It is my first semester as a freshman in college, so I am trying to approach this in the most logical way possible. Any tips are welcomed, thank you all! :)", "author": "noviina", "created": 1632548508, "retrieved": 1632800339, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he9f45d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv0n33/cramstudy_tips_for_first_semester_in_college/he9f45d/", "text": "I have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college.

Consider repeatedly writing down the important information at least 3 times a day for the next 10 days.\n\nThird tip: Explain the material in your own words. Grab a rubber duck, your favorite inanimate object, or your roommate and give them a lecture on what you think will be on the exam. Doing this can help reveal any gaps in your knowledge that you need to fill.\n\nFourth tip: Make connections between concepts. You know, for some reason, the one thing I remember from my history class is how in certain ancient civilizations, the local religious building was at the center of the city (a symbol of its importance in the lives of the citizenry)", "author": "Comprehensive-Ad3963", "created": 1632584695, "upvotes": 2}, "he6vcol": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv0n33/cramstudy_tips_for_first_semester_in_college/he6vcol/", "text": "A whole 10 days? Damn you\u2019re sitting pretty. My study habits were/are cram the night before and the best proven habit that also worked for me is setting a timer for an hour, when it\u2019s done take a 15-30 minute break, then rinse and repeat. Don\u2019t make the mistake of mindlessly reading the whole book. If you took notes fantastic read those, is the professor recorded lecture great watch it, if none of the above, make or find a quizlet and take facts from your old tests and quizzes and stick em on there, read the units over and pit important information in there. Then study the absolute shit out of the quizlet. You could mindlessly skim over the chapter but I can almost guarantee it\u2019s not gonna work.\n\nEdit: hopefully your professor was nice and has been hinting at stuff you should know or have you a review!", "author": "Kenkxb", "created": 1632550490, "upvotes": 3}}}
