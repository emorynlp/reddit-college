  "text": "Failing a lower level math class with seemingly no end In sight. I\u2019ll either have to stay at my dorm and fail or withdraw, receive a W On my transcript, and go home. Both are miserable. Turns out I\u2019m not smart enough for this class or major, and since most classes require the one I\u2019m taking as a prerequisite, it\u2019s looking like I\u2019m not smart enough for college at all. Even though me being a junior somewhat contradicts that, these classes are too high level for me. How do I deal with my failure? How do I deal with the fact that I\u2019m not smart enough?",
