  "text": "I\u2019m wondering if anybody in this sub goes to UNT or UT at Austin currently. Specifically if you\u2019re a business management major. Im currently going to a CC but I think I\u2019ve narrowed it down to these two for when I transfer. I\u2019ve done some research but would love some reviews on classes/professors/the campus\u2019s/etc from actual current students. I would have to relocate for both, I currently live in between the two schools. \n\nUT at Austin is higher ranked as far as best schools in the country for a business degree, but it\u2019s also more expensive. I also don\u2019t know anyone there so I\u2019d be starting completely fresh. I have always wanted to visit Austin though, and potentially live there one day. \n\nUNT is not very highly ranked but cheaper and I\u2019m familiar with the north Texas area. I know a few people in that area and do like north Texas. I also liked UNTs off campus living program from what I saw online. \n\n\nSome things that are important to me is the area around campus- is it safe? Have you made friends easily or are there good events/clubs to socialize?\n\nI\u2019m also trying to make the deans list at my school and am on track to do so- so far. So I would also like to know how hard the classes are, how strict the professors are, how do you like the classes/professors? \n\nI\u2019m also disabled, if any of you have experience with that (regardless of your major) can you tell me if the school has worked with you on accommodations and been helpful? \n\nIf there\u2019s any other info you think would be good to know for someone considering these schools, I\u2019m open to any important info/advice.",
