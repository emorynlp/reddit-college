  "text": "I haven\u2019t taken any form of testing aside from the TSI (it\u2019s the Texas Success Initiative if you aren\u2019t from Texas haha), the only thing is I have that is recognizable just even by a bit is a 3.5 and I go to a junior college in a rural-ish area. I\u2019m just really confused as to how they got my email and why they sent it to me bc again I haven\u2019t taken the SAT or ACT. I don\u2019t plan on applying because I\u2019m trying to transfer to Rice Uni. Is this common for Harvard to email people? And if so, is it usually a scam / way to get more applicants? Thanks guys!",

      "text": "There's a misconception that when schools say they look for \"diversity\" they're only looking for black/hispanic students. Rural people are extremely underrepresented in Ivies as well, so \"rural students\" are often on the list of \"underrepresented students\" that they reach out to. Schools often focus their advertising budget on \"key\" demographics, so it's possible you or your current school checks some boxes with regards to the people they are looking to recruit.\n\nIf you're rural *and* you fit other \"underrepresented\" characteristics, then it's even more likely that schools will randomly reach out to you. \n\nIt's not a scam, but it is certainly a way to get more applicants. It definitely doesn't mean your chance of getting in is any higher, but it does mean they do want you to apply. \n\nA handful of Ivies did some intense advertising at a community college I worked at that had a single digit graduation rate. Usually there would be a person or two from the college who'd get accepted to one of the Ivies, but in reality the Ivies just want to expand their pool of applicants beyond the stereotypical rich white/Asian kids from the suburbs.",

I might apply just for shits and giggles because I know I won\u2019t get in, but atleast I can say I applied to Harvard right? Haha! Thank you for the info!",
