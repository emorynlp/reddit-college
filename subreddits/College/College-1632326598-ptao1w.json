With aid I could only pay like, 850 a month. Unfortunately, the uni is in a very expensive city and I'd have to commute a bit to find an apartment I could get for anywhere near that price. So I'm trying to get some idea of how much I might have after working an internship (while paying rent / food during the internship) to save for putting towards rent / food next year. \n\nYes, sadly we need to worry about this this early on.

However here were my food and other cost break down:\n\nFood: 200-250 every two weeks (ate out a metric fuck ton with the girlfriend and food isn't exactly cheap). You could (and I did some weeks) get it down to $50 a week if you budgeted and meal prepped no biggie. \n\nGas: $200 per month. Around $50 a week, could be more depending on how much I drove. \n\nInsurance: $36 dollars a month \n\nEntertainment: 200 a month. Thankfully in San Diego, a lot of activities are outdoors and free so the only thing it costs is gas. Usually spent on shopping for clothes or other necessities. \n\nI think in the end it will be largely dependent on how much you want to spend. I could tell you everything about my spending habits (have every expense saved on excel) but it won't matter if you're in Boston v San Diego or Chicago as living expenses are different everywhere. I would  make sure that the hourly pay lines up roughly with living costs. You can always get another side job in the afternoon if your typical intern is 9-5", "author": "DoorBuster2", "created": 1632328544, "upvotes": 2}}}
