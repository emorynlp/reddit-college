          "text": "This is a good question covered in a lot in reporting on covid. The two issues usually brought up are...\n\n1. It's still so early in our experience with covid that we don't know what \"immunity\" will be. Is it permanent or brief? Do some people become immune but not others? Are certain populations more likely or less likely to become immune? Do we become immune but become more likely to develop related illnesses later on? (Shingles is the classic example... you'd get chickenpox as a kid, become immune, but then have shingles later in life.)\n\n(And \"1a\", I guess: young people on campus are surrounded by older people on campus.)\n\n2. Even though young people die less often from covid (it seems so far), they still get sick. We'll put aside the cases we've seen of young people not dying but being left with organ damage, etc. and focus on the fact that many, many schools have bare bones student health clinics, some with just a nurse practitioner on duty and many not open 24 hours. If there's a covid outbreak on one of those campuses, the students, their contagion, and their tight budgets get moved to a local hospital, which may already be serving a community that itself is seeing a spike.\n\nYour point is well taken though. Again, it's a good question. But unfortunately, eight months into this, we still don't have good enough answers to know what you suggest would be better or worse.",

Then if you have them consider the people infected that didn't die, and also consider the people infected that died with a co-morbidity, you start to realize how the mental gymnastics is so impressive on here.\n\n0.0005% of the population has died from the KungFlu.\n\nThe states locking down, the media causing panic by fearmongering every single day for over half a year, people literally using fear as a weapon. It's madness.\n\nIf the economy crashes, or people lose their absolute minds because some people stop caring about living in fear, it will end up causing more deaths than the virus ever could.\n\nIt's absurd, but I am comforted by the fact that there are a few of us who are trying to past it and are trying to be reasonable.",

I don't agree with the 24/7 attacking of the higher education systems as it is optional but for those who do choose to attend college, they have the right to complain about how a lot of their money goes to, what they feel, is a waste. Of course on the opposite side the college/university's concern is their bottom line and believe it or not they don't actually have a large profit margin. There are core issues with every university but now isn't the time to go on about it because the schools concern is their bottom line and trying to avoid firing staff, getting rid of a lot of the things people enjoy on campus, and all of that good stuff. Simply said you shouldn't expect to have an optimal college experience because we instead have to choose to keep people safe.",
