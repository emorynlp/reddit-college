Say, you did the fasa for your current school only (you can't use the fasa for 2 schools) and you used the aid for an elective and then did an online school for the class you needed (like math but without the fasa you would have to pay for it but their are some cheep school transfer agreements). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdk if it's possible to attend 2 schools while receiving financial aid if you only apply said financial aid to one college.

By changing the year, I no longer needed that one class that was full and unavailable and I was able to take a different class that still fulfilled that requirement of my degree. I hope your university/advisors can do something similar. Good luck!",

Some Universities, when a required class is chronically full and missing it can affect graduation, will sometimes allow an independent study with a professor, in lieu of the class.  This of course means you would also need to convince a professor to go along this path as well.  Doesn't always happen, but seen it done in more than one institution. \n\nAlso, if you have no luck with your majors dean nor your advisor, try reaching out to your dean of students, student ombudsman, or whatever title the position is at your campus, and calmly, and logically, lay out your case. \n\nAt the end of the day, schools, in general are judged by their graduation rates. If you have a good record at the school, and this is the only thing preventing your graduation, they may just find a way around the problem.\n\nAll this presumes you are telling the whole truth here.  If there were things under your control you did not take advantage of, such as missing the 1st day of enrollment for a student of your standing, etc, you may get less sympathy",

You're honestly trying to tell me a school has a class required for graduation that is hard-capped at 50 per semester, it is taught in both the fall and the spring semester, and yet the department has well over 100 students trying to graduate a year? I honestly don't believe that for a hot second. There are layers of curriculum committees and admin that would flag and correct that problem.  \n\n\nWhat else is there to this story?",

One counts for our degree and the other does not.  Multiple advisors were telling students they could get around having to formally see me for advising by taking the other classes and it would be fine.  Then, when they should have been at the end of their college careers and had to see me for a permit for our final course, I had to be the bad guy and tell them they couldn't graduate with that degree.  :(  When called out on it, the other advisors were like, \"Oh?

My major was being phased out (boo), none of the students were notified, and a whole bunch of courses disappeared, so the courses that remained were full. Some of us were told to switch degrees, meaning an extra 1-2 YEARS of school. Turns out, that was a big lie, the course counselor had the power to get us into courses that could allow us to graduate, but it was a lot of work on their part, so they simply didn't want to do it. I put up a big stink (by that I mean I had a panic attack at a meeting lol) and was put into the courses I needed to to graduate. After that I saw a different course counselor . . .",

Take it all the way to the school president if you have to. Depending on how much time you have left before the class starts, ideally send your emails and give 1-2 business days before moving up the ladder until you get a \"yes\" from someone. \n\nHaving students not graduate looks bad for the school. Having students not be able to afford living expenses after not being able to access a class doesn't look good. Write these hardships out in your emails and say you need help getting into the course and that the teacher is willing to teach you if you're given a spot in the class. If you can tack on a letter or two of recommendation from previous teachers to these emails, that'd be good too.",
