They get paid to help students, so use it. \n\nIf ur class has a tutoring session, then make time to go there. If there is a Class GC then use it, but for the love of god, be productive in the GC. Don't be talking about Jordan's and unrelated crap unless its either about the class or stuff pertaining on or around campus so u have a less likelihood of getting distracted by the side chattering and more likely to get ur ass into gear b4 u fail and either have to retake the class or lose the money and time spent in the class where u are legit borderline in passing. \n\nYou got this, fam, u can do it, if u got time and there are assignments left that still haven't been graded; then u got a good chance of getting a C. However, u can't not afford to make  mistakes or errors since this is ur wake up call. \n\nDon't waste it darlin. \n\nNow go kick some ass and show that class who's boss and get those results.",

Asking for special favors is considered grade grubbing and is a massive irritant.\n\nEdit: folks seem to think I\u2019m being a jerk (or worse) by saying this. I\u2019m not trying to be a jerk. It\u2019s just a warning that some professors get annoyed by these kinds of requests, so there\u2019s a potential risk involved here that OP should be aware of. People usually think there\u2019s no harm in asking, but there can definitely be harm in asking certain professors for this sort of thing.",

I can\u2019t give you extra credit opportunities that I don\u2019t give the entire class. I will use my rounding policy as stated in the syllabus.\u201d\n\nPS - not sure why everyone is downvoting me on this. This is a consistent theme at the end of the semester, and the advice is always not to grade grub because you don\u2019t know how the professor will respond.

I suppose it's also worth mentioning my personal approach.\n\nI tend to give 2-5% of the course grade's worth of points in extra credit opportunities throughout the semester. I also allow students to revise and resubmit assignments prior to the deadline if they submit them early. Between those two things, everyone has the opportunity to do well in class. You really kind of have to go out of your way to fail my classes, and that usually happens when people just don't turn stuff in.\n\nIf someone worked really hard all semester - came to office hours/met with me to talk about things, turned everything in, came to class all the time, participated, did all the extra credit opportunities I offered earlier in the semester - and still ended up with a 69.4%, I would round them up, and their asking me about it would not be offensive at all. Meanwhile, if someone blew everything off all semester, never came to class, didn't turn some things in, and so forth, and then they come up at the end of semester asking for more points, I would be less apt to help them out.\n\nThat said, not everyone is like me, so I thought it prudent to provide fair warning that it could backfire.",
