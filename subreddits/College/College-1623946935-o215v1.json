So I joined the army reserves they're paying for my CC but the recruiter acted like the army would pay for everything just being in the reserves little did I know that wasn't true. So I'm in college using the reserve gi bill working a part time job and paying my own rent and bills. \n\nIt's not that bad just a little difficult at times but I'm making it through!", "author": "bald_butte", "created": 1623965101, "upvotes": 2}, "h24xki6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o215v1/did_anyone_else_have_abnormal_college_experience/h24xki6/", "text": "I started my second semester of senior year high school because I moved from one state to another and the new state had shitty educational requirements so I graduated a semester early. Then I moved after my first semester because my parents moved again (yes we were in that state for only a year) and I definitely couldn't support myself living alone. \n\nOn top of all this, my parents income was out of date on the FAFSA because of the moving (and my dad losing his higher paying job) so I only got unsubsidized loans that did not cover tuition. I worked at least 25 hours a week to cover the leftover tuition I got stuck with so my life was work, study, and sleep. I stayed at a second college in the new state for two years, planning to transfer to another one in state to finish as pre-vet.\n\nRight as I was finishing my fall semester of the second year, running out of gen eds to take, I realized I would not be able to handle the stress and expense of veterinary school. Plus, organic chemistry was kicking my ass and I doubted I could pass that semester, let alone take orgo 2. So I looked at the school I wanted to transfer to for other related programs and found out they offer a wildlife biology degree where you graduate with your bachelor's AND as a certified wildlife biologist. \n\nSo, that summer, after 2 1/2 years total, I finally transferred and moved out on my own with my boyfriend of 2 years. Then we realized we're fucked financially by the FAFSA since my parents can't afford college but make too much for me to get aid. So we got married and the FAFSA finally recognized I have $0 and now I get paid ~$100 a semester to go to college. I graduate in December after a total of 5 calendar years. \n\nI never lived in the dorms and never really made lasting friends aside from one person in my program currently and my husband. I am certainly enjoying my courses now though since I struggled and had a whole crisis over changing my entire life plan that I thought I had figured out since basically being born.\n\nWildlife is absolutely my thing and I plan to pursue a master's so I can go into habitat management and have fun managing land, talking to people about land management, and hopefully getting into rewilding. I'm not a mega fan of fieldwork, but I love planning and directly helping the environment by way of managing forests.\n\nSorry for the whole essay, but I don't think many people truly appreciate their place in college without having struggled or knowing someone who struggled. College is expensive, difficult, and sometimes you go in with the wrong expectations or majors. It's not supposed to be a party, it's supposed to be a time where you figure out what you want and learn valuable life skills.", "author": "FurretsOotersMinks", "created": 1623964212, "upvotes": 5}, "h24vuda": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o215v1/did_anyone_else_have_abnormal_college_experience/h24vuda/", "text": "I hated my uni years.

I went to community college part time from 19-23.It really allowed me to do well on my classes. It was mostly online though. \n\nI was able to save a decent amount and actually funded an entire year abroad still having additional savings when I came back. So I studied for a year abroad but had physical/mental health problems the second semester, so I was unable to transfer credits and took a semester off when I got back. I made my main college friends abroad, I only frequently stay in consistent contact with two. It was fun, but not all roses. I had a professor humiliate me after a presentation and ended up crying in the bathroom for two hours. It was so traumatizing that I never went to any of my classes. It came with consequences, including loosing half my credits and my savings.\n\nSpring of 2019 I finally decided to go full time to make connections and live on campus with the hopes of making more friends. BAM! Corona hit. \n\nLong story short, just because you didn't have the \"average\" college experience doesn't mean you should let that get you down. I have friends who went to a traditional college but honestly, it was four years of their life that they barely bring up anymore. \n\nTaking your time had benefits. Unfortunately, there are some people who kind of want to constantly boost about college because it was their version of the  \"good ole days.\" \n\nI understand where your coming from, I always get, \"Wow, what took you so long?\" Umm. None of your business. \n\nAnyways, you're not the only one. With time, things will pass and you will meet people who will bring up college less and less. At the end of the day, people are boosting about college to boost their ego. Don't get me wrong, we all do things to do that. However, do not let it lessen your journey. I went through a lot that prevented me from having the regular college experience. People are so quick to judge those who did not have such experiences, it kind of ticks me off because they have no idea what goes on in someones life during the \"College years.\" All that matters is that you graduated and you were able to get to a good place. We all have times we need to get our shit together, and it prevents us from meeting our goals on time. Ours was just sooner rather than later.

Not a lot of parties really, everyone just kinda keeps to themselves. I very seldom made friends pre-covid, even less during. It's not inherently bad, some people are at school to learn and not really to make friends and there's nothing wrong with that. My philosophy is that I'm at school to learn first, and if I make some friends along the way (which I have) that's great, but I'm here primarily to better myself. I find that a decent portion of people that do end up at those big party schools are there because their parents wanted them to and not out of their own will anyway. \n\nHonestly I think more people can relate to you than you would otherwise think, my rule of thumb is that if your school doesn't have a football team, it's generally going to be the same keep to yourself vibe.

My dad lost his job right before I went but we were okay with money. Then I had a supremely shitty roommate my first semester. I switched to a school closer to home for that spring semester but hated it there so I went back to the first school the next spring semester. Mental health was okay but not great. \n\nI stayed at that school for a year and a half. In that time my mom got diagnosed with breast cancer and my grandmother died from lung cancer. My dad got a job in another state so he was living between two states while we worked to move and I went to school WHILE my mom had cancer. Luckily she didn\u2019t need chemotherapy but it was still a stressful time. \n\nDuring all this time I had ZERO idea of what I wanted to do with my life. I switched majors four times. I finally found something I loved and transferred to a school in the state my dad got a job but had to take the fall semester off because they couldn\u2019t admit me until spring 2019. My mom had knee replacement surgery since I was home so I helped her a lot. I move to my new school and absolutely love it. Great roommate and the atmosphere was amazing. \n\nIn the fall I ended up with a new roommate because my other one became an RA and couldn\u2019t have a roommate and this roommate was bad. She never spoke to me and just gave me bad vibes. But we made it work. Otherwise I was living my best life. Loving my classes and my major and making new friends!\n\nThen surprise COVID hits!!!! I move back home with my parents (which is totally fine I love them) and finished that year at home.
