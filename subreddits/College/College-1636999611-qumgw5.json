  "text": "Hey guys, I need help switching majors. I am a freshman currently taking computer science courses and I don\u2019t understand a thing so I\u2019m thinking I need to switch it up. However I want to stick with the technology side of things because that is my main interest. I eventually preferably want to work in the robotics industry but I wouldn\u2019t complain about working with video games. What\u2019s your guys take? \n\n(I\u2019m currently considering switching to Electrical Engineering with a CS minor) I appreciate any help I can get, I\u2019m stuck.",

      "text": "I graduated with a computer science degree in May of 2020. I now work on planes with a bunch of other computer scientist and electrical engineers. Both degrees are great.\n\nThat said I have a problem with switching from computer science to electrician engineering because you don\u2019t get your intro computer science classes. Electric engineering won\u2019t be any easier. I recommend really trying to learn the basics of programming on your own and see if you get it.\n\nHere is what I would do before you change majors. \n\n1) download visual studios\n\n2) pick a language. ( I would pick C++)\n\n3) watch YouTube tutorial and code along side them. I would learn how to do variables, output and input, if statements, and loops. Afterwards you can decide if programming is right for you.",
