  "text": "I want a shorter option, and something that really hits hard on the comprehensiveness. I want to be really valuable and not just fluff that's useless in the real world.\n\nMy main skill is webdev, and music as a hobby. I think marketing knowledge could come useful in both, especially adding to freelance webdev.",

      "text": "There isn\u2019t much fluff in marketing. Everything is useful. You want rock solid English skills to be great at writing for marketing material. You want history skills to read through the past, see what works and what didn't, and learn from the marketing mistakes of others. You want math because nobody wants a stupid marketer. You even want the business classes like business law and econ because you want to know the legal implications/requirements and overall market orientation to help your marketing plans succeed.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be looking for speed or comprehensiveness in purely marketing. You should be looking for a well-rounded program. Marketing requires you to not only be artistic and creative, but have strong PR skills and still have some good business sense to know what\u2019s going to appeal and what won\u2019t.\n\nGet a business degree and concentrate in marketing.",
