  "text": "I'm a high-school senior seeking a career in astrophysics; my initial plan was to study in France at the public unis (400-2000\u20ac a year) then get a PhD and become a French citizen.\n\n  But, my uncle recently moved to Canada and invited me to study there and stay at his place; I was also informed that university there are expensive (+16k CAD). So if I'm going to pay that much, wouldn't it be better to try and get into prestige universities (the likes of MiT , Harvard , Oxford...).",
