  "text": "we do weekly labs for physics 2, it started with ohm's law, the equipment is around 50 years old and every weeks seems to function worse. ohm's law went ok, had some high error percent. last week was dc circuits and we managed 4000 percent error and this week was joules law with the equipment not working at all and deeming the lab a complete failure not due to our faults. im straight up loving physics and lab fees!",

Some programs are different, and may count off for results with major disparities from the accepted value you are trying to achieve, but my lab classes generally don\u2019t. I try my best to get a good percent error, but if you can\u2019t then you can\u2019t. What I try to do in my lab report is basically say \u201c yeah, the experimental results are fucked, here are some sources of error that likely caused this\u201d. \n\nAnother thing you need to keep in mind is the type of lab, seeing that certain subjects will generally just have higher levels of error. Thermodynamics labs generally have high percent errors because heat is finicky and comes from the ambient temperature of the room, your hands, containers, etc.",
