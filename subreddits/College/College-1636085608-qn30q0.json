  "text": "For my calc 2 group chat (13 people) and mech induction course group chat (9 people), whoever gets the lowest total mark in the chats will need to receive a punishment.\n\nCurrently for calc 2, someone named Alexius and someone with the number 93XX-XXXX are in jeopardy of ending up as the lowest score. A bunch of us got 50-59/70 for the midterm, the highest score range in the chat, while those two got less than 30. Mech was still wide open as our scores are all similar.\n\nAny ideas for the last place punishment?",
