  "text": "Hello, so I\u2019m going to college pretty soon. I haven\u2019t decided on any schools yet, I do have preferences but nothing set in stone. I originally planned on going into the medical field however, I\u2019m kinda hesitant. I want to know if there\u2019s other fields that I\u2019d find myself happier in. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m entirely opposed to medicine but the thought of it all seems more unappealing. Also on the academic side, I\u2019m not the biggest fan of chemistry at all which is extremely detrimental for the medical field. But anyway, if anyone can tell me how they decided on the right major for them, can you let me know or give me advice?",

      "text": "Some advice on choosing a major:\n\nLook up lists of the best paying professions(do a few websites to make sure you see most of the options). Also make sure the profession doesn\u2019t need a masters or doctorate; find one that only needs a bachelors.\n\nChoose the one that seems most interesting to you and/or one that is in line with your skills(e.g. don\u2019t do engineering if you\u2019re weak at math). Play to your strengths.\n\nIf nothing seems worth it, consider community college/technical/trade school. If the manual labor type trades don\u2019t appeal to you, there is still IT and healthcare which only require an associates degree and/or professional certifications to get into entry level work",
