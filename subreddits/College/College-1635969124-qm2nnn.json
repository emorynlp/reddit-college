              "text": "i honestly would try to power through since you\u2019ve made it this far and your grades are REALLY good. I don\u2019t think it would be worth dropping if it\u2019s gonna show up on your transcript. \n\nbut languages are generally pretty good to show well-rounded-ness for your future , and i feel like it\u2019s generally easier to take a psych class at a local community college or something over winter/summer break. i would drop psych if you\u2019re definitely going to drop one or the other. just my two cents!!",
