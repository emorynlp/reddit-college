{"sid": "px1hvw", "link": "/r/college/comments/px1hvw/community_college_woes/", "title:": "Community College Woes", "text": "I just started attending a local community college for this fall semester, and I honestly feel really unsatisfied. My plan, as of right now, is to utilize community college as much as possible for a cheaper tuition, and then transfer to a university. I know that this is a smart way to go, but I\u2019ve still been having negative feelings towards the whole situation. Admittedly, I know that some of this is just the jealousy of seeing my friends, including my girlfriend, go off to universities and experience this whole new chapter in life, while I feel trapped in my hometown living a mentally numbing routine. I\u2019m wondering if anyone else is in a similar spot? Should I try to transfer sooner rather than later for the sake of my own happiness, and to finally get out of this situation that I hate? I\u2019m majoring in psychology, btw, so I know I\u2019m going to transfer at some point, I\u2019m just not sure if I should do it sooner or later. Any advice on how to get through this is greatly appreciated!", "author": "wrldonfire", "created": 1632815972, "retrieved": 1632945471, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hem4fzz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px1hvw/community_college_woes/hem4fzz/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632847527, "upvotes": 1}, "hekpi32": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px1hvw/community_college_woes/hekpi32/", "text": "Community college is better than a university mainly when it comes to smaller classes and cheap tuition. Imagine sitting in a class with hundreds of people paying ten times more tuition to get the same education. Take advantage of community college as much as possible.

I\u2019m a freshman, and I had my heart dead set on going out of state for the longest time. I really want to go to college in California or Florida because I love it there. But to reduce debt and due to a scholarship, I go to cc for free. I\u2019m depressed, and I hate it here. I hate my hometown and the state I live in. \n\nMy sister went away to a four-year in FL and I\u2019m jealous. But she\u2019s also in debt because of it. This means that after college she will be stuck at living at home for much longer to repay some of her debts. Especially with a criminology degree the starting salary for jobs are low. \n\nThe sooner you leave, the longer you stay. That\u2019s my motivating force to stick things out. I don\u2019t want to be stuck here for years after college. I want to move out of state altogether. Given my circumstances, I\u2019ll be able to do so sooner if I stick with cc. \n\nAnd just because the hometown you live in sucks, doesn\u2019t mean areas around you don\u2019t. Why not adventure out to other places near where you live or try something new. I\u2019ve been doing this on the weekends, and it\u2019s helped maintain my sanity thus. \n\nIt\u2019s ultimately up to you and what feels best, but try making a pro and cons list. Because remember, it\u2019s not as simple as just two years here or there. There\u2019s a big financial factor that follows you for years, possible decades.", "author": "kizeltine", "created": 1632818908, "upvotes": 3}}}
