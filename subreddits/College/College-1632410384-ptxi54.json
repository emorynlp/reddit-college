I knew it wouldn't be like the movies, but what the hell? The workload is manageable, but the people are making it miserable. My roommate and her friend- who I thought was also mine- are toxic and ignore anything I tell them about their behavior to make me look crazy. I'm just a background character to them. Genuinely, we were all three hanging out for several hours and I felt like I was just following them and they didn't even notice I was there. I was standing between them while they discussed going somewhere and then just walked off without me. Keep in mind, not the first time this happened yesterday. I was trying to be joking, like \"Oh, am I allowed to go? Should I just stay here?\" and they just sort of stared at me, like they forgot I was there.\n\nIt's been a lot with them, but if I'm not with them I'm alone in my freezing dorm trying to resist the urge to s\\*lf h\\*rm. I've decided to withdraw from my classes and work full time instead. I really enjoy my job- I just hate being home now.", "author": "salamader_", "created": 1632410384, "retrieved": 1632946152, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
