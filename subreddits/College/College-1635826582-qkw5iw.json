  "text": "I'm supposed to give a 4 minute extemporaneous speech but I have such a hard time remembering things in high stress. Our speeches are pre-recorded and posted into our discussion board.\n\nWondering if anyone has used the teleprompter extension on Zoom or another recording app successfully without looking like you're reading from a script? It sounds useful but I am feeling morally gray about it.",

          "text": "I did try that but it's a longer speech and my vision isn't great. I have to be far enough away that I'm visible from the belly button up, so reading off a word doc isn't ideal for the speech length as I can't scroll down mid-speech for text.",
