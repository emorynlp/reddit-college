  "text": "I am having second thoughts about the college I\u2019m attending. I applied, got accepted, and even got financial aid figured out for this college I\u2019m going to. I\u2019m a junior transfer student and it\u2019s my first quarter at this liberal arts school. My field of study is ELL and Education (which implies that I am studying to become an educator for students who want to learn english.) l was really excited to start this school but now I\u2019m halfway through my first quarter and I\u2019m feeling disillusioned. There\u2019s very limited courses at this school. None of the classes at the college actually teach me how to become a teacher. Even the ELL classes seem to not really focus on teaching English. The classes that are listed field of study are things such as creating games, political issues, or classes about social issues. I\u2019m paying all this money to take classes that won\u2019t benefit my future career. Two small colleges that I previously attended (one of them in which I graduated with my AA), have new bachelors programs for education which would be perfect to take, because the classes actually teach people about educating students in the future. However, it would add on a lot more time (maybe seven more quarters) and money to switch colleges. I\u2019m not sure if I can transfer my credits for this quarter because the school I\u2019m at doesn\u2019t even have grades for the courses. I\u2019d have to get financial aid all figured out again. If hadn\u2019t already attended college for three years now, I would try to switch as soon as possible. Another thing is that I want to live in Japan and teach English there as soon as possible. If I stay with this current school, I\u2019ll graduate on time. It\u2019s difficult though, because I feel like I\u2019m not learning anything useful at this school. I don\u2019t know what to do.",
