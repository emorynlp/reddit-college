  "text": "I just got in trouble for exiting my dorm building which I live on the first floor of 10 steps away from the door because my mask was not on for the duration of those 10 steps. Masks can be taken off outside as well. I don't care for the mask rule whether its in place or not but this seems ABSURD.",
