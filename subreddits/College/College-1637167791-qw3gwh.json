Could do homework then.\n\nMy history prof said that he took a security job where he pretty much just had to exist there and he read books during all his shifts.",

Random jobs you wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect - I work on the events crew at my school and oftentimes between tasks there will be 15-45 min where I can just do homework. Don\u2019t expect to be able to do it the entire time anywhere though",

      "text": "If there\u2019s any clinics or hospital systems close to you, you could apply for a part time job or even a temp job as a paser, which is just working the front office. Pretty much just as a receptionist. There will be days when we get a ton of patients and there\u2019s not free time and then there are days when we only 6 patients.  \n\nIt\u2019s what I\u2019m doing currently and my coworkers and manager are fine with me doing hw as long as I get things done. My manager lets me take time off and leave early whenever I have an exam I need to study for which has been super helpful. I work 16 hours a week for $10/hr and I can ask to work more hours if I have extra free time. Its a million times better than a $7.25/hr on campus job capped at 10-15 hours.",
