  "text": "I\u2019m currently majoring in math, statistics, and CS (yes, I know its a lot, but I like all three and I managed). However, I\u2019m a little uncertain about which I should pursue in graduate school. All three interest me and I realize that they would have a good amount of overlap, but perhaps there is some aspect that I am not considering? Anything to help me decide?\n\nI\u2019ve also heard of operation research PhDs but I feel like that might be a bit too specific for my interests. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong though!\n\nP.s. I am aiming for either quantitative finance (research) or data science.",

      "text": "Math is a path to research more than anything. At the PhD level, you would be looking at a professorship. Stats could take you into finance or data-science - big money either way. I don't know about the CS degree, but I'm guessing with a doctorate you'll have your choice of jobs at any FAANG.",
