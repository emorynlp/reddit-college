  "title:": "Our logic Professor is going to give the whole class full credit on our final because of Proctorio problems",
  "text": "So yesterday I was trying to do my last assignment, which is monitored by Proctorio, and I was being asked for a nonexistent \"Access Code.\" I emailed my Professor and after he told me to try a couple of things (none of which worked), I contacted the Proctorio live chat. Those jerks weren't of any help either. Then I told this to my Professor and he suggested trying to take it on another computer. After realizing nothing was going to work, I emailed him again telling him what had happened, and he told me to join him on Zoom to see if we could solve the problem together. \n\nAfter spending over an hour on Zoom with my Professor, Carlos (the Canvas it guy) and Michele (the Proctorio tech support), he told me that he was starting to get emails from other students telling him about the same problem. All in all, I spent 3-4 hours yesterday trying to figure this shit out. He finally dismissed me, and I went downstairs to eat some cake from Porto's which my mum had just brought.\n\nToday, I received an email from him addressing the whole class. He says he is going to give us full credit on the last four assignments AND on the final.\n\nWhich kind of blows because the average for previous exams was 70%, whereas I would get 95%. What do y'all think?\n\nPS: shoutout to my Professor for being a real one replying to me in a timely manner",

At the end of the day, life isn't always fair. But you just have to focus on yourself and make sure that the only fairness you stand up for is for your own - you worked hard, and you're getting the grade. That's all that matters. I'm not trying to sound preachy, I know it can be frustrating when you put in effort and a slacker ends up with the same grade, but I've learned that fixating on others will get you nowhere.",
