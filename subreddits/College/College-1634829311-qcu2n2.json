  "text": "I currently have a 78 in it because I bombed the first two tests (Under a 60 on both tests). Luckily the 2nd test score was dropped. I have two more unit tests and a final exam left. Honestly, I'm a pretty bad test-taker and I haven't been in school for 2 years. I could keep going and try to get the C, but it seems a bit risky. This is a Psychology course, by the way, so it's all just memorizing a bunch of material. The final day to drop is tomorrow.",

Google some videos on memorization or test-taking techniques. If your college has tutors, use them. Try chunking.\n\nIf you do end up getting a C, does it matter (like, are you planning on going to Grad/Medical school?). If it does, you can always re-take the class.",

Which remains on your transcript as a W. You\u2019re currently passing, so I don\u2019t know why you would withdraw at this point. Seems like what you need to do is go to the tutoring center or office hours to understand the material and better prepare yourself for exam day.",
