I've spoken with a couple people that are older and more suited to talk about it than me: there's a variety of opinions in the medical community but a lot of the people I have talked to think this will reach it's peak in the next 2-3 weeks.\n\nI think picking either option, right now at this moment, is safe for you and the people around you. However, if you are seriously worried about getting it or potentially having it, then it's bad for you to travel home because for your logic to be consistent you would have to be putting your older relatives at risk. Remember, most students really don't need to fear about getting this... but they should absolutely be very concerned about transmitting it to other demographics and take reasonable effort to prevent that. Transmitting it is the bigger issue we students need to worry about.",

They or your advisor can probably give you a decent idea of whether or not the online will last the entire semester or may restart face to face. \n\nHonestly with the way things are going I suspect even the colleges that haven\u2019t gone online all semester will probably be making the announcement soon rather then try fiddling with making up time for cancelled classes.",

They've decided there will be, at the very least, an in-person final exam. If they have to extend the state-wide cancellation of large gatherings, I expect the school would require us to come in to take the exam weeks or months (I doubt it would go that long) after the semester ends.\n\nIf your classes are all easy to transition to online classes, it's possible you wont have to go back. If I had to travel to go back, it might be worth it to me to go back home even with having to come back for finals.",
