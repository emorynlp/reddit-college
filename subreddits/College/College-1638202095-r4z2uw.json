  "text": "I started working on this final project for my \u201cDisney litterateur\u201d English class at 10pm. I finished at 8:00 am with basically no breaks at all. I walked around a bit and grabbed a drink but never fully stopped. The crazy part is it feels like it was only a few hours. I fell into some weird state of hyper focus and 10 hours flew by like nothing. Maybe it was because I actually enjoyed the project/material but still I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been 10 hours.",
