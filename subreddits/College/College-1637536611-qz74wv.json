  "title:": "Are there any benefits to graduating early besides cost?",
  "text": "So cost is not an issue because I attend a very cheap state college whose tuition is mostly covered by my scholarships. Cost aside, is there any benefit to graduating early? Right now, I can take 12 credit hours every semester and still graduate on time because I transferred a lot of classes from highschool. However, to graduate a semester early I would have to take 18 hours next semester, followed by 2 semesters of 15 credits each, then the last semester would be 12 credits. I am a computer science student if it matters. I would also like to be involved in school clubs.",

As someone in a tech major(EE) I would not advise taking 18 credits unless you have to(unless you can manage that well). Would it be possible to take 15 credits for the rest of your semesters or to take 15 credits next semester and 3 credits during the summer?",

          "text": "The only reason I'm taking 18 credits is because 6 of those credits are meant to be easy As, another 3 credits maybe a little more work, and the 9 remaining credits are more of headache classes. I don't think it's that bad since I didn't enter the classes that are super difficult (I think) yet. All of this is assuming I take a summer class and the next summer I do an internship. I wouldn't rely on summer classes much since they don't offer everything all the time. Sometimes they don't even offer required classes in the fall/spring semesters and I wouldn't want to get caught without financial aid because I waited until last possible year and they don't offer the class that year, so I have to do it next semester, which is not covered (my scholarship is only 4 years, already used up 1.5)",

I don't even know if networking with college peers is important or not because we all compete for the same thing, maybe one day it will come in handy? If I graduate a semester early, I could start working faster and make a little more money, but why rush? Is the stress worth it? I want to socialize a little bit, but is a semester really that much of a difference? Who am I going to socialize with anyways, it's a commuter college and most of my classes will be in the evening.. A summer internship will happen either way... I can go back and forth like this forever I don't know what to do",
