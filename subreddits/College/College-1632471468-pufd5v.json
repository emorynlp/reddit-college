And he asked us to give our honest opinion about him continuing to make Simpsons from \"classic\" Simpsons because nobody seemed to get them. I told him I liked them and he told me I don't count because we had a very similar sense of humour lol. But his references are still my go-to Simpsons references (Season 3\u20139) and now that they are on Season 32, most of my students weren't even BORN when those seasons first aired. I wake up some mornings and feel so very out of touch.\n\nBut I will think about including a little more humour to spice up my often very dry lectures :D",
