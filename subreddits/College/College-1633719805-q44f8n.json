  "text": "Hi, I am a freshman currently enrolled at community college. I read somewhere that a college freshman should have about 18 credits by the end of the year transitioning into their sophomore. Right now, I am at the pace to finish off with 28 credits. I plan on transferring to a university sometime in the future. Is this a bad thing or good thing? I\u2019m taking advantage of having free college, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m taking a ton of classes. I just wasn\u2019t sure on where to even ask and I stumbled upon this group.",

You generally want to have half the credits required to graduate by the end of freshman year if you want to get your Associates within the traditional two years.",

I\u2019m really doing well and almost was wondering if I should take more since it\u2019s been really easy for me. I just wasn\u2019t sure if getting a bunch of credits would be smart since I am only a freshman. I almost wonder if I can finish 2 years worth of credits this year and be able to graduate early. I just don\u2019t understand how this college stuff works, both my parents didn\u2019t finish college",
