  "title:": "PSA: Saying \"I'm going to watch this lecture recording later\" is probably the worst lie you'll tell yourself",
  "text": "Speaking from the experience of a semester of online classes; it'll start out as \"I'll watch them tonight\", then move onto \"I'll catch up on these eventually\" and it'll end with you \"catching up\" on 15 lectures the night before a midterm.\n\nThe semester's (hopefully) still young for you so thought I'd put this out there: online classes can be tricky, make sure you're making good decisions.\n\n(Think this could help out students do better in what is obviously a difficult time for everyone! Posted this in a couple of college subs, hopefully it can be helpful to people here too!)",

Try to make them around the same times everyday to maintain consistency. Then look at your schedule and try working in set times everyday to do classwork/study. I prefer to alternate days between lecture and work days so I engage with the material everyday and don\u2019t get overloaded/bored with one subject. Then, cruise through your syllabuses and try to throw due dates into your calendar ideally 24 hrs before the actual due date to give yourself wiggle room. Hope this helps!",

One habit, responding to your phone. You can help build this habit by adding silly/dummy tasks like get a drink of water or do 5 jumping jacks, as long as you *don't ignore the alert no matter what.* This makes it easier to follow the alert when it's something you don't really want to do.\n\nIf you use a paper calendar, your habit is checking that calendar every time you are bored, your mind wanders, or you are thinking \"what's next.\"\n\nIt is much easier to change your lifestyle this way than trying to teach yourself \"every morning I watch my lecture, every evening I work my problem sets. MWF I do this class, TR I do these...\" because you are splitting it into a hundred new tasks to learn.",
