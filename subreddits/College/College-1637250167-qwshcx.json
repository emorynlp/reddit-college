  "text": "Ngl I\u2019ve skipped my history class for a month and 1/2. The syllabus mentioned nothing about mandatory attendance and I do all the assignments online. She emailed me today saying she\u2019s noticed I haven\u2019t been in class\n\nAm I fucked?\n\nShit she told me attendance was mandatory but she makes exceptions sometimes. Crap crap crap\n\nEdit: Emailed her about my situation and she said she understands and now we\u2019re having a zoom meeting later about our final project. God bless her soul",

I\u2019ve had professors reach out out of concern before, so it very well could be that. The way I see it is that I\u2019m paying to be here/have the experience, therefore, I should get to choose if I\u2019m in class or not. Then, if I get shitty grades I have no one to blame but myself. But that usually doesn\u2019t happen (thankfully) and if you\u2019re on top of everything, I\u2019d venture to say that you\u2019re not fucked.",

She is free to ask you to attend the future lectures, but no weight is on you to explain prior absences if there is no mandatory attendence policy.\n\nShe gave out a syllabus and you agreed to it by continuing to fulfill the expectations of said syllabus. That's what this boils down to. Any action on her part would require her to break the syllabus without shared agreement. While it is not a legal document, it is professional to honor it.",
