At the end of this last semester I had a 2.27 and got put on academic probation. Basically, this has been a year-long lesson that I absolutely DO NOT function as a student with online-only classes. \n\nThis is the first time ever I've been on probation and it was a fucking kick to the stomach when I got that email, let me tell you. I decided it would be a good idea to sign up for summer courses because the state would cover all but $200 if I took two. I just finished my first one and I got an A! It's probably not a huge win to a lot of you guys, but to me it feels like I'm finally getting my groove back, that I'm proving to myself that I'm not really a shitty student like I've thought all year. So yeah! Next session starts in 2 weeks and I'm ready to go HAM on that one too :)\n\nEDIT: all of these lovely comments have given me the biggest smile I've had in a long time, I love you guys <3", "author": "sashathebrit", "created": 1624691224, "retrieved": 1632802720, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 638, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h35rpq6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o85vbn/after_a_really_shitty_year_i_got_an_a_in_my_first/h35rpq6/", "text": "Congratulations!!
