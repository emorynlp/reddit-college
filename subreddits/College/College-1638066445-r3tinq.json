  "title:": "Should I study computer science at ETH (top 10 college in the world and diamond league) or at another college called HSG (University of St.Gallen, less known in the world but known in Europe) because they will offer comp sci for the first time and I would be a 'pioneer'?",
  "text": "As a Swiss citizen there is no stress for choosing a college cause most of them will accept you. So my initial plan was to study comp sci at ETH. ETH is a well known top college in the world. If I go to ETH and studied comp sci I won't even have to care wether I would find a job or not. \n\nBut the thing is this; another college offers comp sci also. The only difference is that HSG is known in Europe for it's businesses majors etc but not for its comp sci courses. The reason is that they've never taught people comp sci. So in this fall they would start for the first time a comp sci class and I have the honor to be a 'pioneer' at this college. As I stated before, HSG is less known than ETH but still known in Europe. \n\nThe difference in those colleges are:\n\n* The size. Around 600-800 people enroll for comp sci at ETH. As for HSG the professors estimated that around 30 people will enroll for the comp sci class.\n* Study material. ETH focuses more on the theory and HSG on the applied material. Some professors would even call the comp sci course at ETH a math course.\n* Relationship between teacher and student. Since 600 people are in the auditorium of ETH it is not personal but imagine it with 30 people at HSG... The teachers are closer and it will feel like a big highschool class.\n\nI don't know what to do. Both are really cool things. What would you do? I have to mention that Swiss people don't pay a lot of tuition. SO each year at ETH is around 1200 Dollar and for HSG it is also 1200 Dollars.",
