  "text": " Hey guys, I plan on attending a Chiropractic college in the USA next year. I'll be an international student, with a student visa. I plan on just driving to the college.\n\nAre there any ~~blood clot injection~~ vaccine mandates for international students?\n\nI called a couple schools I've applied to, and at least the schools are against any ~~Stalin Maoist~~ mandates.\n\nLet me know please guys. Maybe there's someone else out there in my similar position.\n\nI'd appreciate just objective answers.",

I don't trust the injections at all, myself.",

Here's just a brief history of Pfizer for example:\n\n>Pfizer received the biggest fine in U.S. history as part of a $2.3 Billion plea deal with federal prosecutors for mis-promoting medicines (Bextra, Celebrex) and paying kickbacks to compliant doctors. Pfizer pleaded guilty to mis-branding the painkiller Bextra by promoting the drug for uses for which it was not approved.  \nIn the 1990s, Pfizer was involved in defective heart valves that lead to the deaths of more than 100 people. Pfizer had deliberately misled regulators about the hazards. The company agreed to pay $10.75 Million to settle justice department charges for misleading regulators.  \nPfizer paid more than $60 Million to settle a lawsuit over Rezulin, a diabetes medication that caused patients to die from acute liver failure.  \nIn the UK, Pfizer has been fined nearly \u20ac90 Million for overcharging the NHS, the National Health Service. Pfizxer charged the taxpayer an additional \u20ac48 Million per year for what should have cost \u20ac2 million per year.  \nPfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that it had bribed doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.  \nIn 2011, a jury found Pfizer committed racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug Neurontin. Pfizer agreed to pay $142.1 Million to settle the charges. Pfizer disclosed that it had paid nearly nearly 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals some $20 Million for speaking on Pfizer\u2019s behalf.  \nIn 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had reached a $45 Million settlement with Pfizer to resolve charges that its subsidiaries had bribed overseas doctors and other healthcare professionals to increase foreign sales.  \nPfizer was sued in a U.S. federal court for using Nigerian children as human guinea pigs, without the childrens\u2019 parents\u2019 consent. Pfizer paid $75 Million to settle in Nigerian court for using an experimental antibiotic, Trovan, on the children. The company paid an additional undisclosed amount in the U.S. to settle charges here. Pfizer had violated international law, including the Nuremberg Convention established after WWII, due to Nazi experiments on unwilling prisoners.  \nAmid widespread criticism of gouging poor countries for drugs, Pfizer pledged to give $50 million for an AIDS drug to South Africa. Later, however, Pfizer failed to honor that promise.\n\nWhat about now? Would you just trust them for the rest of your life, no matter what?",
