  "text": "My first semester of college was amazing. Partying almost every weekend, pregaming with all of my friends in the dorms and just having fun. I\u2019ve never been happier but that\u2019s until my 3 friends and roommates decided they wanted to rush this specific frat that were all chill with. I would love to rush too it\u2019s just my parents definitely won\u2019t let me and now I\u2019ll be excluded from everyone else. I\u2019ve already begun to feel left out these past couple weeks and now I feel it will get worse as now every weekend we won\u2019t be going to 3 different parties, pregaming together etc bc they will have their own shit to do in their fraternity that will sometimes be exclusive to only the brothers. (Such as mixtures, bonfires, etc). This kills me to think about since nothing will be the same and probably won\u2019t spend as much time together. Yea it\u2019ll be fun when their frat throws but this obviously won\u2019t be nothing like before.",

If you're not going to join the fraternity then join CS/Engineering clubs. Your roommates, if they get in, will probably be moving out anyways to live at the house. You'll meet new people, more programmers and it's a club you can actually put on your resume.",

Everyone is always focusing on the academics, you see people posting here about burnout and not having any friends. You are having the time of your life. Having the perfect grades is not worth it without friends in my opinion and this is the time in your life when you can be wild and party if you want to ( better now than when you are 30 with a family and a job). If you can show your parents that you can focus on studying while also having fun, I think they would accept it.",

Frats are design so you get closer with one another and go through \u201cbrotherhoods.\u201d Soon they will start talking about frat stuff and events that you might not understand and feel left out.

See if they wanna do anything that isn't frat shit.\n\n3. The big old 3. Haha. Situations like this are common in life, you lose friends or sometimes grow apart. If your attempts to stay close do not work then the suggestion is that you go and make more friends. Your world will not end without those guys, it may hurt but thats just the reality of this. They chose to focus on being frat bros, you're just going to have to deal with that. \n\n4. You're in your first semester. Take a chill pill with these parties before you cause yourself to crash and burn, college is only a time for frequent parties if you're dumb.\n\n5. Brace yourself. Especially with this covid shit. Shit gets fucked up from here on out.",
