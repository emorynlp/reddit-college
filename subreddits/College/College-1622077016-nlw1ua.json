  "text": "Still can't believe this is real, 8 years ago I had addiction problems and almost ruined my life.\n\nI left a career I absolutely hated last year and decided to bet on myself. As I'm now older and more mature/know what I want out of life.\n\nDon't need to describe where I was years ago, but let's say I never thought I'd be able to pull this off.\n\nTo anyone struggling or going through tough times, you can over come anything and find success.",
