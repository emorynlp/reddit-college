  "text": "I\u2019m only a month into my second year of college and I already hate it. I\u2019m over it, I\u2019m not interested in going to classes anymore or getting a degree. Last year all my classes were online and while I kinda grew away from it all, I thought it was just due to it being online. I was so excited my senior year of high school to go to college because I thought I needed a degree to become someone. I wanted to become a Special Education teacher, I was so excited and I had worked hard to get accepted into a decent college. Then everything went online, and it went downhill from there. I did ok the first semester of my first year, I was working full time and taking care of my classes. My second semester went terribly though, the stress of work and classes kinda got to me but overall I thought it was merely due to everything being online. I love actually being present for thing, I hate sitting in a lecture alone despite being in a class full of people. Now that I\u2019m here actually attending college in person, I\u2019ve realized that the feelings are still the same. I don\u2019t enjoy it and I really don\u2019t care for college but I\u2019m terrified about how my family will react. My parents want my siblings and I to build a better future for ourselves by going on college but is it really worth it if you don\u2019t care about it?",

      "text": "I went through the same thing dang I wish I was able to stay and learn more honestly I loved it so much. Maybe you can take some time off and take a baby vacation. Someone told me to look for the job you want on line and see what the qualifications were and use that as what you should take in order to ensure you get the job you wanted. As for special education I think that\u2019s awesome! I feel like I\u2019m going to have to take a nap though guys so I\u2019ll be here again soon. Hope it all works out for you. And if all else fails just have a good time frame for your next time frame to work on what you need from life. I think some guy names Maslow did a thing called the hierarchy of needs it\u2019s pretty good reads",

      "text": "I\u2019ve gone through this plenty of times I find it best to take interesting classes. It makes it fun. If your going into special education try psychology courses. I currently am a student and work at the children\u2019s psych hospital. I deal with many kids that have special needs and I am only getting a psychology degree. There\u2019s ways to make college fun, you just have to find it.",
