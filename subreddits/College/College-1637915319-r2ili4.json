  "text": " I recently moved to a university over 1000 kilometers from home.  However, I cannot adjust to this place. I am lonely all the time and  have barely any friends. Everyone made friends online while I did not. I  cannot communicate well, I keep fumbling and mis-speaking all the time.  There are no activities I am interested in that I can do here.  Everyone else here seems to be having fun. I don't know what to do. Please help.",

He told me to put away all technology/social media away for a day and see if that makes a difference, AND IT FUCKING DID. Basically he said that it happens when there\u2019s too much on your mind and you try to speak and just run over some words.\n\nSpecifically social media sites like Reddit, Instagram, and Tik Tok where you just mindlessly scroll till the end of times.",
