  "text": "Hi, I'm currently a junior thinking of changing my major from medical laboratory science to CS, and want to know more about Computer science. I don't think I'll see my self pursuing as a medial laboratories for life, and I know that I'll have to change my career even after working in the lab. I NEED some opinions on what I should do, stick to medical laboratory or is it too late for me to change my major now?? What does the courses loads like? Does it too late for someone like me? Will an extra year in school affect my ability to find an intership/job? Has anyone able to find jobs right after graduation? And what does the job outlooks for Minnesota look like? Thank you.",
