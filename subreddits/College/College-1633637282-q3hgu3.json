I tried to change my major to psychology but they told me I didn't have enough GPA. I almost joined the marine corps last year but decided not to after I was enlisted because I felt like I made a mistake. What are my options?",

If I\u2019m feeling like I need a break I pick everything up and move somewhere else (like a literal different building). \nI do a bunch of other little things like that but that can get you started. Just gotta figure out what works best for you and what doesn\u2019t, and don\u2019t be afraid to try new things",
