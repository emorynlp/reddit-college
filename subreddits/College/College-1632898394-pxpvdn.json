  "text": "i share a bedroom with someone who makes these very weird very loud and very gross mouth noises in their sleep so i either have to go to sleep before they do or if i wake up in the middle of the night i have to put on headphones and drown it out so i can go back to sleep. as far as i know they\u2019re not aware of this (either that or they don\u2019t think im aware of it.)\n\nthey\u2019ve also started snoring and i have an extra pillow that i was thinking of offering them so they can properly breathe in their sleep (they don\u2019t have any pillows on their bed)\n\ni was wondering how to bring this up or if i even should? im not trying to be mean or make them feel bad i just want to sleep easier at night.",
