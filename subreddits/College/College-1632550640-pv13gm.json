What does this make me?", "text": "CS major in my senior year.\n\nMy TA and teacher are pretty useless/purposely unhelpful in helping us figure out these labs, and I know practically noone to work with as I transferred from a community college in Spring 2020, when Covid happened. This is my first semester back in person since then.\n\nIve been experiencing bad anxiety and depression this semester. To ease my anxiety, my dad will guide me through the labs, helping when I'm really stuck.\n\nI am struggling with this. I feel bad that I have a resource others don't, but I genuinely don't know what else to do. Most students I've encountered don't seem really helpful out of a fear of academic misconduct(which I'm not saying is invalid).\n\n How much of a fake/imposter does this make me?", "author": "Steven0710", "created": 1632550640, "retrieved": 1632800345, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"he8c0j3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv13gm/i_ask_my_dad_for_help_with_homework_what_does/he8c0j3/", "text": "My husband helps me with my homework it\u2019s like going to tutoring.
