      "text": "Requirements differ between schools, but usually you\u2019ll need a minimum membership, and an Executive board.\n\nYour E-board will definitely need a President and Treasurer, and often it\u2019s recommended to have a Vice President and secretary. That\u2019s your core. You can add other club specific officers as needed.\n\nOften times a weekly general meeting will be the start of activities. Do yourself a favor and make it more than informational. Make it interactive and something the members will enjoy attending. I\u2019ve seen too many clubs use their weekly meeting as advertising for volunteer events and no one goes.\n\nSpeaking of volunteer events, see what other charitable clubs/activities your club can volunteer to support. It helps build community.\n\nAdvertise according to your university policy so you don\u2019t have flyers taken down, but put them where you think potential members would be. So around comp sci classrooms for example.\n\nAlso ask your school, they love Student orgs and there\u2019s almost always a department dedicated to supporting and guiding them. They\u2019ll be able to give you specific advice for your school.",
