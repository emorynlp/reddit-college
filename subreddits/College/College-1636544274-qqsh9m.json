  "text": "im so depressed and i feel like im falling deeper and deeper into depression every day. you really cant enjoy college without friends honestly. im in my third year and sadly i had to spend my second year at home because of covid. i made friends in my first year when i was on campus, but i remember even then i was soooo lonely. now in my third year it's even more lonely and awkward when i bump into the friends i made in my first year cuz we havent spoken since our first years. \n\ni have friends that came to my uni who were kinda close to me at home but im so jealous of them because they have all these friends and theyre always out partying and having fun and they never think to invite me or anything. i know theyre not obligated to invite me to their own things but i wish they didnt have to rub it all in my face. i wish they would just ask to hang out with me. or even just check up on me because sometimes i'll make a post joking about how lonely i am and they never really text me. again, i know theyre not obligated to but god i wish they would. ive never gotten the \"college experience\" just the stressing and homework and work part. but yeah. it is so lonely in college.",

      "text": "Have you ever tried being the one to reach out to them? Or maybe joining a club? It\u2019s hard, but putting yourself out there as often as you can and being vulnerable instead of scared can really make a world of difference. There is a countless number of times I just said nice comments or attempted to start a conversation and it failed, mostly because I\u2019m just a socially awkward person, but sometimes it worked! Just attempting to maintain those little conversations and checking in with people, not being afraid to reach out and talk first, I have my little group of amazing friends.",

      "text": "Taht is the college experience my friend there are always 2 sides of the story while movies show that cool college experience not very many college people actually live like that it\u2019s more the recluses type but I fully agree college is ROUGH without friends but just if your \u201cfriends\u201d won\u2019t invite you out then jsut go out go to places like the bars and event areas attend college events like sports games and all taht other shit bc just being there eventually people will start talking to you and you can socialize and make friends that way not every event will yield rewards  and after some you might even feel awkward and sad but just keep trying bc not doing anything actively for yourself to fix the issue of why you are so down isn\u2019t gonna magically fix your loneliness. I feel ya as a lonely college kid too shits rough",

      "text": "Yeah I get that feeling. I spent last semester mostly in my room, and sleeping til 3pm. It was horrible. Certain people might just say get a life lol, but they don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s hard to start from ground zero \n\nWhat sucks is how slowly it\u2019ll take for your situation to likely change. I\u2019ve still only got a partial social life now. But, through taking some active steps, I\u2019ve at least seen reasonable improvment\n\nAlso trying going to a party alone. Daunting, I know. But if you can get past the first 40 mins standing in the corner, you\u2019ll find inevitably it\u2019s quite easy to reach out and talk to people and have a good time. Or at least dance your heart out",

Turns out, im different from those type of people that can turn that life into that direction where that \u201ccollege experience\u201d scene is at. I have no friends currently in college they are all at others colleges or back home and you know what it doesn\u2019t matter to me. My life is on a different course than other people they don\u2019t have to be the same we are all different, for what reason should I be sad about my life just because it happens to differ from others\u2019? I look at it like I shouldn\u2019t try and make my college life out to be something it isn\u2019t and aspire to achieve the stereotypical college experience, that is a goal for other people, not one I ever set for myself and so I stopped being depressed about it. Now im senior and this is my last semester.",
