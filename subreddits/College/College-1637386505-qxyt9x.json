      "text": "i\u2019ve had a few 6-9 and 5:30-8:30 classes (physic and ochem labs, and english); it sucks when you\u2019re heading there and know you\u2019re going to be there the rest of your evening and it\u2019s definitely a struggle to get yourself motivated to go especially if you\u2019ve already had classes that day. that being said, the energy in them is often super good \u2014 everyone from you to the prof is in the same boat, nobody really wants to be there, and everyone tends to get a little bit nihilistic, chaotic, and in that \u201cidgaf\u201d mentality. so as much as i hated going to them, the actual class can actually be a good time.",
