      "text": "I'm a junior and usually recieve the same grade for my first set of exams. Dont sweat it. Now that you know what the exam format is like as well as what your professors are looking for, you can switch up your study routine to better prepare for the exams. I usually end up with Bs after the first round. Also, previous advice is great. Find ways to study more effectively and calm your nerves before exams if you have test anxiety.",

      "text": "Do you mean for your regular courses? \n\nI know my school has people you can sit with and they\u2019ll give you tips on how to take tests, how to study, time management etc. You could ask your academic advisor if your school has anything like this, or where you could look to learn these skills. \n\nGoogle and YouTube also have resources for studying, note-taking etc. If you don\u2019t have a planner (either physically or on your phone) this is a really good place to start. \n\nI would also recommend reaching out to each of your teachers and asking them if there are any tips for taking their tests in particular.",
