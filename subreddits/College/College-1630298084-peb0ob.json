Nobody cares. Whether you're worried about looking ridiculous on zoom, wondering what you should wear, curious about how to make friends, or not sure how to handle a social situation -  remember that nobody cares.\n\nAnd by this I don't mean that nobody cares *about you*. In college you will make life long friends who will be there for you through thick and thin. What I mean is that nobody cares how you act, what you wear, or what hobbies you have. This is the first time in a lot of people's lives that they get to reinvent themselves away from the pressure of their hometown or old toxic relationships. \n\nDo your best to remember that everybody else is trying to find themselves just like you are.\n\nI work with a lot of first-year students and they always ask me what piece of advice I would give to a first year. And the answer is always \"Nobody cares\". Don't be too hard on yourself because everybody is watching themselves way harder than they are watching you.", "author": "Pm_Me_For_SomeAdvice", "created": 1630298084, "retrieved": 1632802693, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 684, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hb10la9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/peb0ob/an_answer_to_90_percent_of_the_questions_on_this/hb10la9/", "text": "I disagree  \nSome people out here care about strangers we do not even know!  \nEspecially when it comes to academic grades.

I've loved my first and second years more in retrospect because I look back on them and realize that the culture shock associated with university and becoming an adult (increasingly synonymous in North American culture as more folks go to post-secondary) was a huge step to becoming what I am now. I have no idea what I would be like now if I didn't push myself outside my comfort zone and intellectually, to challenge myself with new ideas and different personalities/groups.\n\nTry to enjoy yourselves everyone.
