  "title:": "An answer to 90% percent of the questions on this subreddit: \"Nobody Cares.\"",
  "text": "So I browse the subreddit pretty often and I have come to the conclusion that 99% of questions or posts on this sub asking for advice can be answered with the following words. Nobody cares. Whether you're worried about looking ridiculous on zoom, wondering what you should wear, curious about how to make friends, or not sure how to handle a social situation -  remember that nobody cares.\n\nAnd by this I don't mean that nobody cares *about you*. In college you will make life long friends who will be there for you through thick and thin. What I mean is that nobody cares how you act, what you wear, or what hobbies you have. This is the first time in a lot of people's lives that they get to reinvent themselves away from the pressure of their hometown or old toxic relationships. \n\nDo your best to remember that everybody else is trying to find themselves just like you are.\n\nI work with a lot of first-year students and they always ask me what piece of advice I would give to a first year. And the answer is always \"Nobody cares\". Don't be too hard on yourself because everybody is watching themselves way harder than they are watching you.",

The point is that if you don\u2019t start becoming an adult when you\u2019re in college and blocking out these people from your life, you\u2019re going to be the kind of person who is negatively impacted by that kind of behavior when you\u2019re in your twenties or forever.",

But as long as you're open to new things and new people, it'll happen.\n\nIt's great. I've loved my first and second years more in retrospect because I look back on them and realize that the culture shock associated with university and becoming an adult (increasingly synonymous in North American culture as more folks go to post-secondary) was a huge step to becoming what I am now. I have no idea what I would be like now if I didn't push myself outside my comfort zone and intellectually, to challenge myself with new ideas and different personalities/groups.\n\nTry to enjoy yourselves everyone. I know it's going to be rocky, but I love teaching first years because it brings me back a little bit to that time, and to help them get through this difficult patch is one of the joys of my job.
