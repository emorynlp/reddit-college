  "title:": "Should I transfer to get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d?",
  "text": "I\u2019m 22 and currently have 2 semesters left after this one to graduate. I\u2019m a commuter student because I\u2019ve gotten a free ride to the state school I attend so far, so I haven\u2019t had to pay any tuition at all. I\u2019m pretty dedicated to my studies and have been able to keep up a 4.0 GPA so far, but I feel like my while entire experience in college so far has been soul-crushing.\n\nI\u2019ve never had the traditional college experience of dorming, partying, & meeting lots of new people. My school is really small & there are barely any events that go on (it also has zero party scene). I already regret not going to a big out-of-state party school straight out of high school. I\u2019m not going to lie, being a commuter student 25 mins away from home really sucks.\n\nI have to say that while being a commuter student tho, I\u2019ve been able to work & have saved up almost $30k. The school that I want to transfer to is around that same amount a year for tuition. \n\nDo you think it would be a wise decision to transfer to this bigger party school that has around 50k students? I\u2019ve been accepted to already but I didn\u2019t go this fall because I was afraid of getting into debt. There\u2019s also the possibility that they won\u2019t transfer all of my credits in, forcing me to delay graduation. I don\u2019t wanna regret wasting my youth with a boring life so I wanna know your thoughts on the matter.",

      "text": "No, this makes no sense especially at this point in your academic career. You have no debt, made good financial decisions thus far and are ahead of most students with $30k saved up. Use that to travel or put a down payment on a house/apartment. Plus it\u2019ll be a real pain in the butt if they don\u2019t transfer all your credits. Don\u2019t mess that all up for two semesters of a \u201ccollege experience\u201d As a fellow commuter, I understand where you\u2019re coming from but, ultimately, college is for studying and as the other redditor said, fun doesnt end here.",

If you want to go party I suggest going to clubs/bars in your nearest big city. You could also join a very close relationship club at your school or form your own! I think the most fun is when you are traveling with your friends. Use the money you saved to travel, invest, maybe even start up some thing.",

      "text": "This is one of the more crazy things I\u2019ve read on this sub. You want to throw away 30k so you can party at college? Which will also mean your GPA will probably slip as well. College isn\u2019t about partying. It sounds super immature tbh. You have a chance at a fully paid school experience that others would kill for, and you wanna transfer and dump money into another school so you can party. You also said it might delay your graduation if the credits don\u2019t all transfer. Why would you ever delay graduating for partying? You can make friends at your current school and party with them. There\u2019s also no guarantee that moving to a new school will mean you get to party all the time. Use that nice nest egg you saved up for something awesome. I think you will highly regret throwing away all that money to school when you didn\u2019t have to, just to be able to party. Just my opinion.",
