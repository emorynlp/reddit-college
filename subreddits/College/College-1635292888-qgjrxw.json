  "title:": "Should I transfer to get the \u201ccollege experience\u201d?",
  "text": "I\u2019m 22 and currently have 2 semesters left after this one to graduate. I\u2019m a commuter student because I\u2019ve gotten a free ride to the state school I attend so far, so I haven\u2019t had to pay any tuition at all. I\u2019m pretty dedicated to my studies and have been able to keep up a 4.0 GPA so far, but I feel like my while entire experience in college so far has been soul-crushing.\n\nI\u2019ve never had the traditional college experience of dorming, partying, & meeting lots of new people. My school is really small & there are barely any events that go on (it also has zero party scene). I already regret not going to a big out-of-state party school straight out of high school. I\u2019m not going to lie, being a commuter student 25 mins away from home really sucks.\n\nI have to say that while being a commuter student tho, I\u2019ve been able to work & have saved up almost $30k. The school that I want to transfer to is around that same amount a year for tuition. \n\nDo you think it would be a wise decision to transfer to this bigger party school that has around 50k students? I\u2019ve been accepted to already but I didn\u2019t go this fall because I was afraid of getting into debt. There\u2019s also the possibility that they won\u2019t transfer all of my credits in, forcing me to delay graduation. I don\u2019t wanna regret wasting my youth with a boring life so I wanna know your thoughts on the matter.",

You\u2019re right, that wouldn\u2019t be comparable because it would be vastly superior in terms of long-term value to you, your growth as a person, life experiences etc. \n\nIf I could trade one or pick which one I would put my resources and focus on, it would be Europe 100%. With how much you\u2019ve saved\u2026try and get an internship over there for six months or something epic. Take three months and travel. Have no plan, just go with the flow as you meet people! You have the money, no need to stress! You clearly planned well and worked your ass off for a gift which so few people have after college: emerging debt-free, cash in the bank, with very little need to go straight to the grindstone for the next 30 years. Freaking epic. \n\nCall me a cynic, but half the hardcore party scene is just children trying to be independent and feel \u201cadult\u201d or live a life they saw on TV while still having their parents pay for everything lol. By senior year a lot of that has quieted down as people take on more real responsibility \u2014 not to say some don\u2019t hit the house parties three nights a week, but for many that culture is tapering off!",

College isn\u2019t about partying. It sounds super immature tbh. You have a chance at a fully paid school experience that others would kill for, and you wanna transfer and dump money into another school so you can party. You also said it might delay your graduation if the credits don\u2019t all transfer. Why would you ever delay graduating for partying? You can make friends at your current school and party with them. There\u2019s also no guarantee that moving to a new school will mean you get to party all the time. Use that nice nest egg you saved up for something awesome. I think you will highly regret throwing away all that money to school when you didn\u2019t have to, just to be able to party. Just my opinion.",

A good college experience really depends upon the individual student, not the school one attends.  For me, it involved a good group of socially conservative friends, participating in a sport and a few other activities, and enjoying learning.  That's hardly the kind of wild party scene many imagine as being the college experience.\n\nYou do have more of a college experience challenge as a commuting student.  Be sure you don't leave campus right after your last class of the day.  Show up on weekends as well.  Attend college events, whether athletic, cultural, or academic.  Join some activities and meet some of the resident students.  You can also get together with classmates for informal study groups at the student uniion, or an exercise/basketball/racquetball session at the gym.",

If you are worried about any other \"experience,\" you are probably chasing the \"highschool experience.\" I keep saying this: Don't waste your money on college if your goal is anything but personal and  intellectual growth. If you like to party, some of the best parties ever are waiting for you after college if you still care by then, and if you have half a brain (which it sounds like you do) they will be free. They also won't be filled with a bunch of kids having their first beer lol.\n\nFor some anecdotal experience: No college party will ever come close to the partying I did backpacking through South America (which was not even remotely the coolest part of traveling for me, and I barely partied at all in Europe) or the parties I threw myself because I had a house and could do that. I don't get drunk anymore, and haven't since I was 21 as I'd had my fill of partying by then, but I still go to gatherings that I'd rather be at than any college party.

If anything... Graduating opens up the doors to much more fun and enjoyment than you think, you got a great thing going for you in college right now, don't take a chance of ruining it just a little fun.\n\nIn a few years you might be thinking back to your college days and regretting the lack of fun it had, but you can always make up for it for the low cost of 0 US dollars, but if you don't end up transferring and things don't work out as well as you thought what will happen then, even if the social life of that college is booming it doesn't mean that you're going to be apart of it, you have no idea what's in stock for you and neither do it.\n\nOP, you have no idea who I am, so there's no need for you to listen to anything that I said (wrote), I'm only writing all of this in hopes that I was helpful, if you check my account you'll see that I don't usually comment on anything let alone something this big, I just don't want you to make a mistake that you will regret later in life, having a 4.0 GPA is amazing, that's something I could only dream of achieving, but regardless of which phase in life that you are at, there will always be an opportunity to have fun and enjoy your life, all you need to do is play your cards right and set your priorities straight.\n\nI'm not really used to writing such an essay so excuse my vocabulary and grammar if it's not perfect, if I messed up on something regarding the way people usually comment on reddit tell me please.

I\u2019m a sophomore and I\u2019ve only really made 1 good friend since this pandemic ruined the whole making friends thing. Since you\u2019re a transfer, it would also be a little more difficult to meet people since everyone has their friend groups and is settled in. I would stay where you are because college is expensive and not worth going into debt just to live in a dorm and party.",

Smaller schools tend to be cheaper with greek life too- it costs me $300/semester.\n\nEdit: I also thought this school had nothing going on but tbh all the events are run by greek life. Majority of the students in the school commute so anyone not in greek life rarely spends time on campus. Going greek is the easiest way (and probably much cheaper in your case) to be more social in college.",

I honestly can say once I gave up trying to gave the college experience I was happier and I am doing a lot better mentally. Colleges want you to live in their dorms so you can owe them more. They want you to attend all of the events so you feel like you owe them something. Most of the events that my college throws are them trying to give away cheap items and are only for dorm students anyways. Parties are overrated and can be an excuse for teens to drink and get into way more trouble than necessary. \n\nMy best advice is find a group of friends, if you don't have one already, and socialize with them. My group plays table top games and video games together and guess what that is the best \"college experience\" I've had. College isn't meant to be people acting stupid, it's people transitioning into the workforce by gaining the necessary skills and knowledge they need and most people forget that.",

It really seems like you have already picken up good traits of a mature adult and are focused on the right stuff. I'm not sure how impactful doing the final year on campus would be to you.\n\nGoing abroad yourself seems like a much better option. $10k will last you 4-6 months and get you through a lot of very different cultural places. Stay at hostels. Europe through Central and East Asia is a good route for a few months.",

Ideally the cheapest is best. \n\nOne of my biggest regrets was not doing enough club activities or internships. For many people, college is the best time of their entire life. You make the most friends, meet the most people, have the most opportunities. You legit CAN'T get this outside of college.\n\nIf you absolutely want to experience this, you can also consider saving some money by working and going to school after, but you'll be older than most people.\n\nReddit here loves to shit on colleges (often for a good reason) but I guarantee you after university, that chance to be young and free of responsibilities, while making friends and joining clubs is literally irreplaceable for many people. \n\nIf it's worth it to you, do it! Just choose a place that lets you in for cheaper than 30k. \n\nIf you want to be top of your field, choosing ivy league also helps.",

Participate in as many school activities as possible, continue working part time, and travel to friend's colleges to sleep over and have fun. Do you really want to be in debt up to your neck over some lame ass parties? If you need to transfer to a different school with more activities to do then so be it, but avoid debt at all costs. Focus on your studies, participate in school activities, and then laugh at all your friends who are $120K in debt while you're debt free (or only like $30K in debt).",

You seem to be doing great, academically and economically, which is awesome; many people wish they would be in your shoes in regards to those two things.\n\nI intentionally did not go to a party school, because that would be a lot going on, but that\u2019s just me. \n\nIf you want to enjoy your time more socially and improve your experience, try going to clubs, hanging out in your lounges, going to events, etc.. Then, you\u2019ll hopefully meet new friends to go pubs with, get pizza with, etc.. \n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "While most people are saying it a a dumb idea to transfer for the sole reason of wanting a college experience (partying), I\u2019ll come at it from a different angle. You are in fact on Reddit and nobody here actually believe that the college experience is worth it.  The ones saying it doesn\u2019t matter say that because they don\u2019t have it. So I get where you\u2019re coming from and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stupid that want to transfer for that reason. I\u2019m a student at a big state school who parties usually 3 times a week while balancing a rigorous degree. The two can coexist despite what people will tell you. However, my issue with your situation is more than you\u2019re transferring for your last year and it may be difficult to meet people that you\u2019ll have lasting relationships with at this point. Which to me, if you cant do that, just doesn\u2019t make it worth it. Sure you\u2019d go out and party and meet people at the bars and things like that but everyone\u2019s kind of at the end of college in your situation and just aren\u2019t looking to meet new people to have last relationships with. Like someone else said, I think it\u2019d be more worth it for you to save your money and travel or something like that. Sure maybe you\u2019ll regret not having that college experience. So then maybe do something that everyone else could regret. Travel or do something crazy with your money. That\u2019s something I probably won\u2019t be able to do due to my spending habits throughout college. Just my two cents hopefully from a different angle",
