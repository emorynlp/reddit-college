  "title:": "I'm rotting away alone and feel cheated out of a college experience",
  "text": "I'm an international student sophomore that worked really hard in high school to get a full scholarship in a college outside my home country. Since covid I've been stuck back in my home country where the virus has forced me into pretty much house arrest for >6 months now, with online classes for almost two semesters so far. I feel like I'm being cheated out of an experience I had worked so hard to get to. I had realistic expectations coming into college, but now it's just like Coursera or any other online course.... No human interaction, no capacity to make new friends, try new things, actually have a social life, have time for stable relationships, or do anything. I just want to give up. I have no friends here and have been completely alone and isolated for so long now with literally no one to talk to outside of more zoom meetings that feel so fucking impersonal. Why did I bother working so hard? I literally don't have a single pleasant school or childhood memory because it was all spent working to get out of that horrible system. I never got too close to people or tried new experiences, just worked my ass off. By the time I graduate I'll be as alone as I was in high school, but at least then I could tell myself that it would be worth it for a good college experience. What do I have to look forward to now? Just grind myself out of a middle class until I die?",

Vaccine delivery and widespread immunisation is a multi-year process, and this could really just be the start. Don't mean to be a downer though, yeah I'm keeping myself busy otherwise. I'm glad you were able to prioritise your own well being.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in my final year and can understand this. I\u2019ve gotten the initial college experience but half of my degree will be online. I\u2019ve already made so many connections and relationships along the way but since online classes they seem so far away like a distant memory. \n\nI think students, particularly new students, are missing out a lot and don\u2019t mean just the fun and friends. You\u2019re also missing out on learning experience. Online classes can\u2019t replicate a classroom, not even by 10%. In a classroom you can ideas from various perspectives and point of views regarding each topic. This can\u2019t be done in online classes. In addition you can learn a lot from the people you meet every walk of life, and even make connections which may help you get recommendations in the future positions which will enhance your learning. You can learn to interact with people in a work environment as well, at least college helped me break the bubble from being introverted to becoming more confident and applying myself helping me prepare for the demand in the workplace.\nThanks to online classes none of this is possible. It\u2019s harming development of many students I feel. For me at least I\u2019m glad I can continue my education.",

I was also a transfer student so I already knew nobody.

      "text": "I understand what you are going through but you need to splash some water on your face and snap out of it.  It really sucks, the circumstances are not ideal and worst of all we didnt want this but this is far out of your control. If you waste your time thinking about the failures of what you cannot control then you will suffer long before you even have to do anything. You should try making or joining discord channels for each of your classes and groups and make networking and relationships that way. You have to take responsibility for what is under your control. You have social media and many apps to meet others and it takes a lot of effort but the ball is in your court in that regard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe isolation is definitley draining so I would sugguest to be intentional with your time. I go on walks every day just to get some fresh air and not trap mysel fin the box that is my room. I turn off all negative things like politics, news, toxic people. Yes, you worked hard and now it really is unfortunate that you cannot experince that college setting but rememeber that it is temporary and this too will pass. If you want I can invite you to my servers and we can always chat up and support each other. You are not alone. Many students are feeling what you are feeling but sitting there and feeling sorry for yourself wont make your experince any better. Take this time to explore skills that you didnt have time for or read books you couldnt do before. Find ways to shift your attentio away from the fact that you are in your house most of the day. While the whole thing really freaking sucks and is awful..thinking fatalistically and nihilistically about your future is like digging your own grave and shooting yourself while youre in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDont lose sight of the long term goal. You didnt just work so hard everyday because you can \"experince\" college. You worked hard to make something of your life, to perhaps escape poverty, to maybe be the first with a degree in your family, to perhaps pursuse what you have a passion and interest in. You worked hard so that your future could be bright and rewarding and so that you dont have to worry about an unstable prospect of being poor or losing your financial well being. You worked hard because its in your mindset to give it your best. Nothing is ever wasted unless we stop nurturing the idea and stop watering our hopes. Do some basic exercises in your room, learn new skills, join a discord server, play some video games, chat with friends..do anything expect feeling pity for yourself.\n\nThis is the time to remain strong and stubborn. This is the time all those days you were in the library being stubborn and not giving up...telling yourself \"I will make it\"...this is the time to use that anger, that passion, that drive to keep yourself alive. This pandemic will test you like no other and you will break and feel like giving up sometimes but...when you fall get back up and tell life to go fuck itself because you will come out of this mess...a better person, more skilled, more adaptable, more flexible, and with a clear goal. Dont give in just because things didnt go as you expected because I gurantee you that in your future life...nothing will ever go as you expect it and you MUST be flexible and willing to keep a positive outlook or else you will drown yourself in your own thoughts. Do what you can and dont worry about what is out of your control. In the long term the \"college experience,\" wont change your life in any profound way. You are going to college to get a degree and dont ever forget that. Yes it sucks...I really feel for you..but trust me..You need to stop overthinking and overburdening your mind.",

I've networked with professors, done so many projects, made myself competitive for summer Internships, so many things.\n\nBut it's all felt like a constant reminder of how alone I really am. So many people have reached out to me for help with their projects, make me a website, build my app, etc but no one cares about me personally. I've become more and more affirmed that my only worth in everyone's eyes is my economic worth.\n\nI've reached out. To my old acquintances here to meet up or talk to, to my college friends scattered the world over to try to just hang out or chat or play video games, and there are a few college friends that I feel somewhat close to, but it feels one sided, and in the end no one really responds or cares most of the time. College friends have people back home, I don't. People I thought were at least friends in my first year of college outright ignoring me. It's always me putting the effort, no one ever asks me to do anything or invites me for anything. And fuck me if I haven't been trying for 6 months now to reach out and just feel alive. Hell my own family doesn't even involve me or invite me to things because they think it'll just disturb my work, and they've never cared how I'm feeling. I prefer it that way but I hate that I can never rely on them for any emotional support. I'm trying so hard and nothing sticks and I want to give up. All I do is oscillate between burying myself in my work and not, even a five minute break and I'm reminded of how fucking tired I am of no one caring.",

Even though I mostly stay in my room, I've still had some really fun experiences with friends playing games or getting into other shenanigans online. Check if your school offers something similar, you might be able to find a cool group online, it's not too late! The nice thing too is in you will probably have a friend group in person to hang out with when this is all over.  \nIf you don't have people to talk with from your school, internet strangers can work too. Finding people on reddit or other discords for communities you're interested can help. I got a VR headset and there are a couple games where you can just chat with people or play social games like poker.  \nIt's rough socially for everyone out there but there are plenty of opportunities to meet people online if you go looking for them. If you ever need someone to talk to there are plenty of people in this thread you can reach out to, including me, who would be happy to have someone new to talk to.   \nI wish you good luck and keep your head up, this will be over eventually and we can all go back to enjoying a full in person life.",

      "text": "I totally get what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m also an International student sophomore and I too dont have any friends from high school. Here\u2019s a few things that helped me:\n1.In my country, we live in societies. I definitely started going down in my society park a lot more and just started interacting with people around me. Even if they\u2019re high school sophomores- you\u2019ll end up finding something to talk about if y\u2019all want interaction equally badly- and at this point, who doesn\u2019t? College truly taught me that age is just a number and with the right intentions, you\u2019ll be able to connect!\n2.I started having monthly gatherings with these people in my society. We go to one person\u2019s house each month and just play cards or dance or whatever. Since we\u2019re all quarantined in the building there arent any worries about the spread of covid\n3. With the weird class times due to the time difference, I\u2019ve created a routine around my new timings. I wake up kinda late (so that takes off hours off my day), and I do things that I enjoy doing in the day. I eventually start doing homework and before u know it, it\u2019s midnight and it\u2019s time to start classes!\n4. I know this isnt what you wanted. And I can totally understand you wanna get out of your current system. My suggestion would be to start looking for paid/unpaid (based on your preference) internship opportunities in USA for summer 2021. If it\u2019s paid, you could probably rent an apartment with someone else for a few months in the city that you\u2019re interning in, even if the internship is remote. USA is still relatively more open and by summer 2021, you\u2019ll still be able to explore atleast some part of the city with a mask on and the right precautions! The sheer size of USA as a country means that it is always more likely to be more open and explorable than USA- even if that means just going to the park or local cafe\u2019s in the city. If you get an unpaid internship and you have to work from home, I hope it motivates you and makes you hopeful enough that YOU will get out at some point, because if you do perform well the company will definitely give u a returning offer!! \nps- colleges will mostly start in fall 2021 and if things get better sooner due to the vaccines, go back and take summer classes and spend the summer in USA.\nI hope these help and I hope you get better soon! If you need someone to talk to, there are a bunch of free resources available online!! Take care and stay safe \ud83d\ude0a Sending positive vibes your way!!",

One of the ways I did that has been to swap contact info with others in the classes. I ended up making a friend and we text about the classes we have together and help each other out on assignments. And that's made all the difference in the classes I attend with them.\n\nEveryone's situation is different, but my advice is to try to reach out to other students in little ways like that. You may bond with some other lonely students. There are a lot of us right now!\n\nIf you weren't looking for advice though, just know that I feel you. It's rough right now dude :/",

Many students are placing a great risk on their education by banking on the fact that schools will reopen \u201ceventually\u201d for them to gain the \u201cexperience\u201d. There is no guaranteed date for that, and others are right when they say that some colleges have actually found a way to turn this situation into a financial advantage. \n\nThe multi-billion dollar company I work for just closed their offices permanently because they realized they could up the salaries of employees while saving on office costs. Nobody within that company is ever going to see the traditional \u201csocial experience\u201d again and the majority are fine with it as they\u2019ve adapted already. \n\nColleges will similarly continue to get tuition from students determined to get their degrees regardless of what it takes, and even when they do reopen, the \u201cexperience\u201d is likely to not be the same for years and years. My college just permanently ended some athletic programs due to pandemic costs. Those students will never see that student athlete social experience ever again, even when the college fully reopens. Large parties will be fined for long after. \n\nPostponing a degree with hopes of waiting out the \u201ctraditional experience\u201d to return is a huge risk. Everyone has taken a hit and is having to learn to adapt accordingly. Putting off learning how to adapt is likely to not end well, especially when more companies are looking to hire those with the ability to excel in their work both remotely and in person due to current circumstances. Putting off learning how to adapt in hopes that everything will be \u201cnormal\u201d after a sole gap year is, frankly, denial of the fact that there truly is a \u201cnew normal\u201d.",
