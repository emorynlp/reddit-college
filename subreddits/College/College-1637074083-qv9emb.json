  "text": "Does anyone else have issues with being approved for an amount by a private loan and then your college lowers it significantly with zero explanation? Last time I complained about it they said I\u2019m only allowed to borrow a certain amount but this amount only gives me a $700 refund for books. Does anyone else have this problem?? I literally can\u2019t survive if I don\u2019t get my full loan approval and I work 3 jobs already\u2026",
