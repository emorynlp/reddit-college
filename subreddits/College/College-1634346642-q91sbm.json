  "title:": "club president got mad at me for highlighting my role on LinkedIn instead of calling myself a \"general member\"",
  "text": "I'm apart of the events department at a club at my uni. our job is literally to plan and execute events, so when I was updating my LinkedIn I wrote my title as \"Event Coordinator\". the next day, the club president messages me on Slack AND LinkedIn, telling me that my title isn't event coordinator, it's 'general member' and to change it.\n\nI was kinda annoyed but I changed it. I casually mentioned it to my dad and he said that she's trying to minimize everyone else's contribution so she can look better, which I think makes a lot of sense. she literally messaged me in 2 places to change it and didn't even like my job update \ud83d\ude2d its like she's threatened by other ppl doing good or something??\n\nI really want to change it back, \"general member\" makes it sound like I just go to meetings and sit there, when in reality my job is to reach out to potential speakers, plan the logistics of events, promote the event online... which is literally coordinating an event, making me an event coordinator.\n\nwhat do u guys think?\n\nedit: i don't want to make it seem like i'm above anyone else/have a leadership role, cuz i am just a  member. however, i don't think \"general member\" is fair cuz it doesn't encompass everything that I do within my role. will changing it back to \"events coordinator\" make it sound like i'm trying to claim  a position I don't have?? i think literally everyone in the events department (\\~15 of us) should be considered an events coordinator, cuz we DO SO MUCH and \"general member' just doesn't cut it for me. idk.",

Then she does have a valid point, but that doesn't seem to be the case from your description).\n\n\nA good leader would want to leverage the value of letting you have free social media points, and use it to encourage your contributions. (But don't tell her that, lol)\n\n\"general member\" sounds odd to me, why not just \"member\"?\n\nJust for fun, take a look at your clubs bylaws, and see if any of this has anything about all this in writing. \n\nIn any case, proceed with caution. Keep your eye on the big picture and don't get pulled into her needless drama.",

They have that official title you don't - even if the specific language is slightly tweaked.\n\nIt's totally normal in a club for members to take on varying levels of responsibility. That doesn't make you more than a member, it just means that when you describe what you did as a member, you can include a lot more.\n\nWhat you DO in the club is more important than making up nice-sounding titles. I was once a member of a small club that by the end of my first year was falling apart (a lot of people graduating or transferring out all at once, and not a lot of new members to replace them) , only a few of us stuck around. I ended up being president on paper the next year, but I don't think we ever even met once. While technically I could have put that on my resume, I didn't because there was zero experience associated with my role as \"president\".",

For internal affairs you would be titled at the discretion of your manager or upper body management/stakeholders. It means very little aside from slighting the credit/recognition someone should actually have. In rhe real world pay and stuff is not affected by the title. You can be a manager receiving manager pay but be called a \"trainer\" or something similar that doesn't immediately indicate manager status. \n\nYour dad is right though the girl is being a bitch and I'd kindly explain that to her and print a job application for event coordinator that matches projects or events you've planned and how they are toe-in-toe, and ask her what she thinks at that point, and also ask if her head is in the right space to be making club-leader decisions if her mind is so clouded to the blatantly obvious",

I get the point of view of not wanting members to give themselves titles that are not in the bylaws. I see it in non-profits, where someone is asked to do a few things and now they are introducing themselves as appointees or with titles that aren't official. There is a lot of pressure in the resume and employment word to pad resumes and experience to make things sound a certain way. As a hiring manager, when I checked references, I would cold call a supervisor and ask \"what was their title and what did they do?\" What happens when someone calls her replacement and asks what duties event coordinators have and they reply \"we don't have those... there's a committee but it falls under...\" Generally, I accept that resumes are mostly made up fluff and jargon because that's what people are told to do. If you want to highlight yourself and your abilities, maybe create a digital portfolio with a page for titles, a page for awards, a page for activities, and then include albums with photos of you doing stuff. This way, you can provide more narrative and be interesting to prospective employers.",

      "text": "Honestly, this is a no-brainer.  She's just the president of some club.  She doesn't have any authority over you or your private social media accounts, and she certainly doesn't have any authority over your CV/resume.  Phrase your LinkedIn profile however you see fit and tell her to mind her own business.\n\nIf you think that \"events coordinator\" makes it seem like you're solely responsible for events and implicitly hides the fact that there are other staff members who do the same thing, then instead of writing \"events coordinator\" put something like \"events coordination staff.\"  That way it will be clear you're part of a team, but it will also be clear what you and the team are responsible for.",

You wouldn't inform her if you added some prize or new skill to your resume, so there's no need to inform her that you've updated your work/experience section either.\n\nStill, if you *want* to inform her, that's fine.  Just make sure you phrase things very directly and unequivocally so that it's clear that you're *informing* her of your decision and not asking for her permission.  You don't need her permission.  Not at all.  But if you want to inform her, something like this would be more than sufficient: \"Dear X, I have reconsidered your request to use 'general member' as my job/position title on my LinkedIn profile and have decided to change back to <whatever> after all.  As a member of the events coordination team, I perform work/dedicate time to the club that a general member does not.\"\nThat's it.  Don't include anything that would open the door for discussion or debate.  You're informing her of your decision, but whether she is ok with your decision is not your concern.  If she does write back trying to argue, do not engage, but simply respond with \"This matter is now closed.\"\n\nBut like I said, I don't think you actually owe her any response at all.",
