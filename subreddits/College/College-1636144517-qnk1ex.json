  "text": "My parents are assholes. They are forcing me to go back and forth on a four hour drive every weekend from college. It's too much for me and is a huge distraction but they don't give a fuck. They don't care about anything else but themselves. They are now trying to cut me off from the entire family just because I wanted to stay this weekend so I could study for a class I am very behind in. I don't want to waste time driving back and forth to be in such a toxic place where I can't even focus to study. I hate how controlling and evil they are.",
