  "text": "It is week 5, and I am sooo tired. This semester I am taking Physics, Biology, Biochemistry, and Diversity. Every week there are 3 quizzes, if no quiz there's an exam. It feels like there is an endless cycle of assignments. I am able to do them on time, but I have no motivation whatsoever.",

      "text": "I think your advisor may have failed you. Taking such a large science course load is a mistake. If you are pre med or if you are going into any scientific research field in the future then you need to spend more time learning the material. Many successful medical and grad students took more than four years to graduate because learning the science and getting good grades are so important. \n\nMake an appointment with your advisor asap. Dropping a class and taking it later may take a lot of pressure off you. There are deadlines to consider when it comes to tuition reimbursement.\n\nMany students deal with this same problem so you are not alone. I hope this helps. Good luck!",
