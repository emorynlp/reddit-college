  "text": "First I will say I wasn\u2019t the one who did it but my one group partner did. \n\nWe were to work on a presentation about 30-45 slides and it was supposed to be divided evenly among the group. Our group made a group chat and everything! We would schedule times to meet and this one girl was always \u201cbusy\u201d. We even tried to work around her schedule but she never should up on the zoom calls or on FaceTime. She then tells us she has been working on slides and would share it with us. Come to find out she only made a title for a topic that wasn\u2019t ours. I decided okay enough is enough and I made a shared slide with us. I\u2019ll make a quick summary to cut this short. Me and the other group mate did all the work and this one girl showed up the night before and did 3 slides that later had to be fixed due to it being wrong. On top the girl didn\u2019t show up to the presentation (which stated in the syllabus is a automatic 0). My professor after class asked what she did and we said maybe 3 out of the 42 slides. This girl told the professor she did majority of the work and demanded a grade. Come to find out she put her initials on slides that were mine. I emailed the professor due to me seeing activity in the drive on the slides by her. Well guess who now has to face the academic board due to her stealing my work. \n\nSummary:Group projects suck and if you steal work your group members work you will have to face consequences :)",
