  "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am going into my junior year of college, this semester was going to be a challenge. I thought I could take it on, the beginning was going smoothly until about a month into the semester I had something serious happen in my life that caused me to struggle, I am a computer engineering major last semester in one of my classes for multi variable calculus I was not able to pass it I was so close and this semester I had to retake it and not considering dropping it as I am doing worse due to me struggling. Which it lead to me struggling in my other classes, I am fine in all the other ones except for my multi calculus and electronics course. \n\nI need help deciding what should I do to, I have never had to drop a class or struggled this bad, how would this effect my financial aid? What\u2019s the best thing I could do in such situation? \n\nThanks in advance, looking forward for your respond.",
