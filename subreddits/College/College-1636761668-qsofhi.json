Even some of the food items they always have as options vary in quality quite a bit.\n\nOne good example of this in my cafeteria is the pizza. I\u2019ve noticed the quality of the pizza basically is inversely proportional to the thickness of the bread. The thinner the crust, the better the pizza. I think it\u2019s because they have to cook them quickly to keep up with demand, so the thinner ones get cooked well with the cheese fully melted and starting to brown, while the thicker ones don\u2019t get cooked through very well and can be doughy in the middle. And doughy pizza is obviously very bad (at least IMO, I figure most people would agree), but when it\u2019s cooked well, the pizza at my cafeteria is actually pretty good.",

      "text": "Before 2020-21, there was a great cafeteria on my campus with about every food option you could really ask for and reasonably priced. This past semester though, they decided to raise the price on every item by about 50% (speciality burger and fries went from $9 to $17), and after they refused to raise wages above $9, you were forced you to stand in line for about an hour due to lack of employees. That place closed last month after everyone refused to buy from it and now the food situation is a complete shit show as they outsourced everything to GrubHub instead so you have to put in a order 2-3 hours before you expect to eat if you want to get it on time.  \nUnless you get unlucky because they'll just leave your order sitting on a table near building entrances with no one watching it half the time and people have now started to just walk up and take items if they sit there long enough to which GrubHub refuses to accept any responsibility for as they consider it a successful delivery as long as it got to the building, not the person.",

They have their good dishes (seafood pasta, shrimp, lobster, baked fish)vand bad dishes (I personally don't like my school's fried chicken that my schoolmates go gaga over, nor their mac and cheese)\n\nIt's not perfect 100% of the time, but I can't recall many days the foods served were *genuinely* bad either. More often I didn't like what they were serving if wasn't to my taste, but genuinely *bad*? Rarely. I mean I could still eat it.\n\nI like to think that a lot of my school's student body just doesn't like it because they think that it's uncool. Not because they genuinely don't like it. I mean there ARE some students that genuinely don't like it, not denying that. \nBut I said that bc I've seen other students make fun of their friends and call them poor for not buying idk Chik-fil-A or Wingstop for the 7/11th time. \n\nAlso, our school is expanding, so they built a new cafeteria to accommodate the new dorms, but anyone can go there. So as long as it's more convenient for you to do so. The old cafeteria also got an all new interior design change. Same workers (though they alternate), same foods being served on the same days. \nBarely anyone comes to the old cafeteria anymore lol, they say that the food in the new cafeteria is better. IT'S THE SAME THING, THEY COOK IT THE SAME WAY. I don't trust their judgement on a lot of shit anymore.\n\nI think what helps me like it is that I also don't experience what the other students experience where they say it makes them feel sick or whatnot. Like I'm that person that usually goes back for seconds and thirds (Tryna cut back tho, the weight is starting to show now lmao)",

And the ingredients they use aren't cheap so it all tastes great. They even make grab and go lunches and those taste pretty good my favorite is their Buffalo chicken wrap boxes. And best part about it is they are open 8am-8pm and since I have a night class it's very nice to get dinner there. Also their breakfast is pretty good as well some days they'll do something special for breakfast last time they strawberry pancakes.",
