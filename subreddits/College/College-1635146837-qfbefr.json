Are you looking for making more money immediately or in the long haul? \n\nFor a few though (income will vary by state/area, but I\u2019ve listed a range based on US)\n\nWith an Associate\u2019s degree: \n- Dental hygenist: 55-98k salary\n- Electrician (also need apprenticeship): 38-70k \n- Radiation Therapy Tech: 65-120k\n\nWith a Bachelor\u2019s Degree:\n- IT specialists (like Information Security, Database administration, etc) \n- Engineering\n- like others have said here, STEM fields \n(I don\u2019t have salary info here since these jobs are more wide ranging)\n\nWith a Master\u2019s Degree\n- Nurse Practitioner: 60-160k (projected 50% growth in jobs)\n- STEM jobs (jobs that require/prefer master\u2019s in STEM fields tend to jump way up in salary)",
