Genuinely tried to study, attended tutoring, still failed.\n\nIs this what college feels like? I\u2019m a freshman with my first month barely passing by, however this was my first college exam ever, now I know what to expect. Day by day, right?",

      "text": "That isn\u2019t always what college is like. College, depending on where you go can have much higher academic standards than a high school. They expect more. Also, art appreciation/art history classes are a lot of memorization and are generally pretty difficult. If you aren\u2019t the best at memorizing, you should come up with a way to make it easier, such as mnemonic devices. College is a lot about discovering what studying habits work for you best. It\u2019s different for everyone and therefore can seem harder than high school.",
