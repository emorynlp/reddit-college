  "text": "Im in this business ethics class and there\u2019s a 10+ page paper that\u2019s worth 25% of our grade. For last name\u2019s A-M it is due on the 27th of November but for N-Z it is December 4th. \nI asked the professor if there was a reason for the difference and it essentially boiled down to her not wanting to read all the papers at once. \nEveryones doing the same assignment so it seems completely unfair that I lose an extra week to work on this paper just cause my last name is A-M. \nDo I report this to the department?",

If it bothers you that it's unfair, I'd say go report it. But if you think you can still do well despite having an earlier deadline, then just finish the paper.",

              "text": "Im saying you have know this was the deadline since fhe beginning of semester, and the key to being successful at college is time management. Your professor is a human being who has to read ALL of the papers yall turn in, makes notes, and then assign a final grade - and they have to do so in a certain amount of time so that grades are in by the department deadline. \n\nPlus, I highly doubt your class is the only one being taught. \n\nMoreover, most people suck at writing papers and reading a bunch of what I assume are undergraduate student's last-minute papers is surely a level of purgatory in some cultures...\n\nSo yeah. It is totally fair. Your professor is only one person. If you manage your time wisely and plan to turn it in on time, why are you concerned with whether or not it is fair? It is reasonable, at the very least. Be a human being and stop worrying about things that arent worth your time.\n\nI cant believe you want ro report your professor even though you fully intend to turn the paper in on time.

      "text": "I was wondering when this kind of issue would come up. It\u2019s certainly arguable that it\u2019s an equity issue if everyone was able to start at the same time but would be given different due dates simply because of their last names.\n\nThe issue if you do complain is that this may not rise to the level of an issue that can be changed by anyone in administration. You would have to prove that certain folks are at a disadvantage. This is where the other side of the argument comes in - if everyone had weeks to do it but it only takes a few hours to complete (just for sake of argument), then the extra week is irrelevant. Of course, it\u2019s all in how it\u2019s framed or viewed.\n\nIf you do complain, do not go to the dean. You should first consider going to the department chair, but ONLY after you try getting the professor to change the dates (which sounds unlikely, but that\u2019s the proper first step). Never go straight to the dean about an issue like this because it will almost certainly be kicked down to the chair, anyway, and you might end up with a negative mark on your reputation as a result.",
