      "text": "I'm pretty sure 2 points is nothing in the overall course. You yourself said it's a minor assignment. I know sometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to be perfect, but it's not worth it if it comes at the expense of our health. Last semester I pushed myself incredibly hard to maintain 100% in my classes, even though an A was at 95% in one of them and 90% in another. It's really not worth it and it doesn't even make sense. Don't worry about such a small detail, focus on the bigger picture which in this case is passing the class. Good luck!",
