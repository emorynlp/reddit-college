  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm not sure if this is the right place to do this, but my cousin (17M) is having trouble deciding which field/major he wants to go into. He's told me that he's content doing anything (humanities, engineering, pre-med, etc.) and has yet to find a passion. He doesn't know anyone in college besides me (although I just graduated) so I wanted to help him out. I have a list of questions that he's written that I've sent to a bunch of my friends to answer, but I'm worried I don't have a varied enough group (most people graduated from my same college in a STEM field). I was hoping that I could post them here and get some responses from people at different schools in different majors to give him the best and most widespread information. I would really appreciate if anyone could help me/him out! Here are the questions:\n\n1. What is/are your major(s)/minor(s)?\n2. What made you interested in that major/field?\n3. What do you like the least and most about your major(s)?\n4. What was your undergraduate academic experience like as that major(s)? (i.e. how were your classes? how important was your GPA for jobs? did you feel like you had a good work/life balance?)\n5. What do you want to do with your major(s)? (i.e. career-wise/academically)\n6. Did you always know you wanted to do that? How did you figure it out?\n7. Do you think getting your degree in that major(s) was worth it?\n8. Would you have done it differently if you could?\n9. Any advice for someone who is interested in your major(s)?",

      "text": "> What is/are your major(s)/minor(s)?\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\n>What made you interested in that major/field?\n\nHaving the numbers on the page have a physical meaning, instead of just numbers being numbers.\n\n>What do you like the least and most about your major(s)?\n\nLeast: Any class that has \"dynamics\" in the name. Most: Doing big projects and understanding how some things that seem like magic actually work.\n\n>What was your undergraduate academic experience like as that major(s)? (i.e. how were your classes? how important was your GPA for jobs? did you feel like you had a good work/life balance?)\n\nSchool is/was hard, GPA semi-important, but most just look for above 3.0. Was able to do school, have 20ish hours work and play games with friends. Midterm weeks were rough, but it was doable.\n\n>What do you want to do with your major(s)? (i.e. career-wise/academically)\n\nGet a job...shooting for aerospace but honestly its so versatile that I can do whatever\n\n>Did you always know you wanted to do that? How did you figure it out?\n\nFound out about it sometime like 10th grade-ish, did engineering stuff senior year HS, and knew that was what I liked to do.\n\n>Do you think getting your degree in that major(s) was worth it?\n\nI'll let you know when they get back to me in a week or two about the interview lol...but actually yes, the potential jobs I can get are pretty nice.\n\n>Would you have done it differently if you could?\n\nNot taken the convoluted 3 school 8 year path that I did.\n\n>Any advice for someone who is interested in your major(s)?\nIf you're in it for the money, then its not necessarily the major for you. Is it decent money? absolutely...but if you want fuck you money go into business. You have to at the very least be really interested in some aspect of it, otherwise the 4 years are gonna be rough.",

      "text": "1. What is/are your major(s)/minor(s)?\nCriminal justice & psychology with a certificate in child welfare \n\n2. What made you interested in that major/field?\nI\u2019ve always been interested in cold cases/true crime & I really like talking to people and giving them advice.\n\n3. What do you like the least and most about your major(s)?\ntbh you get a lot of shit for being a psych major and it gets annoying after 3 years of hearing the same joke, the job outlook is also poor for psychology if you don\u2019t get a masters or PHD. \nMy favorite thing is that there\u2019s a lot of versatility with my major combo career wise I could go into: Law enforcement, FBI/DEA,ATF, be a lawyer, work in probation, work in group homes, be a therapist, do research, the list goes on. \n\n4. What was your undergraduate academic experience like as that major(s)? (i.e. how were your classes? how important was your GPA for jobs? did you feel like you had a good work/life balance?)\nIt\u2019s been really good and comes pretty naturally to me because i\u2019m following my passions. GPA is important for me because I am planning on going into federal law enforcement or going to law school, both of those options are extremely competitive so a high GPA is needed.\n\n5. What do you want to do with your major(s)? (i.e. career-wise/academically)\nlisted above \n\n6. Did you always know you wanted to do that? How did you figure it out?\nNo. I was originally accepted into university as a pre-PT student. I hated the majority of classes I had to take (intense chem/bio) so I knew it wasn\u2019t worth it to me or the right fit.\n\n7. Do you think getting your degree in that major(s) was worth it?\n100% all the jobs I want or am interested in need a degree and the ones I chose are the best fit for those positions. \n\n8. Would you have done it differently if you could?\nnope. \n\n9. Any advice for someone who is interested in your major(s)?\nBe patient and don\u2019t get discouraged based on outside option. People will shit on you for being a psych major and sometimes for being a criminal justice major but we need quality people in those fields more than ever. The career growth for psychology is rapid with the expansion on mental health care and criminal justice is in need for people as well. People will also comment on the amount of money you make because entry level isn\u2019t super high for CJ/psych but the majority of people end up making 6 figures within the first 10 years of employment. If you are good at what you do the money will come.",

      "text": "1) Materials Engineering Technology 2 year Diploma Program kn Canada. \n\n2) I worked for a few years after high-school and ended up at a place that worked with corrosion, NDT, and general Material science. I fell in love and went to school for it. \n\n3) what I like the most is the wide range of jobs we can enter into. If you like hands on We can work in Inspections, Coatings, welding, Catholic Protection. If you like lab work, then metallurgy, R&D, Failure analysis. A little of both? QA/QC, destructive testing, Material Selection, material analysis. \n\n4) currently a second year student. It\u2019s a lot of work but if you can plan ahead and set reasonable amount of time for assignments you can still get personal time. There\u2019s a lot to learn and a lot of hands on lab work. 60% theory 40%labs. \n\nGPA is reasonably important. Materials engineering technology is a fairly broad field but our skill set is unlike any other. Our jobs often can range from nuclear labs to field work looking at welds the options are wide open. \n\nFor a work life balance I think it\u2019s pretty good if you can plan ahead if you don\u2019t it can take up a lot of time. \n\n5) I want to do some inspection work with the corrosion industry or some manufacturing work. The jury is out there and there\u2019s a lot we still have yet to learn. We also got a presentation from the Canadian Nuclear Laboratory\u2019s from across the country which was super cool!  \n\n6) nope I never would of found out about it if I didn\u2019t work those odd jobs.  It a pretty niche industry but once you get in and get some experience your golden. \n\n7) still a student but I already gained so much from it. From getting industry contacts to getting all the theoretical learning to be a radiographer. There\u2019s a lot we learn and gain for the cost of our tuition. \n\n8) I would of went back sooner had I known how much fun it would be. I also would of been I person which would make our learning easier. \n\n9) have a good understanding of Math, Chemisty, and physics. Get used to reading and writing reports. Set up good study habits ASAP. \n\n\nBest of luck!!! Ask me more questions if you want.",
