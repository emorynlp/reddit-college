One of them last semester said that he \"made a mistake and put a B instead of an A in the gradebook\" I've been contacting him and the school for months and the grade remains the same. This semester we had to do our work through myitlab and show for class in zoom meetings. I've contacted my professors about my low grades and one of them says that i never showed up for the meetings (i did regularly) and another says that I have never send in my homework (I did and she replied that she got my homework) now she says that she never got an email to begin with. Both of them keep saying that I never emailed them when I did and I even have screenshots of their replies to prove it. I'm losing my sanity. I know that community college professors are not that good but I never expected them to be so fucked up. I'm seriously considering dropping out.", "author": "galactea101", "created": 1590926456, "retrieved": 1632947899, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 697, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fshsc3j": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gtxvts/how_am_i_supposed_to_transfer_when_professors/fshsc3j/", "text": "Fair.

I'm sorry.\n\nDoes the school have an ombudsman?  That would be a good office to consult with.  Alternatively, I agree with the advice that suggests you consider talking to leadership within the department\n\nThis is probably a no-brainer, but make sure the venting language you're using here (\"Professors keep messing up\") isn't what you use in official communication.  I would characterize this a neutrally and matter-of-factly as possible.  \"My Professor indicated he will be submitting a grade change based on updated/corrected information.  However, the grade change has not yet gone through, and this may jeopardize my transfer applications.\"  As for the other, the situation is something like  \"I'm trying to resolve a dispute about attendance and assignments for which I have documentation.\"    These kinds of statements say you're looking for next steps and guidance.  It's easier for people to see the role they may play in helping you.  \n\nI see you have gotten multiple pieces of advice here about contacting top leadership or the press about this.  That might be something to consider at the right time.  But starting there?  It is not clear to me that either of these tactics are effective or as speedy as people imply.  One issue is just governance--it's uncommon for trustees and presidents to interfere in classroom issues.  The other issue is credibility.  Your case may be sound but unfortunately, there are plenty of students who regularly go straight to the top over issues less robust than yours--although they will sometimes embellish details to make it seem that their concerns are urgent/dire.  So Presidents and Trustees--and the press--evaluate please for interference with caution and there's no guarantee they will move as swiftly as some posters have suggested they will.  I think this would be appropriate as a later step, after you have exhausted attempts with people who, being closer to the situation, may be able to actually fix it.  \n\nI would not advocate dropping out.  You have invested time and effort and money into your credits, and dropping out makes the path back much more challenging should you change your mind and decide you do want to further education.", "author": "FeatofClay", "created": 1590977312, "upvotes": 1}, "fsgfycg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gtxvts/how_am_i_supposed_to_transfer_when_professors/fsgfycg/", "text": "Sorry this happened.

I'm sorry you've been frustrated. You will get this remedied if you are patient, polite, and persistent. You also need to **clearly document your work** and the communications you've had.\n\n1) Regarding grade change from first semester: How have you communicated with the instructor?  I assume email...which means you should have a \"paper trail\" of your correspondence.\n\nDon't send screenshots. If there was an email, you should be able to forward the email.\n\nIf you have emails that document his admission of the error, forward those emails to the [program's Chairperson or Dean](https://www.bhcc.edu/directory/index.php) (whichever is directly \"above\" the professor) and copy the instructor on it.\n\nUse formal letter format and be professional when expressing your concern.\n\nIt would surprise me if this didn't get taken care of in a reasonable time frame, given you have documentation.\n\n2) With the attendance at Zoom meetings: The instructor can pull up a list of participants to verify your attendance.  \\[It's on their Zoom meeting dashboard > reports >usage.\\] Politely request that your instructor get a usage report to verify your attendance.\n\n3) With homework:  If you emailed it, you should have an email with the file attached in your sent email file and all you need to do is forward it. Again, don't forward screenshots when communication was done via email.\n\nYour campus uses Moodle for its online learning system. If you submitted work through the Moodle portal, then there should be place where it is stored. It doesn't go anywhere once it is uploaded, so locate your work submitted page and screenshot that. This is when a screenshot makes sense.\n\nIf you do not have email documentation, because you deleted it, which I cannot imagine you did, then you may be out of luck other than the usage report from Zoom.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a reality when you interact with big institutions and people who have different levels of ability when dealing with technology. It's worse when a pandemic hits and screws with everyone. The best thing you can do for yourself is learn how to document everything in case something happens again.", "author": "NotACynic", "created": 1590952346, "upvotes": 23}, "fsfzlja": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gtxvts/how_am_i_supposed_to_transfer_when_professors/fsfzlja/", "text": "For sure start the conversation by yourself because colleges do value your ability to be an adult and stand up for yourself BUT this seems like a bad situation and some people just won\u2019t listen to \u201ckids\u201d\ud83d\ude43. I got royally screwed over on a few incidents and honestly I had to get my mom involved. The first was a highly unethical and illegal internship my school found for me (a requirement for a degree program I was in) and the second was an issue with graduation where they blatantly misinformed me on what classes to take resulting in taking multiple unnecessary classes (and therefore missing requirements) and setting me up to not be able to study abroad and still graduate ( I had already paid for my entire study abroad program) they sprung this 3 days before I left the country.
