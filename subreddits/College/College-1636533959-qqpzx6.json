  "title:": "1st semester into college and I'm already thinking my life is over",
  "text": "I am 19 years old i started college during the summer and am now about 1 month off ending my fall semester. The problem is I procrastinate a lot, and this has lead to me doing really bad in my coding class other 3 classes are good but that 1 is bad. I don't think I can pass it and I thinking of withdrawing, its a major requirement and now I'm thinking I'm going to take 5 years instead of 4 like originally planned. I'm  really anxious because I'm going to lose funding from a program. I feel anxious all the time and stressed on weekends because of my coding class that I'm failing. Rethink my major if I should even be in college. I don't work i live with my mom and thinking the worst about myself. I have no prospects rn besides college.",

If you truly can\u2019t make yourself do an assignment with this much at stake, maybe the problem goes beyond normal procrastination.",
