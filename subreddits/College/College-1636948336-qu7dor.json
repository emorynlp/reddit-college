      "text": "Hey dude. I'm almost 30. For reference, I was in a pretty good place in terms of mental health. I don't want this to come off as trying to brag about having a good time to anything, just give you an idea of how enjoyable college can be. My first semester was really positive for me. I met some of my best friends there. \n\nA few weeks before I left for college I met a couple guys going to the same college as me. They really catapulted me into being more social, meeting more people and putting myself out there more. **If I hadn't met them, I wouldn't have had nearly as good of a time my first semester/year in college.** I went to as many parties and things as I could get invited to just to put myself out there. This was the semester that classes were the easiest, so I had extra time for activities like that. \n\nIf you aren't in a good place and don't feel as if you can do college right now, **don't.** There is nothing wrong with either going to community college, just getting a regular job, or living at home if it's an option. You have so much more of your life to worry about college and if you aren't ready now, just wait. It costs way too much money to waste the opportunity, if you are in a bad place in your life it's okay, but make sure to take care of yourself appropriately. \n\nWhen I went to a community college a few years later, it was way more lowkey, not as much \"campus life\" stuff, but that was what I wanted. There is legit nothing wrong with community college, you will most likely use it to get easy credits and then use those towards another degree at another university. \n\nCollege can be really enjoyable, but I would say you have to be in a good place to really get the most out of it. Take care of yourself first, college will be here when you're ready!! If you have to go home, the sooner you go the sooner you'll be ready to get back out there. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I dont want to make anyone feel inferior, so let me say this was MY experience. I was a 4.0 high school student (weighted), AP, honors, yada yada. Community College is easy. Especially your core entry level 100s classes. Its literally a high school refresher to bring everyone up to speed and on the same page (some people never went to HS). Also the core classes will help you figure out what you're good at and want to do, if you haven't figured that out already.\n\nIt's ok to be nervous, I know I was at first. But if you're like me, you'll get used to it really quick. Just pay attention, take notes, do ALL the work, and don't skip class. \n\nYour peers are going to be a mix of people who are on their 2nd or 3rd year, but that doesn't mean they have an advantage over you in the class. Its most likely their first time taking the class too, so you're on the same level. The rest are all first year students just like you.",

      "text": "Woo, so far, I'll take the cake at 32! \n\nI've been back for a summer semester and this is my first whole semester. It's closing up relatively soon also. \n\nBoth of my semesters have gone extremely well and I'm terribly happy about it. \n\nI started college right out of high school for mechanical engineering. It only took me 2 years to start doing poorly and everything went down the shitter. I had to drop one class and it just destroyed my morale. I ended up trying to switch majors for a semester but ended up just quitting altogether with a 2.4 gpa. It just wasn't working for me at all. I was too young and didn't have the discipline to do the studies. \n\nI went back to finish the mechanical engineering degree because it is still largely what I want to do. Even after close to a decades worth of work in the woodworking and CNC industry, I'd worked into positions that were closer to engineering and those are which I enjoyed the most. \n\nMy semesters have been really good. I've only got 1 B so far, and I'm starting at the junior level of an engineering degree. I have some fluff classes this semester but a few difficult ones as well. I think the part that has stood out to me the most about being an older student is that my age has serious benefits as far as discipline. I've been used to showing up at a warehouse for 10 hours a day, every day and have to work the entire time. Now that I'm in college, I get assignments that fill some of my time but I've got more time than I need. It's rare that I study past 5 pm. I wake up from 6-7 am and do assignments in the mornings. I have 2 days off a week in which I prioritize my assignments to get ahead. A lot of the weeks this semester I've gotten ahead by a week and that feels amazing. \n\nI didn't attend college for any social needs. I have my girlfriend who is working together with me so we can afford my education. She's the best. I have made plenty of friends though, contrary to the mood of this subreddit. I have zero problem making friends. Once again, I feel as though my age has given me opportunities to improve my social skills. I wasn't always a social butterfly, but I definitely have the ability to do so now. Nobody is a stranger to me. I get along with pretty much everybody. \n\nI don't know if it matters but I was a gifted student in high school. I was pumped through AP math courses and put into special programs. My problem with going to college in the first place was a complete lack of discipline and time management. I was doing what everyone did which was struggle to finish things right before the deadline. I've figured out that I can cull almost 100% of my stress by doing things early. I never ever miss assignments either. Never had a late assignment. \n\nI suppose in closing I feel like my age has allowed me to really take college for what it is. The knowledge is sticking a whole lot different than it did before. I think with my work experience, I have a lot of nodes to attach this new found knowledge to. I can't help but to think that this was the absolute perfect time for me to go back to finish schooling. I worked through covid so the relief funds stacked in my savings. I got a fat ass grant from the college for attending during covid as well. \n\nOP, what's got you down?",
