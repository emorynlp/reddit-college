  "text": "I'll admit, its nearing the end of the semester and I've gotten lazy. I've only begun college too, not good. I used to study for hours and now im barely doing that and just kind of \"common sensing\" the classes. Does anyone know GPA calculations? I'm currently at a 3.7 with 19 credits. And this semester is the usual 12. I think my grades will possibly be 3 B's and 1 C, or there might be an A. I dont know, alot of my classes are borderline asf rn. (%91.01, %89.21, %83.24, %85.68) The 83% is math, and I know for a fact that grade is going to drop to an C. I hate math with all my heart, no offense to you math lovers. \n\nAlso, im that type of guy where I believe as long as you pass, you pass. I'm stopping at my associates since my field (IT) relies more heavily on Certifications and Experience.",
