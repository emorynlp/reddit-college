  "text": "I'm in my Junior year of University being a Bio major and I've done so well compared to High school lmao. I graduated high school with a 2.84 GPA and didn't really care much for school until my Junior year. I went to CC first and finished with a 4.0 there and am at a University doing fairly well in my classes now. Genuinely curious if anyone else has done wayyy better in college. Now that I look back at it, I absolutely hated the way high school is structured.",

Pretty common in the ADHD crowd (not saying you are, just that I am and that is my and the experience of my ADHD friends).",
