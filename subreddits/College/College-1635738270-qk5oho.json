  "text": "hey guys, \ncurrently a freshman cs major who applied for a change to a dif major, just waiting for it to get approved hopefully in the next few days. \n\ni am taking 13 credit hours and 12 is the minimum to be a full time student. there is a programming class + lab i want to withdraw from because i think it will bring down my gpa significantly and it\u2019s causing me a ton of stress because i hate cs and it\u2019s very hard for me. this will bring me to 9 credit hours. \n\ni will be applying to transfer to a different university at the end of this semester (for admission in fall 2022). does me being a student with only 9 credit hours for first sem + a W on my transcript affect my chances? i will be applying for a dif major as this one isn\u2019t a good fit. also the class is a cs class so it isn\u2019t a good fit but i really just don\u2019t want to do anything to mess up my chances of getting in anywhere. \n\n i could really use some advice. thanks.",
