  "text": "It's a beautiful format that works and doesn't WASTE MY TIME! taking a required class.  It is an English class.  I am a senior.  Why?  It is an OVERT waste of time!  We have been working through making a \\*recipe\\* as a technical document for over 5 weeks now.   My god, the professor keeps drawing out the process so long.  She wants us to do everything in this extremely drawn-out, painstaking, annoying fashion.  Everything is nitpicked to DEATH but with vague non-committal nonsense.  Just let me get over this class.  I could have done all of the material from the last 5 weeks in a DAY.  This class is a joke.  Why do we have to take these annoying gen-ed classes that waste our time?  What is the purpose?  Here's a TIME TESTED format: \n\n1. Lecture to the class and assign the work with a clear rubric.  \n\n2. Do the assignment.   \n\n3. Turn in the assignment and have the professor correct it. Discuss it deeply and improve it meaningfully.   \n\n3. Do the corrections and resubmit.\n\nIts a beautiful format that works and doesn't WASTE MY TIME!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I am a double major.  My other major is German.  I'm not some ranting sour engineer; the course is just part of the AERE curriculum.  I'm used to the general format of writing classes and this is nothing but annoying and wasteful.  My german profs cover 10x what this one has.  We have days that are more productive than this professor's month.  \n\nI'm so done with these silly little classes that don't teach the subject.  I want to learn 'technical communication' but this is just missing the mark.  Frankly, the professor should feel humiliated that this class is what it is.  Again I ask: Why do professors do this?  Why do we need to waste our time as serious students in these classes?",
