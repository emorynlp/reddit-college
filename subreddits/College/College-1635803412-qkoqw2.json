  "text": "I\u2019ve been feeling a bit of pressure from my family to get a bachelor\u2019s degree but to be totally honest, whenever I look through the bachelor\u2019s programs in the universities around my area none of them really interest me\n\nI\u2019m actually pursing a trade right now (dental assisting) and while it is difficult and fast paced I feel like I can get a job easier, especially since the instructors and the college itself are willing to help us find jobs and they\u2019ve helped previous students find employment before\n\nA part of me would like to be a community college foreign language teacher or college counselor but I heard even then it\u2019s hard to find employment here in Cali as either, and I don\u2019t really have an interest in teaching below the college level so that might make finding a job even harder \n\nShould I take the risk and go for a master\u2019s in college counseling or the language I want to teach in community college even though it can be hard to find employment (or at least I think) or would I be better off just finishing my trade program and ending my college education at the community college level?\n\nThanks for reading this!",
