      "text": "Mr.happy stack is based off souvenaid, a treatment to Alzheimer\u2019s in Australia, helps with focus and motivation while still being good for your brain in the long run. Could also try eating healthier, keto helps my concentration tremendously once I\u2019m in ketosis(my version includes lean meat and lots of monounsaturated fats), improve your quality of sleep and make sure your getting enough of it (things like sleep masks, ear plugs, valerian root/lemon balm/ magnesium glycinate help), meditation helps if your struggling with stress which can lead to adrenal fatigue or ashwaganda could help which regulates gaba and cortisol, hydration, water soluble vitamins like Bs, electrolyte balance are all incredibly important for energy levels. Lastly mindset, having a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset for example is beneficial, mindset by carol s. Dweck is a good read for this, also the book atomic habits by James clearwould make these transitions easier.. also make sure you take small breaks otherwise you\u2019ll get burnt out, every 30 minutes or so take a 5 minute break.",
