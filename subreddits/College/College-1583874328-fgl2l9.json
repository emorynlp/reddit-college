  "title:": "The quiet goth kid in HS, now a Communication major in College... I talked about sucking balls in front of 30 students",
  "text": "I was the quiet emo/goth kid in HS and I had a lot of social anxiety (I wasn't hardcore emo, I just wore a lot of black and was quite tomboyish so..goth?).  I've ran out of a room crying once when everyone looked at me to answer a question in class.\nI wanted to change this about myself, so I went into college as a Communication major, marketing minor, joined a marketing club (now on the executive board), and got a job in hospitality and another job in sales. \n\nI have gotten a lot better EXCEPT for standing in front of an entire room of people looking at me while it's dead silent. Couple examples:\n\n1. Gave a speech about boba tea in front of a class of about 30 students (could've been worse). Rambled for about 3 minutes about how a lot of people don't like it because of the sucking balls into your mouth part and the texture. Yea\n\n2. Dad jokes. I wear glasses so I walked into a room to give a pitch and I said \"You know the great thing about being blind as a bat and having social anxiety? I can take my glasses off and it's like none of you are here\" and I took off my glasses and put them on the table and proceeded with my pitch.\n\nI used to blush when talking to anyone. Plus the usual sweats, shaking, stuttering, rambling, panic attacks..But I have been forcing myself out of my comfort zone for about 3 years now (I'm currently a junior) and putting myself in leadership positions. If you want to make a healthy change about yourself, do it. Go out of your comfort zone. It's a whole change in mentality and change doesn't happen over night, so be patient with yourself too.",

There was one last week where we knock on the door, a lady opens, we give our little sorry for your loss speech and she says \u201cOh no need to be so solemn, that moment has passed. We\u2019re trying to have a sense of humor about it now\u201d. My asshole of a partner says \u201cWell my partner here just so happens to be a stand-up comedian on Friday nights\u201d. Of course I\u2019m not a fucking comedian, the extent of my humor is calling dead leg amputees Lt. Dan and asking the dead bodies if they\u2019re alright after going over a bump at 90 mph.  The lady brings us into the living room where a dozen or so family members were sitting awkwardly trying to be positive. Lady says \u201cTurns out we have an actual comedian here to help cheer us up!\u201d. They\u2019re all looking at me. I\u2019m glaring at my partner. \u201cWell go on, tell us a joke!\u201d. I pull the gurney over to the bed with their dead grandpa. \u201cWell do you know what a morticians favorite lift is? A deadlift!\u201d And yanked him over onto the gurney. The granddaughter started crying and ran out of the room. I still haven\u2019t forgiven my partner for that one.",

I'm sure there are professionals with better advice or tactics than what I have done.However I think any professional could agree that change takes time.\n \nBaby steps, don't push yourself to the point of breaking, be patient with yourself, and be proud of every achievement, even if it's as small as \"Hell yeah! I ordered the shit out of that food\" (my social anxiety made even ordering food difficult lol)\n\nEdit: Correction, I didn't \"cure\" myself. There was nothing to cure.
