  "title:": "How to ask a professor for accommodation because English isn\u2019t my native language?",
  "text": "So, this is actually for a classmate in this art history class I\u2019m taking. Basically the professor would put up a slide with a picture for like 30 seconds and we are supposed to describe/state what it means/symbolizes. There\u2019s this classmate whose first language isn\u2019t English so she is having a hard time taking notes within that 30 second window so she asked if I can write an accommodation for her. I\u2019m like genuinely clueless and have no idea where to start. It\u2019s supposed to be like a letter stating that \u201cI\u2019m not a native English speaker\u201d and asking for more time or additional help. Fellow redditors, I don\u2019t know who to ask for help besides you guys",

      "text": "Unfortunately accommodations for this does not exist because it is not really a 'disability' per say. Accommodations are also not handled through students and professors, that is usually a DSS matter. Might want to have her reach out to the professor, since it is her issue, though he would have to change it for everyone to make it fair, which might be a pushback.",

If it\u2019s something she has to turn in, I\u2019d encourage her to speak with the prof about her concerns. He may be willing to allow her to record her answers verbally if that\u2019s easier for her. Or she could go discuss her concerns with international students office.  It isn\u2019t appropriate for her to ask you to intervene on her behalf.",
