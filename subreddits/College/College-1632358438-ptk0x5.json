Basically the professor would put up a slide with a picture for like 30 seconds and we are supposed to describe/state what it means/symbolizes. There\u2019s this classmate whose first language isn\u2019t English so she is having a hard time taking notes within that 30 second window so she asked if I can write an accommodation for her. I\u2019m like genuinely clueless and have no idea where to start. It\u2019s supposed to be like a letter stating that \u201cI\u2019m not a native English speaker\u201d and asking for more time or additional help. Fellow redditors, I don\u2019t know who to ask for help besides you guys", "author": "iamfired", "created": 1632358438, "retrieved": 1632946192, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdx5qhi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptk0x5/how_to_ask_a_professor_for_accommodation_because/hdx5qhi/", "text": "Unfortunately accommodations for this does not exist because it is not really a 'disability' per say.
