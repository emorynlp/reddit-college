Didn't study enough and now I'm paying the price with my grade.", "text": "How - used the wrong formulas, forgot the formulas. Didn't study enough. Didn't ask questions.\n\nI'm posting this as a reminder and a wakeup call more importantly to myself I can't do how I used to study, this isnt highschool and only 2 hours a week isn't enough to cut it. Last minute isn't gonna help me and I'm gonna end up failing my first year like I did in highschool. Keeping this test on my wall as a reminder\n\nI need advice math wise, I wanted to do tutoring but I'm not sure how or what to use for it. I've used khan acadmey for learning in depth better stuff. but I can barely retain stuff for less than a day, my focus is shit due to my medication (trying to switch that at the moment). My next test is gonna be in around a month from now. I wanna make sure I atleast get a B+, \n\nThis is all rambling and I apologize, but I wanna make sure I can atleast get this right.\n\n\nSo here's my direct questions if it wasn't clear enough - \n\nHow do I properly study math?\nWhat do I mention to a tutor when asking for help?\nWhat specifically should I write in my notes on stuff I don't understand or get?", "author": "Gr0wlerz", "created": 1632356511, "retrieved": 1632946185, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"hdwrsb0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptjhfm/got_a_7_on_my_college_algebra_test_didnt_study/hdwrsb0/", "text": "Math requires repetition.
