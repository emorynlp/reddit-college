  "text": "I\u2019m sure this has been asked and answered before but I haven\u2019t seen too much on it. I am going to school for finance currently as my backup plan is to become and insurance agent / financial advisor if my other job dosent pull through. I work with my dad in manufacturing and the end goal is to take over the business and that would be it, but he wants me to get a degree as a backup if you will. I\u2019m thinking about switching to general business for a simpler degree (I\u2019ve talked to many employers and they say they never look what the degree actually is as long as it isn\u2019t left handed puppetry it\u2019s fine). Any who back to the original question, are online colleges just as acceptable as traditional? I have minimal time to work on my own stuff anymore because of the wack class hours. I just want a simple degree to get me by if I need it in the future. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? If you made it this far and understood this mess of an \u201cessay\u201d thank you!",

      "text": "The online college of a traditional brick & mortar university is a perfectly valid option.  \n\nFor example, Penn State University's \"World Campus\" is their online college.  \n\nBut an online university, with no meaningful brick & mortar presence starts to get into territory that is less immediately trusted.  \n\nEmployers have a real stigma for colleges or universities that prioritize how quick and easy their education is.  \n\n*\"You can complete your 4 year degree in just 2 years with our special program...\"*  \n\nA 4-year degree is supposed to take 4-years.  \nIf they are doing it faster, then one of the following is true:  \n\n* They are going to work the ever-loving shit out of you.  \n - Crushingly intense work-loads.  \n* They are ripping entire chapters out of the textbooks or curricula, and are just simply teaching you less material.  \n - Except now you know less than other students do if they took the same class at a different school.  \n\n\nIt doesn't take an intelligent employer long to judge the quality of your education during a technical interview.  \n\nOne exception I'll more or less admit to is Western Governors University.  \n\nWGU is an online-only institution and compresses many of their classes into shortened versions.  \n\nSo there are several warning signs that suggest something isn't right.  \n\nBut they are also accredited out the wazoo as a legitimate institution of education by an array of entities.  \n\nSo, I'm on the fence about them, personally.  \n\n[US News & World Report Ranking of Best Online Undergraduate Schools](http://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/bachelors/rankings)",
