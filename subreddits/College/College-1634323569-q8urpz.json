  "text": "Am I the only one noticing this or do in person classes seem as though they're heavier than they used to be and heavier than when zoom was a thing? My professor had told us that the school told all professors to continue what they were doing before COVID had put us online. There was really no transition period or any kind of slowing down a little bit to ease back into in person. I have 4 exams this week and I feel like I havent had any time to study for any of them let alone collect my thoughts.\n\nI've also noticed professors being slightly more lazy than usual as well, am I the only one seeing this trend?",

Like what could they do? The course content is what it is. If they have fewer exams, that means each exam is weighted more and that's worse, imo. Same with homework. Also, it's likely you'd learn less if they'd ease up, which is against the whole entire point of taking the class.",

I was talking to some people and they thought maybe instead of exams for this semester maybe conduct group projects or conduct simulations in place of that, however I see the opposing view of in a group project you could have lazy peers but I am not sure it could just also be me",
