  "text": "Caption says it all. \nI\u2019m 20M in my second year of college. \n\nI work full time and I\u2019m also a full time student. I\u2019m currently doing terrible in most of my classes due to lack of motivation and effort. I feel so beat down and worn out I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a good place for school mentally at the moment. I want to finish this semester but at this rate I don\u2019t think I can even pass. \n\nAt some point I want to get a degree but at the moment I feel like I just need a break. Ever since this semester started I\u2019ve felt super stressed and I\u2019ve felt unhealthy overall. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",
