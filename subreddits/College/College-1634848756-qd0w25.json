  "text": "Caption says it all. \nI\u2019m 20M in my second year of college. \n\nI work full time and I\u2019m also a full time student. I\u2019m currently doing terrible in most of my classes due to lack of motivation and effort. I feel so beat down and worn out I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a good place for school mentally at the moment. I want to finish this semester but at this rate I don\u2019t think I can even pass. \n\nAt some point I want to get a degree but at the moment I feel like I just need a break. Ever since this semester started I\u2019ve felt super stressed and I\u2019ve felt unhealthy overall. \n\nAny advice is appreciated",

      "text": "Full-time school and full-time work is a pretty hefty load no wonder you're burned out. If you feel like you don't know exactly what you want to do yet then I might consider dropping out. My only caveat is that you have to do something exploratory and productive with your job or jobs if you drop out. Don't just go work retail or fast food go work in something that you think you might be interested in if you can make the connections. If you're interested in business see if you can be some sort of administrative assistant or accounting assistant for a small company. If you're interested in engineering see if you can go be a technician or a drafter or something like that. If your potential career isn't something you can do without a degree then see if their opportunities to volunteer or shadow like if you're interested in the medical career you can always Shadow but you could also do things like become an EMT or phlebotomist. There are a lot of shorter programs at technical colleges that you could give a try that might help you understand more about what you would want to do. ultimately if you don't have even a vague direction for your college career you're kind of just throwing that money away and stressing yourself out way too much. Might as well save money have a little more free time and a little less stressed figure things out assuming it doesn't go on for too long.",

          "text": "I currently work in the food industry for a small business. It\u2019s pretty decent money. But I totally agree I should find somewhere else. Regardless of me finishing the semester or not I don\u2019t plan on going back next. I\u2019m interested in business so I would like to find experience in the field so I will look into shadowing jobs of that nature. If I do go back to school ( I would like to eventually), I think I\u2019ll try to go through a shorter program to get my degree. \n\nThanks a lot!",
