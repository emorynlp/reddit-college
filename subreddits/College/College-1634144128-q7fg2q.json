  "text": " Hey Everyone,\n\nI am a senior in college but I am on a 5 year plan, so I am set to graduate in Spring 2023. I am an English/Secondary Education major and I am also working towards getting an ESL certifaction; or at least getting closer to it by the time I graduate.\n\nWhen I started at this university my Freshman year, I was heavily involved on campus. I joined a fraternity and was involved in the music program (vocal jazz and choir). As I wanted to dedicate more time to my fraternity and classes, I dropped choir and vocal jazz but joined an a cappella ensemble with some friends to keep music in my life. Flash forward three years and now I am the current president of said fraternity, and the a cappella ensemble is still going.\n\nThe trouble is, as I am further entering the education program, my classes and general workload are getting increasingly harder and harder to bear. I was warned by older friends in the ed dept. that I had no idea what was coming, but I didn't expect to struggle this hard.\n\nI used to be a chronic cannabis user, but have since quit (1-2 months clean) in hopes that it would bolster my productivity, which, to a degree, I feel like it has. Still, though, with the time commitment that these classes are demanding of me I am finding it harder and harder to put time into my fraternity and a cappella group. My mental health is declining, and my grades are slipping in a way they never have before (I have a cumulative GPA of 3.99... and I am now at a point in some classes where I could be in danger of actually failing if things continue on how they have).\n\nAt the end of the day I know I am here to get my degree first, and that I should prioirtize my mental health more. On the other hand, I would also feel regret for leaving and letting down some of my friends in either group. Not sure what to do. Any advice you have would be appreciated.",
