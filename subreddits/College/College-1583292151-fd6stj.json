There was one that sort of killed me- the professor makes it very difficult and it's a two hour exam. The average on his exam last year was a 33%. Of course he curves it, but jesus christ dude. Way to make your students feel inadequate. I think I did well on the rest of them. Just got this one back, 77% after the curve. Better than I was expecting. So glad it's over. Felt like poo progressively leading up to the exam, and probably a day or two after. \n\nI have a substance that lets me float on life when I want, though. It is profound. It's not even an escape from reality, it's a more in-depth reality... it's not like school is all that matters. I could use the good parts of me to offset the inadequacies- but I find that it's better to just let go of my ego and it's need to feel good. The relief that provides- that is good, without needing to feel or think it. \n\nAs long as you love yourself, you will always have love- ie the best thing to ever exist. :)", "author": "This_is_your_mind", "created": 1583331961, "upvotes": 2}, "fjgo419": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fd6stj/mental_health_checkin/fjgo419/", "text": "I'm both getting better and worse.

I put 1 sentence TLDR at the end. My mental health have been off the wall bonkers. I'll go from screaming and crying that I can't take it anymore to.. Just kind of sleeping and having no motivation to just.. Feeling numb and useless. But then I'd go right back to screaming and crying. It's been a terrible cycle, and I've tried to fix it myself by keeping myself distracted and busy, buts its like fixing a sinking ship with weak duct tape. Hell, I've even contemplated running out into traffic a couple of times but I just can't bring myself to do it because my parents would be sad if I hurt myself like that.\n\nI haven't turned in any of my online assignments because they make me anxious, and I also flunked most of my classes. For ex, in Physics I put the bare minimum and turned it in because I couldn't even figure out how to start the equations. I'm also flunking Stats because I can't keep up with it (though, I've accepted Withdrawing from the class). My Chem lecture and lab aren't any better. The only classes I'm kind of dong okay in are my Ani Sci classes and A&P.\n\nI have no hope in passing most of my midterms with all of that being said, and it makes me feel like absolute shit that I'm wasting everyone's time and money like this. \n\nI've tried speaking to my school's mental health professionals about everything that's been going on this year, multiple times I might add, and since *January* they've ALL been booked up until after Spring Break. In regards to my grades, after Spring Break is way too late because that's the Withdrawal period and we only have the week to do that. In regards to anything else, I just felt like it wasn't... Worth it.  I've been salty about it because they are ALWAYS booked up every semester.\n\nOh and they aren't taking walk ins unless you're ready to kill yourself at that moment so there's that (Just bawling your eyes out wouldn't work either. When my dad went into a comatose state one semester, I couldn't handle it. I broke down and went to their office where they turned me away because walk ins were only reserved for people admitting to wanting to kill themselves). I'm not sure what to do at this point. I can't even afford out of school care.\n\nFinally, I have no friends, no mentor, nothing. Not one. I've tried everything people have told me to do, speak to people in class, in the commons, wherever, join clubs, start up random conversations with people. Nothing sticks. So I have no one to vent to about all of this (so I really appreciate you making this thread btw). This has been going on for three year. Idk what to do anymore.

This semester 3/4 of the classes I'm taking are for fun (I'm undeclared, but planning to declare and start on a journalism degree this fall) but the trick is that 2 of them are decently taxing. I'm taking one course on Russian Science Fiction which I'm really enjoying (the books we've been reading are amazing) but tends to stress me out, since the reading assignments are either really light (about 20 pages) or absolutely absurd for the time frame (50 pages or a little more in two to three days) with no in between. Last week she had us do 50 pages in one of our books and it's completely screwed me up since then, since I was barely able to get any other work done that weekend and have been scrambling to catch up ever since. \n\nOther than that, I'm taking a course on ancient Greek History which is fun but, again, has some really beefy reading assignments that I've been struggling to complete in addition to my Russian ones. Even though they aren't nearly as necessary as the Russian ones (since most of the material is covered in lecture) I still feel really bad about skipping or not completing them, and am especially worried because we have a midterm next week. \n\nAlso, I had a test in my Russian class about a week ago that I'm getting back on Friday, and I'm honestly terrified because it was entirely hand written and my handwriting is absolutely terrible. On any normal exam, I usually finish early and have about 10-20 minutes to rewrite all my answers and get them legible, but I only had 50 minutes for my Russian test, and there was so much stuff on the exam that I wound up only having about 10 minutes to rewrite everything. I recognize that it's entirely my fault for having shit handwriting and I shouldn't expect a professor to accommodate my personal failings, but it still stresses me out. It also doesn't help that my Greek midterm has a similar structure and similar timeframe, meaning that I'll probably run into the same issues and have to worry about everything all over again. \n\nOther than that, things have been good, since, in spite of all the reading, I actually really enjoy all my classes and the books I've been reading, and am pretty excited to get started with my major. Even though the reading assignments have been stressing me out, I think it makes a big difference that all the reading I'm doing is fun and relevant to the classes and I'm taking, and usually tends to add a lot of context and peripheral info to lecture material (something I feel a lot of classes don't do right).", "author": "Adam_Drivers_Ass", "created": 1583296777, "upvotes": 5}, "fjfj2a7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fd6stj/mental_health_checkin/fjfj2a7/", "text": "That's very sweet of you to create a mental health thread like this.
