  "text": "I am currently a 1st year college in Bachelor Of Multimedia Arts (BMMA) and as of now I am having fun. We can do animations, photography, graphic design, film production and etc.\nHours ago, I just received an email of my government scholarship being approved as long as I am in Bachelor Of Science In Entertainment and Multimedia Computing (BSEMC) or Game Development in short. This is great news because it cuts my semestral tuition payment and my mother wouldn't have to worry as much.\n\nThe bad side is, I am bad at math. It also seems like that program is more limited than what I am currently in. BSEMC focuses heavily on game making, obviously, and that worries me on my job searching. I'm worried that people wouldn't take me seriously because my degree literally means Game Developing. Unlike my current program (BMMA), it tackles a broader set of skills such as animation, motion graphics, film making, and even game design as a free elective.\n\nI am seriously in a dilemma right now because my family is in a financial struggle. Having my college payment being cut by half would be a great benefit for us. But at the same time, I wouldn't want to lose my current almost perfect program if Game Development is worse when it comes to job searching.\n\nJust wanted people's opinions...",
