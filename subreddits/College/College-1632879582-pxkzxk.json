  "text": "You ever just kinda *know* something isn\u2019t for you? Well that\u2019s me with college, I can barely handle High School homework. I\u2019ll be graduating next year, and I\u2019ve been tore in two thinking about going to college or going into cosmetology which is similar to a trade school were you just do what you plan on doing. The thing is, I really love Psychology/Neurology, and I would love to be able to go into it so I can study the use of psychedelics drugs. As much as I love doing people\u2019s hair, I know way more about psychology in many regards other then my preferred profession. Psychology is one of the only subject where I actually can understand and retain the information with ease, same with neurology. \nI\u2019m just trying to map out how hard college is. I thought maybe I should go into just to get the necessary college things done first at a community college. Then I\u2019ll really know if that\u2019s even what I want to do, and if it is, I won\u2019t have to worry about other classes while studying for my main degree. I would really love some advice on how hard college is in general, and I also would really love some advice on how hard getting a psychology and neurology degree would be, or if getting a degree in neurology would be necessary for this type of study. Any advice or just telling your experience would help greatly.",

      "text": "I think being passionate about the subject will help. If it's cheaper to do prereqs at a community college, and you want to save money, do that.\n\nI'd think neurology would be more difficult because of the amount of chem, bio, and anatomy involved in it, and neuroscience in general. \n\nI'm a psychology major and it's not all that difficult, as a whole.\n\nIntro psych is really easy, same with psychological stats and measurements (this varies from person-to-person). But something like cognitive psychology was challenging because it's kinda dry and it dealt with a lot of abstract concepts, and you have to be able to understand them well to make inferences and explain things. Some of the questions that come up seem simple initially, but get more complex as you go on, since cognition involves both conscious and unconscious processes, and so on.\n\nBiological psychology was challenging since it's like a mix of everything: anatomy, biology, chemistry, neurology, etc., integrating all of them together was the challenging part, but you don't go too in-depth into any particular subject. \n\nCollege can be stupidly easy, stupidly difficult, and everything in-between. Really depends on the course and the topic/subject. What really matters is being able to put in the time and effort, and that involves finding good study habits and routines that work *for you*--everyone's different. \n\nYou don't necessarily need a degree in both neuroscience and psychology.\n\nAs for relevant degree/education for psychedelic research, I'd think about what capacity you'd like to be involved with it. There's a psychological aspect, a chemical aspect, a biological aspect, a neurological aspect, a pharmacological aspect, and so on, with everything in-between.",

      "text": "Learning something you enjoy makes it much easier, so if you are really passionate about psychology then it will come easier to you than someone who isn't really interested, even if the content is more advanced than school. \n\nIt's also all relative. I find statistics easy but many people don't. You will have natural strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI would suggest going through Coursera and looking at some of the courses there. That will at least give you a taste of the subjects for free. Some professors also share content on YouTube so that's another place where you can get a feel for the subject.",

      "text": "It helps to start reading and taking notes like you would in college. When I was in high school I started learning college studying skills from my sibling. I also attended information sessions and workshops at universities I was interested in. I can share some resources with you on how you can prepare for your college freshman year. Although you still have some time before you start college, you can learn about expectations and practice some skills beforehand. \n\nI would suggest reading journal articles now. The Journal of Emerging Investigators offers free access to journal articles. The articles are not exactly college level, it is meant for middle and high school, but you can start training your skills in reading articles. \n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)\n\nI also have a College Freshman Starter Kit.
