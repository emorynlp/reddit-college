      "text": "Unfortunately outside of the US is your best bet. Most states don\u2019t allow minors into bars. Only 18+ clubs I can think of are cabarets that don\u2019t serve alcohol, and they\u2019re all very sketchy. If you have quality fake IDs you could go anywhere theoretically, but any bar/club within the US that admits minors without IDs isn\u2019t a place you want to go.",
