  "text": "Hey peeps!\n\nI was wondering if it\u2019s possible to learn college algebra in 1 year? I wanna test out of it. Math has always been my weakness but when I was taking in college before I dropped out I was actually getting it until we moved on to something else.. now I\u2019m thinking of going back. But I wanna learn it on my own and test out. Or maybe take it and just pass with the highest grade possible. Can it be done? Free online courses will keep me on track with what comes next. What do you guys think?",
