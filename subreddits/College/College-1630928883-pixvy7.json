In general approaching people is weird to do and frankly can be off putting unless you get the right people but, the issue I usually see especially with sophomores or freshman moving in for their first time to school is that they don\u2019t understand how to socially interact. I have made friends at my community college, I don\u2019t like em that much but they like me, though because of my involvement and I actually had things to talk about that others were interested in I was pretty approachable. Others may not exactly know how to keep conversations going and it just becomes awkward though this happens more over time rather than just meeting someone for the first time. I think though really understanding your interests and actually being able to provide thoughtful insight into what you like an expand upon stuff other than just saying \u201cyeah\u201d\u201dcool\u201d\u201dinteresting\u201d\u201d(insert simple question here)\u201d at least gives you more. How do people find others interesting when they can\u2019t even talk about themselves? I think once more of the students are put into positions where they are given so little to talk about and have to run with something they will start to make friends just mostly those coming to college haven\u2019t had to do that. Maybe these are just assumptions but I definitely feel like the same people asking this especially my friends who have talked to me and made posts here about this are the exact same ones asking \u201chow to meet people in college\u201d or \u201chow do I handle (insert social situation)\u201d.

Relaxed shoulders, relaxed face, can you manage happy or cheerful. Hello, here i am and I am open to people\n\nPretext: why are you talking to this person? (Please don't be so committed to being this persons friend. Its like flirting, just be happy to talk to a person)\n\n-compliments are easy, be genuine or fuck off. Good compliments are about the person not about the thing. Ie, I love your dess vs, I love your dress you have good taste, I love your dress you are so put together. \n\n-shared things, class, location, being new, shared activity (Your college has outdoor activities scheduled usually through the gym, your college has clubs, your college has a calender of events)\n\nAfter pretext ask a question. People love talking about themselves. Some are easy af what's your major? What are you taking? I bet they are taking something interesting. I took algebra 5 times. I tell everyone that says algebra... haha this is a judgment free place. Im not lying, im offering a piece of me (the key here is not being self depreciating, just being honest and open) where are you from!? (This is great im in ~conservative place~ and I found someone from ~hometown~ and so we were able to talk about ~politicized topics that are normal other places~)\n\nKeep showing up. If you do an intermural sport, excersice class or a club or a study group(Excellant pretext for getting numbers/snaps) keep going\n\nYou're not going to be friends the first time at a club (especially not if you pick clubs with fellow introverts like chem club, physics club, etc) but if you keep showing up eventually you will get to know everyone there and find out shared interests. (I used to prioritize my dumb job. Never went to the events. Few times there were parties didn't go. Just show up to all the things! I know its so dang scary but walk up to the other singular people. \"This is my first x event its cool that they do x\") \n\nIm 100% incapable of starting a conversation with an introduction. I save it for the lull in the conversation. Or I ask them their name so they have to ask me and im not just demanding to be known lol. \n\nIf its a club or whatever im like, hey ill see you next meeting. If its a study group im like gimme your number we'll set it up (I always call immediately, or send a text that says hey its btb so we are on even ground, they know is me and the line of communication is open)\n\nI am overeager probably but I own it. I am friendly and bubbly and also an introvert. Thats allowed and excepting it for what it is is freeing. I hit them up a few hours later, next day at the latest. Hey, it was so nice talking with you, here's a link to a thing I said, or was the movie you recommended \"\"? I dont like to wait because im signaling that I did enjoy talking to them and I would do it again.\n\nSnaps are easy to ask for. Because they feel less close to a person than a number. I literally just say \"omg! You should give me your snap!\" And I ALWAYS compliment their bitmoji. Because I think they are so freaking adorable. Also, they always say something... horns? Halo? Hiking boots? (You absolutely do not have to be a creep,I look but only bring it up if it sticks out, but people put effort into their avatars)\n\nHere's some more. If you say you will be at thing, be a person of your word. This is 2021, and the temptation is to text 40 minutes before a meet up and say you are doing another thing but BE A RELIABLE PERSON. I know this is college. Use your phone calender. And if you must blow off a meeting, do it AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE(but this stresses me out!, I know, try anyway, do your best) and OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE \n\n\"Im so sorry, I just got told I have a paper due, ive got to study in the resource center. I can't go to coffee tomorrow but I would love to go Saturday or Sunday of you can make it?\" If its cool they might join you to study or might do coffee the other day. \n\nBut for real, if its a first meeting, do everything in your power not to flake.", "author": "bitetheboxer", "created": 1630949583, "upvotes": 265}, "hbttn0s": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pixvy7/yall_need_to_talk_to_people/hbttn0s/", "text": "Jumping onto the bandwagon:\n\nThis isn\u2019t a movie.
