I ended up reaching out and introducing myself to multiple people and *wasn\u2019t* anxious. That level of socializing, as a more introverted person, is kinda tiring sometimes and can feel intimidating, but it can also feel rewarding in the times where I feel lonely. \n\nThe point is, sometimes you just gotta put yourself out there. If you need a break afterwards to recharge, that\u2019s valid! But it\u2019s better to balance those two situations together than pass up opportunities to make some semblance of human connection. I have my issues, but being alone with my issues is what will destroy me. Just try your best to \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d. Easier said than done, but I\u2019m trying I guess.",

In general approaching people is weird to do and frankly can be off putting unless you get the right people but, the issue I usually see especially with sophomores or freshman moving in for their first time to school is that they don\u2019t understand how to socially interact. I have made friends at my community college, I don\u2019t like em that much but they like me, though because of my involvement and I actually had things to talk about that others were interested in I was pretty approachable. Others may not exactly know how to keep conversations going and it just becomes awkward though this happens more over time rather than just meeting someone for the first time. I think though really understanding your interests and actually being able to provide thoughtful insight into what you like an expand upon stuff other than just saying \u201cyeah\u201d\u201dcool\u201d\u201dinteresting\u201d\u201d(insert simple question here)\u201d at least gives you more. How do people find others interesting when they can\u2019t even talk about themselves? I think once more of the students are put into positions where they are given so little to talk about and have to run with something they will start to make friends just mostly those coming to college haven\u2019t had to do that. Maybe these are just assumptions but I definitely feel like the same people asking this especially my friends who have talked to me and made posts here about this are the exact same ones asking \u201chow to meet people in college\u201d or \u201chow do I handle (insert social situation)\u201d. Idk just a thought.",

Consider the alternative, do you want to feel awkward in social situations for the rest of your life? \n\nEasiest way to start a conversation is to use the immediate situation as a foundation. Example:\n\nYesterday I went for a hot coffee at Starbucks. Girl behind the counter says, sorry the machine\u2019s broken. I only have iced coffee. I asked, Who broke the machine? She shrugged and said it happened yesterday when someone ordered hot chocolate. Machine started smoking. I laughed and said, who the hell orders a hot chocolate on the hottest day of summer? She laughed and passed me my iced coffee. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it. I have conversations like this several times a day. Some long. Some short. The key to doing this is practice practice practice and being present in the moment. You have to hear what people are saying to respond to them effectively. Over time you\u2019ll discover people you vibe with.",

Hello, here i am and I am open to people\n\nPretext: why are you talking to this person? (Please don't be so committed to being this persons friend. Its like flirting, just be happy to talk to a person)\n\n-compliments are easy, be genuine or fuck off. Good compliments are about the person not about the thing. Ie, I love your dess vs, I love your dress you have good taste, I love your dress you are so put together. \n\n-shared things, class, location, being new, shared activity (Your college has outdoor activities scheduled usually through the gym, your college has clubs, your college has a calender of events)\n\nAfter pretext ask a question. People love talking about themselves. Some are easy af what's your major? What are you taking? I bet they are taking something interesting. I took algebra 5 times. I tell everyone that says algebra... haha this is a judgment free place. Im not lying, im offering a piece of me (the key here is not being self depreciating, just being honest and open) where are you from!? (This is great im in ~conservative place~ and I found someone from ~hometown~ and so we were able to talk about ~politicized topics that are normal other places~)\n\nKeep showing up. If you do an intermural sport, excersice class or a club or a study group(Excellant pretext for getting numbers/snaps) keep going\n\nYou're not going to be friends the first time at a club (especially not if you pick clubs with fellow introverts like chem club, physics club, etc) but if you keep showing up eventually you will get to know everyone there and find out shared interests. (I used to prioritize my dumb job. Never went to the events. Few times there were parties didn't go. Just show up to all the things! I know its so dang scary but walk up to the other singular people. \"This is my first x event its cool that they do x\") \n\nIm 100% incapable of starting a conversation with an introduction. I save it for the lull in the conversation. Or I ask them their name so they have to ask me and im not just demanding to be known lol. \n\nIf its a club or whatever im like, hey ill see you next meeting. If its a study group im like gimme your number we'll set it up (I always call immediately, or send a text that says hey its btb so we are on even ground, they know is me and the line of communication is open)\n\nI am overeager probably but I own it. I am friendly and bubbly and also an introvert. Thats allowed and excepting it for what it is is freeing. I hit them up a few hours later, next day at the latest. Hey, it was so nice talking with you, here's a link to a thing I said, or was the movie you recommended \"\"? I dont like to wait because im signaling that I did enjoy talking to them and I would do it again.\n\nSnaps are easy to ask for. Because they feel less close to a person than a number. I literally just say \"omg! You should give me your snap!\" And I ALWAYS compliment their bitmoji. Because I think they are so freaking adorable. Also, they always say something... horns? Halo? Hiking boots? (You absolutely do not have to be a creep,I look but only bring it up if it sticks out, but people put effort into their avatars)\n\nHere's some more. If you say you will be at thing, be a person of your word. This is 2021, and the temptation is to text 40 minutes before a meet up and say you are doing another thing but BE A RELIABLE PERSON. I know this is college. Use your phone calender. And if you must blow off a meeting, do it AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE(but this stresses me out!, I know, try anyway, do your best) and OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE \n\n\"Im so sorry, I just got told I have a paper due, ive got to study in the resource center. I can't go to coffee tomorrow but I would love to go Saturday or Sunday of you can make it?\" If its cool they might join you to study or might do coffee the other day. \n\nBut for real, if its a first meeting, do everything in your power not to flake.",

I\u2019m also doing this with my professors if I have something to say about the lecture, which I NEVER did as a freshman, I was too scared.\n\nPeople like to talk about themselves and you\u2019ll quickly discover who matches your major, hobbies, interests, etc. I talked to someone who seemed disinterested in the class and said she was going to get drunk later. I wasn\u2019t eager to talk to her again because that\u2019s not why I\u2019m in college. In my other class I talked to a neuroscience major in her senior year who switched from pre-med. I got her number for a study group because I want to be around intelligent people who have the drive to get their degrees and be successful.",

              "text": "Yes. Yes I do. With a lot of practice it can be almost a teeny tiny itty bitty bit less hard. I still walk in my apartment and cry sometimes. I still think about the awkward thing I said or if people know that on the inside im a fucking weirdo. I also don't live in the dorm so I feel weird everytime I'm in the shared areas, an extra layer of dont belong. Activities help. Sometimes I think strangers can see into my soul and know that I'm worthless, awkward or empty. Or worse, none of those things but still somehow not worth talking to still. Can they see im self conscious? Did o talk about myself too much? No one cares about this or that...\n\nRemembering my lonely undergrad makes it worth it. Remembering sitting in the library and watching groups come and go while I ate my arbies(off-campus food I ate in the library not on-campus food I ate with other people...) in a corner and dug into subjects literally no one gives a fuck about. (Because I went from a med focused school to an ag school)\n\nSat in the basement (thats whats open till midnight) wearing headphones but still hearing the girls that work in that lab chatting to eachother. \n\nI actually had all these long distance friendships from when I used to be me (awkward, self-conscious but talkative) and I nurtured them. So it actually took me longer to realize I was lonely. I got a break up and it was like the world was pulled from under me. School ended at the same time and I was just alone in an apartment while the great walkout took away all my work acquaintances and I suddenly had just my boss, asking me why I had become a non-functional human being...\n\nSo(I can only say this for me) I saw that there might be something worse than social anxiety, and self consciousness. And it was the hours I spent with absolutely no contact with people and the months I spent not touching another person(with the exception of going to my BJJ gym and letting people beat me up, which probably stopped me from reaching a level of loneliness where I just gave up and wandered into the woods...)\n\nBut my heart still races. I still have to talk myself up. Im attractive(by conventional standards in the place im in) but I have to tell myself that, and that I'm funny and smart and ok. And that even if im none of those things, I trust in my research skills enough to believe in the books I've read about people. Praise be, to the almost formulaic way they suggest I meet people(another insidious thought, \"do they know im on a script?\") Also I tell myself other people want friends. Who the heck is like \"I have to many dang friends\"\n\nSometimes I also think I'm a human/robot construct, because humans talk to eachother... don't they? Easily even... and I look like a people and talk like a people but on the inside... uh. Im pretty sure that maybe I exist and am valid? Maybe. Probably) \n\nSo yeah... I am not being dismissive when I say, yes. I believe I know how anxious this makes you\n\nAll of this really is advice from an introvert. If you really can't handle it, pick the nerdiest club on campus and show up 5 meetings in a row. Someone will ask your name by then.",

I was sick of doing that after a while and made the effort to join a fraternity myself, and I ended up making lifelong friends.

It seems \"take the initiative and talk to people\" recommendations generally get fewer up votes than \"I'm the same way, college sucks\" responses.",
