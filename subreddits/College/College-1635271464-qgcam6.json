  "text": "I am and honestly I got so tired of doing so many writing assignments that I half ass them especially if they say type 250 words for the first post and 150 for the replying post. Like I just write and make my post sound dumb to get that many words. Surprisingly I still have As in all my classes while I\u2019m doing that. So I was wondering am I the only one that does that or do other people do that too? I despise writing since that is not my favorite subject but I still try to have my assignments done.",

Plus my high school did a poor job on teaching me how to understand how to write them. Most of my teachers would just say \u201cokay your going to write about so and so\u201d then they wouldn\u2019t bother helping me improve if I did something wrong. So I just know I need to get it done with the requirements in the rubric.",
