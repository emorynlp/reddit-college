      "text": "Biology classes are different at every college, and it depends on if you\u2019ve taken biology before (like AP bio in high school). Oftentimes intro bio classes are pretty easy if you\u2019re already somewhat familiar, but at other colleges they\u2019re really hard (especially if it\u2019s new to you).\n\nOrgo, on the other hand, is hard at every college for most people. For me, taking bio and orgo at the same time wasn\u2019t any worse than taking orgo with any other class, but orgo just sucked in general.",
