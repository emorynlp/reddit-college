Even if you were to pass a referendum or other kind of measure, would the university be likely to implement it? Also, would semesters have to begin one week earlier to accommodate the shift? Just posing questions as someone who was involved in student government in recent years.",

Well, I\u2019ve heard of some universities doing this, but the ones I\u2019ve experienced have had one or two \u201creading days.\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell you what universities do a full week of no classes.\n\nBoth as a student and now as a professor, I preferred that because it meant we had shorter overall semesters and didn\u2019t delay finals more than necessary. But that\u2019s just my opinion.\n\nHope you get some good data!",

      "text": "3 years ago, my university implemented a \"Reading Week\". Most post-secondary institutions in Canada now have reading weeks in every semester, but it depends on *when* they put the reading week. For my province, the schools under the school district system get it half way through their semester, while the universities put it 3 weeks before finals, which gives professors approximately 2 weeks to assign big assignments/projects. the last week before exams are supposed to have nothing due, but there will be lectures. Lectures in this final week are typically wrap-up sessions.",

These will be the colleges/universities that your own school compares itself to, in regards to meeting admissions/graduation/GPA criteria. \n\nWith that list of universities, just look on their websites for their academic calendars and see if they have anything called \u201creading days\u201d right before finals. \n\nThis will give you the data you\u2019re looking for in a way that your own school already uses for research purposes, so if the data shows what you want it to you\u2019ll likely have a stronger argument!",
