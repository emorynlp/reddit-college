No.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than this but i hope you can move on. I see people getting sad and all but I\u2019ve never been in love so idk. my best advice is who cares that they dumped you or broke up? There\u2019s plenty more fish in the sea. Go fish.",

Drink water, practice good hygiene, confide in friends, and walk around for a little bit. Please go to class! This is helping me a lot right now! I know your mind is elsewhere, but focusing on school is probably the best thing you can do right now because it distracts you from other things :) Also, I know it hurts, but just know, what\u2019s meant to be yours will ALWAYS come back to you or find it\u2019s way back to you. So in the meantime, focus on yourself.",
