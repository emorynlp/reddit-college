Even though you didn\u2019t ask specifically for it. \n\nAdvice:\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to change, don\u2019t waste your money on school. It\u2019s expensive, and without a degree you\u2019ll likely be making less than if you had worked harder and got one. So be smart, cut your losses now, find the best paying job you can, and don\u2019t waste any more money on school. \n\nIf you are serious about school, you\u2019ll do what needs to be done to make this degree happen. You know what it takes. There\u2019s no magic formula that will all of a sudden make you do the things you already know you need to do. Something in your mindset, your values, has to change. You have to tie your personal identity to being a good student. When school is your priority, you\u2019ll do what it takes to be successful. \n\nHow do you make school your priority?\n\nDecide that it is. Self evaluate. Look at your priorities. Be honest with yourself and understand what they are. And decide to change them. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to do that sometimes. But that\u2019s really what it takes. \n\nSorry if I sound a little harsh, but I\u2019m just trying to be real. You can do it. Anyone can do it. Decide to.",

Adderall is meant to correct the brain chemistry of people with an actual disorder, not solve a motivation problem in people who do not have that disorder. Not only can it be dangerous, but the \"try Adderall\" mentality is the reason why so many of us that truly need it have to jump through so many hoops to get it.
