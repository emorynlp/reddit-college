  "title:": "Someone in my College made a petition to suspend everyone who has been accused of sexual misconduct",
  "text": "A girl in our second year accused someone, but the legal system will take 6 months. So she started this petition, with the goal of getting everyone accused suspended until a verdict is reached. It seems mainly geared towards this one guy, but the title and text still call for all suspects to be suspended.\n\n\nIn the groupchat of my year people are angry, calling for suspension even though no proof has been shown yet. People seem to have done away with the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'. I want to support victims, but this just seems crazy!\n\n\nOn top of that, one of my best friends had also been falsely accused by a different girl (weeks before). He is having a breakdown, his depression making a swift comeback because of the accusation. I truly believe he is innocent, they hooked up multiple times, she was sober and they even showered together. But she had a boyfriend, as he found out later, so possibly she didn't want to own up to it. He has moved out of our building already on request on the uni, but still studies with us.\n\n\nWhat can I do to ensure people aren't getting suspended based on accusations alone? Is a petition like this even legal? I am personally rather upset by the amount of ire this has elicited. When I defended maybe not punishing someone without evidence I got some angry comments thrown my way.\n\n___\n\n\nEDIT: I want to put this into perspective, there is no physical protests or anything going on, just discussions in the groupchat. However, the petition now has 681 signatures. I assume most of them are just out of solidarity, but the title of the petition is ''MY UNIVERSITY to Suspend Suspects of Sexual Crimes from Education'' so it isn't exactly covert in its intentions. It is only a petition, but still.\n\n\nThere are people speaking out against this luckily, so it isn't as bad as it could be.",

      "text": "Technically it isn't illegal, as a university isn't a court of law and since a university is mostly a business, they are within their rights to throw you out even if you aren't guilty of anything and there isn't much you can do about it. That being said, it isn't like it's the end of the world, if you're suspended or expelled you can simply transfer to a different college, and while you won't be able to hang out with your friends other than that it won't effect you. \n\nIt won't effect your job opportunities as employers are looking for work experience. In the workplace it is all about your experience in the workforce, a university graduate is worthless as while a degree will tell them you know the information, you don't have any experience applying it and using it in a workplace setting, so as far as they know they will have to teach you from the ground up. As worthless as a degree is, obviously your grades, what school you went to, and any trouble you managed to get in really doesn't matter. Since you're fresh out of college, you're pretty much worthless and a student who went Harvard and got straight A's is the same in their eyes as someone who went to podunk college and got C's.",

It's such a scary precedent to set. Democracy without legal processes behind it is terrifying--it feels as though mob rule is taking over my campus.\n\nA kid I know was added to the list--no one knows why or who added him, he's in a happy relationship, doesn't drink or attend parties, but now all of a sudden people tell me to stay away from him because he's a perpetrator. It's absolute slander--who the fuck are we as a student body to judge a persons entire existence based upon one anonymous student report to a student organization?!",

Honestly, saying sorry and being super sincere may diffuse the situation (if your friend is actually innocent). Often these kinds of people just want to know that they are heard and that you are sorry. Have a rational talk, do not accuse her of anything, but try to see her point of view so it can be refuted.\n\nThat being said, I also think you and your friend need to talk. The truth is, as someone else mentioned, false accusations are pretty rare ( or at least based on some form of truth). Do not go to bat for your friend just because \"he's a really great guy and said he did not do it.\" This could put you in a bad place as well.

But if you would like to take a stand against it, I would suggest finding out if it isn't possible to be involved in the conversation if a conversation about this ever happens. \n\nAs for your friend. I'm going to be downvoted to hell for this, but false accusations are not very common despite the nonsense and cherry-picked studies you read on reddit. I can talk about this forever if you like, but that isn't the point of what I am trying to say. \n\nStatistically it is more likely your friend might actually be guilty. I don't think you're a bad judge of character, and I don't actually think your friend is guilty. I don't know what happened and I wasn't there. But the reason rapists so often go free is because the people around them absolutely refuse to even consider the possibility that a person they know did something wrong. I want you to take a long look at the situation with unbiased eyes and maybe even ask other unbiased people for their opinions on the details of what your friend says happend vs what the accuser says happened. \n\nThe reason I say this is because if your friend is guilty, you going to the college to speak on his behalf will look very bad. You have an understandable worry here with petetions to suspend people, but if you use your friend as a motivation for this it would absolutely backfire. Either don't mention him if you choose to be involved, and make sure people won't find out about it, or decide for yourself whether or not you can trust what he's told you and go from there.  ",

But, you still need to be careful where you step. \n\nWhile you're there, avoid contact with any female that falls outside of the classroom and study groups. Keep everything professional. The women in your class will attempt to character assassinate once they realize that you're not giving them power over you by attempting to date or have consensual sex with them. They'll likely label you an incel or homosexual. That's ok. \n\nThat's fine. Wear it like a badge of honor. Do your partying off campus at unaffiliated residences/bars/whatever.\n\nIf you want to date/have sex find yourself a woman that is 15 - 20 years your senior. Date her while you're going to college. She'll eagerly satisfy all of your carnal needs on demand. She'll pay for most of your dates. She'll also act as a mentor to you and generally have your best interests at heart. Dating a significantly older woman is a completely different dynamic than dating one of your contemporaries. She wants you for sex. She knows you want her for sex. There's little worry about the \"future\" because her life is likely already established and she's using you for physical satisfaction as much as you are her. Each encounter is purely for the enjoyment of the moment. Neither person has the expectation of making a life long partner out of the other so that dynamic is not there there way it is with your contemporaries. ",

Honestly, in the US some universities do have a policy where being accused of rape can get you expelled, which is stupid considering the fact that not all accusations are true.

I mean even when the accusations are proven to be false, the person's reputation remains the same, and their life remains ruined. It just isn't right. Honestly, if you're going to falsely accuse somebody of committing such a heinous act against you, you clearly have no humanity. Whether it's online, to the police, or the media, you're one fucked up individual and there's a very special place in Hell for you. You are ruining lives, and taking credibility away from the true victims, who the majority of the time are already too scared to report rape as it is.

Individuals such as yourself are so determined to see a social-Issue addressed and corrected that they neglect to view the consequences to their actions just because it hinders their vision for justice.\n\nJust because the false accusations are a minority, doesn\u2019t mean that they are nonexistent or nor worthy of addressing. No one should have to have the start of their life ruined or dragged in the mud because of a false accusation. It is beyond immoral to say it\u2019s ok or that it\u2019s just a result of justice for that to happen. \n\nWhatever assault may have occurred should be determined to be true or false by the criminal justice system. Just as she maybe wouldn\u2019t like if  the accused in question started a petition saying bar/ban all accusers from campus or campus-activities during an investigation, she shouldn\u2019t seek more publicity and/or undue influence on the matter to occur, ultimately tainting the criminal justice system she supposedly supports. \n\nOn your ridicule of the main campus issue portion of the original comment, there is without a doubt a despicable rise in relentless, unwarranted, and illogically-dangerous protests and cultures developing on campuses throughout the country that degrades the open-forum to which college is meant to function as. These same advocates, SJWs, etc. reject the free speech of others and the presence of facts alike the far-right when they follow feelings instead of logic in shunning people without proper review of their background and views. These same menaces believe that their stances are absolute truths and therefore seek to ban the attendance of speakers that challenge such undeniably biased views through tense protests and chaos. \n\nAlike the minority of cases you mentioned in regards to false-accusers, these same individuals I describe as a minority as well matter and must be addressed promptly and adequately because they matter, even if their population is small. \n\nThat\u2019s a fundamental part of U.S. democracy, we all matter despite controversy or disdain and the only way we function as a community is to engage in proper modes of communication and allow for unabridged justice by the governance we have set in place for the people and by the people. This process in question should not be muddied or scrutinized without just factual reasoning. ",

                  "text": "The issue comes when your first reaction is to question the victim's validity in such a noble pursuit of \"facts and logic\" rather than to empathize with her and accuse the assaulter. This is all too common a theme whenever I see this issue pop up on reddit. Although both are not favorable, the truth is it is so much worse to be sexually assaulted than it is to be falsely accused. Whoever denies this simply has zero empathy and is extremely sheltered from people in the real world.\n\nThe miniscule amount of false accusations are a necessary consequence of the greater culture behind sexual assault. I say this because if we continue to focus on the false accusations, condemning victims and telling them to \"think before they speak,\" then they will seldom accuse their assaulters. Not all sexual assaults are cut and dry, raper rapist, black and white cases. Most come at at least some fault to both parties. Maybe they were both drunk, maybe she was leading him on, but no matter what, if she was sexually assaulted, she was still **sexually assaulted.**But if the culture around sexual assaults is to blame the victim, she will overthink herself. She might say, \"no, I can't come out about this, I did lead him on.\" This can't happen. This means that sexual assaulter gets to continue freely without consequence and without learning from his action. This means that another woman will be subjected to this man.\n\nThis is already the case with a lot of sexual assaults. In many instances women do not report their sexual assaults for the exact reason that they are not confident that they will not receive backlash for an action as simple as **reporting their own rape.** If this isn't a human rights violation I don't know what is.
