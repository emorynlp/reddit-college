So she started this petition, with the goal of getting everyone accused suspended until a verdict is reached. It seems mainly geared towards this one guy, but the title and text still call for all suspects to be suspended.\n\n\nIn the groupchat of my year people are angry, calling for suspension even though no proof has been shown yet. People seem to have done away with the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty'. I want to support victims, but this just seems crazy!\n\n\nOn top of that, one of my best friends had also been falsely accused by a different girl (weeks before). He is having a breakdown, his depression making a swift comeback because of the accusation. I truly believe he is innocent, they hooked up multiple times, she was sober and they even showered together. But she had a boyfriend, as he found out later, so possibly she didn't want to own up to it. He has moved out of our building already on request on the uni, but still studies with us.\n\n\nWhat can I do to ensure people aren't getting suspended based on accusations alone? Is a petition like this even legal? I am personally rather upset by the amount of ire this has elicited. When I defended maybe not punishing someone without evidence I got some angry comments thrown my way.\n\n___\n\n\nEDIT: I want to put this into perspective, there is no physical protests or anything going on, just discussions in the groupchat. However, the petition now has 681 signatures. I assume most of them are just out of solidarity, but the title of the petition is ''MY UNIVERSITY to Suspend Suspects of Sexual Crimes from Education'' so it isn't exactly covert in its intentions. It is only a petition, but still.\n\n\nThere are people speaking out against this luckily, so it isn't as bad as it could be.", "author": null, "created": 1552744776, "retrieved": 1632802543, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 857, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"eiqusxe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/b1sq05/someone_in_my_college_made_a_petition_to_suspend/eiqusxe/", "text": "welcome to feminism!", "author": "dontbeabitchok", "created": 1552845893, "upvotes": 0}, "eiqe08b": {"link": "/r/college/comments/b1sq05/someone_in_my_college_made_a_petition_to_suspend/eiqe08b/", "text": "Accuse the woman that made the petition of sexual misconduct.\n\nProblem solved.\n\n&#x200B;", "author": null, "created": 1552833471, "upvotes": 1}, "eiq9ogy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/b1sq05/someone_in_my_college_made_a_petition_to_suspend/eiq9ogy/", "text": "object to it in your chat group. tell peo\u011fle its wrong to suspend people for just being accused.", "author": "14b755fe39", "created": 1552829727, "upvotes": 2}, "eipzoha": {"link": "/r/college/comments/b1sq05/someone_in_my_college_made_a_petition_to_suspend/eipzoha/", "text": "Find a way to get that shit shut down or else half of the college will be empty because everyone will accuse each other left and right.", "author": "Ironwarrior29", "created": 1552816376, "upvotes": 1}, "eipqlqr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/b1sq05/someone_in_my_college_made_a_petition_to_suspend/eipqlqr/", "text": "Technically it isn't illegal, as a university isn't a court of law and since a university is mostly a business, they are within their rights to throw you out even if you aren't guilty of anything and there isn't much you can do about it.

You have an understandable worry here with petetions to suspend people, but if you use your friend as a motivation for this it would absolutely backfire. Either don't mention him if you choose to be involved, and make sure people won't find out about it, or decide for yourself whether or not you can trust what he's told you and go from there.
