You need to actually sleep and take care of yourself. You were looking forward to this time, so you better take advantage of it. I know, you are only home for a limited time and you want to see all your friends. That's cool. But take some small time to actually take care of yourself.\n\n\\- If you are spending it at home, then please spend some time hanging out with your parents and family. If you got them nearby, go see your grandparents. Looking back, I wish I would have just spent a bit more time with my mom when I was home.\n\n\\- Check your grades. Celebrate, cry, ponder, but take a moment to really look at where you are and see if you are doing as you expect. Not liking your classes? Still want to major in that? Is this your 3rd time taking a course? Sit down and really evaluate where you are, and if you are taking the right steps to get to where you think you want to go.\n\n\\- Check on your funds. Those of you that are lucky to have your parents pay for your education, please do not take it for granted. If you know you are going to be short for the next semester, look at job options, loans, and any possible scholarships. Mapping out how much you are going to owe before you start can put you in a better position.\n\n\\- If you are considering not going back to school, like you are for sure not going back, TELL SOMEONE. You do not need a big fat bill showing up on your doorstep because you failed to withdraw the correct way. Tell admissions, tell a family member, and talk to someone. Do not assume that this will be taken care of.\n\n\\- If you are feeling down over break, find someone to talk to. Yes, it is okay to text a friend and say \"Hey, if you got a minute to talk or hang, I would really appreciate it. I am not doing well right now.\" Reach out to people. Talk it out. Do not bottle things up. Help is out there.\n\n\\- If your graduation is in the upcoming year, or you know you are going to be doing a lot of interviews soon, make sure you got a professional sounding email and an updated resume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy the rest of your break!", "author": "tacotaco92", "created": 1545930000, "retrieved": 1632947382, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 978, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ecpmjb2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/aa0w4d/just_a_few_things_to_consider_while_on_break/ecpmjb2/", "text": "Help i cant sleep more than 6 hours my body is not convinced that i have a break", "author": "Akm_s", "created": 1545976026, "upvotes": 1}, "ecp7vkb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/aa0w4d/just_a_few_things_to_consider_while_on_break/ecp7vkb/", "text": "Christmas has made me broke ", "author": "BroncoNuggets", "created": 1545963043, "upvotes": 3}, "ecp3gtn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/aa0w4d/just_a_few_things_to_consider_while_on_break/ecp3gtn/", "text": "I'll add my part here too: \n\nWhen applying for scholarships during the stress of classes, work, and other responsibilities, remember putting them off because you had something else to do?

It'll give you a head start on the classes so you're less stressed out.

Treat winter break like a chance to get ahead on next semester's classes and save the fun till spring break and you'll be way less stressed out.
