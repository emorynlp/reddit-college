  "text": "The apartment I'm looking at starts at $1325. There are a few others but they're a couple hundred more. This seems like way too much but at the same time it's the cheapest housing around. Now this is in a pretty wealthy city in California so no matter what it's gonna be expensive. But just out of curiosity, how much are you spending (or willing to) on rent. Have a nice day.",

Probably could have gone cheaper but i would have ended up paying for laundry/pet rent separately and had to deal with a faceless corporate entity rather than a landlady that I\u2019ve actually met.",
