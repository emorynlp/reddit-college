  "title:": "PLEASE help!! What are my chances of getting accepted?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! I am looking for honest and realistic answers, don't be afraid to hurt my feelings. I am wondering what my chances would be at acceptance to selective colleges. I have a list of 20 schools and am looking to narrow it down. I tried to talk to my counselor about my chances of getting accepted into ivies or prestigious schools in order to remove a majority of them, but he wasn't much help. He told me I could get in anywhere I wanted, which I know is not true. So please be brutally honest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY STATS:\n\n\\- Senior; female; white \n\n\\- public high school with a graduating class of 349\n\n\\- We do decile ranking instead of exact, but my counselor told me I am ranked 1. I can't technically include that in my application, but he said he would try to add it to his recommendation letter if he remembered. Otherwise, top 10%. \n\n\\- ACT: 34 (E 35, S 35, M 35, R 29) ( I know my reading score is low- will this impact my chances a lot? I'm going into STEM, so I'm hoping it doesn't have that large of an impact) \n\n\\- GPA UW: 3.99 GPA W: 4.236 (we do weighted GPAs on a lesser scale than most schools, but I've gotten straight As thus far, with one A- in AP biology. I've taken 5 APs so far, and am enrolled in 5 this year) \n\n\\- ECs: \n\nvarsity hockey for 4 years, captain for 2 years \n\nvolunteered at a hospital specialty care center (digestive care) this summer assisting some nurses and doctors. I think it sounds better than what I actually did- I really just cleaned rooms and medical instruments and sometimes escorted patients.  \n\nVolunteer at the same hospital this year, but being a patient/guest escort and working at the front desk \n\nfounder and president of a women in STEM club at my school (just started it this year, unfortunately)\n\nAmbassador of an online non-profit organization that spreads accurate information about health sciences, medicine and pretty much anything that deals with the human body and FAQ (11th and 12th)\n\nI have been a volunteer youth hockey coach/mentor for 4 years. \n\nI was a volunteer assistant elementary school teacher this summer \n\nI volunteer at a local food shelf (11th and 12th)\n\nMember of a club that just started this year which brings special and general ed students together. also a senior leader at our school student-run coffee shop which is basically a part of this club since the special education students work there\n\nPlayed varsity tennis from 9-11th, quit this year because I didn't like it and wanted more time for school and hockey (my main interests)  \njob at a restaurant \n\nno research unfortunately, couldn't find anything I was eligible for \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know my extracurriculars are pretty weak because some of them feel out of place and not super important, but I do just love volunteering in general and being a part of things. \n\nsome schools I am thinking about applying to are:\n\nharvard, boston u, boston c, northeastern, tufts, amherst, Williams, brown, and case western\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI honestly think I couldn't get into any colleges sub 20% acceptance rate (anything below 30% being a reach), so you won't hurt my feelings if you agree with that. I would just love to hear some honest opinions, as my counselor, friends, and parents are telling me I could go anywhere. I probably won't even apply to harvard because there's no chance getting accepted there, but it is a dream school.",

          "text": "sorry, I don't use Reddit often so I just chose the biggest sub related to college. I will delete it from here. I promise I am not trying to compliment fish, I really don't think I could get into any ivies or really prestigious schools. I have been watching a bunch of youtube videos of kids going over their stats for the schools I want to get into and they are way more qualified than me. They seem to have competitive research internships, math or science olympiads, president of like 5 important clubs, jobs related to their major interest, etc. I know my GPA is strong and my ACT is fairly strong for very competitive schools,  I just didn't think I had anything majorly impressive for my ecs.",
