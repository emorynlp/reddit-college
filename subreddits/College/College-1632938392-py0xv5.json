      "text": "It depends on how involved you are with each one and how often do they meet. There are some that maybe do events like once a month and it is not a big deal if you attend or not. Other clubs are much more time intensive, or are set up in a way where you cannot just drop in whenever. Get on the email list for all three and then attend meetings and events based on your schedule. Also learn to prioritize which clubs you attend when short on time.",

      "text": "How much time would each club take? Is it the kind of club that would be a couple hours a week and you only do thing within a meeting, or is it the kind that would require you dedicating a large portion of your time and would have you working on things outside of meetings? See how much free time you already have, then take into consideration how much time your job would take. Don't forget about homework time and time just to relax. How much time do you have leftover? Is it worth it to you to join those clubs? Or maybe just one instead of all three?",
