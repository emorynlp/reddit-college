  "text": "I applied in October and the deadline was Nov 1st. I already got an acceptance today. They didn\u2019t say anything about my major or anything. Does that mean I didn\u2019t get in or will they send something out later? I don\u2019t know because it only took 11 days for my application to be processed so maybe they decide later?",
