  "text": "I\u2019ve always been a night owl, but when I first got to college (I\u2019m a freshman), I had the best sleep schedule I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019d naturally get tired by 11:30 PM and wake up without an alarm or even feeling tired at like 9:30 AM. I think it was because I was super homesick the first few days and that was so emotionally and physically tiring. Then I got COVID early on so I had to be sent home, and this is where things started getting worse. Once I came back, I was going to bed at like 2 AM and having a little difficulty getting up for my earliest class (at 11:15 AM), but I never skipped it to sleep.\n\nI went home for a weekend early in October, and ever since then, my sleep schedules been the worst it\u2019s ever been. I struggle to fall asleep before 6 AM and wake up before 3 PM and even have not been able to get a single second of sleep 2 nights in the past week, including last night. Obviously, it\u2019s extremely difficult to get myself out of bed after 4ish hours of sleep without my mom making sure I get up.\n\nI\u2019ve tried melatonin and get consistent cardio, but nothing helps. It\u2019s really frustrating because I had an exam today and it\u2019s pretty much pointless to take an exam after being awake for more than 24 hours. Does anyone have any advice? It\u2019s also affecting my mental health - I feel awful sleeping until 3/4 PM, missing my classes, and being awake for 3 hours of sunlight.",

      "text": "Ive found that all it takes to fix a fucked up sleep schedule is to stay just awake until your desired bed time, so like, if you normally go to bed at 6 am, force yourself to stay awake, no matter how tired/sleepy you are, and stay awake until 11pm, or whatever your goal to be asleep by is",

          "text": "I\u2019ve tried that before (not recently) and I always just slept for a crazy amount of time so it didn\u2019t do too much.\n\nI might try going to bed at like 7 PM so I\u2019ll probably sleep until like 9 AM.",
