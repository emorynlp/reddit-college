  "text": "Tomorrow is the last day academic day of college. Next I'll be in college for my graduation maybe and some exams. As this semester has come to end, I'm friendships are on deathbed too. I have almost become a loner. \nToday I got to know that tmrw is the last day and it hit me hard. I never knew I'd be kinda alone this day, this will turn out this way. \nIs there anything that I can do to make it happy? Or not show up? I don't know what to do.",
