  "text": "I hate college so far, I have no freinds, it fucking sucks being here. All thats here is stress and misery I have no time for videogames or hobbies or anything that does'nt make me want to blow my brains out, only homework and studying and I only have 16 credit hours and no job. Its fall break and all im allowed to do is study and school work and it sucks and I hate it. And its pretty much meaningless because my grades still suck even though im not failing. I know the college experience yoi see on tv ia unrealistic but damn, this is the worst month or two of my life. Idk what to do I hate it here but I cant drop out I have no other oppurtunities, not even a drivers license. Anybody else?",

Unfortunately your reward is the classes can get harder but you know you can hang in there so that's alright.",

Life sucks, college sucks, jobs suck, your boss will suck (and not in the good way), and waking up each morning to rinse and repeat is going to suck. That being said, you have a goal, yes? You need that flimsy piece of paper that says you paid x amount of dollars and passed enough classes to get the job you want. Friends won't help you pass that class except for giving you an ego boost or sitting next to you while you study. You can get that anywhere. Call your favorite family member to sit on the phone with you if you need so you have someone to listen while you think aloud. As an adult, I'll tell you what I do when my life feels like someone is having a laugh at my expense somewhere in the nether: breathe, picture where you want to be at the end of this daunting process, and then do whatever it takes to get there. Get some coffee and pull up your big kid panties, make that fun snappy sound with the elastic and go kick some college ass. College is temporary, your dreams, goals and life are forever. You will get through this and you WILL make it. Now go make that happen. Be the person who makes their dreams come true.",

That's kind of what I was going towards. Finding the encouragement to keep pushing yourself toward your goal so you can have those blissfully wonderful moments that make those sucky moments worth the suffering. I would suggest seeing someone to talk to about how you are feeling about life in general because your mental health is important, and your life was granted to you by whatever gods you worship to make an impact on this earth. I hope that some sunlight peaks through the gloom for you.",

      "text": "Hi there! I started college about three months ago, and can definitely sympathize. I don't have much time for breaks, and I usually have classes, labs, and meetings from 9 am - 8 pm. This is, unfortunately, the college grind. But, it's important to find something you're passionate about, preferably in what you're studying, so you have something to look forward to everyday. It also serves as motivation in relation to what you might want to do in the future. \n\nMost importantly, working on your mental health is incredibly important. I currently suffer with anxiety and OCD, and my symptoms vary depending on situations. I try my best to mediate these symptoms by immersing myself in relaxing environments. In the beginning of college, I was really lonely. I searched up so many videos on YouTube about how to cope with being lonely and essentially isolated myself. Later on, I did end up finding friends to my surprise, but I still enjoy my alone time. The point is, along with completing my assignments and studying for tests, I also worked on self care (although to a lesser extent than I wanted to). This will sound clich\u00e9, but you need to learn how to love yourself to keep on moving forward. Relationships will tear apart, exams might not go well, and you might be frustrated at life in its entirety. But, you need to find a good support system, reflect, move on, and rise from these challenges with a stable mindset. It's exceedingly difficult, don't get me wrong, and it will take time. I still struggle a lot with existential crises and anxiety attacks, but the frequency of those issues have decreased. Just know that you're not alone in this battle, and it will get better day by day as you adapt and adjust. Give college a chance. You might find that things will turn around!\n\nIf you ever want someone to talk to, just message me! Please take care of yourself, and enjoy your fall break.",

It's not that they aren't easy, but these courses tend to have so much more mundane work and assignment loads than major requirements. Once you get through your prereqs, I promise it gets better.",

Join a club, that\u2019s a good way to meet people and get to do something you enjoy. You can\u2019t study all day without taking time for yourself. You\u2019ll just burn yourself out \n\nAlso if you\u2019re studying that much for just for gen-Ed classes you\u2019re probably not studying correctly. The saying goes \u201cstudy smarter, not harder\u201d. Rereading everything and taking notes on every little detail won\u2019t help you. If you\u2019re trying to stuff too much information into your brain, you\u2019re going to burn yourself out and forget most of what you learned. Focus on the big picture and not the small details, and take practice tests and do lots of practice questions. A few pages of practice questions will help you a lot more than hours of studying and memorizing. \n\nGood luck!",
