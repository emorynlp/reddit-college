  "title:": "Still working on an assignment that\u2019s almost 3 weeks late for a major class",
  "text": "Basically this assignment involved me interviewing someone else in my career field and writing out the complete interview as an assignment, which is a fuck ton of work on its own. But we\u2019re told to prioritize our major classes.\n\nIt was super hard to find a common time to meet with this person but eventually I got the chance, I just had to miss a day of my class that this assignment is for, which set me back heavily because it\u2019s a one-day-a-week class. And so instead of completing this assignment when it was only a day late, I was busy catching myself up to prepare for an upcoming assignment in the same class and this late assignment has just been on the back burner for almost 3 weeks. \n\nI\u2019ve started to complete it but I just don\u2019t know how my professor will react when I submit it. Honestly I don\u2019t expect any credit but I think I just need to do it for some weird completion satisfaction. Idk.\n\nThis interview was a solid 30 minutes and typing that out is a nightmare but I used voice to text on my laptop and that helped but now I have to go through and edit all 10 pages of the interview bc voice to text gets so off on the words lmao \n\nI just want to catch up and watch Halloween movies, ugh\n\nHappy October, everyone \ud83d\udc80\ud83e\udde1",
