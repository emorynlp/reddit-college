  "text": "TItle is pretty self explanatory I just transferred to a new school into a harder degree and am failing almost all of my courses. I haven't been going to class at all and am going to receive 3 F's. My GPA was already kinda bad due to the covid semester and now it's plummeting even more. I'm absolutely horrified to tell my parents and feel like a huge piece of shit. I have no idea what this means for me going forward in school or even if I will continue. This semester has been really bad for my mental health, but I feel like my parents won't really buy that (I don't even know if I buy that tbh) just feel kinda worthless overall and really unsure of the steps forward.",
