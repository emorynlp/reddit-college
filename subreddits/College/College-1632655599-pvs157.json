It helped me really solidify what I want in life and broaden my horizon. It also helped me build more confidence in acknowledging my strengths and that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid of advancing educationally and career wise. I never had much confidence in my abilities to succeed in an higher education environment but looking at my GPA and my grades, I absolutely can! Plus English is my second language and German my first, so I am very proud of myself for doing all this in an language that is foreign to me. I moved to the US just about 7 years ago. I\u2019m in my thirties and would have never thought that I would be going to college. In Germany we have vocational programs for specific careers so someone doesn\u2019t really need to go to a university. Currently I am pursuing my BBA in HR management and after that I plan to attend law school.

I know that while i have been dealt a shitty hand, i know i can pick and choose the cards to use to work towards a better one.

Growing up I dealt with a fairly problematic home life (my parents tried to raise me and my siblings, but in a lot of ways they just sucked at it lol) and I felt like a complete outcast in school, which over time created some serious mental health issues that weren\u2019t being treated because I didn\u2019t have anyone I felt safe confiding to.\n\nSo I went into college my freshman year with virtually no friends or family I felt like I could rely on, and with severe anxiety to boot. Not the best way to kick things off, I\u2019d say. But I knew I was only going to start college once, so I told myself that no matter what I was gonna force myself to talk to people and to talk to people as much as I physically could. \n\nI registered for my college\u2019s marching band over the summer, which gave me ten or so days of me and a hundred-something other people dying in 95 degree heat from 9 am to 10 pm during band camp before classes started. The first couple days, I was barely talking to anyone. I didn\u2019t quite click with the people in my section, and I didn\u2019t get much of a chance to talk to others in the band because we were just so busy all the time. I started feeling the same sort of despair I had always felt. \n\nBut one night I was talking to one of the other freshmen, and he mentioned that a lot of the others had already exchanged numbers. Ordinarily I would think something along the lines of \u201cwell, fuck, everyone is already hitting it off, I guess I\u2019m just not meant to have friends\u201d and go off to have a breakdown in my room (or something to that effect, oof), but I knew this was my best chance to start talking to people outside of my section, so I asked him if he could add my number to the group chat they had going, and that\u2019s how I started talking to the best friends I\u2019ve ever had. Once I had that friend group, I started to build up enough confidence that my social awkwardness melted away (well enough of it at least, I\u2019m not a social butterfly by any means and I\u2019m fine with that lol). \n\nThe mental health issues that had built up to that point absolutely did *not* go away on their own, but I felt comfortable enough to open up to my two closest friends about it, and I started a long and painful journey to work on my mental health. A lot of mistakes were made, and friendships were tested in ways that very many aren\u2019t, but my friends were too important to me and I was too important to my friends not to keep working on myself, so I\u2019m at a point now where my mental health is fairly good (but by no means perfect!) and I\u2019m comfortable enough to spend time alone, with friends, or being outgoing with new people, whatever the circumstances call for in the moment. I even managed to rekindle a friendship from high school that I value immensely, and I feel somewhat closer to my dad and my brothers than before (although my mom is still being held back by mental health issues of her own, so a lot of work is still needed for that particular relationship).\n\nMy life has improved immensely since I started college two years ago.
