  "text": "No matter what I tell my myself I cant accept my writing as on the level of a college student. It is not the writing itself, i can write just fine but each time i critique it to hell and tell myself it looks like something a middle schooler wrote. How to get out this rut and not worry about how ill do on my writing and be confident in my ability to write? I have a paper due tommorrow and I can't stop mentally beating myself up over how it is going so far.",
