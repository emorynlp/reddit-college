Someone asked me yesterday if I was ready for the exam next week and I froze. I haven't revised at all  in fact, I'd not even considered really it was coming up to October. \n\nI am really stressed as one of them is a whole module I missed because of \"distanced learning\" in the pandemic.\n\nAny advice on how to smash this in 6 days is welcome. I says six because I want to try and rest the day before as much as possible. \n\nThanks in advance!", "author": "JellyBunnyx", "created": 1632658097, "retrieved": 1632800260, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heceeva": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvsldu/is_6_days_too_short_to_study_a_module/heceeva/", "text": "Honestly if you have any kind of proof of what you dealt with, I would let the professor know. He or she will probably give you more time. I get that you may not wanna put your business out there but your professor may be super understanding and try to help you out with an extension. If you give a valid excuse and can back it up, you\u2019d be surprised at how understanding professors can be.", "author": "Coffeeislife1119", "created": 1632663016, "upvotes": 1}}}
