  "text": "So I am going into college fall of 2022. ( I am a senior in high school right now) I am going into a community college that has \u201chousing\u201d instead of dorms. Basically this means that I get my own room but have to share the kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom with three other people. I just need some advice on guests in my dorm room. Can I have guests that aren\u2019t going to said college or not? My boyfriend and I and also my cousin were talking about like sleepovers. My boyfriend is going to the same college as me but he won\u2019t be living there. Any answers or advice would be helpful :).",

If you are going to have guests over often make sure you and roommates talk about it first and layout the ground rules for the year.",
