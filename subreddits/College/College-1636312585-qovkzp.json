  "text": "So I completely forgot about an assignment that\u2019s due tonight\u2026I have been preoccupied finishing two books so I can write a paper about them and forgot about this other assignment\u2026.it\u2019s also a reading assignment so I have to read a very long chapter and write a summary, usually 2 pages and it\u2019s worth only 10 points. We do these every other week. I\u2019m just overwhelmed because the class I need to write the paper for is due by tomorrow midnight and I\u2019ve only finished one book so far and about to start the second\u2026So i feel I should focus on that and not even do the other smaller assignment. \n\nI have a 91% currently in that class so idk if 10 points is going to do anything drastic to my grade\u2026",

      "text": "I mean, you basically have three options. \n\n1) Not submitting, least effort but least points. \n\n2) Half-assing it, more effort with the potential for slightly more points, especially if it\u2019s largely a completion grade. \n\n3) Asking for an extension, depending on the teacher they may grant one, but at least even if you get a zero, the teacher knows you cared. \n\n3b) Do the assignment late, and take your chances.\n\nGoodluck!",

      "text": "One suggestion I have is using digital planners to keep track of assignments and utilize better time management. While it may only be a ten-point assignment, it doesn't look good not to turn it in. I have been using digital planners for over two semesters to help manage my time and task completion progress to ensure I'm where I need to be. Try not to make a habit of not handling small assignments; the points add up rather quickly. A word of advice if you can work ahead on the papers and readings that are assigned in your courses, do so. While this may amp up the stress and overwhelming pressure, this does give you time to make sure everything is handed in.",
