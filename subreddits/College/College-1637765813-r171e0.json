Here is the description of the course; \n\nhttps://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0mGgZLKuIko66M\n\nNow I have a 98 in intermediate algebra as of right now, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s actually going to be on the curriculum so I can be ready. It would be a delight if anyone who had taken a course like this is able to tell me what is going to be on the curriculum. Any thoughts or recommendations on textbooks, apps that will help me to get ready?",
