I'm currently working on an assignment about The Hobbit, about how a chapter contributes to Bilbo's character development. Right now, I have stated that this event helps the character grow. (Killing the spider and saving the dwarves helps Bilbo's character development.) Now, the problem is, I just don't know how to explain...how it contributed to his development. Like, what it did to change him. Sorry that this is a terrible explanation of my question (which kind of makes sense since I'm asking how to explain things well). To summarize; how do you explain how evidence proves a point in an argumentative essay? Thank you if you can help! I can also provide further information/explanation if you need it.", "author": "npojg", "created": 1632610789, "retrieved": 1632945981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hea44t9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhj7j/how_to_write_a_good_explanation_in_an_essay/hea44t9/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1632612704, "upvotes": 3}}}
