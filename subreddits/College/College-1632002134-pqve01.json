  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman majoring in business and a minor in marketing. The reality of going to college and getting a good paying job is always on my mind and stresses me out, I know I have a lot of time before I have to get a job but I\u2019m paranoid. I want to do something in the tech/video game market with my degree but I want some advice from someone that went through the same issues. Where did you end up and are you happy, does your job pay the bills. Sorry if it\u2019s too much but I always worry myself about stuff life this. Thanks everyone",
