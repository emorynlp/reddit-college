  "text": "If this isn\u2019t the right place to submit this, lemme know and I\u2019ll delete it :D\n\nLong story short: I was in my second year and I submitted an unfinished assignment purely just to meet the deadline, I ended up getting 30% on it.\nBefore the resubmission happened though, I ended up taking an interruption to study, which means that I stop uni/assignments/classes but I am still on the course. It ended up being long enough that my university told me I should just redo second year.\n\nMy question is, will I get in trouble for plagiarism if I reuse my old assignment?\n\nQuick note: I\u2019m pretty sure the government are repaying the tuition fees for this year via student finance loans, but I\u2019m not 100% sure",
