Once I\u2019m ready to ask for a limit increase I usually ask every month until I\u2019m approved, once I\u2019m approved I wait 3-6 months before I start asking again. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask with Discover because its a soft pull on your credit. You can also get auto limit increases if you don\u2019t ask but they aren\u2019t as common.\n\nIf you want to build the limit, use as much of the limit as you can and pay it off fully each month. If they see you using all $500 and paying all $500 off each month they\u2019ll be more willing to give an increase",
