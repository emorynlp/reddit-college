  "text": "any advice on how to deal with getting sick in college? \n\nspring semester barely started and i have strep and a fever. i eat healthy, get enough sleep, and always wash my hands so it\u2019s probably just from living in close contact with people in the dorms? it wouldn\u2019t be fair to go to class and infect everyone else but i have attendance grades in every single class and i know if i don\u2019t go to lecture i will fall behind. being sick in high school was just like \u201coh cool i get to stay home and watch tv all day\u201d and i could make up assignments whenever i wanted to but if you miss class in college you\u2019re kinda fucked, you can\u2019t turn in anything late or get back attendance points. i also have to drag myself over to the dining hall when i can barely stand. i hate this, i just want to go home :/",

Email the teacher(s) and see if they can ask someone in the class to record the lecture if not. Most lectures are pretty much supplementary. At least, this is my experience. You're supposed to do the readings/assignments, and then the lecture is for follow-up, more depth, questions, review. What I'm saying is that you can just do the readings and you'll gain probably about as much as you would from the lectures.\n\nCertainly that's not always the case, though. If it's not, look at the syllabus and see what was planned for the period. Learn it on your own. \n\nAll else fails, you could just email your teachers and ask what topics they plan to cover in the period, so you can do some learning while you're sick.\n\nPersonally I'm a pretty average student, and would probably just take the hit. If you want good grades though, don't be like me.",
