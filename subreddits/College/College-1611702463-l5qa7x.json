Those positions getting bonuses/raises are a lot different than most faculty positions in the sense that they are more performance oriented and based on creating value. The school pays well for a head of marketing or university president because they expect that it will pay itself back and more via enrollment and alumni donations. So you have to consider it in terms of what they are getting back from the investment and not just what they are paying to keep those people. The net benefit is generally supposed to be positive even when they pay them a ton of money. It might not always end up like that, but generally that happens if the board is picking good people. They might get paid $300,000 more than a faculty member but they might also bring in a few extra million to the university each year compared to other people they could have hired (this is the goal when they look for a president, at least).\n\nUniversities have a board of regents or trustees and those people oversee the hiring of university presidents. They are tasked to do what is best for the university in the long-term and that often includes paying more for a certain person when it makes sense as an investment.
