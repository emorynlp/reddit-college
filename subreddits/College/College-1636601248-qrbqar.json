  "text": "I\u2019d rather be dragged around by a horse for an hour than take College math. \nI\u2019m stuck on what to do/where to go. I want to major in Criminal Justice and was considering a Trade but Trades don\u2019t offer higher degrees. I\u2019m strictly online as I work full time.\nI don\u2019t fully understand the whole process behind college graduation credits and don\u2019t even know how feasible it is to graduate without general studies. All I know is i don\u2019t want to \u201cwaste\u201d 2 years on general studies and rather just dive into the degree i want. \n\nAny recommendations on Colleges or even a Trade that doesn\u2019t require them? Not too picky, either. Just want my CJ degree.",
