      "text": "Nope. Unfortunately everything you worked so hard for is like your silver bullet to getting your job after college. But you only get one. Everything after that is based on your work experience and accomplishments on the job/ in the field and very very less about school grades or academic accomplishments (unless the position requires something very specific).\n\nPS- this would apply for traditional students going to college right after high school then a job right after college. For those like me who returned to school later in life, grades don\u2019t matter \u201ctoo\u201d much given you already have work experience prior (assuming) however it does matter significantly if you plan on going to grad school.",
