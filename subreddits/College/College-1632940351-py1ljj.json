  "text": "I\u2019m so many weeks behind. Luckily, my classes aren\u2019t too hard like some engineering ones. I literally don\u2019t know what to do. \nMy sleeping schedule is so messed up, i can\u2019t get myself to sleep before 4 am. Then i wake up at like 1 or 2, and it\u2019s so hard for me to even get out of bed then. \nI feel really ugly and insecure about how i look so i don\u2019t go out much. My LIFE ISNT AESTHETIC AND WHEN I TRY TO BE \u201cTHAT GIRL\u201d IT ISNT AESTHETIC, I just stay in my bed, but when i try to open my class work, i\u2019m not able to focus. \nI literally forgot how to study after covid. Idk how to take notes for my online classes :( especially since they\u2019re more technical and about coding.\nPlease help i literally don\u2019t know wtf i\u2019m doing with my life, i wish i could get out of this, but when i try, i just give up. \ni am so behind and want to catch up :( \n\ni had an in person class today at 1 but i literally woke up at 12:58 and had to miss it\n\n\nAlso i always see on tiktok about the \u201cthat girl\u201d lifestyle , and when i see it, i feel like making my life more organized, but when it\u2019s not aesthetic or very organized, i lose motivation",

In particularly trying times, I tell myself I'm working for whatever the next meal is and focus on that. \n\nI'm absolutely not saying getting up at 5 won't suck the first week or so, but no one is going to do this for you - has to be you that sees it through if you're wanting change. \n\nYou'll also note that there is a similar amount of sleep in the schedule you laid out versus the one I did. It's all in how you use the waking hours.",

This may come as a shock, but I HIGHLY recommend seeing your school's counselor. I had the same issue as you and I decided to schedule an appointment just to get some advice and it really helped. I ended up being diagnosed with depression and adhd after just thinking I was bad at focusing and a heavy sleeper. \n\nI'm not telling you that you have those things like me. But even though it's intimidating it can REALLY help to talk to a professional. They truly do know the best. :)",

          "text": "ALSO lol you mentioned organizing your life on notion, I thought that was my solution too, but it's a lot. There's a simpler app to use called studylife that helped for me but other than that, you're right about college not seeming as great and easy as it is on tiktok. Take it easy and go step by step. Don't listen to that guy saying you \"just need some self-discipline\" because everyone goes at a different pace and has different struggles that are holding them back. Start small and build yourself up, you got this!",

      "text": "ya i\u2019m not the wake up at 6am girl either. But plan a time where you can reset your sleep schedule by taking quick naps throughout the day until it\u2019s a reasonable bedtime and then give yourself the full 8-9 hours of sleep. Ask your friends or roommate or family to help you sleep only during your specific nap times while you\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s tough!\n\nThe aesthetic is something that you have to create. You can\u2019t make it by simply wanting to be more organized, you have to find your own conventional ways of getting your life together! Maybe if it helps to get you on track, think that everyday you let pass you by is another day of being not aesthetic, probably even less aesthetic because you fall more and more behind. \n\nI\u2019m not own a million colorful highlighers girl. I\u2019m me and my black pen, laptop, and waterbottle against the world girl. It\u2019s not *that* girl aesthetic but it *is* aesthetic. I promise you can find what works for you!",
