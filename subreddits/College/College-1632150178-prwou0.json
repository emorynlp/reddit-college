If you're still super stressed, confirm with the professor that they are individually reviewing submissions with high percentages (they almost certainly are). I won't go into the specifics, but Turnitin has **much** more detail than just the overall percentage (And much more useful detail). \n\nYou are fine as long as your writing is your own. Avoid regurgitating the assignment sheet, textbook, lab manual, etc. Cite properly as well. And of course, don't copy other students' work. Just focus on trying to write the best you can.", "author": "Toxitoxi", "created": 1632426842, "upvotes": 1}}}
