I asked her about my nieces birthday as an excuse to randomly call her. She told me the details and still said she\u2019ll call me again tonight before she sleeps \n\nLike bruh why must you call me before you sleep.  If I called you twice today that should hint for you to leave me alone for today\n\nNow I have to wait till she about to sleep and prob have my friend wait. \n\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll use the old headache excuse \n\nBut it\u2019s just so irritating like I\u2019m in college I don\u2019t have to talk to you everyday \n\nBut if I use the headache excuse idk if she\u2019ll get suspicious", "author": "lilaczebraaaa", "created": 1632612052, "retrieved": 1632800263, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"heg48f9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhw3q/my_mom_is_irritating_me_with_her_daily_calls/heg48f9/", "text": "Ensure she doesn\u2019t pay your phone bill and just don\u2019t answer it.

It kinda sounds like your mom is having difficulty with accepting the fact you're growing up and no longer need her as much as you once did. Talking to you right before going to sleep provides the comfort of knowing you're safe, the same way as seeing you at \"bed time\" did. Lying to your mom is only going to reinforce the belief that you aren't able to take care of yourself (cause \"only kids lie\") and will probably only result in argument, rather than the positive change you're wanting. \n\nI'd recommend just letting her know what's going on, explain that you have plans and probably won't be available to answer the phone every time she wants you to (and that's okay), but you'll definitely talk to her again. The next time this  type of situation comes up and you proactively call her and she says she'll call you again before she goes to sleep, just ask her why and take the conversation from there. \n\nJust try to remember that people tend to do things with positive motivations, try to figure out what that motivation is for her, and then provide reassurance that satisfies that motivation. It's a big change for both of you and it'll require compassion and understanding from both sides.", "author": "TheLordBigfoot", "created": 1632636949, "upvotes": 22}, "hebdvqb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhw3q/my_mom_is_irritating_me_with_her_daily_calls/hebdvqb/", "text": "My mom did this when i was abroad at the beginning and each time i didn't answer her calls she'd call my roommate because she was worried but i dont answer only because i was in class or  taking a nap or eating i told her to stop calling my roommate and just assume I'm busy if i don't respond and it was all good from there", "author": "JC332578", "created": 1632636531, "upvotes": 9}, "heagm77": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhw3q/my_mom_is_irritating_me_with_her_daily_calls/heagm77/", "text": "Stop answering", "author": "TragicalKingdom", "created": 1632618732, "upvotes": 15}, "hea5v2l": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvhw3q/my_mom_is_irritating_me_with_her_daily_calls/hea5v2l/", "text": "Dude you\u2019re an adult I know this may not be what you wanna hear but you need to establish some boundaries are you talking to your mom every day multiple times a day?
