I realize this might be a part of school for a good minute so gotta be water with it as much as you can. \n\nAlso I didnt realize my mic was on last week and I yelled super loud cuz someone was calling me in the other room and the professor goes, we all heard that.

It puts your picture on top for you which tricks your mind into thinking everyone sees you when no one is paying attention at all.  If you can't get the background eraser to work, people see a small part of your room which is the most intimate and private part of your house. Even when my friends come over, no one actually goes into MY room with my computer but in inviting my professors and all these other strangers in.\n\nIn truth, I think people notice you less on Zoom than in class because there are less one on one interactions. In break out groups I am still juggling reading my notes, thinking about the questions/answers, and my own video to really truly concentrate on someone else's video.\n\nMy point is your feelings are valid because the system is engineered to make you feel seen and noticed (even if you don't want to be) and you can address them because the truth might not match the story your brain is telling you.
