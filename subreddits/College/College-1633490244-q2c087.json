  "text": "I get As as well, but I\u2019ve been receiving a lot of Cs and I\u2019m just disappointed in myself. I keep studying and studying and studying, but I\u2019m just struggling. My classes this semester are a lot harder than my previous classes, and I received all As and one B in my previous three semesters. Any advice?",

B & Cs are okay but just make sure you are achieving your major GPA requirement & that a C is high enough to continue on. Some classes require Bs for pre req classes, others require Cs. If you want more help class wise you can pm me and I can probably help you on the concepts you are struggling with.",
