  "text": "i\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve been going to my college since August 9. Now it\u2019s November 24 and I still haven\u2019t found that it feels like home. Obviously I have adjusted to it, maybe not entirely since it\u2019s only been a few months, but definitely more than I was the first few weeks. i\u2019ve tried to get involved, joining a couple clubs and even a sorority, but I don\u2019t really feel happy yet. From some people I\u2019ve heard this is normal but from other people I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s not. I haven\u2019t made that many friends, I\u2019m still homesick all the time, I haven\u2019t even made that many friends in my sorority. I\u2019ve heard that this is normal and sometimes it can take more than a year to feel happy at college, but others told me I should be happy by now and that I should transfer. What do you think? Are you dealing with the same thing?",

I don\u2019t really have any friends but that\u2019s my fault, I don\u2019t go out and do anything besides go to work. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to transfer to a college much closer to home that way there will be at least some people there that I will know from high school.",
