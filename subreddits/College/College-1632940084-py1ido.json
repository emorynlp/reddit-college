  "text": "y'all, I am just so tired EVERY DAY. I need some help. My current schedule is as follows:\n\n7 a.m: Wake up, hydrate, shower, get ready\n\n8: Plan for the day, answer emails\n\n9: first class \n\n10 a.m: second class\n\n11 to 1: remote work & lunch \n\n1 to 3: last class\n\n3:30 to 7: in person work\n\n7 to 8: dinner and relax \n\n8 to 10:30: homework \n\n11 p.m: bedtime \n\nIf I don't follow this schedule, everything falls apart. I get behind and I start missing assignments or doing poorly on tests. but after 12 hours of work, my brain is fried and i just can't concentrate. how do i get through this??",

      "text": "I hate to say it because I'm the same way, but you may need to find a different time for you to work. I'm not saying you can't have a job but if you genuinely feel too tired to be able to complete all your other daily tasks then the one thing that can be changed would be you have to figure out a new plan with work. Maybe only weekends? It can be hard to give it up but that's your solution",

My schedule was similar in my freshman/sophomore years then I finally was able to take less classes after finishing my Gen Eds. \n\nIs that everyday or just your busiest day? Bc my  schedule will usually have just one day like the one you described and then an off day or a day with one class following.",
