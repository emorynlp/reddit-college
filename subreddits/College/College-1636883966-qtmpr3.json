First urgent care visit about 2 weeks in to college I completely lost my voice and  it was bronchitis. I had to to the ER because the cough kept getting worse. They have me more antibiotics and an inhaler. About 3 weeks later i started getting sick again, they gave me antibiotics but didn\u2019t really say what it was. About 3 weeks later I went to urgent care again and was told I had a sinus infection. Since then nothing too serious except my cough is starting to come back and this past week I had a little cold (sore throat, stuffy nose)",

College is just one big petri plate. Get your flu shots and covid vaccines and that should prevent some colds but the big thing going around is strep and it mutates like crazy so chances are you will get it multiple times with different symptoms and it\u2019ll develop into bronchitis if you don\u2019t rest and take care of your body.",
