      "text": "You\u2019re not completely screwed, there is always a chance to improve. \nUnfortunately, being a \u201cgood student\u201d is 75% experience. Some/most of us have already spent 13 or more years learning how to be a good student by the time we get to freshman year and we continue learning over college. I would say talk to someone who is doing well and ask them what skills they have developed that attribute to their success. \nThis is my experience\n- read the textbook, then read it again\n- take notes- take all of the notes\n- go to office hours and email your professor if you need to\n- find the right time to study, make a schedule and stick to it\n- discipline your self. Find your vice (tv, partying, phone, friends, etc) and put your studies first. \n- invest in yourself. Take care of yourself outside of school work. Making time for your mental health and physical health is important. \n- take advantage of the writing center\n- most importantly, participate - go to class and do your assignments 100% of the time. \n\nOther tips that some people use but I don\u2019t:\n- Study groups\n- tutoring",

          "text": "This is good advice, thanks for sharing. I would add good time management and organization skills. I love planners but some people like google calendar or excel sheets. Some people like note software I prefer notebooks and word. It\u2019s about having a plan of attack and trying to stick to it. Sometimes you don\u2019t go to plan but that\u2019s okay adapt the plan and try again.",

      "text": "I did well my first year, then second year tanked my grades. I knew to get it up, I had to reprioritize my life. I quit my sorority, asked for less hours at work, and really put school as my #1 priority. I graduated with a 2.9 but way better than if I didn't reprioritize after my sophomore year. It's possible - just have to want it bad enough and sacrifice your time now for a better future.",
