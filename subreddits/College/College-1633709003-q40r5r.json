      "text": "O chem I was the hardest in terms of content, microbiology is close simply because the professor taught it in the most frustrating, intentional gatekeep-y way. \n\nHonorable mention goes to my yoga class. The content was not hard, but forcing myself to go and listen to the instructor tell us that rose quartz detoxes breast cancer and root vegetables cure suicidal ideations was a challenge",

      "text": "Choral methods. Mostly because I'm not a vocalist and didn't know anything about singing and it was a class full of vocalists who had been in choruses their whole lives (I'm an instrumentalist). \n\nKeep in mind that I've taken grad level math, and which should give you an idea of the extent to which how \"hard\" something is really depends on the individual student. \"Objectively\" speaking, way more people would fail the math classes I've taken than the choral methods class I took, but honestly I really don't know wtf my choral methods professor was talking about. The people who did, though, apparently ended up being great choral directors, so clearly my prof knew what she was talking about and was good at it, lol.",
