The reason being, I feel like I made the wrong choice. For a very long time, I have always believed I would go to an out-state college with the traditional stuff like football games, tailgates, and such. However, during my junior year of high school, I decided that I did not want to do that; I wanted to go to school in the city because I believed I would get more opportunities there. But now, I don't believe that and realized that the location does not guarantee opportunities or internships. The school I attend does not really have a community and since it is in the city, there is no traditional campus. The one thing that i like about this school is that it\u2019s close to home, so I can come home on the weekends. Also, the school I attend is not the best in the field and does not actually have the concentration I want to study. It is accredited but to many companies, it does not stand out. So, I am looking to transfer out but where is the problem. I have made a list of possible transfer schools and it is a very long list. I am conflicted because all the schools are very different from each other.  My major is business management and I want to concentrate on supply and operations management. Can anyone give me advice, which school(s) would be better to transfer to?\n\nI am looking to transfer to a different school for my sophomore year.\n\nColleges to transfer:\n\nBoston college\n\nFordham University\n\nU Mass Amherst\n\nStony Brook University\n\nPenn State University\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nSyracuse University\n\nRutgers University\\_ New Brunswick\n\nBinghamton University\n\nUniversity of Cali-Berkeley\n\nUniversity of Maryland-College Park\n\nBoston University\n\nUCLA \n\nUSC", "author": "eli8979", "created": 1632263654, "retrieved": 1632800966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdry7av": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pstw8i/hi_i_need_advice_on_transferring/hdry7av/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1632264122, "upvotes": 1}, "hdrxscs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pstw8i/hi_i_need_advice_on_transferring/hdrxscs/", "text": "I don\u2019t know anything about those schools but I did transfer after my sophomore year. I think your best bet is going to be doing some online research and narrowing down your list to a top 7. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve narrowed it down reach out to the schools personally and contact their transfer advisor. This person will be able to tell you things about financial aid, what classes you\u2019ve already done that will transfer over etc\n\nfor ex Someone on this sub may LOVE Fordham and the next person could be absolutely miserable there. Everyone\u2019s personal experiences differ so much it\u2019s best to take them all (positive or negative) with a grain of salt and to really tour and look into them yourself. \n\nGood luck with whatever you choose!", "author": "rynpickles", "created": 1632263926, "upvotes": 2}}}
