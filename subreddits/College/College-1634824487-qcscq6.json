  "text": "Hey guys, i\u2019m need of some advice. I\u2019m currently registering for classes next semester and originally planned on taking gen chem 2, bio, and calculus. However, i just realized how time consuming and difficult all of these these classes will be. Next yr, i\u2019m suppose to start ochem and i feel that it would be better to kind of start the bio and calc sequence next semester but now i\u2019m unsure. What do you guys suggest?",

      "text": "For my freshman second semester, I took bio, chem 2, calc, psych, and english. I ended up dropping bio because it was too difficult, it has a lot of Ochem concepts. I would recommend taking Ochem and bio together while taking calc and chem 2 together.",
