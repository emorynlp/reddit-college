Formatting, variable naming conventions, how they convert between the chunks of code and other signs make any copied work stand out.  It's like looking at a lego house where random parts are all different colors.  If you reference code but then write the work yourself, any competent teacher will see the flow is all the same and not question it even if the plagiarism check flags it.  And that's an expected process anyway when you're learning CS, looking at code and understanding it enough to be able to write it yourself.  \n\n\nOne assignment stands out in my mind, where we were tasked with multithreading data processing.  It was a very straightforward assignment, where any good student would have done it with a fairly simple and direct process.  Five people in that class got flagged because we all had very similar solutions.  However, the signs of plagarism that usually come up were absent, and the teacher knew we were the students who worked through the problem till we found the ideal solution.  He had no issue with the similarities and we all aced it.  \n\n\nAlso, stupid little things that might get flagged (ex. Copying code to clear an input buffer)  teachers really don't care about.  They are concerned about whether you understand the material, vs just being able to complete the assignment using outside code.  Especially where some schools will even check against your own code, if little things like that get flagged the teacher won't care.  I was flagged several times for plagiarizing my own code because I reused stuff constantly, and it was never brought up.  Which is often good programming practice anyway- if you find an ideal process for a particular problem the best thing to do is reuse it rather than write it from scratch each time.  In the real world, employers care about you doing it right every time.  Not that you wrote it from scratch every time.\n\n\nEven so (because I too worried about it quite a bit,) as a precautionary measure I always wrote my code in steps, and once one part worked I'd start a new project to continue the work.  That way, I had a series of progressive steps to show how I ended up with the final solution.  If anyone ever questioned if the code was mine, they could look through the direct progression of how I came to the solution.
