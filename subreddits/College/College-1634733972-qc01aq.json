  "text": "Hey I was wondering how you guys did your zoom classes. \n\nI have this one teacher who just talks for the whole lesson and expects us to read the book and do the work. Really easy class is just about how to handle emotions.\n\n And then I have another teacher who screenshares  power points and lesson plans",

      "text": "Online class at a community college in Florida. We buy book access at beginning of semester, prof posts 1-2 page outlines over each chapter. Chapter quizzes pretty much encompass outline info, and the book just fills in untested info. Exam closed book. Not bad at all as all the quiz dates are due one one day close to end of the semester. I figure if I\u2019m going to be using online classes and teaching myself, might as well do it at the pace that works.",
