  "text": "I know it's comforting knowing that you're not the odd one out but please don't be fooled, those fuckers are definitely studying.\n\nI work in the campus library, a few days ago I saw a regular of mine approaching and went to go find the book he regularly checks out.  After checking it out, my partner for the shift commented how surprising it was to finally see him studying  even though it was so late in the semester. Alright here's the thing, this dude had been coming so regularly from since the start of the semester that I had remembered his student ID number, He was definitely one of the most committed students I had seen coming everyday for 2-4 hours daily,  so obviously I had no idea what the hell she was talking about.\n\nHe was in her Biochem class and regularly came to lecture with a pen and a sheet of paper, she had expected him to withdraw quickly simply because of his discussed shit study habits and his stated unreadiness for every exam. Even though she'd struggle in the class, she felt better knowing that at least she was doing better than someone. \n\nNow I'm no Biochem person ( I'm a Neuro person), but I know the class is hard. I can understand thinking maybe he was just getting lucky on the exams but luck can only go so far, so it was either he was doing something to prepare or he was a god.  She spent the rest of our shift asking me if I was a 100% sure it was the same guy. And I am.  She fell for the college scams of \" Oh don't worry I didn't study either\",\n\nNow I know better than to fall for that shit because I see it first hand, if you hear that from someone the majority are liars. They are preparing, they're attending office hours, attending tutoring, coming to the library reserving study rooms and spending hours. They're prepared, they wouldn't still be in the class if they weren't doing well. (Unless they were self sabotaging their GPA).  Don't feel comforted start studying your ass off.\n\n:3",

I generally hear it a lot in people.\n\n\"I'm not smart because nobody else studies for these exams and they still better grades than me.\"\n\nThe thing is, it's impossible absolutely know how much other people have studied unless they've explicitly told you. It's always these off the cuff assumptions. It's a bad habit and a hard one to kick. There's a certain kick back of now figuring out how much you actually don't know. It's like the smarter you are, the more you know that you *don't know*. \n\nI will admit, I always check my canvas for average scores put out after exams. That's a good quantifiable way to measure your standing.",

You should study based on how your performance is reflecting your study habits, not what somebody else is doing. I like orgo and I do fine without studying very much, but physics makes me wanna pull my hair out, for example. In every class there are going to be people studying various amounts based on how much they individually need to.",

Even though I'm a totally average student, people often assume that I'm either stupid/lazy or a genius because I don't take notes in class. In reality it's neither. I have adhd and chronic tendinitis, so my handwriting is too slow and too distracting for me to get effective learning from the lecture. IMO it's pointless to try to guess at another person's intelligence or work ethic from what you see of them in a lecture room.",
