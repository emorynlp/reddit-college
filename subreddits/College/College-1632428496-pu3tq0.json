What is better for an eventual PhD?", "text": "It will be important if I first explain my primary academic goal. It's a dream of mine to get a PhD in Physics/Astronomy/Astrophysics. It's important to note I have a family and work from home full-time. I have a B.S. in mathematics from a small local college and have a couple of options moving forward.\n\n1. I recently got accepted to the M.S. in Applied Physics at Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering.\n2. I could apply for readmission to Georgia Tech and finish out my B.S. in Physics.\n3. I could apply straight for a doctoral program in my desired field.\n\nI'd like to add that my overall goal is to get a doctorate from a top tier university. Johns Hopkins is a dream school of mine to do a doctorate, but I am currently unable to move to Baltimore (recently bought a house and have a 3 month old daughter), but, in a couple of years, this won't be so out of reach. In addition, getting a job at JHU APL would be a dream.\n\nI loved GaTech, but had to leave for family circumstances in 2017. This is why I ended up getting a B.S. in Mathematics at my local college.\n\nI personally feel as though option 3 is not the best option because a top program will likely not want me without the B.S. in Physics. GaTech is also only 1 hour drive away for me and WAY cheaper than the JHU M.S.\n\nI am really struggling between these three options. Any advice you might have I welcome it.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not a question about admissions. Just need advice on what path to take.", "author": "ExistentialQuery", "created": 1632428496, "retrieved": 1632946144, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"he1gmi0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu3tq0/masters_degree_second_bachelors_what_is_better/he1gmi0/", "text": "As some who has completed a PhD in the sciences, my suggestion is to get the MS first and if possible a couple years of employment. The reason is if things go south in your PhD program you can bail on your own terms rather have to scrape together a degree from the scraps of your research.

Why wouldn't they take you without a Physics BS? Lacking specific classes? Go take those specific classes. No need to do all of the bachelor qualifications unless you really want the piece of paper.\n\nMaster's Degrees can serve as a stepping stone if you want more schooling, just make sure you have a specific reason for doing it (research, classes, etc) and that the Masters would let you do it. I would compare whatever your perceived cost/benefit of the MS is to the cost/benefit of the extra Physics classes are rather than the BS itself. Relevant work experience, maybe some research opportunities, and extra classes could certainly compete with an MS. But maybe at that point its worth it just to grab the MS paper and get those connections/opportunities/credentials. \n\nEspecially if you want to do a doctorate at that school, I dont see how excelling at their classes and getting connections with their faculty or research wouldn't be a massive benefit if the cost is low enough.", "author": "AtomAndAether", "created": 1632429701, "upvotes": 1}, "he0bdl1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu3tq0/masters_degree_second_bachelors_what_is_better/he0bdl1/", "text": "You say your overall goal is to get a particular degree, but what\u2019s your end goal?
