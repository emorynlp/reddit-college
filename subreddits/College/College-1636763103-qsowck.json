  "text": "I have been applying to universities. I got accepted by Fiu and it\u2019s 40 mins away and has a good rep for my major. Though I have this weird feeling in my heart that I want to go out of state for college. Like Auburn I heard has a great community and it\u2019s like a little city. Fiu doesn\u2019t have that family feeling. But Auburn doesn\u2019t have my main major but it does have my backup option. What should I do?",

              "text": "The out of state feeling is cool when you're young but its really hard to justify a cost like that. One year of Auburn is the amount of money you could spend for all four years in-state lmao. I'm not too familiar with Florida schools but it sounds like you should try to find one with a smaller town feel. Maybe check out FSU or Florida? The cities for them are a lot smaller than Miami",
