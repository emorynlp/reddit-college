  "title:": "Going back to school as a mom and working adult",
  "text": "Here's my story.\nEarned an associate's in medical assisting, worked for a year with the intention of continuing in nursing school, then got pregnant.\n\nStayed home with that one child, had another child, remarried and gained 3 bonus kids, had another child last year. Yes, you read that right - I have 6 kids.\n\nDuring this time, I spent 6 years making a good income as a copywriter. A few years ago, I went for my notary commission (not easy here in Louisiana, but I did it), and just this year, I moved from copywriting to being a loan signing agent. I've worked around my kids' schedules since my first was born.\n\nI've also homeschooled for 7 years.\n\nNext year, all the kids will be in \"regular\" school, and I'm picking up where I left off in college. I'll spend next year finishing prerequisites and a few core nursing classes, and in 2023, I'll graduate. I don't intend to stop there, as I'd like to work my way up to a FNP by age 40.\n\nThere's no better time to go into the field, IMO, with the shortages and sign on bonuses. My husband is 9 years my senior, so I also see this as a smart move in our retirement planning.\n\nI spent a lot of time wondering if I was too old to go back. I'm turning 34 this month. Honestly, I think I'm more prepared than ever. If you think it's too late, it's not. My great aunt got her master's in her 60s. It can be done. \n\nAnyone else have inspiration to share for us late-to-schoolers?",
