  "title:": "Kicked out from the University",
  "text": "International Student here. I started studying in Germany a while back. Completed the German language from start to finish and then started studying at one of the best universities in German. \n\nDuring the last two semesters, which is my first year at college I failed two exams in two attempts and as the rules say I have to leave my university. The worst of all is that my Professor failed me in a subject by a single mark and wouldn't agree to pass me. Even though I have taken it up with the Examination department the situation looks irreversible, since the same professor would be correcting it again, in case they hear my case. I just cannot live with a failure knowing I needed a single mark, a single mark that would turn my life around.\n\nThe situation is I'll have to apply to another university starting April, only positive being they will credit my already passed modules.\n\nMy parents are too immigrants and live in a different country. My father has worked all his life and given me the position to make sure I was the first person ever from my family to study abroad. And I now I feel like I have just destroyed one year of my life which amounts to 10,000 euros. I have financially set him back by a year, and I just cannot live with the burden. He has his own dreams to pursue and now they have been delayed. I have a younger sibling and I can't imagine what implications their career would have because of this. Even when I start university again next year, I don't know how I will keep on living with this guilt. My fathers situation is not so dire that we would ask me to come back again and he wants me to start a new course but I am just burdened with guilt.\n\nI had moved to a new city last year and due all classes being online I had zero friends in the city and group to study with. It wasn't the case that I spent money drinking alcohol and partying all semester. And now I am scratching the walls for excuses. Yes, I didn't do as much as I should have, but my life is being completely destroyed because I didn't have one mark more in an exam. \n\nI have 6 months from now on to look back at my life and it's just too long to sit idle and keep thinking about this. All the guilt I have, the money I have wasted and the trouble I have brought to my parents is getting to me. My father has had my back in the past whenever I have struggled and now I feel I have finally let him down the most I ever could. \n\nThrowaway account here, though.",

This is not on your professor\n\n>  Yes, I didn't do as much as I should have, but my life is being completely destroyed because I didn't have one mark more in an exam.\n\nYou should really take a step back and think about what led you to be in this spot, and how not to do that in future and what your options are.\n\nThinking about it in a problem solving way and bemoaning it are 2 different things entirely.\n\nI am genuinely sorry that you are in such distress, but you need to see a mental health counselor and do some honest self evaluation here",
