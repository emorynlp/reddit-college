  "text": "Im about done with my first semester and noting has really happened with me so far. Ive mainly kept to myself and worked on assignments and played video games in my free time. I have not been to any parties , drank or had loads of sex like in college movies. I know these things happen on my campus and ive always played things safe but am i missing out for not taking part in \"typical\" college things like this? The risk just seems to high and i dont understand how this id enjoyable and id be worrying about the things that could go wrong the whole time. The std's i might catch or getting arrested for underage drinking. Is it normal to avoid this high risk behavior or am i missing out by being a scared, wet blanket?",

      "text": "Mass media reflects stereotypes which inaccurately portrays real life. It creates this idea that the college experience evolves around parting, sex, and drugs when really it only makes up a small portion. Most of our time in college is spent studying, going to class, and experiencing a great deal of stress from the expectation to do well.",

If you are fulfilled with what you do then continue doing it! Otherwise if you don't want to drink or party or anything then just join some clubs and make some friends who also are not into that stuff!",

I do, however, have friends who are doing all of the college things from movies. You know what? I'll say it. They're suffering. They're unhappy. They're getting hurt and crying and gaslight themselves into thinking passing out at a frat house on a Tuesday is what they should ideally be doing.\n\nI got all my suffering from my home life, so maybe that's why this stuff doesn't appeal to me. But, I've had picnics, gone to museums, film festivals, etc! Do what you enjoy and what appeals to you. :)",
