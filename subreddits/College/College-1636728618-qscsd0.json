  "text": "Im about done with my first semester and noting has really happened with me so far. Ive mainly kept to myself and worked on assignments and played video games in my free time. I have not been to any parties , drank or had loads of sex like in college movies. I know these things happen on my campus and ive always played things safe but am i missing out for not taking part in \"typical\" college things like this? The risk just seems to high and i dont understand how this id enjoyable and id be worrying about the things that could go wrong the whole time. The std's i might catch or getting arrested for underage drinking. Is it normal to avoid this high risk behavior or am i missing out by being a scared, wet blanket?",

      "text": "Dude everyone has a different college experience, Some people go out 5 nights a week go Greek, Can't remember half of what they did last week and and may or may not be acquainted with half the student body by the time they graduate but can't remember the names of half of them. Others are the architectural introverts avoiding everyone and staying in their dorm room playing video games with the only social interaction being either their roommate gently trying to remind them to take a shower or or the RA knocking on the door once a week to make sure they're still breathing. And then there's the rest of the student body that just inhabits the happy middle ground of going out a couple nights a week studying making friends and being normal social humost social humans with different levels of each for each individual person to their preference.\n\nI would recommend maybe not staying in your room all the time you don't have to go party or go do crazy shit but maybe join a club or an intermineral Sports league. College is really the easiest time besides high school to make lifelong friends long friends and you kind of have to force yourself to put yourself out there yourself out there to make those friends because no one's going to seek you out you have to go out and make yourself available to interact with people To make friends and build connections.\n\nBecause building a friendship is done brick it's not just automatic. So maybe if you're really interested in playing a particular video game see if there's a club oriented towards playing that game on campus maybe you can make some friends and play in some kind of competition or something. Or maybe join a pre professional club that's related to your major.  Help maybe join the astronomy society or the formula one team fill a 1 team if you're so inclined at your University. I was part of and still am part of the rocket society at my University. Along with crew and fencing. I love rowing it's a little time consuming but really made it very easy to make friends If you don't want to try out as a walk on for like college teams maybe just see if you can find an intermural team or I didn't enter mirror a club team looking for new people. Rowing and fencing or 2 good examples of this They have people that are unfamiliar with the sport come out for tryouts and just to learn about the sport every year it's a good way to meet random people and make some friends.\n\nBut really just try and force yourself to not be in your dorm room 247 when you're not in class because while you may not want to go to parties and not kind of thing it doesn't mean you shouldn't have some new experiences while you're in college and that usually involves being in a social environment\n\nSo just do your best try and flex your muscles a bit socially. It's good to force yourself out of your comfort zone trying to make some friends just figure out something that you're interested in and see if you can find a club or society that is involved in that and that's an easy way to find people that have the same interest as you on campus.\n\nI'm not trying to be an ass by making this suggestion but not every party is a razor Fraternity house party, There are kickbacks and tailgates that are much more laid back. All very chill usually people were just hanging out talking and it's a great way to socialize. So you don't have to go to a crazy party to go to a party. The kickbacks are usually posted at like the house of a theater kid or something so maybe the maybe think about joining or or volunteering to help out with something with the theatrical society on your campus or something it's an easy way to make friends helping to build sets.  out",

I got a decent size friend group I plan to grow more and I\u2019m about to start going to the gym again because I\u2019m already gaining some weight might as well bulk lol. But don\u2019t stress about being a movie stereotype most aren\u2019t partying and having sex anyway enjoy college how you want to.",

      "text": "If that\u2019s not what you\u2019re into then it\u2019s not what you\u2019re into and that\u2019s okay. Maybe try to branch out a little in a way that makes you comfortable or even pushing your comfort zone slightly though. While you\u2019re doing nothing wrong and probably making good decisions, college is a place where you have the opportunity to experience things that are less common once you\u2019re out. While this could be going out and finding a less risky way to drink or party, it could also mean joining a club or joining a trip to do something more outdoorsy (your school might put these types of trips together if you\u2019re interested). I don\u2019t want to convince you to do something you don\u2019t want to do and definitely try to be safe (even if it\u2019s with sex, drugs or alcohol), but also don\u2019t live in a way you may regret by not going and making more friends in whatever way you may want to.",

      "text": "Best get it out of your system while you still got that \u201csafety net\u201d imo. Plus you make the best friends and even better stories. Unless you really do something stupid its pretty hard to actually ruin your life by just doing the standard college shit. \n\nLike if you worry about catching some aids and shit just wrap it up. And as for catching cases, I got arrested my freshman year for running around campus out of my mind on all kinds of shit, nothing happened my life aint ruined. Slept it off in the the jail for the night then went about my day, they just dropped the charge bc they got bigger problems than some random intoxicated college kid. Matter of fact pretty much everyone i seen get caught up just had their charges dropped unless they had something on them, and even those who did are perfectly fine now. Basically just don\u2019t be a dumbass and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nNowadays I don\u2019t do none of that at all but Im glad I went ham for that one year, was one of the most fun, albeit unproductive times of my life.",
