      "text": "sounds like your professor decided that he/she can't beat 'em, so he/she joined 'em.\n\neveryone knows that exams should never have homework problems verbatim. I bet your professor once actually had standards, but everyone failed and whined to the chair/dean. So the chair/dean told your prof to make them pass, *or else*. Then, the prof decided for future classes to just skip the student complaints by making the exam really easy.\n\nSo yes, you should be scared. You are not taking a rigorous class. Your professor, department, and perhaps college does not care (or cannot care) if you can figure out new problems without having seen the solution before. They don't care to teach you. And I ask you, what good is knowledge if you cannot apply it to new problems? What are you going to do if you need to use that stuff in a future class or your job? Even if it's not your major class (and therefore you won't need it), it's a major class for *some* major. And that entire major is getting a shitty education, which will make their degree, and by extension the school's reputation, and by further but weaker extension *your* degree, look bad.\n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing you can really do except self-study on your own by looking up and \"taking\" exams from other universities/classes, and try to study to that level.",

      "text": "That is not a good situation as far as learning is concerned.  On a good note, however, you are aware that you have an academic shortcoming in this class.  It would not say much for your desire to learn if you gleefully celebrated the repeated questions.  \n\nMore studying and/or different study methods (tutor, study group, outside reading, etc.) may help you gain confidence in this course.",
