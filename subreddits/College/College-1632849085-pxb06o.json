{"sid": "pxb06o", "link": "/r/college/comments/pxb06o/need_some_advice/", "title:": "Need some advice", "text": "So I started taking college classes the summer after I graduated high school when I was 18. I was struggling a lot and didn't have the support system I thought I would have, developed the worst anxiety I've ever had, became incredibly suicidal, and I ended up just not going to the classes at all. Didn't even officially drop out, just stopped going and refused to look at my grades online or check my school email. \nConveniently I was on a full ride scholarship so I didn't have to pay for the semester but it's something I've been very ashamed of for a while since I was meant to be the one child of my parents to pursue higher education. \n\nI'm 20 now and over the years I've moved out of my parents house, found supportive friends, found a job that pays a living wage, and found ways to cope with my anxiety and learn to love myself. \n\nWith that all being said, I finally feel like I'm ready to go back to school and I've never been more motivated. My issue is though, my GPA at the community college I was going to dropped significantly on account of me doing literally no work in the classes. I would love to go back to school, but to start with a GPA that I don't feel reflects my work ethic and passion for what I want to do with my life is extremely discouraging. While it may be something I have to just deal with, a part of me would rather just not go back to school at all if that's the case. I know that isn't the best mindset to have, I still have a lot of anxiety about it and I want to start off on the right foot. \n\nApologies for this being so long, but I was just wondering if anyone here has been in the same or a similar situation, and if they've had success in having a semester wiped from their record to aid their GPA at all.", "author": "mentoilnesluvx", "created": 1632849085, "retrieved": 1632945421, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
