  "text": "I'm meant to be graduating in the spring and now I'm afraid I'm going to fail my Anthropology class. There are only 4 major grades (all tests) in this class. I've been comfortable at an 80, but I just tanked an exam so now I've got a D in the class. I'd calm down and try to retake it in the spring if necessary, but I'm going to be student teaching, so there's just no way to fit it into my schedule. My only hope is acing the final (which is the least impactful of all 4 test on our grade) and getting full points on the extra credit assignment. I've reached out to my professor to see if there's absolutely anything I can do to get my grade up, but I haven't heard back yet and I'm honestly just freaking out.\n\nI tried so hard. This class isn't even for my major. It's a gen-ed. social science. I honestly just suck at it. It's a bunch of memorization and I just can't do it well enough apparently. My primary concern is this will push my graduation back, which will effect me getting a job, and majorly piss off my family. I'm just scared. I've never failed a class before and could really use any advice.",
