  "text": "Hello I\u2019m enrolling in a certificate program at a university. It\u2019s a 2yr graphic design certificate. There\u2019s no application you just pay for the course and register and you\u2019re in. However I\u2019m planning on using my GI bill and I\u2019m some packet I\u2019m filling out it\u2019s saying they require transcripts from all previous colleges . Firstly I\u2019m studying an entirely new field and none of the classes I\u2019ve taken before transfer to this certificate program so it\u2019s pointless 2) in the past I\u2019ve attended like 6 different colleges and honestly paying for and getting the transcripts will be a hassle and (referring to point 1) : useless) .\n\nI\u2019m prone to just say I have not attended any other schools. What\u2019s the worse that can happen. I\u2019ve heard with FAFSA they can look up at clearing house records , but do you think with GI bill they do this? Can I get away with it",

      "text": "Don't lie about your previous education. Suck it up and pay for the transcripts. Every institution wants to know how well you've coped with previous postsecondary education and needs proof, not just your word, of whether you're retaking courses. In the long run, these transcript costs are small.",
