  "text": "I have \u201cfriends\u201d on campus but I never actually hang out with them. I see them around and we bullshit for awhile but that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve tried inviting them to things or getting involved in things and it just never works out. It is getting more and more difficult to sit in a lunch room all by myself surrounded by people. I\u2019m constantly talking to people I know when I go on campus but none of these relationships feel genuine. I\u2019m tired of reaching out and would just want somebody to think of inviting me for once. Does anyone have any suggestions??",

Especially being a freshman it should be somewhat easier but no One talks unless you do lmao. I feel lonely and I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have a solid group of good friends.",
