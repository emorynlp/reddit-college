What are your favorite easy-to-prepare meals ideas for those living on their own for the first time? \nThe best ideas are those that include minimal ingredients that can also be used for many other meals. \n\nThis is what I've had the first few weeks of school: \n\nBreakfast: \nCoffee, a box of pancake mix (this goes a long way apparently... Still have half the box left), cereal, bagels, and ingredients for smoothies ( put some yogurt, flax, frozen strawberries, and cinnamon in a cheap blender for easy yummy-ness)\n\nLunch/Supper: \nI've had microwavable frozen meals, curry/rice (I made a huge amount of curry and still have leftovers 2 weeks later), pancakes, or just paying for the school's cafeteria. \n\nSnacks/Misc: \nLittle fruit containers, cheese and crackers, pop tarts, my roommates' cookies, etc.\n\nEdit: My gosh!!!

The idea is simple but you can easily mix up the ingredients and seasonings to have a variety of flavors. \n\nI start with a base: brown rice, couscous, farro, or potatoes (my favorites are sweet potato and Japanese yam). Alternatively you could make this into a salad by using a leafy green as your base. For the grains I will cook them on the stove with some vegetable stock. \n\nThen I choose my veggies: I love broccoli, zucchini, and cauliflower so I usually pick one or a combination of those but you could also consider using asparagus, eggplant, tomato, etc. Cook them how you prefer, I usually bake my vegetables because I like my broccoli crispy. An easy seasoning I do is minced garlic, olive oil, and Italian seasoning but it depends on the overall flavor I want my bowl to be (sometimes I skip the Italian seasoning if I\u2019m going to have a strong sauce flavor). \n\nI choose my protein: could be chicken, tofu, garbanzo beans, black beans, or whatever else you prefer. If you aren\u2019t as hungry you can also skip the protein or skip the grains, both ways are still yummy. \n\nFinally I decide on toppings and sauce if any: I like vegan Parmesan or vegan feta (I can\u2019t have dairy). You could also top with fresh herbs or any raw veggies you like for example onions. As for sauces I like wasabi, eel sauce, peanut sauce, salad dressing, salsa, or sometimes no sauce. \n\nUltimately the idea is to come up with lots of things you like for each category I specified above. Keep them on hand and then when you are hungry put together the combo you want. The next time you\u2019ll probably do a different combo and that way you won\u2019t get tired of eating the same food all the time.

There's so many sauce options- you can try a cream sauce, a tomato sauce, a pesto, and a cheese sauce to spice up the very same pasta for a week. If you want to branch out beyond jarred sauce, tomato sauces typically freeze AMAZINGLY and you can use fresh or canned tomatoes with some herbs and spices and make it whatever you want, freeze, and reheat.\n\nSweet potatoes are  by far my favorite sweet dinner/dessert item, though. You can just get a can of yams and cook them on the stove. Drain most of the liquid, add to a saucepan (pot with long handle), add some butter to taste (I usually use half a stick for a giant can), and sprinkle some cinnamon (about a teaspoon to start). When you smell them, add some brown sugar and/or honey to taste (for that big can I usually add a quarter cup of brown sugar and a drizzle of honey). When you smell everything coming together, serve! They're extra good mashed. I usually eat them as a dessert, but they're also good with protein/veggies for a dinner side when you want something sweet.\n\n\"White people tacos\" are pretty good, too- you can get a kit that comes with the seasoning, add ground beef and the seasoning to a pan with water, cook it up, and I'm pretty sure it freezes well, too.\n\nI'm also a huge oatmeal person.

Or my mom seems to think it is healthy. I bought a giant think of ground beef from Costco at the start of the semester, browned it all, and then froze it in several bags. Then I just take it out to defrost, put the taco seasoning on, and stick in the microwave. \n* Pork - the only way I have figured out how to cook this so far is baked with Italian seasoning. Tastes good. I have paired this with applesauce, and with tortellini. I bought my pork from Coscto, and froze it all. \n* Flank Steak - I love this. I marinate it using my mom marinate and then eat it with pretty much anything, I also make burritos out of it. I broil for about 10 min per side. Again, buy from Coscto and freeze. \n* And breakfast - smoothies with protein powder. I have a little bullet blender so I can easily make just one serving at a time. Takes less than 5 minutes in the morning. Like pretty much everything else, I can buy giant bags of fruit from Coscto. I think a 4lb bag is 8 bucks and I get at least 8 smoothies out of it.  \n\nSo that is what I have made so far. I usually add some vegetable to my meals as well, broccoli, salad, and coleslaw have been my go tos. I meal prep for mon-fri so I don't have to worry about meals during class days.

Things like eggs, stir fry, and fried rice are great because you can throw a bunch of different ingredients in them and it'll taste good in the end. It's uses up things in your fridge that might be getting old and it's also a great way to build up confidence in the kitchen and experiment.", "author": "Ginn4364", "created": 1601154950, "upvotes": 23}, "g6q7g25": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j08w23/students_who_know_how_to_take_care_of_yourself/g6q7g25/", "text": "The key thing for me for lunch/dinner is to invest in a multitude of spices, for me it's the generic spices at any grocery store plus more niche spices for Indian and Mexican food, but for whatever cuisine you like find some spices, even pre-made mixes or what not. Having a bulk of that (not that expensive either) makes cooking and meal prepping much more fun and less stressful.  \n  \n\nFor actual meals, I go for big packs of frozen veggies, whatever the cheapest chicken/other meats/other proteins is, and usually rice. You can find this stuff for cheap usually and save it up. It doesn't get bland because of the different ways you can cook with a ton of spices, and in general range of things to make that are easy to do on like a Sunday for the week. Eggs, potatoes, onions are also nice to stock up on of you can, and if you have the money for some more fresh veggies or other stuff in general go for it. As for breakfast, at least personally what I do is have a meal with what I mentioned as my breakfast, and then lunch on campus (pre pandemic) being more of a breakfast in terms of lighter, easier to eat and pack food.  \n\n \nAll of this has gone out the window for me though since being at home and having nothing but family cooking everyday for the past 7 months and depression eating junk snacks because it's the only food that I enjoy anymore.", "author": "SGKurisu", "created": 1601154772, "upvotes": 26}, "g6q5he7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j08w23/students_who_know_how_to_take_care_of_yourself/g6q5he7/", "text": "I brought peanut butter and jelly most days for lunch.", "author": "OoglieBooglie93", "created": 1601154086, "upvotes": 1}, "g6q4tw9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j08w23/students_who_know_how_to_take_care_of_yourself/g6q4tw9/", "text": "My favorite breakfast meal (I also eat it for lunch and/or dinner as well) is an egg sandwich.

Spaghetti or Alfredo is literally boil noodles and heat up sauce. Throw in some ground beef or chicken strips if you\u2019re feeling fancy. Don\u2019t forget the salt and pepper. For a good sized single serving to measure out the pasta make a\ud83d\udc4c where your index finger meets the base of your thumb, about the size of a quarter. Also eggs are super versatile.
