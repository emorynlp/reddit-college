  "text": "Honor code\n\nHello all. I recently got honor coded for an exam. Apparently they stated I was looking away and staring during the test off screen. They suspect someone was next to me but I was honestly looking out the window to pass time. What are my odds and how can I tackle? They told me they have clear evidence of me looking away. I didn\u2019t deny I wasn\u2019t but told them I was staring out the window. I'm taking it to trial. What should I expect? Please advise.",

Or were you done in an extremely short amount of time? If these aren\u2019t the case, then they don\u2019t really have much to go off of. I have never dealt with this issue nor have I talked in depth to anyone who has, but there isn\u2019t much else they can say. I\u2019m not sure what the consequence would be, if any.",
