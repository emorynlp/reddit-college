I do well in my accounting courses but I don't like or dislike the subject, it just is. I took general chemistry and am now taking organic chemistry 1. I initially signed up for these chemistry courses out of a fantasy to one day study medicine.  Now though I'm not sure that would be possible so I call it a fantasy.  But I'm still enrolled in orgo, my first quiz did not go swimmingly (above average but not great).  The topic takes quite a bit of time for me to study but so far I find it sort of fun (naming the compounds and drawing the chair conformations) and it is to some extent feeding my curiosity.\n\nNow my **question(s)**: Am I wasting my time and recklessly threatening my grades?  Is the opportunity cost too high? If I don't use science in my career will my hours of study (*I know 9 months of an academic year is a very small percentage of one's potential time on Earth*) represent time wasted?  Will taking this Orgo class provide any transferable skills or teach me anything of value?", "author": "chemchild", "created": 1631998063, "retrieved": 1632801522, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdfa3jz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqu727/taking_orgo_for_fun/hdfa3jz/", "text": "I had to retake organic chemistry four times.\n\nFour times.\n\nI know that for most schools if you take organic chemistry lecture, you also have to take the accompanied lab course.\n\nBut since everything is online, you don't really get the hands on experience you would get if classes were in class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou still have time to drop it before the deadline.

In fact, I bet if I had taken organic chemistry it would come in handy for what I'm doing now, even though I would have never have guessed it 10 years ago.\n\nIn all honestly, there's only a relatively small subset of people who take classes like organic chemistry \"for fun,\" and those tend to be people similar to myself and are more prone than \"normal\" people to finding themselves working on cool and unexpected things some time down the road. One of the opportunities I've had was because I took a differential equations class \"for fun.\" I got lucky and that knowledge ended up being an entry ticket into a research lab, which then lead to more opportunities. I never had to take that class, nor was it necessary for the path I was on at the time. But because I took it, my path changed, very much so for the better.\n\nThis is all to say that right now you *think* you'll be an accountant, but how sure are you that that's what you'll be doing 10 years from now? Maybe you'll find that organic chemistry, of all things, opens up some doors into something that you end up liking better than accounting.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1631999877, "upvotes": 3}}}
