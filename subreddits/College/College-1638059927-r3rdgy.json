  "text": "Hi! I'm currently in the college admission process. I was wondering if there are any suggestions for safe schools that has good physics program. I'm interested in subatomic particle research in the future. \n\nMy stats are:\n\nSAT - 1510\n\nAverage grade (no GPA) : 94.6 / 100\n\nextracurriculars: 2 leadership position/ 2 team positions/ 3 club members/ 3 outside of school extracurriculars\n\n4 AP classes (my classes are for the whole year)\n\nI did not win any awards but i did get a medal for volunteering to reach a specific hour. I've joined 3 college classes",

Lots of research opportunities for undergrads in general (not sure abour particle in particular though), and a good amount of support for Physics-adjacent fields. Plus, speaking as someone who had similar stats, there is a good chance that you would get solid scholarships and aid - though your mileage may vary here.",
