      "text": "You can still try to import tax info, that wasn't new for 22-23 and it's never been automatic. Depends on how you and your parents filed, if you're eligible it'll prompt you to do so.\n\nIt's still asking the drug and selective service questions, though your answers no longer impact your aid eligibility; i expect the questions will be deleted from the 23-24 application.\n\nedit to clarify re taxes: the IRS DRT has been a thing for years, no idea why the articles keep bringing it up like it's a new thing. It'll be interesting to see how many people are actually able to use it though. Sometimes it just plain old doesn't work for mysterious reasons, probably to do with how and when people filed their taxes, like if they e-filed or mailed a paper return, or if they had regular people jobs or just filed corporate taxes bc their income is all from a business or whatever. And of course the IRS is still pretty backlogged from the ongoing unpleasantness.",
