I currently have a paramedics license and am working to finish school at a fire academy next semester. \n\nIts pretty hard to get a job as firefighter and moving around constantly with no firefighting experience makes it almost impossible. I would like to enroll in online school because if I am going to move around relatively unpredictably, I would like to be able to either advance my education or my career. \n\nAfter looking around for a while WGU seems like a great fit for me due to me not knowing anything about my schedule, living situation, or even really my financial situation. I'm also very very new to the college process however, and have only attended community colleges.\n\nMy main questions are; Can anyone who has attended WGU or another competency based learning program tell me a little bit about the experience? Does anyone know any similar programs? Any other suggestions for online learning programs? \n\nThanks for any advice.", "author": "jackissosick", "created": 1632357247, "retrieved": 1632800852, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
