  "text": "So I am currently a freshman at a university and want to transfer to an online community college after my first semester mainly to focus on my mental health and because I am struggling at my current university. \n\nI am currently a computer science major but I felt like it\u2019s too hard for me, so I want to go to a community college with an undecided major. Is this a good decision?",

      "text": "Yes.  As someone who flunked out of college years ago, and just recently went back, due to mental health issues I think this would be a very wise decision.  Your mental health needs to come first and it doesn't matter if you're at a community college or big university.  If you need to take some time off school to get to feeling better there's nothing wrong with that either.",
