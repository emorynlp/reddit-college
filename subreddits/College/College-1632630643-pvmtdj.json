Been there, and the harsh reality is that that's life for ya. None of it is fair, but it doesn't have to be brutal. There is one choice you have in all of this chaos and that's your response to it all. \n\nLemme put it to ya this way. You could drop out and you could find time to figure out yourself and what you wanna do. That's totally fine and there's no shame in that. At any point, if you decide to drop out and you wanna go back to school, that's fine too! \n\nOr, your response could be you try everything you can to kick the shit outta that class. Get more involved in school, join a club, try making friends with some of your classmates and go hang out with them. I know it sounds easier said than done, but give it some time and things will get better. You took an L, now it's your chance to bounce back.\n\nBut choose wtvr you feel is best for you.", "author": "TAMUVIBEZ", "created": 1632665927, "upvotes": 2}, "hec645p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvmtdj/how_to_drop_out/hec645p/", "text": "No friends?

But before you do there are other options. You\u2019re gonna take multiple tests in that class, ace those, you could also take it to the head of the department, for example if this is your history professor, take it up to the history department, they\u2019ll do something to help, I had a similar situation and this is what I did, it worked. No friends? Same lmao, I joined some clubs and made a couple of acquaintances, I\u2019ve been meeting people just by walking up to them and saying hey I\u2019m just trying to meet new people, are you busy? And we talk for a bit, it\u2019s nice. Get out of your dorm, sitting in the dorm won\u2019t get you any friends, you have a roommate? Or neighbors? Talk with them, that\u2019s how I got my friends in my other college, and clubs because you know you\u2019ll have something in common with people at clubs (I\u2019m sure you heard that a million times but it works).
