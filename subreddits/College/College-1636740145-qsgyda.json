  "text": "My daughter is undecided about career. She is a high school senior. She just took the ACT and amazed us with a 27. This includes a 35 on reading and a 32 in English. (She reads voraciously). 25 in science and  18 in Math. I teach school and though she doesn\u2019t like Math I know she could get that score to 25 with a couple months of tutoring.  I just am not sure how to advise her. She could take the ACT in Jan or Feb and I believe she\u2019d crack 30. Wouldn\u2019t we miss the application window. I\u2019d love for her to get a scholarship so she doesn\u2019t have to work or take out loans if possible.  Should we just go with this score or try for something more special.   I don\u2019t want to be pushy or give her the advice to settle. Thanks for any and all input.",

      "text": "Honestly I think it all depends on the application deadline for the colleges she is applying to. For some you may have to go with the 27, others you probably have time to take the test again and definitely should. A higher ACT score will certainly make getting into college easier and will probably open up some scholarship opportunities",
