  "text": "Ok, that might be a bit of overblowing the situation.\n\nBut here is the story: basically, it is my first year living in a dorm with someone else. At the beginning of the semester when we were signing the roommate contract and terms (i.e., the RA was asking questions on the rules we want to be both regulated and abide by), I tried not being an asshole and assumed that we can always decide stuff between ourselves without involving the RA. This way, I ended up screwing myself over bc I left the important (for me) parts of the contract up to interpretation.\n\nThe roommate constantly (well, ok, like 70% of the time when I am in the room to notice), plays Apex or League. And I'd be more or less ok with that, but he plays very distractively: usually, it is with friends, meaning that he ~~talks~~ yells, curses and once in a sudden he just screams random stuff like \"Jimmy, U R so sh\\*t at this game\", \"Heeelllloooooo! What's wrong that guy?\" or anything else like that. I hear him in my headphones with music. I do not hear the vacuum in my room in the same headphones with no music, just as a comparison. It is super distracting, impossible to do homework under that cacophony.\n\nHe recently told on me to the RA for several small things like washing the clothes too rarely. One of the things he apparently doesn't like is that I talk to my parents on the phone in the room (typically, it is quiet and like 20 minutes a day max). He refers to some \"American custom\" (I am a foreigner) that you guys leave the building when you are on the phone. Idk how true that is, but that seems rather suspicious, especially since he spends most of his time on discord with friends. I tried telling him that I'll do that if he keeps his volume down when playing, but he kept insisting on this stupid \"tradition\", and \"that's different\" bc his problem with me is not the sound I am making, but that \"that's considered weird here and causes \\[f\\*cking\\] tension\". and I had no time to pull anything up in google to call his bullsh\\*t during the argument. It is pretty tiring and hard to argue with a person when you have a significantly worse language than him bc instead of spending time to come up with arguments, you have just as much time to do that and also translate.\n\nSo, he keeps playing. Idk what to do bc he will most certainly come up with another stupid reason why he should be doing this if I raise the discussion again. Or he will just keep playing despite whatever agreement we reach bc I have no leverage on him. I can't tell the RA (or at least I can't expect any results) bc we signed the contract that anyone can play however much they want, and the \"unless it's distracting\" part was verbal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know I am an idiot, but what can I do now? I am pretty desperate, and I currently have only some insane ideas on how to also use loopholes in the contract to make him measurable enough to stop. I doubt, however, that that will work, and most likely will only enrage him more. Like, the best idea I currently have is to get a few dumbphones and (I am a CS) make a bot that will constantly spam myself with SMS and distract him too and only disable that when he agrees to stop, but I dislike this plan due to its time inefficiency and childishness. I also don't want to escalate bc there's no doubt he'll also devise a way to make my life more measurable if he wants to.\n\nYeah, I can't swap the room unless I want to pay twice the rent for the rest of the academic year.\n\nWhat would you do in this position?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThx in advance.",

      "text": "Talk to the RA. The contract thing isn\u2019t as serious as it sounds and a RA is gonna be understanding about a kid screaming his lungs out. The phone call thing is kinda true but it\u2019s more of a personal preference, it would be your call if you leave the room or not. It\u2019s more disrespectful that your roommate is putting forward the notion you cannot talk to your family in a space your comfortable in. I had issues with my roomate and my RA and RD were very understanding. Just make sure you have an established list and evidence when you talk to them because they often will ask for the roommates side of the story.",

That thing about leaving the room for a phone call isn't real. Your room is the appropriate place to take a call. You might leave a common area or a place where people are studying/working quietly to take a call, but you shouldn't have to leave your room for a short call once a day. Talk to the RA.",
