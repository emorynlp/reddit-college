  "text": "I had a presentation a couple days ago, I was prepared af, but when I got up there i started shaking like crazy. At first it was just my legs but then trying to focus on making them not shake made me shake even more, im certain the whole class could see. My voice sounded incredibly weak and shaky as well.\n\nI was never a fan of presentations but have never had it this bad. Generally I don\u2019t have any anxiety in day to day life either. And it\u2019s not like im not used to being in front of tons of people, I DJ packed events every other weekend for crying out loud, so I really don\u2019t get where this is coming from\ud83d\ude02 it was incredibly humiliating and the fact that im normally a pretty loud personality and the last type of person you would expect this from made it that much worse. We got another presentation in a couple weeks and now im shitting myself for real bc im worried its gonna happen again or be even worse now that im gonna be thinking about it and anticipating it.\n\nAny advice? I can\u2019t have this happen again. I was thinking of maybe taking a couple shots before class to relax (i can handle myself fine) but thats kind of a last resort. Anyone else deal with this shit and solve it?",

      "text": "Depending on the severity, your two best options are\n\n1) Practice talking in front of people until some of that anxiety dies down (this is the better option), or, if it's very severe\n\n2) Ask a doctor for a benzo or a beta blocker for presentation day. Many/most aren't too hesitant to give out small prescriptions for rare situational events. This is *much* better option than alcohol, lol.",

          "text": "Idk if the first one would work unless i can find random people I don\u2019t actually know to practice in front of. When it\u2019s just in front of homies my brain doesn\u2019t trip me up like that. Hell, mentally speaking I wasn\u2019t even that nervous during this presentation it was all physical. Like that tiny tremor spiraled out of control once i tried to make it stop. \n\nBut yeah I might look into something like beta blockers or something hopefully they can hook me up in time. Definitely seems smarter than getting shitfaced before every presentation from now on. I just CANT allow this shit to happen again\ud83d\ude05 and now imma be tweaking about it in advance too fml\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nI appreciate the advice !",
