  "text": "Story: I dropped out of school at 16 and I\u2019m now 26 and don\u2019t really know what to do. I\u2019m on disability due to a recent kidney transplant and want to use this time to go to school since I\u2019m not working and free. I don\u2019t want anything super stressful and I\u2019m horrible and math and English grammar.\n\nWhat career do I want: Not super sure, on the Business side I\u2019ve worked in retail, military factories and I\u2019ve worked as an automotive technician. Retail was my favorite (working at Walmart) and I was on a roll to be the Department Manager of meat/produce, until my kidney transplant. I\u2019d like to be a manager of a store or supermarket, on the financial side I\u2019ve always liked Stocks, analyzing wealth, managing money and budgeting. So maybe id try to be a financial advisor, wealth manager, Analysts or work for a bank. \n\nStress: I don\u2019t handle stress very well, which is why I think I\u2019d like a general management business degree more, I\u2019ve heard finance is super stressful and a lot of jobs in finance require sells, which I HATE. \n\nI just want something because I\u2019m sick of living in my parents garage having no hope for my future.",
