  "text": "Hi everyone! Hope you\u2019re all staying safe and well! Are there any colleges/universities in the US or Canada that you know of that let you take classes as a non matriculating student, and aren\u2019t extremely expensive? This is definitely something I could Google, but I was looking to see if anyone had any personal experience with one, in case you\u2019d like to share. Thanks so much in advance!",
