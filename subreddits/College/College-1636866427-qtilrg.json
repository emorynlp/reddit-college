  "text": "Last year i had a dual-enrollment class for Spanish and got 3 college credits for it. However, I forgot all about it and therefore didn\u2019t include it on my college applications/self reported transcript.\n\nSince there it\u2019s false info on the application, would this end up hurting me?\n\nAlso, will the credits be accounted for when the college I\u2019m planning on attending receives my official high school transcript, or should I talk to admissions about the error? (I am already accepted)",

The class was in the high school by a high school teacher, just happened to be worth college cred\n\nI think I got a physical copy of the transcript last year but i have no clue where it would be",
