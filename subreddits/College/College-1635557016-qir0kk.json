  "text": "I feel silly asking reddit before my professor, but it feels like a dumb question because I might be overthinking it. It's for a geography elective final. A part of our final requires a PowerPoint presentation and he just states in the instructions that it has to be a minimum of 10 slides with graphics. I haven't done a powerpoint in awhile, but anytime I have was for an IT class to learn how to use microsoft 360. Any time after that was just me making my own to help myself practice my speeches for other classes. Do professors typically just want the powerpoint itself or do you actually present it as the powerpoint goes along?",
