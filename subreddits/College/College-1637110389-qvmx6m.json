  "text": "TL;DR Got a pretty demanding job because of better pay and now I'm falling behind in my classes. Just talked to my doctor about ADHD/anxiety/insomnia treatments since I suspect those 3 things might be the main culprit of my poor time management. Any advice on how to manage my time well/organise my activities until I hear back about the test results/treatment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm currently taking about 13-14 credit hours at the moment. Recently, I decided to take a job as a pharmacy technician since it paid pretty well. However, it was pretty demanding (it was like taking another class, and I had to go through countless hours of online training before working in the actual pharmacy, which I found to be even more demanding than the online portion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI talked to my doctor about getting tested for anxiety and ADHD today, as well as sleep medication, since I have trouble staying asleep (I also go to bed pretty late, around 3-6AM most nights). Everything's been pretty overwhelming, so every time I start panicking about things, I'll usually hide somewhere and play games/watch something until I calm down, but by the time that's over, I'll be too tired to do anything. When I'm in the mood to work, I also have a tendency to organise everything poorly, since I jump between tasks that come to mind, as well as hyperfocusing on one thing and forgetting about everything else as a result. The hyperfocusing thing I've been doing with my job, so I completely forget about school until I see something that reminds me of my assignment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've tried using a planner, and it's decently helpful, but only if I 1) actually remember to use it and follow it and 2) don't avoid it in fear of looking at the stuff and realising I'm behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I've found that I do pretty well in classes that are completely in-person, or classes that are completely online and self-paced within a certain deadline. Virtual/blended classes, however, are a nightmare, since they involve Zoom meetings and I can't take them seriously for some reason. I usually get distracted for the entire duration (unless I hear something interesting), and those Zoom meetings contain the bulk of the class' lectures. I guess Zoom is just...really not engaging for some reason, it's more easy for things to go in one ear and out the other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStats and Calc, I'm doing great in (completely online and self-paced within a deadline period), and English/Comp is also going really well (completely in-person). I'm pretty sure I'm failing Bio (blended) even though I do decently in labs (in-person), because most of the content is from Zoom and I end up not being able to retain any info, even if I try to take notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah. Any idea of what to do to manage time? Should I consider medication if it's the result of a mental disorder?",

      "text": "You're either taking too many classes, or working too many hours at your job. Whether or not you have ADHD is irrelevant. If they find you do have ADHD or insomnia, taking meds for symptom control will be fine, but it won't change the fact that there are only 24 hours in a day and you either need to drop some classes or cut back drastically on how many hours you work.",
