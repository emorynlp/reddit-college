      "text": "I kinda started with that and narrowed it down based on what I didn\u2019t want to do. I didn\u2019t want liberal arts so I went stem. Then I didn\u2019t want to do a pure science and was tem. Picked engineering and chose electrical because I didn\u2019t want to do chem. 4 years later and here I am. Ideal major for me? Nah probably not, but I don\u2019t hate it and that\u2019s of most value to me :p",

      "text": "That's basically me. I wouldn't say it was totally random. I started by crossing out the things that I didn't really want : medicine / anything math - physics heavy / liberal arts / languages / IT majors/ anything that's completely useless.\nAnd this helped me figure out what's left and from then I started applying. I was hoping I'd get a health related degree but the educational system in my country is extremely unfair towards students with foreign certificates ( I am an IGCSE grad in Jordan). That's how I ended up with Finance.\nI start uni next Sunday, and needless to say I am very terrified. I wished I was easily inclined towards certain fields just like everyone around me is, but sadly all I considered were very pragmatic things when it came to picking my field. Depression makes everything way harder.",
