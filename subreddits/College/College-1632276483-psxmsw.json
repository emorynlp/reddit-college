Each week I had:\n\n* 200 pages or so spread across 3 text books to read\n* 1 long paper, generally 7-8 pages\n* 1 short paper, generally 3-4 pages\n* A discussion that had to be thought out/citied/etc\n* A weekly quiz (honestly the easiest part)\n* Also unlike a lot of my other professors I could not see the content that was scheduled for later weeks so even if I wanted to make a dent in next weeks work I couldn't. My other professors allow me to work ahead. Example in my math class I'm generally half a week to a full week ahead.\n\nIs it impossible to write 2 college papers, read 200 pages of text, and partake in a discussion every week? No, its not. But as an adult student with a full time job + a full time school load and considering I would estimate this professor work load he was giving us (on an undergraduate class, that is kinda a basic class) was in my opinion 3x of any other class.\n\nSo I decided on my evaluation to complain, I essentially said overall I think the professor is doing a good job but I attacked the work load A TON. I also attacked one of the text books which in my opinion was needlessly wordy and didn't get to the point and provided next to no value. I was told the survey results would be shared with my professor but he wouldn't know who said what.\n\nWell\n\nOur reading assignments are cut in half, that one text book that was terrible hasn't been assigned in 2 weeks. It now appears we will have 1 big paper due every 2 weeks, and 1 smaller paper due every week. And its either a discussion or a quiz, not both.\n\nFrom what I can tell my professor has no idea that I complained about him, which I don't want him to know cause I don't want that affecting my grades especially since much of the grading is going be subjective. Secondly, its way easier to deal with the level of work he is giving us.", "author": "PGLiberal", "created": 1632276483, "retrieved": 1632800812, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 347, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hdy998y": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxmsw/i_was_honest_in_a_survey_on_a_professor_and_i_saw/hdy998y/", "text": "> its way easier to deal with the level of work he is giving us.\n\n\nmuch easier to grade as well.", "author": "ObjectiveAnalysis643", "created": 1632396117, "upvotes": 1}, "hdxzt6p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxmsw/i_was_honest_in_a_survey_on_a_professor_and_i_saw/hdxzt6p/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632388323, "upvotes": 1}, "hdwkwfa": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxmsw/i_was_honest_in_a_survey_on_a_professor_and_i_saw/hdwkwfa/", "text": "Constructive feedback should be well received, it\u2019s not complaining!
