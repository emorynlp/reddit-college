  "title:": "Going through major depression. Do you think I can afford to skip a 35 point speech this week?",
  "text": "I'm taking intro to communication and we have a speech due Monday night. I've been in a deep depression for the last few weeks and this week I've gotten nothing done. I have a research paper due in my English course and chapters upon chapters of reading to catch up on. \n\nMy comm class has a speech due Monday night worth 35 points. I just dont have it in me to even start it. I have a 97.6% in the class right now. Do you think it's worth not doing? Prof doesn't do late work or extensions. \n\nAnd do you have any tips for pushing through mental illness? I've been glued to my bed for a few weeks. I dont have health insurance. I just feel really dead inside. Past the point of caring about consequences. Yet here I am, asking if the consequences are worth it lol",

      "text": "Maybe you can talk to da campus counselor (?. If not, maybe an organization for mental health. \nDepresion is like any other disease (even if society doesn\u2019t see it that way). Can you just say you\u2019re sick?, something like extreme diarrhea due to intoxicating with bad fish or something like that?\n\nIf you fail your tests and the class, it isn\u2019t worth your mental health. \n\nTips I can give you:\n1. Start small and be proud even for the small accomplishments. Did you manage to make your bed? Awesome!, did you clean your desk? Proudd!!, you didn\u2019t do anything in all day? Well, you survived that day, and that is enough. Be kind to yourself. \n2. Stay away from substances (drugs, alcohol, cigarettes)  it always make things worse. \n3. Ask for help, talk to a friend, family, even some cool profesor you trust. Don\u2019t isolate, even if you think there is no one that cares\u2026 someone usually do, keep looking. \n4. The only time you are \u201cwasting\u201d is the time you use to judge yourself :) \n\nHope that helps a little bit. Take care of yourself <3",

      "text": "First reach out to your professor and let them know what\u2019s happening, let them know you\u2019ll be reaching out to campus counseling and ask for a 1 week extension while you sort out your mental health.  Then actually reach out to campus counseling and have them support you and provide resources and services to help you through it.  I promise that just skipping out on the assignment might make you feel a little better now, but will exacerbate depressive feelings in a few weeks when you realize the implications of it.
