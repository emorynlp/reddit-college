  "text": "So the first week of school I was on a roll. I added calc right before the registration deadline and I was a little behind. One day of missed class turned into 5 weeks of missing class where i didn\u2019t turn in any work. My professor reached out to me a few times in which i didn\u2019t reply. I realized how far behind I was getting and I eventually reached back out to him and we created a catch up plan. He told me I had little less than a week to catch up with the rest of the class and I\u2019ve been watching the pre-recorded lectures but it\u2019s taking me a lot longer to understand the content. \n\nNot only that, I\u2019m also behind in Econ, and one of my excel classes. And it just seems like everything is piling on and it\u2019s becoming overwhelming. I\u2019m doing the work little by little but can you guys please recommend ways for me to get back on track? Is it possible to come back from such a fall?\n\nSince I attend a fairly small school there have been times where I\u2019ve been granted extensions well into the next semester in order to give me time to complete my courses. I think that is something I\u2019ll have to talk with my professors.",

      "text": "Yeah that\u2019s a situation I can relate to. You can\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking \u201coh, if I just get 100s on everything and work really hard\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t. So be realistic. If there\u2019s any one class weighing you down too much or irreparable damage. Drop it. You can make it up later or during a vacation",
