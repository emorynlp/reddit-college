  "text": "My roommate walks in and out saying bye to me. I don\u2019t ask her where she\u2019s going but I know it\u2019s to a party. I also don\u2019t wanna seem clingy af, but would it be ok if I literally went can I tag along? The thing is I get this feeling she wants to branch out and not hang out with her freaking roommate. But when our floor is a learning community and when she leaves so quickly after coming into the room, I feel like I\u2019m being left out. Lmao I\u2019m so clingy it\u2019s sad but my introverted self wishes she would invite me to come with instead of coming in and leaving quickly",

I know that sometimes if you have a friend in a particular club or a frat, it may be easier for you to go to a party. if that isn\u2019t the case, you could always ask your roommate where they go to party and tell them that you\u2019re genuinely interested. they may wanna go out with you! if not, there\u2019s always a chance that you could ask your friends.",
