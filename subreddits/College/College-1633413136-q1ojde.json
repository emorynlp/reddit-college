      "text": "Heyo! Criminology, Psychology, and Philosophy triple major here with a minor in Gender and Women\u2019s studies. I would absolutely recommend a Sociology or Gender and Women\u2019s Studies minor. They\u2019ll both give you great information to supplement your career in psych. Sociology will provide you with knowledge about society that will help you better understand the struggles of your clients and the structural inequalities in our nation (assuming you\u2019re in the US). GWS will give you the best tools for assisting victims of sexual violence and understanding how men and women are impacted by the media and conceptions of gender",

      "text": "Many people argue that minors usually have little to no set-in-stone influence on your career endeavors. That said, if you're going to have a minor, I don't think it would be a terrible idea to base it mostly on what interests you rather than how it can or cannot relate to your major.\n\nNonetheless, many people seem to pair a psychology major with a more technical minor, like biology or statistics, or one that is also within the social sciences, like sociology. After all, math is usually a big part of work in research, whether that's a broad understanding or in-depth calculation of it.",

But I intend to go to Law School and then practice criminal defense so these courses make sense for my goals. What about a Philosophy minor? The classes are typically writing heavy and the critical thinking skills you would gain could be quite helpful in research.",

If you decide to open a private practice, you can set the number of clients you want to see per week and set your own rate. Not everyone is good with business.",
