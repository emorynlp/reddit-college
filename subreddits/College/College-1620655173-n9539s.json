I feel really guilty since my other group mates are seniors and this was a major requirement class. I haven\u2019t spoke to my group mates about our final grade because i\u2019m not sure what to say...",

This often means \n\nA. poking underperforming group members,\n\nB. doing all the work yourself at the last minute (lol), or\n\nC. being okay with a less-than-perfect product. \n\nJust like in college (which is the real world, too.)\n\nIf your group members really wanted that A, it's on them to do A-C.
