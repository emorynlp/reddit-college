I was able to add the class I want to switch to but I can't drop the other class. So now it says I'm enrolled in two English Composition classes for the same semester. I don't start until January but I hate emailing and asking for help.",

But if you want to be successful in college you will have to send emails asking for help many, many times. So might as well start now. Just sit down, write the email and send it. You can do this!",
