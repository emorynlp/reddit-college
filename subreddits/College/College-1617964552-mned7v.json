I wrote my last exam for one course on Tuesday and I did very well. In the course, we had five exams worth 20% each. I calculated my final grade to be 89.3%, which is 0.2% away from the minimum to get an A+.\n\nI wish I tried harder. The frustrating thing is, if I had gotten one more question right on any of my five exams, I would have made the cut for an A+. *One measly question!*\n\nAhhh, I\u2019m so mad. I\u2019m not necessarily upset about the A, rather the fact that I was one question off/0.2% away from increasing my GPA.\n\nCan anyone else relate? Also, I\u2019m sorry if the formatting is all off. I\u2019m on mobile.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve received a lot of comments about messaging the prof. To clarify, I\u2019ve already emailed the course coordinator asking (politely, of course) if there\u2019s anything that I can do for extra credit. Unfortunately, nothing will bump up my grade. It\u2019s okay though, I will try harder next time!

For my microbio lab class, our lowest quiz score gets dropped but like on the day of our very last quiz, I slept through my alarm clock and I wasn't able to attend class to take a quiz.
