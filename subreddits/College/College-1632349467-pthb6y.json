Reverse Transfer?", "text": "So I\u2019m a freshman in college and have been having classes for about 3 ish weeks. I accidentally messed up on my syllabus quiz and got a 1/20 (never used canvas before, thought I could come back to the quiz after starting it) and have just made other stupid mistakes like forgetting about a math assignment and getting a 0 and forgetting another quiz in my history class, which is the same class I failed my syllabus quiz in. For some context the history class is all online except when we meet once a week for the lecture. \nAfter thinking about these things I\u2019ve been realizing that I don\u2019t actually enjoying classes or learning for the most part and feel lost and like I\u2019m already falling behind. The only part so far that I\u2019ve really enjoyed is hanging out with my friends and being independent from my parents. \nI know it\u2019s a little early in the year to be thinking about this but is a community college a better fit? Or do I just need to get my stuff together and figure it out lol. Maybe I\u2019m just being too dramatic haha.
