  "text": "I composed an album of the flagship buildings of each institution in the Atlantic Coast Conference because I was bored at work and enjoy architecture. If you have recommendations, especially when it comes to the identification of each architecture style, please let me know as I am very much an amateur! Some of these buildings' flagship statuses may be up to interpretation, so if you have insider knowledge, let me know which building I should have included. When it came to the category of flagship, I chose buildings based on: campus position, history, recognition, number of google images it shows up in (it is not an exact science), commonly associated structures, etc. I only chose structures that had space for use (no fountains, bell towers, arches, walls) and did not include sports-related structures. I plan to do this for every D-1 institution. For the pictures, I tried to limit myself to creative common images so some of the images may not be the best.
