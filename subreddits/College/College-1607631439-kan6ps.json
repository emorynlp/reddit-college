I used these tips to stay on the Dean's List, procrastinate mindfully, stop wasting time on studying ineffectively, and ease the stress of 18 college hours with my 3 homeschooled kids and a job.\n\n-MAKE A WORKSPACE: Make a little area that you keep your school stuff at. Sit there an hour a day to work, make important phone calls, ect. Your \"adulting\" spot. Dont doodle there. Dont eat dinner there. Dont play video games there. Even if it's a backpack, chair, and a tv tray. Mine is a desk in a closet. Decorate meaningfully. A school vision board and an erasable calendar maybe. \n\n-If you can, take notes on one word document so that you can search your notes instantly for a keyword. \n\n-MAKE TIME (just a little) to actually work. Everyday. Like a job. Even when you have no work to do, sit down at your desk for a bit every day and find something important to do that is unpleasant/has been put off and do it in that \"work time\". Make that appointment you havent made, call the matenience to fix the dishwasher you have been not using for a week bc you havent called, do whatever and limit the adulting to that hour and do it everyday. You'd be surprised how much an hours of actual work can get done if its consistent. But consistency is hard for me so I have to enforce it. My kids have an hour or so of nap/quiet time in their rooms while I work, and I rarely if ever need more time than that. Most of the time I spend outside of that is on important tests that cant be interrupted. \n\n-RITUALS: No not those. But you cant just sit down and expect to switch gears. Do something everytime you sit down to work that gets you \"in the zone.\" Maybe it's a cup of water and a journal, or checking your calendar or whatever, or even a cigarette and 20 minutes of a game that you only play right before you buckle down, set a timer. Setting out 15 minutes  or so to sit at my desk and bullshit actually makes me work better. \n\n-ONLY HIGHLIGHT key words in notes and textbooks. If the course has many dates and names, consider highlighting those in a seperate color.\n\n- COMBINE POWERPOINTS all the teachers powerpoints she sends out into one giant  PowerPoint that you can search for keywords efficiently.\n\n-COPY AND PASTE all test questions that allow it into ONE master document of test questions for each class: if you can correct the wrong answers after, even better. This takes no time if you do it during the tests, or print screen after you've taken it. Not all classes allow this, though.\n\n-INDEX everything that you cant search easily. If you do it as you go, it's easy but it's hard to get started. \n\n-  *Leave it for the due date* , if you have to, but not the night it's due. Work in the morning. Trust me. Wake up at the same time everyday. Do something pleasant for a limited time and then work until you're done for the day. Then you can enjoy you're whole day without the clock ticking down to 11:55PM when that quiz is due that you've known about for 2 weeks and havent done. It's going to happen, it always will, but it you do it that morning, you will always feel better. \n\n- Bring your snack or drink with you and dont get up, if you can manage that.\n\n- totally optional: Bullet journals. Especially for those that love to be creative, hate taking notes, and cant seem to get organized. Everyone loves to be organized and consistent, deep down.", "author": "someones--mom", "created": 1607631439, "retrieved": 1632801613, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1906, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"gjfa137": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gjfa137/", "text": "Thanks for the post, I'm finding it helpful as I'm planning my upcoming semester.

I'm not really going to defend my schedule because maybe it's a dumpster fire and you guys know something I dont. I'm willing to accept that. But I also have some advice that might be harsh... you guys are wasting your lives.\n\n No offense everyone saying that my major is a joke, but it's one of the most well paid and stable degrees you can get right now. I go to a well recognized state school. If my degree is a joke than most degrees are jokes. \n\nMore likely, you may not be as efficient of students as you think and you're letting your early adulthood destroy you. College is not a prison. I LOVE school. I wanted to be a career student even. I enjoy every single hour I put into school. It's not a burden or a prison. No offense but maybe some of you need to reorganize your lives to work for you. I had three kids already, I'm not judging. But now I have three kids, Almost a dual degree, writing a fantasy novel while I watch my kiddos, I finish a book for fun in just my spare toilet time at least once a month. I watch netflix while I clean and I work out daily to wind down. I have ADHD so even if I had the time to sit for hours a day after work, that would be soul crushing and more importantly OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY... for me and my skill set.\n\nYou guys need to enjoy yourselves more! School isnt my whole life. Just one beautiful part of it. To stay healthy and happy and challenged, I can only spend 1 hour a day and make the grades obviously other people do, then why should I? That's what efficent people do, they dont waste their time. \n\nMy heart goes out to you guys. \n\nBut just because I'm not falling apart every exam, doesnt mean I'm not learning anything. I have a finance job now and I apply things I learned in school constantly. I did absolutely top tier in high school, loved the shit out of it,  and basically did no work at home. School is easy for me and maybe that's the missing piece. If you need 40+ hours a week for your 4 classes because you cant pass them without selling your entire life, leave college and get a job you love, you may be the one who wakes up a year after graduation and realized that your technology degree is obliterated by an algorithm and that you wasted your life on school. But if you fully utilized that time and enjoyed school how it was meant to be enjoyed, you didnt waste your time. College wasnt meant to kill you.", "author": "someones--mom", "created": 1607792260, "upvotes": 0}, "gfjojg4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gfjojg4/", "text": "If you can spend this little time on homework for your degree then your major/ program is a joke.", "author": "qonkwan", "created": 1607790575, "upvotes": 3}, "gfjk89q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gfjk89q/", "text": "1 hour a day shows that you have a very low workload", "author": "Wizard_Nose", "created": 1607789087, "upvotes": 3}, "gfij17h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gfij17h/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1607774885, "upvotes": 1}, "gfhd0vv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gfhd0vv/", "text": "Combine PowerPoint: never a problem for a Mac user.", "author": "nerdDragon07", "created": 1607741464, "upvotes": 1}, "gff8rbv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gff8rbv/", "text": "This is everything I needed before this past semester, thank you for your wisdom", "author": "baijones1", "created": 1607712300, "upvotes": 1}, "gff2v9a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kan6ps/i_23f_have_adhd_and_ive_been_a_straight_a_18hr_a/gff2v9a/", "text": "Just a tip to add to one of the points you made.
