  "text": "Am gonna start applying for placements and I'm worried my CV is not competitive enough. I have stuff on it, my first year grade is great and I've done a lot of extracurriculars, but nothing related to my course (Computer Science). If you were accepted by some big company, can you tell me what your CV was like, or send it to me if that's OK with you.",
