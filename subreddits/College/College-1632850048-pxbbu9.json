  "text": "I went to a counseling session recently and I had mentioned that my freshman year was entirely through zoom and my counselor mentioned how that was probably a big reason that I feel socially behind everybody else. I can kinda see why she's right considering that most of my friends who went in person have changed considerably and gotten arguably better relationships. I know that she was just trying to explain how my anxiety and lack of connection is completely natural considering my circumstances but honestly I feel like such a dumbass for missing freshman year. Is there anyone here who has personal experiences that contradict or agree with this information?",

      "text": "Honestly? I found it exponentially harder to make friends after freshman year. The first year, everybody\u2019s looking. After that, people are more settled into their already formed friendships. Fewer people are actively searching. They\u2019re still receptive, but now you have to put in more effort (as opposed to an equal amount of effort coming from both individuals). \n\nHowever, it\u2019s far from impossible. There are lots of people who transfer schools, and I\u2019ve heard of people who made their best friends after sophomore year. So I\u2019d say that freshman year is important, but missing it is not the end of the world.",

      "text": "I\u2019d agree with the counselor\u2026you would normally get so much contact with people just walking to class, being around the dorms, in class etc. That being said, you can still have all of that if it\u2019s off zoom next year.",
