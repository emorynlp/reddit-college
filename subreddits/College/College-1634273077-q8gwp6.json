Now in college, I\u2019m forced to drastically improve my work ethic to manage all the studying, and actually care about my grades because my performance in college will directly affect my future.  Yet despite working 10 times harder then I ever have in my academic history, I\u2019m barely scraping the B range in most of my classes.  I miss when grades were the linear output of effort",

It feels so weird when people talk about their crazy, fun high school memories, while sometimes whole months/semesters just blend together for me because nothing memorable even happened.\n\nEven now, I used to live on campus at the first college I attended, and I didn't even interact with people or make much friends like I thought I would (sort of due to relationship issues, but still). Honestly worried that I'm gonna somewhat repeat my high school experience in these college years too.\n\nWhat about you though, hopefully college is better in some ways at least?",

              "text": "I feel the same way, so I'll offer an answer.\n\nThe classes are much higher quality. I pick and choose what I get to learn, when I get to learn, and have the freedom of an adult. Being my own responsibility makes me feel way better than teachers who did anything in their power to make you pass on the bare minimum. And, choosing my schedule versus the strict and structured environment of highschool is much more preferable and flexible. \n\nThe professors are almost always passionate about what they teach, in my experience, which offers a better learning environment. Professors also don't hold your hand and coddle you, they treat you with respect as the adult you are (in most cases). I like that. I never liked being treated as a teenager without merits. And I like that it takes more work to get good grades, because the focus is on education and learning, not assignment completion (again, in most cases). I like being held accountable for my time management and work, they're important lessons.\n\nPeople have their own things going on, and there's a lot more of them. If you make friends, chances are you're going to meet a lot more people of similar interest in comparison to making friends in highschool based off proximity. You can also really get involved in campus life, if socializing is your thing (it's not a priority for me, personally), but clubs and sororities/fraternities also offer networking opportunities. \n\nColleges practically hand over internships like candy for whatever career you're interested in. They also normally have a ton of academic resources like computer labs, hardware equipment, libraries, databases, etc. The food isn't great, but it's much better, and there are different places to study or eat at.\n\nCollege is miles ahead of highschool imo. I hated my highschool experience, but I'm loving my college one. That being said, it's not for everyone. A lot of kids seem to have a hard time adjusting to college right after getting out of highschool. A gap year may be good for you.",
