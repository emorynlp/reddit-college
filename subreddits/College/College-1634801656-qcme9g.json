      "text": "See if there\u2019s an MIS(management information systems) degree. \n\nIt teaches half technology(programming, databases, networking, hardware, software, troubleshooting) \n\nand half business(project management, accounting, possibly economics, and other miscellaneous business type classes). \n\nIt could also be called information technology, information systems, or computer information systems. If it\u2019s in the school of business it\u2019s good.\n\nIf this isn\u2019t an option, your next best bet would probably be a CS degree with a minor in business or a cs degree and an MBA(if you don\u2019t mind a masters), but really an accounting degree would also be really good, so I\u2019d just pick the one you think you\u2019d enjoy more.",

      "text": "What KIND of business? I mean, if you wanted to start a bakery, I would tell you culinary arts. If you wanted to run a publishing house, I'd tell you literature or creative writing. Finances? Finance. If you wan to run something like Walmart, then I'd suggest an MBA, a path you can get to by studying anything in your undergrad. A tech company? Then comp science. I do not know anyone who has gotten an accounting degree and went on to run a business... unless you want to run an accounting firm/business?",
