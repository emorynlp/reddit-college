  "text": "I\u2019m going to be applying for college very soon and I have been researching on and off for over a year but I cannot determine which school would be best for me. I want to major in Finance because I\u2019ve been interested in economics since I was 14. I currently live on the west coast however I would ideally like to live in a new part of the country. Where I currently live is no big city and everyone here is white. I want to move somewhere that I can meet new people of diverse backgrounds, I feel that this will benefit me greatly in my future career. \n\nI am very fortunate to not have to worry about my expenses during college so that is why I am very comfortable going somewhere far and possibly expensive. After all my research I still have barely any preference about what I want. The only thing I really care about is going to an accredited school that I can earn a major in finance. My parents want me to go for the college experience, but I just want a degree so I can start working for my future. \n\nI\u2019m not too concerned about an active campus. I\u2019m fine with living in a dorm for the first year or two however I\u2019d prefer to find a roommate. Depending on the area/housing market I may want to buy a house to use as a place to live/investment. Preferably I want a small to medium school so I can focus on my learning. (Please still recommend large schools)\n\nThank you so much for any recommendations and insight. I appreciate everyone thought, have a wonderful day.",
