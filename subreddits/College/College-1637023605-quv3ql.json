  "title:": "Feeling like I should drop out but I don\u2019t know if I should",
  "text": "I\u2019m 19. I\u2019ve only completed a total of 2 semesters at my community college and I\u2019ve taken both summer and fall semesters off. I originally planned to go back in January of 2022 when spring semester starts, but I honestly don\u2019t think I can do it. I wanted to take a gap year after I graduated HS last year due to grieving two very important people who had passed earlier in the year. But I got sick of my dad\u2019s nagging and went ahead and went which was absolutely the worst decision. \n\nI\u2019ve passed all my classes by the skin of my teeth. I have a super low GPA and the idea of going back makes me sick. When I was taking classes I wasn\u2019t sleeping or eating, even though I was just part time, because I was always stressed out about my school work. I don\u2019t know what I want to do as far as my future career goes and I\u2019ve changed my major twice and I know if I go back in Jan. I will end up changing it again. Financial aid is honestly another reason. I\u2019m paying for my schooling 100% and because I\u2019m 19, I\u2019m still considered a dependent even though I live alone and won\u2019t be considered independent until I\u2019m 24. My aid still goes by my dad\u2019s income &tax info, but he lives 3 1/2 hours away and he doesn\u2019t do well with computers so I have to actually be there to help him with it. I work full time as he does too and it\u2019s damn near impossible to find time for us both to get it sorted out. \n\nI\u2019m at a point I\u2019d rather just drop out (even if it means being the resident family disappointment) and save my mental health and find myself better and go back when I\u2019m ready. I just wish I would have waited and gone when I was truly ready like I wanted to because I knew this would happen. I want to go to college, I\u2019ve always planned to, but it\u2019s not worth feeling like this. People say college is where you find yourself the most, but I personally feel like college made me lose myself completely.",

I originally went to college for computer science but it just wasn\u2019t for me. Which, within all fairness, I wasn\u2019t a fan of it in school either but it was go back to regular high school or stay in that program since I couldn\u2019t change it.",
