Plus, there may be some value in learning how to manage distractions like screen time, since it will carry over to things like computer use.\n\n\nYou could delete some of the apps that suck up most of your time if it's something like social media. If it's messages popping up, you could turn off your notifications, put your phone on silent, etc. It may help to have designated times when you can goof on the phone so you're more intentional about your technology use. You could even do something like leaving your phone in another room or in a place where you won't see it when you don't want to use it. If none of that works, it could be worth the switch, but those other things are worth trying first.",

I agree with other posters that time-managment apps might be a better move at first. Also agree that procrastination is not a problem that can be fixed by removing the smartphone.

If you wanna go that far, maybe instead you should just delete all your most used apps; apps like reddit, Instagram, tiktok etc. Or just temporarily disable your accounts. That way you wont use it. I suggest not replacing it with a flip phone cause an iPhone per say has very useful features, especially as a student (so you might regret that decision) . Hopefully that helps :)",
