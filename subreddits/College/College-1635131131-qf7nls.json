  "text": "\n\nHi\n\nSo I\u2019ve been freaking out over the past few days. I had a midterm recently and it went alright but I knew I got a decent amount of questions wrong since I hadn\u2019t studied enough and there were some technical difficulties.\n\nIt seems many in the class also experienced the difficulties since it had to do with the format of the exam on our online platform. Due to this our professor was very nice and offered to let us retake it the next day.\n\nSo this was all good but here\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. Our professor made an announcement and she linked a PDF of the question where there was a formatting error. This was like a chart and it had a few questions based on it. She had mentioned that she had uploaded this in case we had any difficulties during the exam (I can\u2019t remember if I even read this part). In the post she also mentioned she was giving us half the time since we already knew the questions and answers. Due to this I thought it would be fine to look at the PDF and possibly use it to make sure I\u2019m ready to do good on the retest. I downloaded it and put it into my notes app on my iPad and looked through it. I planned to use this to solve the questions during the test which I did. \n\nAt the time I was also focusing on preparing for my organic chemistry lab. It didn\u2019t occur to me then that this could possibly be academic misconduct. I thought since she uploaded it and it wasn\u2019t locked or anything and she didn\u2019t say anything about not looking at it that it was ok to look through, especially since we already knew the questions. \n\n1) Do you guys think this would be considered academic dishonesty?\n2) I know our online platform does show the times that files were opened and downloaded. Would this be something that my professor would question me about.\n3) if my professor did question me about this do you think they would try and punish me for something like this if I explained this to them?\n\nI\u2019ve just been really stressed and scared these last few days. I do have an anxiety disorder so i\u2019m not sure if i\u2019m just overthinking it and being paranoid or if I really should be worried and have possibly put my future medical career in jeopardy?\n\nThank you guys for your help!",
