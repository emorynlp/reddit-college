  "text": "I go to a business school and I pass/failed two liberal arts electives just because I wanted to enjoy these classes without needing to study really hard. And, they were electives that I needed to fulfill anyway, but don't count toward my core and major.\n\nAlso, my school gave me the opportunity to P/F all my core/major classes on Spring 2020 due to COVID, but I decided to do none of that because these classes actually mattered (compared to the ones I actually P/F'd) and I got an A on all of em. In fact, I got A's on most of my classes, with 2 A- and a B+ and I'm in my senior year.\n\nLike, do you think grad school or an employer would even question my P/F?",

      "text": "Because they are electives, employers won\u2019t care. In fact, if they ever ask you on an interview why you took it P/F (I promise recruiting won\u2019t care), it\u2019s a great oppty to tell them your reason, what you learned from the classes, and how liberating yourself from the elective grade allowed you to better balance your time across all your classes while getting valuable enrichment from the electives. \n\nGrad school cares about your holistic transcript, your test scores if they\u2019re accepting GMATs, ECs, and your letters of reco. Don\u2019t sweat the electives. And if they ask, answer the same way. Good luck!",

      "text": "Employers won\u2019t care, but grad school, maybe. If you\u2019re doing grad at the same college you should be fine, but it could be an issue if you transfer. If the P/F was during lockdown when everything first went online, it should be fine anywhere.",
