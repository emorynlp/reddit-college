Gotta cram everything in so I don't have to spend another summer in between semesters and then pay for another semester.\n\nFrom a more ideological perspective, I do think that there is a benefit to finishing a 4 year degree in 5 years. This may be controversial (I know students hate taking classes outside of their major!) but I think students benefit from taking a variety of classes at the college level, regardless of their major. I think everyone should take an environmental class, language or foreign studies class, basic biology class, and maybe a few other gen eds. And of course more time to finish a degree is less stressful and lets students gain more experience and a closer relationship with professors before graduating. But it's too expensive!",

There is societal pressure to go to college and finish it soon because the older you get the hardest it is to understand the concepts and the less time you have to dedicate to it. However, I think is better to think it through first before going straight to it. I went to college at 19 and I just good good friends but nothing useful. I went back at 28 and it has been a completely different experience. I actually liked it more and enjoy going to the classes  I care about. I'm so much better at time management, and I can take full advantage of the networking opportunities which I didn't do at 19 at all.",

It also has to do with scholarships. Most are 4-year and require 15 hours a semester.",

I am currently full time (barely with 13 credits) while working 34 hours/week and wouldn't do more than that at this point. I may even go down to half time once my class schedules end up being mostly biology and math (hard classes for me). My field is very competitive and you have to have good grades, so I am just taking it easy on myself and seeing where that lands me. If it takes more than 4 years, at least I won't look back and feel like I was a total wreck for the whole time I was in school! You do you. Many people hurry through school then don't even end up using their degree. It's all about the journey feeling right for you, emotionally and financially. Good luck!!",
