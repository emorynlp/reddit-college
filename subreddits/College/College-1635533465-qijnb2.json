  "text": "So I\u2019m new to college this is my first year attending BMCC which is a CUNY school . And since I\u2019m not vaccinated yesterday I received a email stating that I will be withdrawn from 2 out of 4 of my online classes PSYCHOLOGY ( which is my major ) and Public speech . I\u2019m so upset and discouraged because I\u2019m not even attending campus in person . They are saying these 2 classes are hybrid but the days to meet passed already I dont know why there are doing this  . I dont have an academic advisor because I was never assigned one . I was told to speak to BMCC health department. Any advice or anything would be great\u2026",

You're the asshole here, lol. \n\nNYC probably has some of the strictest vaccines policies in the nation. Unless you live under a rock, there's simply no way you couldn't have seen this coming. Take this as a lesson for the future-- follow policy or face consequences.\n\nThat being said, out of really weird sheer coincidence I happen to have some 2nd hand familiarity with the president of that school and it would not surprise me at all if the school was not clear about their policy, in which case some fault is on them, but even if the school didn't say a thing, you'd have to live under a rock to not expect this. The city mandates vaccines for damn near every situation you could think of and you go to a city school. Did you really think you'd be able to get away with not getting a vaccine while being enrolled in classes that aren't fully online?",
