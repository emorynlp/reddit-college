  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am a junior majoring in accounting and i have had an internship this semester working in my field. I hate the job and it makes me depressed thinking about having to do this for the rest of my life. The problem is I don\u2019t know what I want to do or what would make me happy. I already have an internship lined up for next semester and I graduate in one year. I guess i\u2019m just kinda lost as to what I should do. I love school and learning but hate the accounting field. I feel like maybe i\u2019m just being dramatic but then again i\u2019m not sure.",
