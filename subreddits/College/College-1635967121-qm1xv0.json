  "title:": "General Studies Degree before Transferring",
  "text": "So to keep it short, the pandemic last year hurt my family a lot financially so i wasn\u2019t able to go to my school of choice right after graduating in 2020. So i was pretty much forced to go to a community college if i wanted to continue my education. I did a year there thus far but i am still undecided on my major but i have interests. So i took regular classes there so i could get some credit for when i reapply to my other university. \n\nThankfully things are better and i recieved a bit of merit aid which makes it a better option financially to transfer to my university of choice for Spring 2022. They would take all my credits but i noticed that i would be able to complete a general studies degree this semester with the work ive done so far. \n\nSo this might be a no brainer but should i just switch my program to general studies to get the degree before i transfer? I know it\u2019s practically useless but it\u2019s something i could atleast get instead of just transferring with credits. plus, if i ever need to apply to some crappy part time job during school if money is tight it would help to show atleast a little college education right?",
