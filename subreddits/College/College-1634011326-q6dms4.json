  "text": "I\u2019m trying to major in Computer science. I am taking Calculus 2 twice a week and I\u2019ve legit never hated a class as much as this one, I actually despise it and it pisses me off. Throughout high school math was one of the subjects that just came naturally to me. My senior year I took AP calculus AB and I did really well. I got a 4 on the AP exam and finished with a 90 in the second semester. Can\u2019t say the same about calc 2 so far. Every time I go to that damn class I go in there knowing I\u2019m not gonna learn shit because the teacher goes so fast and expects us to have memorized all of the shit from calc 1 and anything before that. I feel like I don\u2019t belong and it really brings my mood down. On top of that, he assigns a ton of homework. I kid you not we actually keep learning shit two class periods before exams and then he gives us only one class period to review everything we\u2019ve learned from the entire unit which is 2-3 weeks. The shit of the lessons that he goes through is basically just doing problems super fast while explaining it, we go through multiple lessons of the chapter in the same class periods btw so if you don\u2019t get something you\u2019re screwed. Then he assigns about 30 homework problems due the next week on the Monday (I take the classes Tuesdays and Thursdays). These \u201chomework sessions don\u2019t teach shit because you\u2019re trying to get a good grade on them and they usually take me about 4 hours. I got a 62 on the first test and it\u2019s only because the grading scale is curved as hell for exams. Anyways, one of my classmates mentioned last week to the whole class like \u201cyo there\u2019s 6 homeworks and a quiz due next week\u201d which is this week aka exam 2 week. And the teacher\u2019s response was \u201choohoohoo, looks like you guys have a lot of math to do this weekend.\u201d Are you shitting me man, what a freaking asshole. All of those are over 50 problems and they\u2019re due the day before the exam. We can\u2019t even ask about those homework problems because we don\u2019t have class the day before the exam. How can you fucking expect anyone to do well on something that you\u2019re not even giving them enough time to master. Sigh I should probably keep working on this shit. I\u2019ve already taken 3 hours on the first set and I\u2019m only 50 percent done. I\u2019m wondering if this major is even worth it fml. I need help.",

The homework stuff I can't really say much except try to just grind them out and understand them. You got this!",
