I don\u2019t need a job and my parents don\u2019t want me to get one however i know i will run low on funds i have saved over the summer for the school year. \ni just want a little extra spending money maybe work 2-3 days a week? do college towns offer jobs that do stuff like that",

Although theyre often extremely easy and give time to study while on shift, I cant say Ive ever needed extra time to study even with my job and 16-18hrs/semester.",

Depending on how much time you need to put into classes it\u2019s definitely manageable at 2-3 days a week. I work at a grocery store and depending on the department they\u2019re really flexible with my class schedule. If you don\u2019t want to work on campus I\u2019d definitely suggest a grocery store. When talking about the hours you want to work you have to tell them what days you can/ can\u2019t work because of classes. Even throw in some extra time for yourself so you\u2019re not going straight from class to work. They won\u2019t know the difference if you say you can\u2019t work till 5 when your last class ends at 2. You have to balance time for yourself too and I feel thats where things can get overwhelming.",

I would say if you can focus on your degree and not work, you should put all your focus in and make do with not buying fun things. I've been in college for one full school year and it's taken me two full years due to having to work full time. If you were to work, I'd suggest maybe only one or two days a week, babysitting pays quite a bit.",

I didn't have to drive since the bus system was free to students. \n\nI know there were also student jobs working in the cafeteria or at the student gyms. One of my roommates was a lifeguard at one of the gyms. Another worked in an ice cream store near campus. You should check to see if your college has an email list or listserv with student jobs. There were also bulletin boards at the cafeterias were people would post jobs sometimes. Just avoid things like MLMs (pyramid schemes).",

Also very much depends on the type of job that you're working and how much you value endeavors outside of school and work. Try a variety of different things. Have a good support system, if possible. Be able to communicate with your employer(s) and professors. Don't be afraid to admit to yourself if it's too much, and definitely prioritize your mental health! Best of luck to you, OP!",

We are not robots, we are all humans beings. Working two jobs for me was stressful, the good thing of all that was leaving my dorm and roommates and finding other individuals I can interact with and be social instead of being stuck in the dorm after classes and etc. At the end. Do what you feel like doing, have fun, go party, but don't forget to build character and make your own self dependent.
