  "text": "Since school is starting back up again I just wanted to make this post to help and warn people. \n\nIf you're not a drinker or partier don't feel like you have to go out and do those things because \"everyone else is doing it and it's part of the experience\". Not everyone is doing it, plenty of people don't drink or go out partying and they still have fun, they still make friends and they still have great memories. \n\nDon't feel obligated to do stuff you wouldn't normally do because your roommate or friends are doing it. It's okay to tell them no!",

I prefer to just stay in and veg out on the couch and watch YouTube videos. I'm also an introvert so that probably explains it.\n\nI really hate the idea that society pushes on us that you have to get blackout drunk every night to be \"cool.\" (I know I'm exaggerating lol, but I do that when I rant) What, so not drinking until I lose consciousness and puke or whatnot makes me a loser???? Like I'm going to fail at life just because I'd rather watch videos than get higher than Mount Everest???? Am I going to be a social outcast for the rest of my life because I don't torture my lungs by smoking a pack of cigarettes a day???? No, I won't. That's BS.\n\nI don't have a problem with people doing that stuff if that's what they're into, as long as it doesn't affect my life (shoutout to one of my suitemates last year who would smoke in our connected bathroom, making the suite smell like pot and forcing me to leave the room just to chill on YouTube at midnight because I couldn't deal with the smell) but 1) don't be like my suitemate and 2) don't try to push your lifestyle on other people. Not everyone is into pregaming 24/7.\n\nSorry for the rant, and thanks for coming to my TED talk lol :)",

      "text": "I didnt drink at all in college. From mg experience this is what ill say (im not saying my experience is the knlg experience):\n\nI agree on everything said in the post. I think your experience will  depend alot on who your friends are. I was the ionly one of my friends who didnt drink. Nobody really pressured me to drink but i was asked on a routine basis about drinking, especially when people around me were drinking and i wasnt. Even though saying no once got people to stop asking, hearing it asked by 10 different people every night did get draining and having to answer why i dont drink. Again, nobody pressured me but i sometimes thought about drinking just to avoid getting asked. I never did though.\n\nI did want to hang out and party but because i didnt drink many people never kept me in the loop on a parties especially the friends i was closest to. I called them out on it once and they told me \u201cwe thought partying wasnt your thing\u201d. Which i felt is an excuse they told themselves to not invite me. My friends did try after that and i appreciate they did but i could defientely tell i was always the 3rd wheel of the groupI\n. I never felt like i had a close bond with them and i think because i never drank with them we never created that close bond people create when they can get drunk together. I had a good time in colege but i wouldnt say i had all the fun i couldve had. Im slightly introverted so i also didnt do as much to find things to do outside mg friend group. I think the experience i had with my friends made me self conscience about not drinking in college.\n\nIm saying this to say: make sure you get friends who if they do drink, dont mind keeping you involved and if they dont, dont be afraid to be by yourself while you find new friends.",

      "text": "If you do choose to party make sure you get a pair of shit shoes,  I mean a pair of shoes that look nice but you don't care if they get ruined because they will get ruined. There's a lot of spilled beer vomit and other things on various basement floors And you will be walking through it. on a side note Do yourself a favor if you want to wear heels wear boots with closed toes,  Just trust me on this more than one of my female friends has gotten unpleasant things on their feet because they wore heels to a party.. If you are going clubbing and not to frat party  You might be OK with the heels but just have a pair of flat shoes that that you think are cute but you don't give a crap about to wear to parties and that sort of thing because trust me by the end of your 2nd quarter there will be a great deal of destruction associated with o'shoes and they will be in bad condition you're probably just going to want to toss them at the end of the year and get a new pair for the following year if you choose to drink and party",

People should not feel pressured to do more than they feel comfortable.\n\nI went to a \"party school\", where just about everyone partied. But most people knew how to turn off the switch at the right time to get stuff done. Find your own pace and don't forget why you're at school in the first place.",

      "text": "Can I add - if you DO become interested in drinking, learn some alcohol safety first. Learn how many drinks would get you tipsy then drunk based on your weight. Learn what signs are for alcohol poisoning and how to handle that kind of emergency (call 911). Drink your first time around people you trust, and just try to observe how you feel after a drink or two. Don't drink more just because you're feeling good, at a certain point drinking more doesn't increase the good, fun part of drinking, you just make yourself more at risk of getting sick or blacking out. Eat food and hydrate before you drink, drink water while you drink. Don't drink in college without friends around, it's really important to be able to look out for one another, especially at larger parties. Always keep an eye on your drink. Don't drink to cope with mental illness, instead seek out healthy coping mechanisms, therapy, etc. Never drink and drive, and never ride with someone who's had alcohol or is under the influence of any other substances. \n\nThose are just some basic tips. Good luck, and yes, you do not have to drink at all if you don't want to. Good friends won't care and will respect your choices. If you don't like being around when they drink, if they're good friends, they'll be cool with trying to do things other than party / incorporate some hangouts that aren't centered around drinking. (But if they're just having a drink or two, it really won't make much of a difference when hanging out with them. There is a difference in a casual drink and \"drinking\" as the main reason for the hangout)",

It's a genetic condition. Your body can't process alcohol properly and you're poisoning yourself - even more than is normal. If you keep drinking, you're at significantly higher risk of cancer. And your intolerance will never go away, no matter how much you drink. It will always, always suck for you and then you will get throat cancer. \n\nIf you're East Asian, there's a 30-50% chance you have alcohol intolerance (hence the \"Asian\" part of \"Asian flush\").",

You really gotta figure out what works for you to avoid burnout and make the most of your studies. Everyone's different though, it's a lot of trial and error to see what really works.",

Parties, while they are for drinking, they're also for socializing. People can socialize a bit without drinking.   \n\n\nA bit of an aside, I was kind of uncomfortable at parties when I didn't drink just because it was weird to see everyone else drunk and talk to them when I wasn't also drunk. I still had some fun though. I think over time people who don't drink will get a feel for whether parties are the most worthwhile place to go to socialize. Everyone's different, how the experience goes depends on who all you go out with, what the vibe is, etc.",

Water is often used to slow or address the effects of alcohol as well.",
