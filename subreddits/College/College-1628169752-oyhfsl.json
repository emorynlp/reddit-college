Not everyone is doing it, plenty of people don't drink or go out partying and they still have fun, they still make friends and they still have great memories. \n\nDon't feel obligated to do stuff you wouldn't normally do because your roommate or friends are doing it.

Like I'm going to fail at life just because I'd rather watch videos than get higher than Mount Everest???? Am I going to be a social outcast for the rest of my life because I don't torture my lungs by smoking a pack of cigarettes a day???? No, I won't. That's BS.\n\nI don't have a problem with people doing that stuff if that's what they're into, as long as it doesn't affect my life (shoutout to one of my suitemates last year who would smoke in our connected bathroom, making the suite smell like pot and forcing me to leave the room just to chill on YouTube at midnight because I couldn't deal with the smell) but 1) don't be like my suitemate and 2) don't try to push your lifestyle on other people.

From mg experience this is what ill say (im not saying my experience is the knlg experience):\n\nI agree on everything said in the post. I think your experience will  depend alot on who your friends are. I was the ionly one of my friends who didnt drink. Nobody really pressured me to drink but i was asked on a routine basis about drinking, especially when people around me were drinking and i wasnt. Even though saying no once got people to stop asking, hearing it asked by 10 different people every night did get draining and having to answer why i dont drink. Again, nobody pressured me but i sometimes thought about drinking just to avoid getting asked. I never did though.\n\nI did want to hang out and party but because i didnt drink many people never kept me in the loop on a parties especially the friends i was closest to. I called them out on it once and they told me \u201cwe thought partying wasnt your thing\u201d. Which i felt is an excuse they told themselves to not invite me. My friends did try after that and i appreciate they did but i could defientely tell i was always the 3rd wheel of the groupI\n. I never felt like i had a close bond with them and i think because i never drank with them we never created that close bond people create when they can get drunk together. I had a good time in colege but i wouldnt say i had all the fun i couldve had. Im slightly introverted so i also didnt do as much to find things to do outside mg friend group. I think the experience i had with my friends made me self conscience about not drinking in college.\n\nIm saying this to say: make sure you get friends who if they do drink, dont mind keeping you involved and if they dont, dont be afraid to be by yourself while you find new friends.", "author": "ea0995", "created": 1630445611, "upvotes": 1}, "hana8ci": {"link": "/r/college/comments/oyhfsl/you_dont_have_to_drink_or_party_if_you_dont_want/hana8ci/", "text": "I go to a commuter school and there's very little \"college experience\" at it so it's always crazy to see posts like these", "author": "LUnacy45", "created": 1630124967, "upvotes": 0}, "haf2vpe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/oyhfsl/you_dont_have_to_drink_or_party_if_you_dont_want/haf2vpe/", "text": "People act like this is the only way to make friends.

Learn how many drinks would get you tipsy then drunk based on your weight. Learn what signs are for alcohol poisoning and how to handle that kind of emergency (call 911). Drink your first time around people you trust, and just try to observe how you feel after a drink or two. Don't drink more just because you're feeling good, at a certain point drinking more doesn't increase the good, fun part of drinking, you just make yourself more at risk of getting sick or blacking out. Eat food and hydrate before you drink, drink water while you drink. Don't drink in college without friends around, it's really important to be able to look out for one another, especially at larger parties. Always keep an eye on your drink. Don't drink to cope with mental illness, instead seek out healthy coping mechanisms, therapy, etc. Never drink and drive, and never ride with someone who's had alcohol or is under the influence of any other substances. \n\nThose are just some basic tips. Good luck, and yes, you do not have to drink at all if you don't want to. Good friends won't care and will respect your choices.
