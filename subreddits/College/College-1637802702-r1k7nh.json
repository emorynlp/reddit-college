  "text": "Would love to go to a 4 year college for 4 years but don\u2019t want a lot of college debt and will most likely go to a community college then a college close to home and live at home. and Am depressed about it because I will miss out on the college experience. Instead I am going to live at home so I can have as less debt as possible to fulfill my dream of living in nyc. Do I need to give up one dream to fulfill another?",
