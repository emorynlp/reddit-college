  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at a small (about 5,000 people) school in the midwestern United States. I have enough friends by proximity - people I hang out with enough that I feel I can call them \"friends\" - but no friends that I feel I've actually connected to. If I left my school today, I feel like I wouldn't talk to any of these people anymore, or make an effort to remain in touch - we're friends more because we run in the same social circles/it's convenient for us, not because we've really connected with one another. It's hard to find new \"circles\" of people to hang out with in hopes that I'll fit in better, too, because the school is so small\n\nIs this normal? Everyone is always telling me that I'll make friends I'll have for life in college, and build these deep connections; I just haven't done that so far. I didn't have this trouble in high school; I remember after my freshman year of high school, I felt very close with the friends I had made the previous year. Here I just...don't. \n\nHow do I find people that I can really connect with/that I feel like I fit in with? I'm already doing extracurriculars; I've met a lot of people I'm friendly with through them, but no one that has become a close friend. \n\nWould really appreciate some advice. Is this normal? What should/can I do? Thank you!",

      "text": "How many of these people telling you you'll make lifelong friends, actually still talk to those friends? I had friends that we all studied together and graduated in the same major, and when I say studied together, I mean 8-10 hours a day together. Graduated in the middle of Covid, moved about an hour away for a job (3 of them work together at a different job). Went to our first planned get together 6 months later and I realized I don't have a ton in common with them. Once school was over, we were all actually very different people, and we still get together very occasionally, but it definitely feels like it was sort of a phase and if I moved out of state, we'd probably never talk.\n\nTrue lifelong friends are hard to come by and also not necessary to have a good life. How many of your high school friends do you still talk to? Once you're working a full time job, you probably aren't going to go do something fun every night or even every weekend, so it's much easier to maintain friendships or acquaintances with people you actually see every day at work, at church, your family, community groups and activities, etc. Some of them may have very different lifestyles as far as where they want to live and how they want to spend their money that can make it difficult to stay friends.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't be too worried, I went through most of college with various acquaintance groups because I enjoyed the activities I was in, and haven't stayed in touch with hardly any friends. I think that's totally normal.",
