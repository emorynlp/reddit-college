  "text": "I think we all know that we aren\u2019t going to be getting enough sleep every night. It\u2019s my 5th week in college and I know I\u2019ve been sleep deprived. I get pretty bad headaches when I haven\u2019t had enough sleep though, and it makes it difficult to get good work done. I don\u2019t drink coffee or anything with caffeine really, but I don\u2019t think caffeine would help anyway. What do you guys do when you\u2019re tired? Is the best thing to do to just take a short nap or would that not really help? I\u2019m generally not a fan of daytime naps, and I feel like I need to get work done but I am so tired :(. It also doesn\u2019t help that I am younger, and just generally a sleepy person. Any tips would be very appreciated.",

      "text": "Nap- I usually try to go to bed a little bit earlier and if it's super bad then skip a class that doesn't matter too much or you want get in trouble for missing and take a nap. I usually catch up on weekends but I'm also an introvert so I don't worry about going to parties. One thing I found that helped was drinking water and if I really needed it was putting on a video on youtube that I'd seen a million times and zoning out for the majority of it, usually while eating dinner. Sometimes your brain just needs the break to chill out",

Its really, really super not worth it. Try to manage your time better. Its better to wake up early and work on stuff than stay up til 4am",

          "text": "I don\u2019t mean I stay up until 4. I mean if I get like 7 hours of sleep when I really need like 9 to feel good I get tired at around 5-7 pm when I want to be doing work. Sleep is very important to me but some nights I\u2019m not going to get 8 hours. I don\u2019t mean to sound like I am extremely sleep deprived I just mean that I\u2019m tired and it gives me a headache, made worse during allergy season.",
