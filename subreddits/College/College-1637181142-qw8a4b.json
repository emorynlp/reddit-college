  "title:": "Starting my first semester of college in January as a 22 year old.",
  "text": "I have not been in school since I (22F) was in high school, I graduated in 2017. I have been financially independent since then (no help from my parent), and haven\u2019t felt confident enough in my savings to start college until now and honestly, my anxiety also stopped me from enrolling. I finally registered for classes and am officially a college student. \n\nOn one hand, I am so extremely proud and excited but the other hand I am so anxious. \n\nI suffer from pretty crippling generalized anxiety. I am not the best student and got a late start compared to my peers. I didn\u2019t do well in my math placement test so I felt really stupid. However, I scored perfect in my English essay placement test. \n\nHow can I get over the nerves of starting college after a 4 year gap and potentially being much older than everyone else in my classes?",
