  "text": "So, I was working towards a cs degree, and chemistry really peaked my interest like a lot. I was doing research for a paper \ud83d\udcc3 and the peer reviewed study was on melting down regolith smashed rock \ud83e\udea8 on the moon that is very fine. Basically turning the rock into a filament to use for 3d printing. This is basically material science but now i'm sorta lost on the trajectory of my academics.",

      "text": "If you go into something like data science, you could easily leverage your CS knowledge into a chemistry oriented career.\n\nOn the other hand, engineering pays well, so even if you have to stick around another semester or two because of switching majors, you'll probably be fine financially.\n\nI am also going to plug for my major, Chemical engineering. It's like materials, but much more general. So maybe all your classes won't be about materials science, but come career time you have many more options available to you and more mobility throughout your career.",
