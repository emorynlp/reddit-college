  "text": "Hey everyone! I recently joined a Computer Science club. I even volunteered to lead the development of the club official website. Everything is shiny and rainbows until yesterday.\n\nI made a proposal about reorganizing our Discord by removing some of unused channels and asked their opinions about how we should increase our member interactivity. I was caught off-guard by their answers. They had the \u201cif it isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mentality, told me things are perfect the way they are. Also, they answered \u201cwhy should we increase our member interactivity?\u201d, and pointed out how we do better than other clubs. I found it funny because most activities are generated by only a few members that including me.\n\nNow I feel like I am wasting my time building a club for someone lacking of vision and the desires to be better. I think they are too comfortable with their current positions to make changes.\n\nAm I wrong thinking that way? What should I do now?",

      "text": "You can suggest and recommend and plan for the future, all of that is good.  But you also have to keep in mind that this is a club made of numerous people, and you're just one member.  You're not the dictator.  So in the end, you have to get on board with what the majority of people want to do, even if your vision is different from theirs.  If that is unsatisfactory to you, then your options are either to spend your time and energy elsewhere, or to run for some kind of club leadership position (if they exist) in which you would have more authority to directly implement your plans.\n\nGood luck.",

      "text": "As someone who's been on multiple club exec Boards for  a few years now, hopefully I can say a couple of things. With Covid, at least at my uni, events last year become such a nightmare to really do, so we did almost nothing. One of my clubs had to disband entirely because of Covid restrictions (it was a tea ceremony club we couldn't have food and drink so it was a bust). So there may be some restrictions you don't know about (reserving locations, availability of regular members, and so one) Plus getting more members can be easy or extremely hard.\n\nOne of the things you can do is invite more people. They cannot stop you from bringing your friends and classmates to events and meetings. You may not be able to get them to host more things, but for now bring your friends and forcibly make their numbers grow. \n\nIf your university has a discord hub, you could suggest about putting the server on their if it's not already. That may be a small way to get more people.\n\nThe best I can say is if there's elections held for positions for next year, go for it. Talk to whoever is in charge about how you can get involved more for next year. You won't be able to do as much as you want but sometimes going through official channels can make things easier because you have the power to put those ideas out there.\n\nYou're just an attendee so a lot of what you propose will be ignored. It's just a fact, and it sucks but you'll have to live with it. \n\nYou can also just leave if it's not what you're looking for. There's been clubs that I wanted to join but it became extremely clear they wanted official hang out time that they could spend university money on. At that point jumping ship may be a viable option.",

      "text": "That is unfortunate. In my club, it is more social based with many projects and activities included. I love it when my fellow members give me ideas and feedback! I constantly encourage it, but that might be because I'm new to the whole president thing. Every club culture is different though.",
