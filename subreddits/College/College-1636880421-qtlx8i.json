  "text": "Hello! I would just like to say sorry first that I am not fluent in English as it is not my first language so there may be grammatical errors here and there. \n\nI am an engineering student but I have to sadly admit that it's hard for me to be passionate or motivated about my course when even the professors aren't. \n\nIn my college, the professors almost always do not teach us and it is rare for a professor to actually have lectures. They leave it up to the students to do powerpoint presentations after they have distributed lessons from the syllabus in the first week of class. The students will usually only use the given material as a reference and most only read off of slides. They sadly also do this for major subjects that have a lot of engineering calculations. Isn't the point of enrolling in a course to learn from professors that know the subject? How do they expect the students to teach a lesson they know next to nothing about? They encourage us to ask questions and when we do, the student presenter cannot even answer them properly! I know self-learning is very important and is a big part of college but I feel like it is unfair that we paid for education just so the professors can sit down to watch the student read the lessons and pass it off as \"teaching\". And unsurprisingly, we do well in exams and get good grades because the exam questions are only taken from what the student has presented. I have heard from my upperclassmen that it is pretty much the same for them too. They have made complaints but all fall on deaf ears. It is not even really the college, but the professors in my specific field that are lazy. For the 3 years I have spent here I can say that more than half of the classes I have taken in my field were done through  powerpoint presentations by the students.",

I am working on my master\u2019s degree, and in the past three classes the professors just expect you to read the book and teach yourself. I am currently in the process of discussing my concerns with my SSC regarding the lack of education I am receiving. hopefully something comes of it. If not, I might drop out, as this isn\u2019t worth it. $1600 per class (which is only 7 weeks long) and I am not learning anything. College has turned into a joke and the college presidents know it",

The professors that do that, do not deserve even a dollar from that $1600. \n\nI don't even have the option to drop a class cause it'll be the same shitty professor (or someone equally the same or worse) when I enroll it again in the next semester.",
