  "text": "My school announced mid-way through spring break that we couldn\u2019t come back for three weeks. Then, they said we couldn\u2019t come back for the rest of the year. They said they were coming up with a move-out plan, but all they have said is that it won\u2019t be until AFTER June 15! Anyone else dealing with this? Just want some similar stories so I don\u2019t feel so alone.",

My husband and I had been watching the news so planned to bring home everything, just in case.\n\nThe evening before we picked her up, the school emailed that they would be closed for the semester.  So, my husband went to bed early to get to the school early the next morning so we could avoid any crowds and moved everything out.  There were never any instructions on how to check out with the RAs and no one was around at 7 a.m.  So, now we have to mail back her key....\n\nBut... there a ton of students who left for break early or who didn't have time to make arrangements to move that still have their belongings in the dorm.",

                              "text": "Paper towels was something we packed and my daughter bought regularly during grocery runs.  We also packed some spray cleaner (I think all purpose windex).  Cleaning wipes were good (assuming you can find any.  \n\nWe didn't pack a mop or broom, assuming there would be some in a communal janitorial closet but, if there was, she never saw them.  I ended up cleaning her side of the dorm floor with paper towels and spray cleaner when we moved out, so a mop wouldn't have been needed.  I do think I'll get her a little wisk broom and dust pan kit for next year, though.  That would be useful for snack crumbs.\n\nI think the overall most useful thing we bought ahead of time was a fluffy mattress pad.  The beds are kinda hard plastic with no cushion.  With her mattress pad, she said she never had a problem sleeping in her bed.\n\nAnother thing to consider:  we bought a minifridge and microwave.  During the summer, they were on sale for about the same price as one year of rental from the school.  So, financially, that's a good choice for saving money.  But, if money's not that important, not having to move a microwave and refrigerator in and then out again would have been really nice.\n\nOne moving tip:  If you don't live too far away, and your parents are willing to do this, it would have been far easier to move in only absolute essentials the first weekend (I think we spent 2 hours in line in the car) and then take a second trip in with non-essential the next weekend.  We planned on doing that in reverse for summer break (get non-essential the weekend before and then just Eessentials when we picked up our daughter) but Covid made that plan go out the door.\n\nAlso... as far as stuff for your room, less is more.  If you have a credit card, gift card, and/or cash, you can get lots of stuff off Amazon or from a Walmart/Target run after you're in your room.  You'll need your computer, bedding, toiletries, and clothes, but everything else can be purchased as necessary.",
