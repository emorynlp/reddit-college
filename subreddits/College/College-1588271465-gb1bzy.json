Reducing/eliminating fees for services (like a rec center) you can't access from home makes sense. Some fees-- like tech fees --might be reduced but not eliminated, since most of that money is going to maintaining servers, support staff, and software licenses rather than the relatively few public computers on most campuses.\n\nTuition is a challenge though. For most schools tuition revenue is what keeps the operation going, and labor costs are 60-80% of the operating budget at many schools. From our experiences this spring faculty are finding it takes 2-3x the hours to run an online course properly. So if we were to cut tuition dramatically that would mean either big pay cuts-- for faculty who are working more hours than normal ---or laying off many faculty, which would mean far fewer course options.\n\nAs the parent of a college student I'm sympathetic: I'd want to pay less for an arguably lesser experience online. But as a professor I also see the real challenges of making major tuition cuts, which would have effect of dramatically decreasing course offerings which would further limit progress to graduation for many students. In my family's case we have decided that if fall 2020 is mandated to be online our student will take a leave of absence for the semester and work on taking free classes from home (or a few gen ed requirements from the local community college).\n\nThere's also this simple fact: without tuition revenue in fall 2020 there are a number of schools that will simply go out of business. If it went all year that number would likely be in the low hundreds. While the $$$ price tags and personal bills are high to individuals, there are several hundred us private schools that have been running deficit budgets for several years or are borrowing to balance budgets. They will be gone if there is a major drop in revenue, especially after the refunds this spring. Public schools will be more safe as they can (usually) rely on appropriations from legislatures to at least remain in business, but major cuts will happen regardless.", "author": "SnowblindAlbino", "created": 1588351409, "upvotes": 1}, "fp6fba4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gb1bzy/people_going_to_college_in_fall_2020_do_you_think/fp6fba4/", "text": "my college has temporarily suspended tution for the fall idk who it applies to or anything like that since they just mentioned it in passing in an email", "author": "theceiling01", "created": 1588351359, "upvotes": 2}, "fp6f3hd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gb1bzy/people_going_to_college_in_fall_2020_do_you_think/fp6f3hd/", "text": "Honestly as an incoming freshman, I\u2019m worried I might miss the chance of Fall orientation (even though it might be pushed back a quarter).

But that does NOT mean exclude them from a heavy discount just because they have more money available for school. They\u2019re also losing out on the experiences as a regular student would too.

In the past 10 years, many public universities were able to maintain low tuition cost because of the tuition international students brought (out of state tuition). With them gone, and almost-guaranteed further drop in state fund, your cheap tuition might no longer be sustainable. They will need to either raise tuition or **lower education quality (e.g., hire more adjuncts than full time TT professors; layoff faculty/staffs; furlough; reduce services to students, etc).**\n\nNow, most public schools would not increase tuition. This would look bad on state politicians, which would negatively impact their electability. But the chance of lower tuition is almost 0.\n\nHere are what might happen:\n\n1. If your university is a large public university, such as Purdue University, then they might 1) lower enrollment bar to get more students; and 2) lay off non-essential instructors/staffs.\n2.

Your tuition isn't just paying for your credits at the quality you expect. Tuition is mostly for your school _to exist at all_.\n\nPut aside the fact I literally mean schools couldn't run if they lost a chunk of tuition revenue. Here's a more mundane example of what tuition reduction would mean. I was in a meeting today where the topic of looming departmental budget cuts came up. It would mean not renewing contracts with a number of our teachers, many of whom teach classes required for our majors. There's a very real chance that we may not be able to staff a required course in the fall, or if we do, it will be taught by someone unfamiliar with the topic and already overworked. This is _without_ the loss of tuition revenue... manageable, but already losing the quality of education. But cut tuition...to balance the books schools will lay off instructors and, in turn, eliminate many classes because they can't be staffed or supported. The remote class that's not up to expectations simply doesn't exist at all.\n\nAnd I'm not sure students have heard the unbudgeted costs of COVID-19. One school that was up front about the costs was MIT: as of mid-April, it had spent or returned $50 million since January. That was the cost of \"providing the technology to enable the sudden shift to remote teaching and working, supplying financial assistance to help students leave campus quickly, refunding student housing and dining fees while making sure contract dining workers and others are paid through late May\". That's before the hit it will take in lost endowment income, cuts in government grants, and less private giving.\n\nThis crisis is _really bad_. Unfortunately the math is that for your schools to stay open, they're going to have to keep tuition where it is. Some of you will decide it's not worth it and walk away, and that may well be the right decision for you. But for those that stay in school, probably with a noble exception here or there, there will be no tuition reductions.", "author": "dcgrey", "created": 1588298929, "upvotes": 113}, "fp4gpj7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gb1bzy/people_going_to_college_in_fall_2020_do_you_think/fp4gpj7/", "text": "Lmao my school charged a $100 fee for online classes before this shit, so I doubt it.", "author": "madisiiiii", "created": 1588298673, "upvotes": 12}, "fp4g1hz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gb1bzy/people_going_to_college_in_fall_2020_do_you_think/fp4g1hz/", "text": "I\u2019m honestly thinking about taking a break.
