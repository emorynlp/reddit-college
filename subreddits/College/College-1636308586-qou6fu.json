      "text": "Depends what sort of job you want. It's going to be tough for anyone with any degree whose goal is to \"get a job\" but can't talk about what sort of job they want or why and has been doing nothing to hone their skills or to focus on the particular sort of job they want.\n\nIf you have a plan for getting into a specific type of job, then you have less to worry about, since it means you're likely spending your time building skills for that specific type of job. \n\nWhen I see people say \"I applied to 200+ jobs and haven't had any luck\" I think \"no duh, if you're applying to that many jobs, you clearly have no direction and no employer wants someone who applies to their job on a whim.\" Create some focus in your job (and internship) search. Apply to fewer jobs, but make yourself a good candidate for the jobs you do apply to.\n\nSo my advice is to know what you're looking for and beeline straight in that direction. Learn to boost your resume for those \"dream jobs\" you want and go for it. Even if your degree is broad, your career goals can be focused, and that's what employers want-- focus. In their case, they want focus on the skills/knowledge that they need. If you know what you want to do, then you can make this happen.",
