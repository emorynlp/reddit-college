  "title:": "Today I met a 23,year old college grad (with honors), doing yard work for $12 an hour\u2026",
  "text": "I graduated from college 20 years ago, and was immediately offered a number of good, high-paying jobs. But I\u2019m concerned about young people graduating from college today\n\nToday, I met a young man, who was doing yardwork for my neighbor, for $12 an hour because he has been unable to find any meaningful employment other than Walmart and Amazon (we live in one of the hottest economic cities in the USA).  \n\nHe has been applying for jobs five hours a day, for the past six months.  At the same time, I hear companies say that they can\u2019t find or hold onto employees.  \n\nMaybe college isn\u2019t about job training. Maybe it\u2019s about broadening your mind and gaining life experience. But, as someone in his early 40s, I can\u2019t help but feeling that somehow the system is broken and failing us all\u2026\n\nAny thoughts?",

I am pretty tempted to try delivery driving, but I can't help feeling like there's a catch, since most people don't fully calculate their expenses. \n\nLike you get the best tips on Friday and Saturday nights, right? Those are the same nights when the roads are full of drunk drivers. If I'm in an accident caused by someone else, but the insurance company finds out that I was using my vehicle for work, but not paying commercial insurance, I would imagine I'm not getting a full payout. So my insurance is going to rise from $80/month to god knows what.\n\nThen for wear and tear - you have a hybrid, which is awesome. My car gets great mileage, but it is a standard. If I have to replace my clutch because I'm using it more, that will cost $1500 and potentially wipe out a month of earnings. Same for wheel bearings, cv joints, tires, not to mention reducing the resale value of my car via higher mileage. \n\nThere's so many hidden costs. There's a financial blogger, Mr Money Mustache (lol at the name), who figures that every mile you drive actually costs about $1.55, once you factor in all those costs. Depends greatly on the car, of course, but it's far more than the cost of fuel. Are you making enough to call it a decent wage after accounting for costs of $1.55 per mile travelled? That's what I really want to know, if any other delivery drivers have done that math.",

So I'm not just making what the ride gives me, I get a bonus for driving at a certain time and completing X # of rides. Usually 3 in an hour.",

I have 1 absolutely generic resume that's 4 pages long, I have another copy of that resume that's tailored more towards retail and service industry detailing those relevent positions I've worked more in depth while keeping other less relevant jobs a bit shorter but making sure to point out how they can relate, I have one copy that's done the same way that's office/administration catered, one copy that is teacher and education focused, and one copy heavily detailing the jobs I've worked in my degree field while again pointing out how the jobs I've worked not in my degree field (like retail ones) are still relevant and bring applicable skills to the table. It's also important to note that different hiring platforms like USA Jobs have their own specific way they want resumes formatted!",

We are oversaturated with \"educated\" people (I say that because a lot of recent grads aren't as educated as before since it's easier to get the degree) and the boomer generation isn't giving up their jobs. So the people looking to move up can't because the higher ups won't leave meaning there is no entry jobs. Tie that to the fact that a lot of entry jobs two decades ago didn't require an education so those people now have the experience, but lack the education to advance and they are stuck where they are.  There are many issues that have lead us here that no one has kept in check.",

About 5 of these have given me test to perform.\n\nEvery \"entry\" position has required 1-3 years of engineering work experience, like how the fuck am I going to get that experience if you're a fresh graduate???\n\nThis weekend, I had an in-person interview. The company held a group interview where about 5 of us were interviewed at the same time. They had us do a 30 min test in SolidWorks. After the test, they called out 3 names and told those 3 to go home. I was left with one other guy. Moved us to an interview with the manager. I explained to him my situation and work experience and pleaded him to give me a shot. After he was done with both of us, he asked me to stay. Then he had me interview with the owner. Owner told me that he was looking to fill in two positions, but that I shouldn't get my hopes up. He said that last week they interviewed 3 other people and had to consider the two best for the position. \n\nShit like this makes me super anxious and nervous. Another company that I interviewed for two weeks ago said that they had 3 other candidates and two positions available too. Idk if it's just a coincidence or WTF. Still waiting on their call. I just hate how companies ghost you though. Like they don't even bother to tell you that you aren't being considered either, just ask you to wait one to two weeks for notice.",

I've also worked different blue collar jobs and have found all sorts of coworkers, and I've really changed my mind/attitude on the \"lol just do stem liberal arts fools\" thing. I agree at some level, not every degree should be treated as a guaranteed job, but I disagree that those who aren't engineers or doctors shouldn't have self-respect or good livings.\n\nB. most people can't do STEM not out of laziness but due to caps on intellect/having different kinds of intellect and limits within institutions. This is where I am unpopular in my major, I am a half-dual major in a natural science, and two classes of my natural science take 5x more time than 4 classes in my major. I do honestly believe most STEM degrees are harder. \n\n Only so many people can be accepted into programs; the APA has the cap on new pyschiatrists, iirc, at like 200 a year. If someone does have the intellect to do STEM, they may find that there are hundreds of thousands of grads a year in their field, and like 100 positions tops on USAJobs.\n\nyes a person who sucks at math could take 10 years to do a 4 year degree, but colleges probably won't let them, and employers wouldn't want that.

You could see the inevitable over-supply of highly trained labour just building up on the horizon. If it isn't happening already, then I think there's going to be a reckoning soon where too many people have been persuaded that STEM degrees are some gateway to high-paying employment and they'll be very disappointed when they can't get in because there's thousands of other graduates just like them.\n\nAnd I mean it's all very well for people to say \"just start your own business\" if people trained in engineering or whatever, but that completely misses the point that running a business is its own specialised set of skills that many STEM people just don't necessarily have.\n\nMeanwhile all the industries that rely on humanities graduates are going to panic because there'll be a growing shortage of people trained in those fields - because all the kids that would have otherwise gone down that path were coerced into taking a STEM degree.\n\nIt's all insane really.

Better cut back on those occasional 5 hours of sleep, Ramen-eater).\n\nDo that for a few years, walk-off those heart attacks caused by physical and mental exhaustion, and you'll have the required years of experience in your field to apply for a position in an over-saturated job market after you graduate!\n\nP.S.

So I am in the stage its in the store. people want to buy it (or push them physically) rather than the campaigns. So I restock the walmart sample machine to do the 10 second ad etc. so after listening to the ad you get the product.\n\nI knew of a girl who was insta influencing. So she's creating the ad campaign. She quit but she is making you want to buy. I didn't know her personally and her bf good friends were friends of my college friends so someone I dont talk to much.\n\nCreating the ads for a business shouldn't be that bad or something similar with that angle. \n\nbut everyone is different in their 20s because of this pandemic.

Do you think a 17 year knows what they don't know and need to know? What if they don't have any kind of guidance? Do you think a 17 year old is meticulously planning out every detail of their future? We don't know shit yet. At that age, what we mostly hear is from our parents and they can also be wrong. I hate this whole \"it was your responsibility to be a rational long term thinker in high school\" nonsense, because really it's just what people tell themselves so they don't have to worry about other people getting screwed by the system. Their life is a living hell because of debt with an unmarketable degree? Oh well, they deserve it for not making all the correct life decisions a year before it's even legal for them to vote. \n\nDon't get me started on out of state tuition. When I picked my school, it was a priority of mine to get away from my home situation, so I chose the expensive out of state school rather than the cheap one nearby that would have 'allowed' me to continue living with my parent because I had spent the last however many years waiting until I could turn 18 and escape. I'm just lucky to be in a position where I'm not paying for this shit all by myself, but it is absolutely highway robbery that im basically getting an education at the same price of getting a mortgage.",

This is a room in a shared house, not a solo apartment or house - though I have rented a whole 2br house for $625 a month before. Like I said, where you live matters more than how much you make in terms of affordability. Lots of places where cost of living is dirt cheap, and if you choose to live in such a place paying off your loans will not be difficult at all. If you choose to live in NYC or LA then good luck! Of course most places are in the middle, but moving is pretty much always an option, albeit a hard one to make.\n\nWhen you say \"decent\" place, you mean \"average housing cost place\". The place I live is *amazing.* There are 20 waterfalls within an hour's drive. Mountains, beaches, snowboarding, hot summers, mountain biking trails, etcetera. This is much more than a \"decent\" place, it is just inexpensive. It's not very populated. The median home cost here is like 60% lower than the national average. This is the UP of Michigan, btw.\n\nYepp, rent will be around $1000 for a single bed apartment in most places. Rent will be probably half that if you choose to live with someone else. In places with low cost of living, you can get a single bed apartment for $500/mo.",

I know plenty of people in my area that make substantially more money than me and still struggle to get by. It's usually the lifestyle that is the issue - buying expensive shitty food, paying off huge medical bills because of that, buying 'toys' like sidebysides or snowmobiles, buying a car you can't afford, not paying off credit cards, having kids when you're not financially stable, etcetera. \n\nIn other cases people live a modest lifestyle, work full time, and still can't afford to live comfortably. These people have three options: complain about it, rough it out and hope for a better job, or move somewhere else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I live in Oakland County, nice but nothing crazy and like I said, finding a place for less than a $1,000 is super hard.

If you **needed** an affordable option, you could probably find it. I looked on facebook marketplace and found available options in Oakland Cty for $500 and $650 within 60 seconds. These are rooms in a shared house. I wouldn't want to share a living space after college either - but beggars can't be choosers, and the point is that **there are affordable options that most people neglect.**\n\nWhat I'm saying is that most people **could** pay off $50k in student loans within 10 years if they were willing to compromise - i.e. by moving to a place with a low cost of living, sharing a house, etc.",

Company culture, benefits, pay?), but . . .\n\nA theory - The expectations on industries have also appreciated. Or the industry thinks they have.\n\nEverything is relative. In the 80s, you could graduate with a degree in maths and probably get any job in tech, because the industry workers (and demands thereof, such as orders from clients) were relatively level or nearly level with the new grad (with room to grow). In the 90s, you only had to learn COBOL and you were set for the rest of the millennium (so said one of my COSC profs).\n\nNow, clients want XYZ and industries think new grads can't do it--an impression that may come from the fact that, for instance, the software dev industry is developing so rapidly that if you sit out for a month or two, you're out-of-date. Your project manager wants you to write this in Rust, and if you're a college grad, yeah you know Java, some kind of C, Python, maybe Ruby or something this-decade, but Rust is new ^((okay it's like C++ but)) and you don't know it fluently *so come back in a few years when you've got some experience, kid.*\n\nInstead of integrating some language mentoring during company workflow training.\n\nedit: a word",

The fields a business degree open for you all hire based on the subjective opinions of the recruiters and human resource personnel because there is no real criteria or a technical rubric to judge you on. It all verges on things like the way you sound, the way you dress and whether you wear wrist cuffs etc. It is no different from applying to a social club where you have to emit a certain vibe and if not you are out regardless of your work ethic. If you have worked in an office environment before you will definitely notice that some don't work and get promoted while others work their asses of and earn jack shit at the end. That's for all the reasons I mentioned above including how well you navigate office politics and your unofficial hierarchical status in the office which is no different than that of a high school classroom other than the thick uncomfortable suits and the ties than strangle the life out of your neck.",

It\u2019s not special anymore. \n\nI think more people should work a few years and go back for education and training when they have some work experience and a general idea of their professional goals. \n\nI went to community college at 32 and rounded out my experience.

      "text": "I think what\u2019s broken is how much we demand from schools to offer all students (healthcare, mental health resources, career centers, internships, tutoring services, support for disadvantaged students, food, housing, public transportation, etc etc) that should be offered through communities, municipalities, the state, or the federal government in general. Schools have taken on the responsibility of the state or community, and students are facing that cost in no small way. Much of the cost of school comes from support, not the actual cost of educating itself.\n\nAlso, I think folks overhype the kinds of degrees that lead to meaningful employment. Sure, a degree in history might not be as clearly applicable as a degree in computer science, but just because the path a degree offers after graduation is unclear, doesn\u2019t make that particular education useless or inconsequential. A forklift operator who quotes Shakespeare isn\u2019t a problem if that operator is doing work meaningful to them and can handle their finances well enough. Robert McNamara\u2019s degree in Philosophy wasn\u2019t useless, nor Steve Job\u2019s course in Typography, or a student\u2019s knowledge in film analysis doing yard work. People complain that college didn\u2019t land them a job, as if colleges\u2019 sole purpose is to offer jobs rather than a certification of knowledge. Some knowledge is needed now in industries, other kinds not so much. But the market\u2019s needs are different from meaningful work. Meaningful work has always been hard to find, and some have the means to find that work with or without debts to pay pack to schools or Uncle Sam.\n\nIn the end, I think it boil\u2019s down to the debt incurred. If you can go to college and have it completely covered by the parents, then not finding work isn\u2019t so bad. If you\u2019re on your own, then there\u2019s serious thought needed for what you\u2019re getting yourself into. I think a better understanding of finances would do everyone some good. College can always be done later in life too\u2014school isn\u2019t going anywhere fast\u2026",

Last year fresh out of graduation I applied to the minimum of 100 jobs in one month - and I wish I was over exaggerating it I\u2019m not, there was a count. Everyday I\u2019d wake up from 7am and apply to jobs until 9pm- it felt like it\u2019s own kind of job. I applied all over: out of state, out of degree field, hell I even applied to Walmart, Target, Aldi and CVS because they said they needed workers and I was desperate for a job.\n\n\nOf those 100+ jobs I only had three interviews, none of them in my field with one interview requiring a 2-3hr commute. Of those interviews I only received one job offer and they underpaid me (not only by education and in comparison to the other interviews, but also in comparison to other coworkers. I was the lowest paid person in my department - I had coworkers in lower positions with less education getting paid more than me)\n\n\nMoral of this long story is OP is damn right and correct to be concerned. And I wouldn\u2019t even say math, physics or engineering because I know some class mates who struggled to get jobs with those degrees or got laid off. If it ain\u2019t in Programming and specifically software engineering, or even for healthcare: Nursing and Clinical Lab Science then don\u2019t even bother.",

I was only trying to share my story that is similar to many other STEM fields that people assume will be really easy to get a job after college. \n\nMoreover my sample size isn\u2019t limited to my friends, while in college I worked in the faculty of engineering to help students get engineering jobs (go figure) so I had a first hand look at the difficulty students faced. My job was to host large engineering and tech companies visiting campus from all over the country trying to recruit students for internships and jobs during or straight out of school. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think my small \u201cfriend group\u201d (really 500+ students over a number of years) is severely lacking when it comes to my assessment of the job market. Should I also throw in my parent and other family members in the STEM field for 30+ years to sprinkle into my overall assessment of job opportunities in STEM. \n\n\nAlso, how you gonna call me unemployed when I said I had a job, just that it was outside of my major? You just read to hate so early in the morning? Get some more sleep.",

No one should have to study something they do not like for years and take on loads of debt to get a job they hate just to survive. \n\nIt's not a bad idea to get a film degree. It's a bad idea to think that having a degree in a useful market is more important than passion or satisfaction with your life. Being in film is not a bad place to be. There are countless avenues to take where someone can be successful besides making a multimillion dollar blockbuster. I'm a film major. Three years deep. While I'd rather go into production, I could also go into critique, scholarship, theory, education, exhibition, collection, preservation, reporting, etc. \n\nWhat is ridiculous is paying an obscene amount for any education, especially so if one's survival depends on it. Or dedicating your time and effort to your passion and being ridiculed because your passion is wrong. The market ebbs and flows. STEM students may be highly in demand, but they're also highly competitive. Getting a STEM degree can put one under an insufferable amount of stress and doesn't guarantee a job for shit. \n\nIt's always better to do what you do not out of necessity but out of choice, and choosing to follow a passion will always be better than choosing to suffer for material wealth.",

I have a major that is typically looked down upon, yet have done multiple internships at the top banks on Wall Street. I networked with the right people, kept my GPA up, and started to search for opportunities early on. After college I\u2019ll have access to the top banks and companies for employment because I have a resume full of experience. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what your major is, or what school you go to. These thing make a difference, but the real determining factor in postgrad success is how ambitious/hungry you were in college.",

Now the CEOs want to save money by hiring the \"overseas guy\" because they know they'll settle for less and the 4.0 GPA guy get turned down over the guy in the back that barely showed up to lectures. So yes. It is a broken system and networking and getting some experience is one of the best ways to get a job now. HR probably doesnt care about what college you came from.",

I had no job offers out of college, and I actually made more money $15/hr doing construction in high school. I worked my way up to data analyst where I was effectively managing my coworkers and trained them all only to find out they were making more money than me and I was being harassed. I quit to study at a software boot camp. I applied to over 1,500 jobs and was rejected from all of them over a year long period from 2018-2019. I was almost homeless because i was unemployed for so long.\n\nI eventually found a part time programmer job I did while going back to school to study computer science. At 1 point I had an internship at 31 for mechanical engineering while doing the programming job and school. I was treated like I was a child and harassed by HR.\n\nMy grades were so good in computer science I am now a masters student in computer engineering studying in Italy. I hope to never return to the USA. I want to be a professor. The one caveat is that I am autistic and we have an 85% unemployment rate",

      "text": ">Today, I met a young man, who was doing yardwork for my neighbor, for $12 an hour because he has been unable to find any meaningful employment other than Walmart and Amazon (we live in one of the hottest economic cities in the USA).\n\nIn 2021 a random degree doesn't help you that much with job searching. Your best financial option is to either forgo a degree entirely (going with a non-degree trade) or pick a degree that is in demand. You also can't graduate without experience anymore: now you need to do internships and projects because that is what makes you competitive.\n\n>Maybe college isn\u2019t about job training. Maybe it\u2019s about broadening your mind and gaining life experience.\n\nIt was never all about the job training, it was about improving critical thinking and becoming a better person. A finishing school. Increase in costs over the last few decades have made job training the main focus and put less emphasis on the secondary and tertiary benefits that college offers.\n\n>He has been applying for jobs five hours a day, for the past six months. At the same time, I hear companies say that they can\u2019t find or hold onto employees.\n\nIt could just be the applicant, the specific field, or both of those. People seem to forget that a piece of paper doesn't guarantee a job: you still have to show value, interview well, and be good at what you are doing. A lot of college graduates don't get jobs due to crappy resumes or an esoteric degree. Not all but a fair amount of unemployed graduates fit into this group. At the end of the day, much of it comes down to personal responsibility and these people represent the risk associated with not having a proper college plan.\n\nAssuming a degree will get you a job is linear thinking and failing to consider most of the important information in your plan. Lack of critical thinking is the culprit 80% of the time.",

Lack of critical thinking is the culprit 80% of the time.\n\nWhile this may be truer of recent generations, it wasn't necessarily the case in earlier generations without the infinite supply of information at their fingertips to understand the marketplace and supply/demand in different fields.  Even now high school students rarely get formal instruction on determining marketable fields of study and the pros/cons of different degrees or pathways.  Some are lucky to have knowledgable adults to advise them and/or at least educate them about the value of researching it on their own.  There is a general push for STEM education and a more recent trend of encouraging lucrative trade skills starting with specialized high school programs for those that may be suited to them.  But beyond that, not having much job search experience, high school and new college students often don't know what they don't know apart from a vague awareness that technical/STEM fields might be better bets, IF they have the aptitude for it.  Point being, a lack of education advocacy about the job marketplace in general is a bigger culprit than a lack of foresight or critical thinking. This should be part of the required high school curriculum along with basic financial literacy and the like.",

      "text": "I\u2019m going through a similar situation. Been graduated for a little over a year now. And I did graduate in the middle of a pandemic btw so that\u2019s probably affected me in a way when it came to the initial job searching process. \n\nSo I started looking for that first career right out of college and started searching around March 2020 (I was an aug 2020 grad). And I got nothing. The things I was coming across were jobs that really fit based on what I was getting my degree in (psychology with a criminology minor). But i just happened to be ineligible for everything I found. It said I needed a bachelors degree, check. Be at least 21 years of age, check. And some other things. But then you needed like 3-5 years of experience in the field\u2026 no check. And believe me, I did do my research before committing to a major. I didn\u2019t want to do psychology just to go to grad school to study psychology further. But I wanted to help people. I was wanting to get into juvenile corrections. And so the reality of it that I faced that I wasn\u2019t prepared for, was I wasn\u2019t ready for that big time career yet. I needed to do something smaller-scale first before moving up to that big time career. And that puts you looking at jobs that hire for less than $20 an hour. And some of that probably has to do with the fields im interested in and currently working in, which are human services, social work, early childhood education where the pay sucks. \n\nI did end up applying to over 70 jobs(I made a whole excel spreadsheet to keep track), heard back from maybe only 10 of them. Of those 10 I was rejected 7 times, of those 7 rejections I only had like 2 interviews). I eventually landed something in social work as a residential supervisor at an emergency youth shelter. I\u2019ll admit, I love the work, but I\u2019m doing it for $14 an hour part time. And then I needed full time work, and found it as a preschool teaching assistant. Again, love the work, but I\u2019m doing it for $15 and that\u2019s already $2-4 over the average starting wage (my employer was like, I see you bring a whole college degree with you, so $15 will work). I think that right there was the biggest advantage I\u2019ve had with my degree. Even if I want to advance in my career in early childhood education, I still won\u2019t make a whole lot. After taxes, I\u2019m probably at $26k. But the whole job search, I was getting desperate and just applied to whatever I could get. I even applied to be a Target associate and got rejected from that. \n\nSo I am a 23 year old college grad, currently making $15 an hour as a pre-k teaching assistant. I feel like I need to be doing better but I\u2019m still trying to figure out my true purpose in life. And it\u2019s hard figuring that out when my interests change a lot. And it\u2019s not the same from when I just graduated college. And I just think I need to be working with kids bc that\u2019s what I\u2019m good at. But nothing pays well enough when you work with kids or in school corporations and that\u2019s what I want to do. But I might have to sacrifice ever owning a home or having kids or having my own new car (like 2018 at least is what I\u2019d like). I\u2019ve found something that I might do as a long term career, the one I could retire with and that\u2019s child life specialist. I\u2019d basically utilize the same skills and knowledge from preschool and child development and apply it to a higher level of complexity of work. But I\u2019d need the motivation to take classes, enroll in a program, complete internship hours. I\u2019ve also thought about pediatric occupational therapy. But need to think about grad school. So those have been my past ideas, still up in the air. Currently thinking about counseling and specializing in marriage/family counseling for kids, as a lot of my childhood trauma is focused around family trauma. So I\u2019d have to think about grad school first. \nSorry for the long post, just wanted to give you some insight so you could compare how other people\u2019s experiences are and compare how this generation of college grads may be different from past generations of college grads.",

But obviously they're going to take someone with a degree and experience over anyone else. This is also just my field, and it could very well be different in other fields of work.",

College is practically expected at this point, so you're applying against mostly other college grads who may have better credentials than you.\n\nThat's why (even though this shouldn't necessarily be what college is about) not getting a useless degree is extremely good advice these days. Especially if you're not going to a well-known college. \n\nMost of the people I know who got a degree from a decent college in a demanding field immediately got hired out of college. Engineering, computer science, business (maybe economics but less so), mathematics, accounting, marketing or double majors/minors to complement these fields are still in very high demand. Hard sciences are good too, but you need to do more school first. Then there's going to medical/law school.\n\nIf your goal is to make a good income, you're probably wasting your money if you're spending tens of thousands of dollars on an art, English, sociology, anthropology, psychology degree without another major or without getting extra schooling. Maybe that would fly 20+ years ago, but not so much anymore.\n\nWe're getting to the point where unless you're getting a useful degree from a good college, you would be better spending your time and money going to community college and/or getting more specialized job training. There is still massive demand for blue collar jobs that don't require college degrees.\n\nA lot of people in their teens and twenties don't want to hear this unfortunately. It's totally fine if you want to \"pursue your dreams\" and if you \"care more about liking the job than making money\", but you need to be real with yourself when you're a college grad making $12 an hour with 50k in debt as a result",

People will tell you things like GPA and the school you went you don't matter, but then can't find a job out of school. Which is then the same people who don't have good grades or go to a subpar school, resulting in having a hard time in the job market. What employers mean by having job experience is often times general job experience while in highschool and college. So like at restaurants or retail, places that require hard work and dedication. If you've never worked for significant periods before graduation (as a grown man starting at 18), then that says a lot about your work ethic.  I'm currently doing CS at the UofA (a top school in the country) and have a 3.8 GPA. Also, I've worked multiple different jobs since I was 13 years old in both the food and retail. I've had two internships thus far and have already been in contact with multiple employers. They've all told me they judge applicants based off the factors above because of the saturation of people with degrees. So yeah, school is useless if you don't apply yourself",
