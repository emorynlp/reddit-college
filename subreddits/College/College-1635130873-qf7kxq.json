  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college and foolishly applied as a CS major. I\u2019ve realized that this major is not for me so I\u2019ve changed it to Biology, something I\u2019m more interested in. However, I\u2019m still stuck in my programming class since that\u2019s what I thought I wanted to do, I\u2019m probably going to fail it so I switched it to a P/NP so it won\u2019t hurt my GPA. Was wondering how bad a NP looks on a college transcript. Any advice would be helpful thank you guys",

      "text": "It depends on what you want to do. If you want to go to grad school and are applying to high ranked schools, it will probably look bad. But depends on the school and the program. If you want to find a job right after graduating, it probably won\u2019t matter as much if you don\u2019t need it for your major. Once you get your first job, transcripts shouldn\u2019t matter at all",
