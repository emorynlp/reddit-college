We share a drawer set and in one of them is a big pack of razor blades. I didn\u2019t think too much about it until I saw an open razor on the counter. They usually wear long sleeves but the other day they were rolled up and there were super new scabbed cuts. I don\u2019t know what to do, I haven\u2019t confronted them or told anyone. I know if I was in their position, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone confronting me. I really don\u2019t know what to do. If I tell an RA, my roommate is gonna know I \u201csnitched\u201d on them.\n\n\nPsa: roommates pronouns are they/them\n\n\nEdit: hey guys, thanks for all the input. I did end up reporting them to my RA. He was super understanding and thanked me for saying something. I\u2019m not sure if my roommate knows I said something, there\u2019s a chance that they think someone else saw the cuts. I\u2019m hoping I did the right thing.", "author": "mangomupe", "created": 1632424468, "retrieved": 1632946073, "over_18": true, "upvotes": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"he3km7i": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu2h0u/what_to_do_about_roommate_who_self_harms/he3km7i/", "text": "As someone who self harms, I know everyone is different but this person is in a lot of pain and it would be helpful to just sit down with them and really just talk to them and open up the conversation to lean more towards mental health/self harm. I've been hospitalized and people/police/medical have been called on me and it never goes well. Get to know their situation better and how you can help as their roommate or friend because 9 times out of 10, if you go to an office or any other authority figure, the person ends up just getting forced into worse situations or situations they are not comfortable with. The only time, in my opinion, when immediate medical or professional intervention is needed is if there is a deliberate plan do do serious or lethal harm to themselves or others or a plan is already being carried out or attempted. Hospitalization just makes things worse and if they are not seeking treatment from a therapist or psyche, bring up that option to them. I've been navigating the mental health field for YEARS and it is never easy, but just a little confidential support can go incredibly far.

If you had reason to think they were going to kill themselves, that would be different. But, self harm isn't a crime, even if it is a result of mental illness. If someone has ocd and resulting behavior, that wouldn't be something an adult tells on another adult about. If someone has flashbacks due to PTSD, that's not the schools business either. If someone is diabetic but eats a shit ton of sugar, that's also no one's business.\n\nIf you are concerned about them, maybe get to know them a little better. Talk to them as one friend does to another. Be with your roommate as one human to another human. If it comes up and you have consent, then you might be in place where advising them to seek help is appropriate.\n\nHonestly, reporting it could make things worse.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a more embarrassing moment in my entire life.\n\nIf you\u2019re really bothered by it (only saying that bc I know a lot of people who don\u2019t give af about their roommates) talk to your RA. *especially* if you aren\u2019t that close. The only time I\u2019d recommend confronting them head on would be if you guys were besties or something. \n\nI know for me, having my roommates bring it up to me just made me kinda retreat into myself and not want to talk to them for a while, basically hiding it better. This is a situation where, unfortunately, not you nor your RA will likely be able to change your roommates situation. It has to come from themselves or someone they\u2019re super close to.

Bringing this issue to others' attention will certainly not be fun, and your roommate might react with active hostility.  But how would you feel if it later turned out that the person was working up to slitting their wrists or something like that?  This situation is terrible, and it's not going to be pleasant to address, but all I can say is that I personally would be devastated if I simply ignored the situation because of how uncomfortable it was and then later something tragic happened.\n\nIs there some kind of counseling center or medical clinic on campus where you could speak to a professional to get some advice?  I would definitely do that.  If you don't know of any campus resources, there are also national toll-free crisis lines and websites that you can reach out to for advice.  Although you might be the first person to realize what is happening, *you don't have to address this situation on your own*; there are adults and other professionals out there who can help, so just see what's available on campus and online until you track someone down who can assist you.\n\nGood luck.", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632426343, "upvotes": 43}}}
