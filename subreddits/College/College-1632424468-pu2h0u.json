  "title:": "What to do about roommate who self harms?",
  "text": "Me and my roommate each have our own room with a connected bathroom. We share a drawer set and in one of them is a big pack of razor blades. I didn\u2019t think too much about it until I saw an open razor on the counter. They usually wear long sleeves but the other day they were rolled up and there were super new scabbed cuts. I don\u2019t know what to do, I haven\u2019t confronted them or told anyone. I know if I was in their position, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone confronting me. I really don\u2019t know what to do. If I tell an RA, my roommate is gonna know I \u201csnitched\u201d on them.\n\n\nPsa: roommates pronouns are they/them\n\n\nEdit: hey guys, thanks for all the input. I did end up reporting them to my RA. He was super understanding and thanked me for saying something. I\u2019m not sure if my roommate knows I said something, there\u2019s a chance that they think someone else saw the cuts. I\u2019m hoping I did the right thing.",

      "text": "As someone who self harms, I know everyone is different but this person is in a lot of pain and it would be helpful to just sit down with them and really just talk to them and open up the conversation to lean more towards mental health/self harm. I've been hospitalized and people/police/medical have been called on me and it never goes well. Get to know their situation better and how you can help as their roommate or friend because 9 times out of 10, if you go to an office or any other authority figure, the person ends up just getting forced into worse situations or situations they are not comfortable with. The only time, in my opinion, when immediate medical or professional intervention is needed is if there is a deliberate plan do do serious or lethal harm to themselves or others or a plan is already being carried out or attempted. Hospitalization just makes things worse and if they are not seeking treatment from a therapist or psyche, bring up that option to them. I've been navigating the mental health field for YEARS and it is never easy, but just a little confidential support can go incredibly far. I hope this helps and I hope your roommate gets better!",

      "text": "Honestly, at this point we are dealing with adults. If you had reason to think they were going to kill themselves, that would be different. But, self harm isn't a crime, even if it is a result of mental illness. If someone has ocd and resulting behavior, that wouldn't be something an adult tells on another adult about. If someone has flashbacks due to PTSD, that's not the schools business either. If someone is diabetic but eats a shit ton of sugar, that's also no one's business.\n\nIf you are concerned about them, maybe get to know them a little better. Talk to them as one friend does to another. Be with your roommate as one human to another human. If it comes up and you have consent, then you might be in place where advising them to seek help is appropriate.\n\nHonestly, reporting it could make things worse. It can effect their education, and it could make them feel unsafe in their environment.",

Self harm doesn't equate to suicidal intention. While, I am glad you were helped where you went to, that's not always the case. Often these places are hell holes. There's violence from both staff and other patients etc. And, patient complaints aren't taken seriously due to being mentally ill. The patients can't just leave or decide to go to a different facility of their own voltion, either. And even the ones that aren't abusive, often just create further trauma just by how inpatient centers generally operate.",

I used to know another person who died after taking too many antidepressants. And several cases that are further from myself. All these people were adults with serious problems.\n\nThis situation on the other hand seems to me like a stereotipical teenage girl that's at war with the world. Seen countles such examples and they all grew out of it when they started acting like adults, working on goals and improving themselves.\n\nWell she surely didn't hide it well, because it was seen, not to mention her *tolls* being in the shared are. People use shaving blades for this, because they are very sharp and don't cause much pain. If I wanted to harm myself, I'd join a martial arts school, if I were a girl and wanted to harm myself, I would use a rusty old knife for maximum pain, and if I didn't want it to be seen, I'd carve myself on the thighs (also for maximum pain). Or chop off a piece of my fingers every now and then.\n\nAll in all, this just seems like a plea for attention that would be best cured with a slap in the face and a philosophy book smacked on her head.\n\nI know that happines requires a balance of freedom and responsibility, the joy of pursuing goals and having meaningful hobbies.

I can assure you that you can be an RA and not know how to spell, as I have worked and currently work with several who have way worse grammar and spelling than me, lol. \n\nAlso reporting with that quote won't get anything done. It'll just make the staff hate you bc they'll see you as attacking the roommate. Again it just needs framed as a concern and less of a \"she's crazy and I don't want to live here.\" Even if you feel that way you kinda have to play the game to get shit done on college campuses.",

Personally, I think you have an ethical obligation to report the matter to someone who can connect your roommate with the care needed to overcome this behavior, *if you are convinced that the person really is self-harming*.  Bringing this issue to others' attention will certainly not be fun, and your roommate might react with active hostility.  But how would you feel if it later turned out that the person was working up to slitting their wrists or something like that?  This situation is terrible, and it's not going to be pleasant to address, but all I can say is that I personally would be devastated if I simply ignored the situation because of how uncomfortable it was and then later something tragic happened.\n\nIs there some kind of counseling center or medical clinic on campus where you could speak to a professional to get some advice?  I would definitely do that.  If you don't know of any campus resources, there are also national toll-free crisis lines and websites that you can reach out to for advice.  Although you might be the first person to realize what is happening, *you don't have to address this situation on your own*; there are adults and other professionals out there who can help, so just see what's available on campus and online until you track someone down who can assist you.\n\nGood luck.",
