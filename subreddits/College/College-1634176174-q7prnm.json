      "text": "Reddit can be a great tool for certain things but not this. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re stressed and want reassurance which I get but every school is different and has different procedures. What you should do is make an appointment with your advisor ASAP. Once you sign up to take the class again next semester, see what it would mean for your GPA if you passed with a good grade the second time around. Also evaluate why you failed and maybe communicate with your professor for help, so you do better next time. \n\nAs for the reassurance bit: you\u2019re only a freshman. Usually that means you\u2019re only 18 years old. Even if you\u2019re older this is still the early beginnings of a long college career. It really isn\u2019t the end of the world, don\u2019t let one bad grade deter you. But don\u2019t let yourself become complacent either. You could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve done better but you didn\u2019t because you\u2019re human and we\u2019ve all been there; just make sure next time you\u2019re better prepared.",
