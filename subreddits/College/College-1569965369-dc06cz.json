These are my completely anal-retentive steps I started following after being sick and getting pinkeye all the time. As long as I follow these steps, I don't get sick:\n\n* Stay hydrated. Dehydration makes you sluggish, prone to infection, and [stupid to boot.](https://uproxx.com/life/dehydration-mental-effects/)\n* Eat well. [Vegetables and Fruit are important to a healthy immune system](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/foods-that-boost-the-immune-system).\n* Have a [consistent sleep schedule.](http://science.time.com/2013/11/07/go-to-sleep-why-messing-with-your-body-clock-may-make-you-sick/) I know, advice your Mom probably gave you, but the more rested you are, the stronger your immune system is.\n* Get a flu shot. I hate needles, but hate having a incurable cold for weeks a lot more.\n* Wipe your desk/communal keyboards down with hand sanitizer/antibacterial wipes when you sit down. I don't care how crazy I look or feel anymore. People are disgusting.\n* Don't share ANY writing utensils. Teacher passes around a sign in sheet? Use your own god damn pencil. Have to borrow a pencil? Wipe it down with hand sanitizer first. Same goes for banks/ dr offices/etc.\n* Wash your hands after you leave every classroom. You just touched the door, which everyone else touched. One of them is bound to be sick, or filthy. Don't risk it.\n* Use hand sanitizer when you can't physically wash your hands with soap and water.\n* Don't be shy about getting up and sitting somewhere else if the person you're sitting next to is sick. IDGAF if someone feels bad about me moving away from them, they shouldn't be in class when they are ill. I know that often falls on the teachers because they require certain levels of attendance, but too bad. They can stand a little discomfort, I can not stand being sick in order to keep them comfortable. Last time I ignored this rule to keep someone happy, I got a chest cold for 6 weeks.\n\nI also brew a fruit tea that was handed down to me by my great grandmother and drink it pretty much every day during October/November/December. Its delicious too. I'd be happy to share it.\n\nEDIT: Cool. Some of you were interested in the tea recipe, so here it is. You're also all my honorary primos  (cousins) now. Bienvenido a la familia!\n\nGrandma's Tea aka Ponche de Frutas Caliente\n\n* 3-5 Cinnamon Sticks\n* 1 Apple, sliced  (no red delicious apples, those are complete shit)\n* 1 Orange, sliced\n* 1/4 lemon, sliced\n* approx. 4 cups of water (or apple juice, or apple cider if you're feeling fancy)\n* 1/3 cup prunes\n* 1/3 cup raisins\n* 1/4 cup pilloncilo (alternatively, I use honey and molasses because sugar isn't great for you, whereas honey has antibacterial properties, and molasses is a natural cough suppressant)\n\nBoil the cinnamon sticks in the water (or juice or cider) until the water turns dark. You can leave the sticks in, but I take them out. Add the fruit & pilloncillo (or honey & molasses). Boil until the fruit goes soft, then drink up. You can eat the fruit, or strain it out.

Honestly I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a way around it because I was eating very healthy and still getting sick, sleep probably wasn\u2019t good though so I guess make sure to sleep enough. Probably a good idea to take vitamin C and take a probiotic!

If you start to feel sick (dry throat, slight cough) take vitamin C (pills are most effective) and drink a lot of water for a few days. Spray down your doorknobs and handles with lysol every week.
