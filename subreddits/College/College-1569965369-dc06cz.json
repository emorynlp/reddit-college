Germs from a cough/sneeze linger in the air for like 10 seconds and can spray about 20 feet.  It may be over the top but if you are among a crowd of sick people, breath less, or cover your mouth nose with your shirt if someone is having a sneeze/cough fit in your vicinity.  Obviously you cannot hold your breathe and cover your face all the time, but if you can, it helps.  \n\nDont touch things, keep some kleenex in your pocket and use it to open doors and light switches, cover up grocery cart handles, any communal thing hundreds of people touch a day, you want a barrier between it and you.  \n\nDont touch your face, dont pick your nose, dont rub your eyes, dont bite your fingernails, if you must be sure to wash/sanitize your hands first.  \n\nKeep sanitizer with you, use it.  Make a little mental schedule, every time I sit down to class sanitize my hands, every time I get in my car sanitize my hands.  \n\nBasically just practice really good hand washing, and touch as little as possible and dont breathe deeply around sick people.",

No matter what precautions you take or how strong your immune system is, if you're being constantly exposed to people from different regions who are carrying different germs to the ones you're used to, you're going to get sick. Even the people who \"don't get sick\" are being infected and passing it on to others, they're just not feeling any symptoms. \n\nYou can't wash your hands every single time you touch any surface or object, so take some precautions, wash your hands regularly, and avoid touching your face, but know that it may not be enough. Make sure you're stocked up on cold medicine and throat lozenges, and try to stay away from class/people when you're sick. \"Soldiering on\" when you're sick isn't an admirable thing, it's just a dick move to everyone else who gets infected.",

      "text": "I used to run a comic book and gaming store. These are my completely anal-retentive steps I started following after being sick and getting pinkeye all the time. As long as I follow these steps, I don't get sick:\n\n* Stay hydrated. Dehydration makes you sluggish, prone to infection, and [stupid to boot.](https://uproxx.com/life/dehydration-mental-effects/)\n* Eat well. [Vegetables and Fruit are important to a healthy immune system](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/foods-that-boost-the-immune-system).\n* Have a [consistent sleep schedule.](http://science.time.com/2013/11/07/go-to-sleep-why-messing-with-your-body-clock-may-make-you-sick/) I know, advice your Mom probably gave you, but the more rested you are, the stronger your immune system is.\n* Get a flu shot. I hate needles, but hate having a incurable cold for weeks a lot more.\n* Wipe your desk/communal keyboards down with hand sanitizer/antibacterial wipes when you sit down. I don't care how crazy I look or feel anymore. People are disgusting.\n* Don't share ANY writing utensils. Teacher passes around a sign in sheet? Use your own god damn pencil. Have to borrow a pencil? Wipe it down with hand sanitizer first. Same goes for banks/ dr offices/etc.\n* Wash your hands after you leave every classroom. You just touched the door, which everyone else touched. One of them is bound to be sick, or filthy. Don't risk it.\n* Use hand sanitizer when you can't physically wash your hands with soap and water.\n* Don't be shy about getting up and sitting somewhere else if the person you're sitting next to is sick. IDGAF if someone feels bad about me moving away from them, they shouldn't be in class when they are ill. I know that often falls on the teachers because they require certain levels of attendance, but too bad. They can stand a little discomfort, I can not stand being sick in order to keep them comfortable. Last time I ignored this rule to keep someone happy, I got a chest cold for 6 weeks.\n\nI also brew a fruit tea that was handed down to me by my great grandmother and drink it pretty much every day during October/November/December. Its delicious too. I'd be happy to share it.\n\nEDIT: Cool. Some of you were interested in the tea recipe, so here it is. You're also all my honorary primos  (cousins) now. Bienvenido a la familia!\n\nGrandma's Tea aka Ponche de Frutas Caliente\n\n* 3-5 Cinnamon Sticks\n* 1 Apple, sliced  (no red delicious apples, those are complete shit)\n* 1 Orange, sliced\n* 1/4 lemon, sliced\n* approx. 4 cups of water (or apple juice, or apple cider if you're feeling fancy)\n* 1/3 cup prunes\n* 1/3 cup raisins\n* 1/4 cup pilloncilo (alternatively, I use honey and molasses because sugar isn't great for you, whereas honey has antibacterial properties, and molasses is a natural cough suppressant)\n\nBoil the cinnamon sticks in the water (or juice or cider) until the water turns dark. You can leave the sticks in, but I take them out. Add the fruit & pilloncillo (or honey & molasses). Boil until the fruit goes soft, then drink up. You can eat the fruit, or strain it out. It's up to you. This recipe will make your house smell amazing btw.",

Avoid people who are sick (at a fault). Never share a drink (whether water or not). Carry hand sanitizer in your bag and apply at the end of each class. If you start to feel sick (dry throat, slight cough) take vitamin C (pills are most effective) and drink a lot of water for a few days. Spray down your doorknobs and handles with lysol every week. Get enough sleep and stay relaxed, sleep deprivation and stress make you more vulnerable to sickness. But most importantly, stop touching your face, putting your hands or fingers in your mouth, rubbing your eyes/nose, etc. All of these are the easiest way to infect yourself with whatever plague is going around at the time",

The long answer is because alcohol actually kills bacteria in two ways.\n\nThe first way is that ethanol dissolves the cell wall. This happens by having one end that dissolves in water, and one end that dissolves in dissolves in fatty/greasy like substances. The chemical formula for a lipid just happens to have those two properties. When you introduce alcohol, the parts of the cell wall will associate with the alcohol instead of each other and break apart.\n\nThe other way is that protein must be dissolved in water to properly function. Alcohol causes the protein to denature by disrupting the side chain hydrogen bonds. This causes the protein and alcohol molecule to form new hydrogen bonds, disrupting the original function. Because the proteins can no longer function correctly, neither can the cell.\n\nNot only would the cell have to develop a new type of cell wall, the cell would have to function without using proteins.",
