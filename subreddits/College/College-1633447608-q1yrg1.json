  "title:": "Considering Finishing College in a Different State",
  "text": "I am a sophomore in college. I started out going to a public state university, but I was unprepared and covid-19 disastrously struck. I had not prepared for the tuition cost and my parents were making considerably less, so they couldn't help me much. I took a break for a year and ended up going to a local community college. I'm currently doing that now. I really hate being in my hometown in the south, and I am looking to move out and live in the city somewhere. I like the northeast, and have been considering colleges in Massachusetts and further north. I also would like to be able to afford living lol. I want to ask for advice on how I can move out of state and what college can be most beneficial to a graphic designer on a budget.\n\nedit: I am going to finish as many gen-eds as I can at my current school",
