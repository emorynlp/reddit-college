It is made using conditional formatting with google docs. If you want to change the name of the prefixes for classes instead of using numbers, right click on 1st row and go to conditional formatting where you can edit it and replaces the numbers with names.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sort by date, go to row F where the due date is, click on the letter f at the top, click data, then click sort sheet by column f, a - z\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or things you feel I should add/ change\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink To it: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9\\_HQ3FGUMmA8/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9_HQ3FGUMmA8/copy)\n\nLink to public copy: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9\\_HQ3FGUMmA8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LHVfFdpdQpUd5CAva7-r7rGtpDOMezV9_HQ3FGUMmA8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWhen you access it, you can make copy and edit it yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPhoto of Sheet: [https://imgur.com/a/JTY72B7](https://imgur.com/a/JTY72B7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy!\n\nUPDATE 1: There were some bugs that I found out and fixed it. If you were having issues try again now.  \nUPDATE 2: Changed bright green for finish to grey in order to have it not take away from work that needs to be done\n\nEDIT: I did just find out google sheets has their own assignments track, which funnily enough is somewhat similar. There's seems easier to use but has less functions than mine. Take a look at both and see which one you prefer best.
