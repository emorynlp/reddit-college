  "text": "I am at a college right now where the academic workload and opportunities are plenty abundant. I have also made some friends and so far it has been decent.\n\nBut, my other friends are at another college which is more of a party-college and I desperately want to go there and hang out and live with them and everything and ESPECIALLY party with them.\n\nThere are parties and here and stuff, but I really want to hang out with my old friends at their college and they have a pretty decent ranking in the major that I want to pursue.\n\nSo should I transfer colleges just so I can hang out with my friends? I feel like it would make me a lot happier.",
