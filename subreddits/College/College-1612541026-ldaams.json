  "text": "Absolutely the best feeling I feel in college lmao; I open up many tabs when I do an assignment, either to look to see if answers are on quizlet, taking notes, looking at notes, etc... and then when you\u2019re done, you X out of all those tabs you used.\n\nIf I were to live for a feeling, it would be for the satisfaction of closing tabs.",
