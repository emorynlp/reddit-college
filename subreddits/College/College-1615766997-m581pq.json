I got about 70 credits done in 5 years but they were mostly elective courses and I had a math class, a science class, a history class, and a speech class preventing me from graduating. I dropped out in 2016 because my GPA was so low. \n\nI went back last summer, to a new college and due to a change in requirements from college to college, I had to take two full semesters and two summer classes to transfer. \n\nWell, I will be done at the end of April, and graduation is May 7th. Short of failing my Stats class rn, I will graduate with a 3.5 or above. I got into the Honors program and the EOP program.\n\nMy family was talking about throwing me a celebration but I am embarrassed? I have so many friends who have had bachelors degrees for years. I will graduate with an associates almost 10 years to the day that I got my high school diploma. \n\nI am transferring in the fall but should I wait to celebrate until I get my BA in two years?

Plenty of people have gone back to school at a later age and been successful.\n\nSecondly, back to your primary question, in my opinion, yes an associates is something to celebrate (in my view). \n\nIn a world where automation threatens many jobs in the future, and where skilled labor brings investment to expensive national workforces, an associates is proof of skills both to employers and the world. \n\nAdditionally, many people take classes equal to completing their junior year at a four year school but then drop out with nothing to show for it, never to complete their degree. With an associates, if you somehow are forced to stop schooling, you have something to show for your work even if it isn't a bachelors. \n\nGoing off of the previous paragraph, in the US, economic analyses demonstrate that a masters maybe preferred to a bachelors, and a bachelors to someone with an associates, but an associates is preferred to someone with only a high school diploma. For now, this makes you more competitive in the job market. \n\nLastly, in a world of Swedens, Costa Ricas, and Central African Republics, among the top indicators of human development within a country is education of the citizens. Many countries consider graduating from primary school to be a big accomplishment, let alone a bachelor's, master's, associates, or high school diploma.
