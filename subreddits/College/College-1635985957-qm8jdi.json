  "title:": "Will a couple of Cs look bad for grad school?",
  "text": "I'm not great at math and physics. Hell, I'm awful. Last year, took calc 2 p/f in the fall and got a C- in calc 3. For some reason, I thought I could handle the harder intro to physics course. Well I don't know what's going on and I think I may get a C in it as well. For reference, I'm likely going to get As and Bs in my other courses that are more applicable to what I want to do. But I'm worried that this will look bad and that I won't get into a good grad school.\n\nFor reference, I'm majoring in bio and minoring in chem (more on the organic side)",

However, if you have good grades in the coursework more relevant to your grad program, a good overall GPA, and some relevant practical experiences and skills, it\u2019ll more than make up for it.",
