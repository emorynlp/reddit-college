  "title:": "Question for Canadians: Which is the better of the two colleges Durham(Ottawa, ON) or Langara(BC)",
  "text": "'m looking for a course in Computer Science or something similar and I've found [Web and Mobile app developement](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/admission-requirements.html) by Langara college and [Computer programming by Durham College](https://durhamcollege.ca/programs/computer-programming-two-year#tabCourses). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first look, Langara college appealed more to me and also seems to have a very good reputation in Vancouver. Durham college, on the other hand, is in Ottawa which is a small town in Ontario. I also liked the Campus of Langara. The only reason I'm considering Durham is that the course contents looks much better and has the topics I actually wanted to study. The course is much neutral and doesn't focus on a specific specialization(like Langara which is aimed towards web and mobile). I'm really confused between the two and I've already applied to Langara a couple of weeks back. Which one should I choose?",
