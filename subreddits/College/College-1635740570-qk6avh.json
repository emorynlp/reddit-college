  "text": "Hello, \n\nSo I'm taking a writing class and we're on a fiction unit. I enjoy writing fiction. I'm supposed to share a story with the class in a few days. \n\nAs of now I'm planning on submitting both stories to my teacher (we only have to submit one, but I think we can submit two if we want, or we can ask the teacher for input on the one to choose). The first story I've been working on in this class this year, and it's on track to be done in time. However, some parts are kind of embarrassing for me to let the class read for some reason. I'm thinking of just giving it to my teacher to read and give feedback. \n\nThe second story is a story I wrote in my English class last year (high school). Now, if I were only submitting this story, then this would be cheating (submitting a work of already written, even if I made edits). But I think I'll continue to make edits, change the ending, and have this one be shared with the class since my class enjoyed it last year. \n\nSo, I'm still submitting two stories (which I think is allowed). Except, I'm only having the class read story 2, but have the teacher read both. \n\nWould this be ok?",
