  "text": "Anyone else felt more stressed than usual this semester? I\u2019ve been in a slump lately because of my grades I\u2019m doing the worst I ever have in college and it\u2019s put me in such a terrible state of mind. I\u2019m usually a pretty good student but lately it\u2019s been different. Forgetting assignments or not doing them at all, blowing off things till the last hour, just overall lazy and procrastinating and it\u2019s made me feel awful and I have tried but I can\u2019t get out of what\u2019s going on. Am I the only one?\n\nEdit: I wanted to add in that I don\u2019t mean to make a sob story for myself, just feels like a place I can post smtn like this and have peers relate to it.\n\nEdit 2: Wow! Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up, so happy to see everyone sharing their stories about this semester. Thanks for the support and thank you guys for supporting each other through all of this! We can do it!",

I went from mid-January to December 4th non-stop this year. The breaks between semesters were only a week at max I think. \n\nMiraculously, I didn't really start feeling the burnout til Fall Session of this year. I think it all started taking a toll because I was taking a second language, as well as essay-heavy courses alongside. Next year I am taking Fall Session off, either both \"semesters\" or just the second one. The day after I finished finals, I was so exhausted even though I'd gotten a good night's sleep after everything. Never again.\n\n*Edited when I realized that I was away for 10 years, not just the 8 I was working full-time",

I literally could not get myself to sit down and go over anything, and if i studied for at least one test, it would have needed to be chem so i could at least pass. We had some online program due 2 days later as well that i could have done all day and night to complete to help out my grade somewhat, but again I just couldn't. Sat myself in front of the computer but I literally couldn't comprehend just doing those problems. This class was important to my major too, and I needed to pass to take the next level next semester, but as usual I've gone and fucked myself over. Dont even wanna look at my final grade from how scared I am, and dont get me started on telling my parents yet or when my friend and roommate find out. \n\nSorry for the long ass rant, I guess I just had to put this somewhere but TLDR, failed an important class because I'm too scatter brained to get myself to study and do what matters.",

It's been marked but the prof emailed us last night saying he's waiting until the thirteen late papers have been handed in before releasing marks. It's eating me up, lol. Like, bruv, it's been two weeks, they're not gonna hand them in, GIVE US OUR MARKS BACK.\n\nI'm waiting on four different marks for three separate courses, one of these we did a class showcase of our work yesterday over Zoom, so I'm confused why the marks aren't up if the prof has already publicly evaluated my work.\n\n I've combated this stress by eating the money and getting a Nintendo Switch with Smash Ultimate, training to beat my friends at Christmas and playing World of Light; I also I started forcing myself to exercise every day again which means running .50 miles on snow and ice for the first time ever, lol.

At first it worked out fine, and then in October things just went downhill and I couldn\u2019t find the motivation to do anything despite still having ample time to complete stuff on my to-do list.\n\nWe were hybrid this semester but the way it worked out, I ended only going to campus 2-3 days a week, which turned out to be bad for my mental health and work ethic. So I\u2019m right there with you. I have always had motivation/procrastination issues but it has never been this bad. \n\nI have been considering only doing part-time in the spring or just taking the semester off altogether because we are partially online once again, and I\u2019m not sure how much more I can take. So I guess my advice would be to consider either of those if it is possible for you?",
