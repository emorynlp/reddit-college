I wasn\u2019t even super happy in high school or anything, but I\u2019m not ready to see my parents every few weeks at most and I dread the moment when my home is no longer my home and becomes my parents house. I read a while ago that by the time you reach age 18, 90% of the time that you\u2019ll spend with your parents has already passed. That hit me pretty hard.",

My brain feels like it's going to blow up.",
