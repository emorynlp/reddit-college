  "title:": "Working on my Associate\u2019s degree in Business Administration for Transfer at a community college",
  "text": "Hello! I am currently at a community college working towards my associate\u2019s and I have one semester left (Spring) before I transfer to a university. I did not apply for any university YET with money being the main issue. But I don\u2019t mind taking a year off school before starting uni anyway. But since I\u2019m almost done with my Associate\u2019s, I would like to hear some options on what I should do.\n\n1. I took the CSU pathway over the UC pathway, which I now regret. The main issue was always money and I obviously could afford CSU more than UC. I\u2019m not sure how different the required classes are but I\u2019d say I probably need to take at least another 3 or more classes before I can get into UCs.\n2. My current GPA is 4.0 and I talked to my counselor before and she asked me if I\u2019m sure I want to transfer at CSU San Bernardino with the current grades that I have. In my head it is the only option because 1) I live close to CSUSB 2) It\u2019s more affordable\n\n\nBefore I started school, I had no background of any university in cali and just chose the most convenient choice for me. (I just moved to the US 2 years ago. I\u2019m a permanent resident though, so I get fafsa at my cc and I\u2019m not considered an international student)\n\nAnyway all that said, now that I\u2019m somewhat familiar with schools/transfers/etc, I kinda want to aim higher and maybe look into USC too? Or UCI? (It sucks that UCLA doesn\u2019t have business school). But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s still worth giving it a shot or should I just stick with what I\u2019m already at? \n\nAlso I mentioned that I don\u2019t mind taking a gap before uni after I get my Associate\u2019s. Will I be able to get an entry-level job with my associate\u2019s degree for Transfer? Because it would really help me figure out how to afford uni while already gaining experience in the business world if in any case, I wouldn\u2019t be able to transfer as soon as I would have intended to :/",

      "text": "I would recommend looking into a bookkeeping position, low level office administrator position, or see if you can get an internship with the county/state/federal government. Having relevant experience will put you light years ahead of people graduating college with just a degree. \n\nAs for picking a college, no employer will care where you graduated from. They will see you have a check in the box for a requirement. You might be able to squeeze a few extra opportunities out of USC through networking, but is it really worth the 40k - 80k tuition?",
