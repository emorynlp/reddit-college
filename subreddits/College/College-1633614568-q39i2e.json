  "text": "hey everyone! i\u2019m a high school senior that is taking a concurrent enrollment math class that i have no interest in taking. i was forced to take this class and i am currently failing. i have no motivation or interest in even trying at this point. i didn\u2019t even want to take the class in the first place. it\u2019s so bad for my mental health that i dread waking up on the day i have the class. i guess my question is, is it better to drop the class mid semester and pay a fee and also pay my parents back for taking the class (which they forced me into taking), or just fail. also does anyone have any idea how much it\u2019ll cost to withdraw from the class?\n\ntldr; dropping a class mid semester bc i was forced to take it and am now failing. good or bad idea?",
