  "text": "I'm a sophomore now, going into IT. However, I didn't meet the grade requirement for my second beginner python class last year, and had to retake it (so now I'm a class behind). Now I'm in a Data Structures (Java) class, and I already feel behind. My coding knowledge seems lackluster and I don't particularly enjoy coding, and I don't want to fail this class. Should I drop and change majors?",
