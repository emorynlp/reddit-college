  "text": "So I'm a student at CSU Global and who's very close to being finished with my degree. However, I still need 9 credits of electives and my advisor told me about alternative credit options that I could take to finish those credits a little faster than just taking normal classes. I'm curious if anyone's had any experience with them?\n\nThe options listed are: \nCLEP,\nDSST,\nJumpCourse,\nPropero from Pearson,\nSaylor Academy,\nSophia,\nStraighterLine,\nStudy.com,\nAlternative Credit Project\n\nI'm not familiar with any of them so any advice or knowledge would be amazing. I'm just hoping to get through the nine credits I need quickly and easily before the Spring semester begins. I don't really care that much about what the classes are as long as they're not very stressful to get through lol. I just want to finish my degree more than anything. Thanks to anyone who can help in advance!",
