      "text": "One thing that helps me keep my A\u2019s is planning my weeks ahead. I\u2019ll look at all my hw due for the week and plan which assignments I want to do and what day to turn it in on. For example on Wednesday i have 4 assignments due so on Monday I\u2019ll do two assignments and turn it in. On Tuesday I\u2019ll do the other two and turn it in. It\u2019s a simple fix (imo) but if you need another idea, look at all ur due dates and in a planner or some organization sheet (excel) change the due dates to a week in advance. Why a week? If you get lazy and want to push it off, you\u2019ll still have an extra week to actually get it done. With this method it\u2019ll train ur mind into getting assignments done early and you\u2019ll have a lot more free time. One way to motivate urself to study (it\u2019s clich\u00e9) is to leave ur phone in ur room and go to the library, if ur on campus. Being around other students as they do nothing but work could motivate you andddd if you do take ur phone you\u2019ll be less inclined to getting on it.",

Top of the class used to ace all my exams, teachers' favorite. Now, I'm trying so hard to keep up with everything and since we're the only country that does not go to school physically, it doubles down the weight I've been trying to carry since last year.  Had a prof who struggled too when he was in college, but he said to us that he had a goal and he made the action to achieve it. He may not had good grades when he was studying but it took him some motivation to try and finish it. After he graduated it was another chapter of his life. \n\nYou see, it's hard to motivate yourself especially if you're really beating yourself up over it right now, but always think about why you started it and why you are continuing to do it. Maybe change your habits little by little, it's still progress. Consult your professors about a lesson because an inquiring student would mean he's willing to learn. Go to studystream if you'd like to see other people studying. You're not alone having C in your classes, but try to think that you actually tried.",
