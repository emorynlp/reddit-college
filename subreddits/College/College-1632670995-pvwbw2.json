  "text": "I am only 3 weeks into my first year as a college student but I already feel so behind compared to the rest of my peers. Some of them have done internships, made projects, this that and the other thing and I am here doing nothing. Beyond the career stuff, I also feel like I haven't been doing the hobbies I enjoy like art and playing video games.\n\nI feel like most of my free time is spent doing nothing on my phone or doing nothing with my roommates and I want to change that. \n\nWhat should I do? I was thinking of making a schedule so that on certain days I \"have\" to do a thing for at least 10 minutes, which should be enough time to get me invested in it. \n\nAny tips would be nice!",

      "text": "Add two things to your spare time: volunteering in your field (if possible) and club activities. Being in a club can lead to leadership, which looks good on your resume. And volunteering is a good way to get experience when you're not qualified for a job or internship yet. Even if you can't find a volunteer opportunity related to your major, volunteering anywhere can at least lead to getting a letter of recommendation, which is always a challenge.\n\nAnd personally I'm extremely busy so I set schedules for EVERYTHING including hanging out with friends and sitting alone in my room playing video games.",

      "text": "First, I would say that you should stop comparing yourself to your peers, especially the ones that you see with internships, projects, etc. Whenever you feel this way, remember that there are thousands if not millions of people just like you who come in to college without having done anything, and that is completely fine. \n\nSecond, for making time for hobbies, I would first make a list of all the possible hobbies/activities you want to do this year. I would put this in a place where you can look at it from time to time just in case you forget what you wanted to do and need a refresher. Then, I would pick a few hobbies to start out with and then do a little research into them. Find what you have to do first and any resources that you might need to get for it. Then make a concrete plan of what you need to do for that hobby.\n\nFor example, I like to read, so I first looked up what book I wanted to read and then got it. Then I made a concrete plan by telling myself that I would read for 30 minutes - 1 hour a day or maybe 50 pages depending on what I wanted to do that day.\n\nAnother example is I wanted to learn a language. I found some textbooks and a free course online that uses those textbooks to teach. I then made a concrete plan that I would go through one chapter in the course a day and do the corresponding HW exercises for that chapter that day.\n\nI believe the most important part to this planning is to have a concrete plan of what to do instead of just an abstract hobby that you want to spend 1 hour that day doing. So do not say I want to spend 1 hour learning spanish. Instead say I want to spend 1 hour on this chapter of this course/book , 1 hour reading Don Quixote in its native language, or 1 hour watching youtube videos fully in spanish. I feel that this motivates you more.",
