  "text": "Hi there. I sit on the board of a student organisation which hosts academic events and builds the bridge between students and companies in the finance industry. I am 1 of 10 board members, and have recently come to the conclusion that a significant part of the board are not too engaged and put minimal effort into the job. We have no articles of association which specify a minimum effort under which a member should depart from the board. I am curious if there are any board members out there who can tell me about how they hold members accountable and ensure that work is put into their job? It saddens me that me and the rest of the business relations team are the only ones who have carried out events for the students this semester, whereas the rest has simply attended board meetings.\n\nExcuse my poor english. Thanks!",

However, if the majority is not doing much, they may decide not to go for it. \n\nBringing it to a vote is the only way I can think of. In my business, thays how we settle pretty much everything.",
