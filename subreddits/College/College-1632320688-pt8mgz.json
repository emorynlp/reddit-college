  "text": "It seems like no matter what I say or how politely I say it, everyone is viewing this negatively. I had to miss a family event and that really upset a lot of them. I have to keep turning down friends because these 4000 level senior classes are really hard and require all of my attention to get ready for exams. \n\nIt\u2019s upsetting to me, but I\u2019m trying to be responsible. I dropped down from 18 hours to 15 but all of my deadlines end up being back to back. It costs me $10,000 per semester and if my grades drop I\u2019ll start losing scholarships.",

      "text": "You tell them that you don't have time for their event because you have schoolwork. Just keep it simple. Don't sugarcoat it.\n\nIf they are rude to you, that's not a *you* problem.\n\nI usually tell my friends \"If I get my schoolwork done, then yes I'd love to go to dinner/bbq/girls night\". This is kind of a psychological trick where they are now *also* wanting me to get my schoolwork done so they are more inclined to leave me alone about it.",
