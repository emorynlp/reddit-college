  "title:": "College drop out wants to give it another chance.",
  "text": "So as the title says I am a college drop out wanting to try again. My first go around when I was 18 I gave in to my parents constant berating and dropped out to go into welding. Fast forward 7 years and 3 career changes later and I am back to wanting to pursue my original career path of being a pharmacist or something pharmaceutical sales related.\n\nI would basically be starting from scratch with no record of previous credits, no ACT/SAT scores, and a less than stellar high school transcript list(previous uni had an insanely high acceptance rate to where if you had a pulse you got accepted).\n\nShould I attend local Ivy Tech and get basic courses done first then more on to a different, more specialized local community college for what I can, then transfer and finish at the University I want? Or is there a better more direct way of obtaining a diploma that doesn\u2019t involve online classes? Because I honestly can\u2019t trust myself to learn online, it\u2019s challenging enough to do it in person where I can ask questions.\n\nAny feedback or recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",
