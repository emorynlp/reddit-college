  "text": "I'm a freshman in CC with a 4.0 gpa atm but I am projected to get a C in a class and am hoping to drop...\n\nI've taken 4 courses in the summer and am taking 9 right now(clearly regretting it, but will be getting all A's in the other courses at least). I'm also planning on taking 2 classes in the winter and a couple more in the spring so that I can accumulate around 40-45 credits bc I want to apply to the UC's(I have AP Credit) but don't want to spend 2 years in a CC. I will definitely be more careful when selecting my classes, and will hopefully be keeping this as my only withdrawal. Will this look bad when applying to other colleges(UCs and privates)? It's not a transfer requirement, just a GE history course. I'm planning on applying as either business or applied math.",
