  "text": "So I'm going to have to drop my STAT course tomorrow because I'm really not getting the material and I might fail. When I drop it I still have 4 courses to finish this semester, but it's going to delay my graduation :/\n\nI know it's the right thing to do but I just feel like a failure because of it. Just posting to see if yall have any advice to get out of this feeling.",
