Every few weeks to maybe months I make drastic and usually bad career/work changes. I have done the college thing several times over the years, usually always in the direction of technology, and always end up dropping out over either an English course or some form of writing I have to do in another course (writing is my kryptonite for sure). In the last 5 years, I have tried twice to return with online schools and I usually fizzle out within 6 mos or so of starting. When I had graduated high school (over 13 years ago) I went to a \"brick and mortar\" school which I did well in for about a year, maybe a little longer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is, I REALLY want to try it again, however, the saying goes though to try the same thing again and expect a different result is the definition of insanity. Should I just get this idea of trying again out of my head? should I reserve myself to try again with brick and mortar, or give this new online school a chance? for reference, the online schools I've attempted are Ashford, WGU, and am looking at UofPeople if I go that route again. I just don't know what to think or if I should even be thinking about it.", "author": "Realdomitious", "created": 1632673159, "retrieved": 1632945951, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hedgwzr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvwztu/try_again_or_stop_the_madness/hedgwzr/", "text": "If you want to try school again, start with one community college class, fitted around your work schedule. You can build up to more, and will only have to commit to one course at a time. Based on your track record I think that you\u2019ll have more luck with in person instruction.\n\nCommunity college can often provide more support than online ones.
