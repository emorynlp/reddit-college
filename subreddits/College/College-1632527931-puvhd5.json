      "text": "I really feel like freshman need to realize their true work ethic. I'm old and have a few courses with the 18 year old freshman. NONE of them have good work ethic. They are all glued to their phones and talking about shit other than what we are doing.\n\nMy favorite is every class, no fail, one of my group partners will say \"we still have a whole hour left\". I always think that means we should work harder and faster to get it done. It's a difference in drive. \n\nFresh out of high school hasn't prepared anybody for college or work. Playing games in classes is common of them too. Instead of just listening, they've got to not listen and do other shit. \n\nYour phone and friends MUST wait until you're out of class. If you seriously can't make it through class without communicating, you should go get a job for a  year or two.",

With that being said, make the most of it. Walk up to that cute girl standing by herself and introduce yourself. Get out of your comfort zone.",
