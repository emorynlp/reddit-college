A lot of the students I talked to said that their grades also have not reflected in their grade average as well. Someone said that if it says \"omitted\", it means that the instructor suspects you of cheating, which I think is a bit odd considering that the exam was open notes. Has this happened to any of you before? Should I be worried?", "author": "CubicRadiation", "created": 1632836968, "retrieved": 1632945463, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heli2fm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px6svj/professor_omitted_exam_results/heli2fm/", "text": "> I think is a bit odd considering that the exam was open notes.\n\nThere are students who will literally pay another person to do their exam, even if it's open notes.

Some will drop.your lowest exam score or drop a score that the entire class did badly on, I had a professor would would grade exams but not have the score factor into our grade until all exams had been graded and any adjustments were applied. You should just ask your professor about it, because they'll know why the score is omitted.", "author": "hemehime", "created": 1632837406, "upvotes": 2}}}
