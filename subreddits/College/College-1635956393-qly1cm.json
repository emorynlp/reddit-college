  "title:": "My Philosophy professor thinks I am plagiarizing (I'm not) and I don't know what to do",
  "text": "I'm in a philosophy class and it's entirely online. We have a weekly discussion board on the topic of the week, usually it's in the form of a question like, \"What is a fallacy\" or \"What is validity in an argument\". A lot of people in the class give very simple responses that aren't written too well and don't offer much detail. I personally hate this and I try to give detailed answers and use proper language. Every time I finish my response I feel good about it because I know it is well written and expresses exactly what I think in a clear manner.\n\nMy professor has typed twice now in general chat to say that he is noticing some of us are \\*obviously\\* plagiarizing and to stop it. Just today he said he will start calling those people out on it and taking points away.\n\nI have legitimately never once plagiarized in my life. I enjoy this class and put effort into my responses because I like to be thorough. I got curious and when I copy pasted 2 of my previous responses to a plagiarism checker, they BOTH came back as 100% plagiarized. The website that says I plagiarized has 8 different links to websites and shows what phrases I \"stole\" from each one. I then tried another website to check for plagiarism and it says my two responses are completely unique. \n\nI feel kinda shitty. I put effort into that work and I'm proud of it, but the professor has absolutely no reason to not believe I'm not plagiarizing. If I keep putting the same effort, I'll come off as plagiarizing again and get points taken off. If I start replying the way other students do, it'll look like I didn't know much all along and really \\*was\\* plagiarizing. I want to reach out via email but I don't know what to say. Any advice is appreciated.",

The thing matches similar words, it doesnt know it was your post.\n\nJust go to office hours and clear it up",
