      "text": "Ask people in your classes to hang out/eat together. If you\u2019re in a dorm, leave your door open if you\u2019re doing anything light. Hang out in common study spaces. Go to events. Join clubs. If your dorm has lounges, see if people are there and hang out. Most of all, while you\u2019re doing these things, make the effort of actually talking to people and learning about them. If you vibe, ask to hang out again/ask for their contact. It\u2019s easy to find people, but you have to put some effort in to make them your friends.",

Eventually, you\u2019ll find people you actually vibe with. It can take a while though. Try branching out to a more diverse group, and really take interest in the activities/ideas of others.",
