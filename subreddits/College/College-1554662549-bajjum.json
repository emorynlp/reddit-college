  "text": "Professor has accused me of cheating during online exam, by saying that I communicated with another student during exam. \n\nThis is 100% impossible because I don\u2019t know anyone in the class since it\u2019s online. Should I attach my text/call logs from AT&T to prove I didn\u2019t communicate with another student during the exam? \n\nI\u2019ve even thought of attaching my data logs to prove I wasn\u2019t using Facebook or anything else during the time period of the exam. Is this a good idea? \n\nHe\u2019s given me a 0 for the midterm based off of his assumption. ",

With that in mind, here are some facts and questions to ask the school and your teacher:\n\n1: the technology does not detect cheating, only that your eyes were not focused onscreen\n\n2: the technology may or may not use AI to detect cheating, but at best it should have flagged your video for human review. Did the review reveal, reasonably, that you cheated? If there was no review done, why not?\n\n3: were there explicit instructions given that the examination of the skills tested included focusing on a computer screen for the entire duration of the exam? If so, you clearly failed the exam. If not, then you should be afforded the ability to look away from the screen, for instance, to work out problems on paper, if doing so would improve your score. \n\nThe reason why AI and technology for education exists is because some teachers are absolutely terrible at their jobs. If you feel you have been swindled out of a decent education by any of your teachers, I suggest you be a vocal advocate for AI in education (some of which detects when a teacher is failing or lazy or being unfair).

You'd have a camera recording every lecture? If a professor literally hits a student, I'm quite positive you wouldn't need AI to detect that - every student would be reporting that, and for good reason.\n\nAnd if it is a one on one situation (in an office for instance) there wouldn't be a camera running 24/7.\n\n>On a higher level, you can detect when someone is depressed or upset, and then make a high-probability decision about whether they should be teaching that day or not.\n\nMaybe, although I'm not sure how you'd detect that.

So, you can try me :) My issue is that you're using the term \"AI\" as though it were magic or an omnipresent being or something. It's not, it needs data from somewhere and it has its limitations.\n\nYou made a pretty outstanding claim that AI could detect teachers who were lazy or failing, and I don't see how a system could do that reliably and I have no idea on what data you would do that. That then diverged into a separate claim of noticing when teachers were physically hitting students which just...doesn't seem useful to me.\n\n>However, to answer your questions: you can pretty much automate 90% of what teachers do today with technology, everything from roll-call to grading exams to teaching to filling out administrative forms. \n\nGrading exams or projects cannot be automated unless it is simple multiple choice type stuff.\n\n",

The camera did not have the angle to see what you were doing when you looked down and the professor decided to call you a cheat. \n\nThe other data the professor would use is your actual answers.

To my understanding, they check to see if anyone Googles an answer during the time you\u2019re taking the test and then they check the location of the person making the search. It sounds a little convoluted to me, and they\u2019re very vague about what they do. \n\nI live in a house with dozens of connected devices and with eight people living in the house, so I doubt they\u2019re able to check the search history of everyone especially without consent and then block their Google results with dummy websites. And I really doubt they have technology so advanced that it\u2019s able to detect devices through your webcam within a certain distance. Which even if they did, is a ridiculous reason to assume cheating, since in my room alone, I have a smart TV, my wife\u2019s phone, my phone, an Alexa, two smart watches, smart lightbulbs, and two tablets. Also: what if you\u2019re on a public network like Starbucks or somewhere with students who might be taking the same test. Also: what if use a VPN to show you\u2019re phone from a different location. It just seems like they\u2019re guessing, honestly. Which is why I say it all sounds really sketchy. \n\nAnd no one ever contacted me. It was just an automated message that appeared at the top of the screen that said something along the lines of \u201cface not visible. Look back at the screen\u201d. Same thing would happen if you navigated away from the page or opened a new tab in Chrome. \n\nEDIT: OH, and my professor never gave us, like a pamphlet to read regarding it or anything like that. It was more like \u201callow access or fail class\u201d type of thing. So I honestly had no clue about any of this stuff until after talking the exam. Every thing I know is from reading through their website/terms of service. All of which is not helpful at all. ",
