  "title:": "Unsure about going back school. Coursera for furthering education? Need advice.",
  "text": "So back in 2018, I already completed 13 college credits. I'm technically a second semester dropout because I needed to prioritize other aspects of my life. I'm making up for lost time as I'm learning as much as I can, studying the things that I find useful. Philosophy, statistics, logic, and english. All of those further my ability to interpret information, and communicate my thoughts.\n\nMy purpose would be to educate myself, not obtain a degree. I don't have any idea of what to major in nor am I interested in taking a full load for financial aid benefits. I had some pell grant money due to my good grades (unsure it's still there since I dropped 12 units in 2020). Online school is also more difficult for me, but I can handle the learning in isolation. Coursea, but it's not credit approved. If I could take those courses and receive credit, I would. But not if I have to take a full load and pre-requisite courses.  \n\n\nWould love to hear your guys thoughts. It's not a problem that I may get some biased answers being on this sub.",
