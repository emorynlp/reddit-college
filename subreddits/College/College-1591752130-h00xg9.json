Ended up with a A in calc 2 spring 2020 semester, the teacher didn't even have to round it up.\n\nHowever the only reason why is because the teacher often grades tests out of 105-150 ish instead of 100 so silly mistakes are less costly. Did you ask the teacher to round it up? Can it be rounded up?\n\nGreat job for your achievement though",
