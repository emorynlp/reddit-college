  "text": "Apologies if this doesn\u2019t belong here, I didn\u2019t know where else to post it.\n\nAlright so, I know this is really long but I have no idea what I\u2019m doing and I need help, and I want to make sure that I list everything. I want to start college but I\u2019m so confused. I recently got out of an extremely abusive friendship, and a point of contention between my former friend and I was college. He didn\u2019t want me to go into the career I\u2019m pursing (it didn\u2019t \u201cmake sense\u201d to him and he wanted me to go into on computer science and coding with him instead), and he didn\u2019t want me move out of state, so he manipulated me and lied about college. I\u2019ve gotten out of that friendship but I feel like I don\u2019t know anything about college anymore, or who to trust or ask for advice. My parents are very supportive and are trying to help but neither of them really has the right college experience to help me. \n\nMy education history: I was homeschooled for almost my entire life. I moved to public highschool for junior and senior year. My grades were fine while homeschooling, but because of the transfer they\u2019re just listed as \u201cpass\u201d in my academic history and they don\u2019t factor into my GPA. During the first few months of junior year in public school I unfortunately developed severe chronic illness and my grades fell. I never got them up again and my grades in senior year were just as bad. I graduated, but just barely. Because only my last 2 years (the years I spent in public school) counted towards my GPA it is embarrassingly low. It\u2019s basically just high enough for me to be passing. My PSAT and SAT scores were fine but they were only average. If I took the SAT again, however, I\u2019m confident that I could score much higher. \n\nI graduated in June of 2020 and I haven\u2019t done anything academic-related since then. I\u2019ve mostly spent the last year and a half resting/improving my health. I have an actual diagnosis now and I\u2019m getting treatment, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot better. I have a well-documented medical history in case I need to defend my low grades/time off from school.\n\nMy career goals: I am (hopefully) planning to get a bachelors in marine biology and a minor in psychology. The career I want to go into is very competitive and requires a lot of unpaid internships/volunteer experience at specific locations. I currently live with my parents in Northern Virginia, and while my state has a few marine biology schools, none of them are close to locations that I could intern/volunteer at. None of their marine biology programs get the specific experience that I need either. My family will be moving to Tennessee (which doesn\u2019t really have any marine biology schools) within the next 2-3 years so I will have to live on my own by then, and I don\u2019t want to stay in Virginia. Apart from the experience and intern/volunteer opportunity issues, it\u2019s very expensive to live here and I don\u2019t have any other reason (like friends or family) to stay here. My plan was to do community college/basic classes in Virginia for a few years and then move to another state (either when my family moves or when I\u2019m finished with basic classes) to get my marine biology degree. I am currently looking at schools in Florida, Texas and possibly California. Right now I am enrolled at NOVA (my local community college) but I haven\u2019t signed up for any classes yet.\n\nNow, my issues/questions:\n- If I do community college for a few years then move out of state, will those community college classes still count? If not, how do I make sure that they count, or how do I find classes that will count? Do I need to get something like an associates degree for it to count? Should I do a few months of community college (NOVA) and then switch to another local school (like George Mason University) to get my basic classes done?\n- If I can have a good GPA in college classes, will my highschool GPA matter? Will my SAT affect anything? Should I retake it and get a higher score to compensate for my low GPA? Or is my highschool GPA going to keep haunting me?\n- Can I still do my community college classes online, at least for the first few months? Do I have to find specific online classes or are all colleges still offering online classes?\n- What\u2019s the difference between a degree and a major? What exactly is a minor? Can I do a minor at any college? Do I need to do a minor when I do my main degree/major, or could I do it before/after? \n- If I start community collage now, how will I know what classes to take my first semester? \n- How much of a difference will instate vs out of state tuition be, and how can I save money when I move out of state for school? \n\nAgain I\u2019m so sorry that this is so long, and that this is random and some of the questions probably sound so stupid, but I feel like I\u2019m totally alone right now and I have no idea where to start or who to trust. Thank you for any help!",

      "text": "1. Classes may or may not count. Most intro classes will, but once you get to higher level and some geneds they may not. Talk to the advisor you get at CC. You can also look up your desired schools requirement for that major and try your best to synch them to your classes at CC. When to transfer is up to you. I transferred after a semester, but I know some people waiting the full 2 years. \n\n2. Once you have a college gpa no one cares about high school gpa or sat. Your sat may impact what math or english class you are in. My sat score helped me skip english comp and some math classes. I would honestly not retake it and if you want to skip some classes take the ALEKS, which is basically an sat subject test.\n\n3. You'll have to find specific classes for online or just do an online degree.\n\n4. There's not really a difference. A degree is just the physical piece of paper. A major is you getting that paper and what you studied. A minor is a below a major. You don't need to take as many classes in that subject compared if you majored in it. You don't need a minor. \n\n5. An advisor will help you.\n\n6. If your looking at no scholarships or financial aid it can be a lot. My in state is 20k while oos is around 45k per year. You can try to find scholarships both within the school and outside. There's also financial aid if you qualify. Otherwise you take out loans some are subsidized with others are not.",

              "text": "CC is an abbreviation of community college. Geneds is general education. These classes do not pertain to your major, but are needed for graduation and can vary depending on school. The theory is they make you a well rounded student. They are usually a math, english, and a science at bare minimum, but many other colleges have more subjects needed.",

      "text": "In state or Out of state tuition only applies if you are going to a state school. A private college will be the same whether you live in that state or not. Private colleges will initially look more expensive than a state scholl will, but they often offer more financial aid so the cost you actually pay could be very similar to what you would have paid as an instate student at a state college.",
