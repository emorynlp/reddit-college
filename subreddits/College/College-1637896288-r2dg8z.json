  "text": "Hello! I would like to ask you guys what books should we students need to read to deeply understand and practice empathy and leadership early on? \n\nI am still in my first year of university and I want to inculcate this kind of mindset and skill at a young age to manage people and empower them. Another reason is that I am already preparing for leadership positions on college organizations to get into managerial corporate positions for my career soon after college as well. \n\nAlso if you have any advice about leadership in mind, kindly feel free to share it with us :)",
