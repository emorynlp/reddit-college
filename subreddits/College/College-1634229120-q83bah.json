  "text": "Oh boy, let's go. So, you'd find this in my history easily so I'll just say: I go to the University of Michigan.   \n\n\nThe thing is, I'm a junior. I have been getting a reassonable amount of interest / success thanks to my school's name and city location, and I guess I have interesting projects (Bob, It was one AI bot I made with a team, IT'S HILARIOUS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THAT). Anyway, I am also in a club that's really selective and would help me build the real skills for my career. \n\nAll in all, things are finally looking up after suffering 2 grueling years of shit before this. But I am definitely not out of the woods yet. The first big hurdle is I went through life dealing with a lot of shit and most likely having undiagnosed neurodiversity that was never addressed. Sooo I am a tired, depressed stressed out person at a super rigorous school who is currently struggling to get my work done, let alone, thrive. \n\nFeels like a tiny miracle I have the amount of internship success I have had (one offer already at a kindaa? known financial company, getting to the point where internal recruiters are helping me find internship matches in other companies). I cant get proper medication for ADHD until after November 18th (neuropsych eval). So I could start failing shit even this semester, I feel like my brain is just really giving up, especially after that internship offer and even though I try to motivate myself with the classic motivation steps of just needing to push a little longer, I could loose this internship etc, I cant. Anti depressants, kinda have bad side effects that make working more difficult right now so I've held off. \n\nI am starting Wellburtin Tuesday which will hopefully help me with focus / depression eventually. But yeah, lack of motivation has been a huge issue.\n\nThe other issue has been the people I go to school with (The undergrads) I right now live with great people who are actually really understanding for the most part and nice but, the last two years, especially the first year were really tough. I went through a lot of trauma when I came to this school (Not having realllyyy wanting to) because two online friends went to the school. \n\nI thought we were close, but the moment I got here, they did a bunch of weird ghosting shit (with one of them we had started getting into fights after I got accepted) and I found myself alone and drowning in a rigorous competitive school, when I had gone through years of working my ass off with nothing to show for it, so I was tired and didn't need this stupid competitve ambitious Ivy-esque bull shit. Pretty traumatized after that. \n\nI tried to visit a therapist after that. Multiple. As I recently learned, since most if not all of them did not specialize in trauma or ADHD, they realyl weren't equipped to help me. My latest therapist suggested transferring schools given the shit I'd gone through with this one (Another big issue is that well, this is a school filled with rich white kids, many of who Im sure have loving supportive families, or at least make friends easily. I, don't. I've been trying, it's been rough.) I am a comparatively poor minority. I try to not let that get to me but talking to them online has shown the consequences of those differences. Sure people act different online, but Im not interested in meeting someone who's a dick online irl because \"They're so much better without the PC allowing them to be a bully anomynously!\" But yeah . . .\n\nI've definitely met nice people but the trauma I dealt with the first two years really paints my emotions when I walk around / communicate with people here. I'm just now finally meeting most of the decent people I ever met on campus (ones who are closer to my age, I wonder if there's a trend hmm) but the past really fucked me up. Been struggling to find the time to keep trying to find therapists who take my Medicaid insurance. My school therapy service? Only for short term therapy and my first appointment with them is October 21st. I called some time back in September, lol I forgot about this LOL \n\nSo, TLDR I have good elements to my school, good name, good opportunities, but I got hella traumatized by ghosting and subsequent gaslighting while keeping afloat in a rigorous school, with undiagnosed ADHD, litttle access to therapy, and a therapist tryna maybe soft get rid of me or suggest the only thing she could think of of going to a different school which, ngl sounds tantalizing , but transfer credits are a bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny insight / advice is much appreciated.",
