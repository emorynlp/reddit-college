  "text": "I\u2019m starting university in the next spring semester and I was just wondering if I actually need to reply to every single email I get from the university? \nBecause I get a lot of email from uni where they just inform me about something. I\u2019m not sure if I have to reply to all of them.\nPlus, when I want to reply, would it be enough to just reply with \u2018Thank you for the information.\u2019 or should I start the email with \u2018Dear\u2026..\u2019 and then thank them for the information? :( I really don\u2019t know, I\u2019m so new to this. :(",
