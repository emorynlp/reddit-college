  "text": "I have spent so much money on an online tutoring service this semester just for math. And it's like $30/hr. Fucking sucks. There's tutoring on campus but you have to make an appointment and most of the time they're booked like weeks ahead. I can't understand my professor. I can't understand the complicated textbook. I can only understand when somebody goes through the questions with me one step at a time. I'm just dumb. I would fail the class if I wasn't able to afford private tutoring.\n\nThis is calculus btw",

That was a tremendous help to me when I was in school. You may also want to check out Kahn Academy. \n\nAlso is big a  pain in the ass as it might be what helped me pass advanced college math was doing every single bit of homework that was assigned. A lot of it was repetitive and tedious but that's the only way I was able to grasp the concepts. Best wishes to you from a fellow math potato.",
