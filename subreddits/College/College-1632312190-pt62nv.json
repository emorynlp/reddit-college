      "text": "Supply Chain Management/Business Administration Major and Data Analytics Minor here. \n\nHonestly, no. I think if you were to transition to data analytics, or database design/arcitecture you'd benefit a lot more. I'm trying to think of the cross application between the two and I can't.\n\nThat being said, if you want to have another option open as far as career path, sure, go for it. But speaking from personal expereince I've had a recruiter tell me, \"you stood out with your minor in data analytics\", and I'll tell you why. My internship was in integrated logistics support, so forecasting demand for spare parts avaiblity and whatnot. It obviously helped that I was able to understand the supply chain, but it also helped immensely knowing how databases are designed, as there wasn't too much of a learning curve when I started running queries and whatnot on the job. \n\nEevryone is different, and thats just my anecdotal advice. I'm not saying dont take it, but look into your field and what you want to. Try to talk to some professors in the field or recruiters as well to get a feel for what will pair the best.",

              "text": "Depends on what you qualify as hard. There wasn\u2019t  all of math involved, rather learning how databases function ie how tables are built and interconnected, and how to successfully manage that data. I was taught using Microsoft access (if any company uses this just run) and SQL (major plus on the resume). SQL is a coding language that allows you to pull information at the click of the enter key, but you need to write a line of syntax (or maybe even a lot of lines) in order to get anything meaningful. And then it\u2019s on you to make sense of that data and present it in a way that management likes (tableau or PowerBI). \n\nEvery time an employer asks what I\u2019m passionate about I default to \u201cI\u2019m passionate about how we can better utilize big data to drive a more efficient supply chain\u201d and it\u2019s worked like a charm every time",
