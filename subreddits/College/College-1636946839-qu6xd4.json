  "text": "I'm thinking of double majoring in business management and information systems but I'm not completely sure about it yet, I don't want to make a decision I'll regret later on. I'm a full time student and don't have a job so I can focus a lot of time of studies and this is something I am interested in doing, but I want more opinions before I make a decision. I haven't spoken to my academic advisor yet.",
