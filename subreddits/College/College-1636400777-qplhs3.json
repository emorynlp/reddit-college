  "text": "Can anyone else validate this?\n\nI don't know if this is universal, but I've come to realize **that I could have done so much more in these past four years**. I've wasted four years of my life; I could have done so much more meaningful things with my time. \n\nAnd oh man, I feel so bad for all of these underclassmen (or god forbid, Seniors) that still believe *that their degree will give them purpose...* I suppose the ultimate lesson in (American) college is that **you need to create your own purpose.** And that requires critical thinking. Ouch. \n\n I could have dedicated this time to humanity (AmeriCorps, PeaceCorps, etc), I could have discovered myself and lived out my cottage core dreams, I could have moved some where else... The list is endless.\n\nOr did I just have a shitty college experience. \n\ntl;dr: what I learned in boating school is that I wasted my time.",

      "text": "In my opinion, it\u2019s too soon for you to know if you have wasted your time. If you want to do something personally meaningful now, definitely do so. But having a degree can potentially help you make a better living following your passion. Or you may change your mind a few years from now and be content with a \u201cregular\u201d job that pays the bills and use your spare time to pursue your passions. \n\nHaving multiple options is never a bad thing.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

Then I figured out the career path I wanted, and for that, I needed a degree. Going to college is one of the best decisions I ever made.\n\nSorry that you had a shitty experience. You're not alone in that. But your shitty experience doesn't mean higher education is pointless. \n\nI hope you find something that fulfills you.",

But instead, figure out what you want to do for a job, and if getting a degree will help you get that job, or will make you more money in that job, then do it. Otherwise, just go get that job. Who cares about a degree?",

Got to be a facility director at a small University got lots of experience being project manager on three different construction projects on campus. Now I'm looking to leave the University, but since I have no paper, like you do. I'm stuck. Experience is great but having that paper completes it. I skipped a step and regret it. You could work for 20 plus years and then realize you wasted your time because you didn't go to college.",

As a result, I had to find opportunities myself. Nor is my school a super reputable school so I had to strive for my professional experience. And I agree with creating your own purpose. You can\u2019t expect your school to do anything for you or your degree. People end up realizing that towards the end and it\u2019s already too late.",

Now that you\u2019ve learned, will you do \u201cso much more\u201d next time; or do all that more stuff now, with all your newly found freedom as a recent graduate?\n\nDo you actually feel bad for those underclassmen, or just soothing yourself for something you did that was not true to yourself? It\u2019s easy to build a pedestal out of thoughts, because it doesn\u2019t require any work and heavy lifting outside the mind.\n\nTime isn\u2019t wasted because it\u2019s an investment, and you\u2019ll know the pay off when whatever old dream or era in your life is over. Maybe the pay off is knowing how bad it can get when you\u2019re not yourself, or maybe it\u2019s finding out what really is meaningful to you! You\u2019d have to figure out meaning eventually, and you\u2019ll have to figure it out again sometime later too, so what\u2019s so wrong about learning something new anyways? 4 years is only 4% of a 100-year lifetime and in America, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll live that long!",
