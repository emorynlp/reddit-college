Action?", "text": "My college (expensive, private) is forcing me to quarantine 10 days after I received a false positive COVID-19 test result. I'm fully vaccinated and have zero symptoms, so I was a little bit suspect and decided to get tested at home.\n\nI've been tested four times: 1 rapid test, 1 PCR test (both at my local Urgent Care), and 2 at home Quickvue tests. All 4 came back negative.\n\nMy school however will not accept any of these negative tests, and is forcing me to miss about a week and a half of classes that I am paying an exorbitant amount of money for, most of which have no hybrid or online component that I can participate in (only 2 of 5 have recorded lectures).\n\nWhat is my course of action? Do I just suck it up? This seems incredibly stupid and I will most likely fall behind on course work (I'm a first semester freshman) because the school won't accept my negative test results. It's not about money, but I am definitely paying way too much to not be able to participate in my classes.", "author": "SpecificRush8122", "created": 1632418145, "retrieved": 1632946107, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "comments": {"he11ca2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu08ou/school_forcing_me_to_quarantine_10_days_over_a/he11ca2/", "text": "I\u2019m very sorry this is happening to you.
