  "text": "I messed up my essay to submit for English. I couldn\u2019t even meet the extension deadline because every time I try to write i start crying and keep re reading sentences just to not understand. I feel so immature for this and childish. It\u2019s not like this with my other classes I got As in their assignments. But I\u2019m lost and even skipped this class because Im embarrassed. I just dont want to fail but I\u2019m doing everything to fail.",
