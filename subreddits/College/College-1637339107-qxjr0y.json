  "text": "Okay so long story short, I\u2019m in my late 20\u2019s and have been out of studies for just over a decade. My health is slowly getting to where I\u2019m getting control of my life again.. anyway I want to try to get enrolled in a school for spring semester and am having anxiety about taking the accuplacer because I feel so far behind. I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to catch my self up so I don\u2019t derp out. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks!",
