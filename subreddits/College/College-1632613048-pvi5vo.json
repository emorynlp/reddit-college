When it comes to my math class I find myself being unmotivated to do the assignments and study. I sit down and start working on some problems then I end up giving up on it. I think it comes down to me not being interested in the subject even though I need to take this class. Any advice on how to get over this? I want to do my best and get a decent grade. I have never really liked math so this has been a struggle for me :(", "author": "ShyCoconut0_0", "created": 1632613048, "retrieved": 1632800288, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heb6aei": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvi5vo/ever_felt_unmotivated_in_one_of_your_classes/heb6aei/", "text": "Happened alot", "author": "diarreahquestion", "created": 1632631796, "upvotes": 1}}}
