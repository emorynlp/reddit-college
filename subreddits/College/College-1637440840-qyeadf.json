  "text": "Hello all! \n\nIt's that time of the semester, procrastination is high and motivation is low and as a result I am just now beginning a project due in a week and a half :)\n\nFor my project, my group and I are tasked with creating a business plan, we call it *Without borders: connect with family without the small talk,* the idea is that we are uber eats/amazon for international goods that are difficult to obtain in your home country. \n\nThe reason this came about is one of our members is Polish, and she likes a specific deodorant that doesn't have aluminum and it's on a roll ball. She can't easily purchase these without major upticks in pricing, or she has to call her family and ask them to ship it, and we all know with the holidays rolling around how family can be\n\nWith that being said, we need to have 30 respondents for a survey, showing the viability of this idea.\n\nIf you would feel so inclined to lend me less than 5 minutes of your day, we would greatly appreciate it \n\n[Here is the survey!](https://forms.gle/cMNWhXF8WCAjRDvT9)\n\np.s no pressure, I only graduate in 2 weeks :)",
