  "text": "I am planning to go to college but I don\u2019t know if I want to go to a small school vs big school. Smallest school would be 4,000 highest would be 25,000. I feel like going to a small school would be high school 2.0 and it would be hard to find someone because of the size. Does anyone have any experience when they decided?",

      "text": "I went to a small school and loved it. Honestly, with a big school, you only encounter people in your own major/classes/dorm/fraternity/club anyways. So the actual number will be much lower. \n\nIf you are looking to make meaningful connection with people, it\u2019s much easier when you see them more often. \n\nThere are other trade offs of course.",

      "text": "For context, my university has over 30,000 students.\n\nGoing to a larger college was one of the best choices I've ever made. Maybe it's because I grew up in a super small school (like, graduating class around 60), but going to a big university allowed me to grow so much into myself. I wasn't as afraid to take risks as I was in high school, because I knew that my actions weren't being micro-managed by everyone around me. (By risks, I mean like talk in class, answer questions, ask questions, etc.) I could be myself without being afraid of what other people would say, because even though gossip still exists, it's no where near where it was in my small high school. I felt like I could be me for the first time in my life, even when things got super hard. \n\nIn terms of community, I found my people over time. COVID didn't help, but I did encounter some of the same people in class after class because of my major and classes. I got an on-campus job and have some friends that way. More than anything, I pursued an interest of mine--D&D--and found some of my best friends ever. I even ended up dating one of them, who I've been with for over a year now). \n\nI won't lie, college hasn't always been easy. There have been hard times for sure. But I don't think I would be as well off now if I had gone to a smaller school.",

      "text": "A small college will have 1 main cafeteria, and maybe a coffee shop. It's easy to just run into someone you know to eat with, but there will be fewer food options. A large campus will have dining halls and cafes all over. It will take some effort on your part to meet someone at the same place and time. It's going to depend on your personality which is the best fit. It's the same with clubs and activities.",
