  "title:": "Does anybody else have a major that\u2019s niche or has a very small class size?",
  "text": "I\u2019m studying meteorology and the undergrad student body for my major is small enough to easily fit in a high school sized classroom (~25 people). Majors like computer science are easily an order of magnitude larger than the meteorological department. It\u2019s a double edged sword as it\u2019s nice to have a small pool of professors that are passionate about the subject, but it\u2019s a nightmare scheduling classes as almost everything is offered once a year with only one time slot. Covid messed up my schedule, so it\u2019s been extremely difficult to work out a schedule where I will finish on time, as taking an extra semester isn\u2019t an option due to the spring/fall exclusivity issue.",
