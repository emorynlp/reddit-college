  "text": "Hi I wanted to TA for a professor and he said I could anytime, informally. I asked last week in email and he said \u201cthe class will have exams the next two weeks\u201d. I assume that I can\u2019t TA for those weeks, but he never mentioned that I could TA after those exams are done. I would really want to TA but don\u2019t want to pester if he doesn\u2019t actually want me to TA. Do you think he\u2019ll email me after the exams are over to let me know I can TA then? I doubt it, and am contemplating giving up on the idea of TAing for him since he sent that email that didn\u2019t seem too keen on me TAing or even expressing interest in me TAing after the exams are over for his class.",
