I\u2019m not sure if I will be able to afford out of state because even with a low efc my brother still has to loan 5k. The tuition for out of state college insane. \n\nIf you were low income, did your financial aid cover everything including housing?",

      "text": "Cost of attendance for out of state schools are usually upwards of $20k/year. The Pell grant max (given to those with an EFC of 0) is only about $5-6k meaning it probably wont cover all costs of attendance. You will either have to take out loans and/or check if the school provides need based scholarships or consider community college.",

I\u2019m an out of state student because I got so much financial aid from my school that it actually made it way cheaper than any of the in state schools I got accepted to. I am planning on transferring so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be like that at my next school. I would definitely recommend looking at schools in surrounding states to see if they have a border state discount.",

      "text": "You can apply to them and see if they offer you any financial aid packages but, I would say 90% of the time, out of state is about 3x-5x more expensive than in state. 5k in loans isn\u2019t too bad. Rule of thumb is to not take more loans out than what you expect to make your first year. \n\nSo if you expect to make 40K Your first year working, try to take out less than that in loans. Of course, the least amount of loans you can take out the better. Sometimes that means commuting instead of dorming.",
