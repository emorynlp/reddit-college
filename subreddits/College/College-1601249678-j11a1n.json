  "title:": "Is anyone else who has classes fully online right now having trouble focusing on classwork?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve had partial online classes before, and it was nice to be able to go to class, relax a bit, and then figure out a time later to just work on online work. Now, with a fully online course load, it seems so much harder to focus on all the things I have to do, as it feels so disorganized compared to going and sitting in a class for an hour and a half, taking notes, and then leaving. Along with that, due to not being able to go out because of corona, it\u2019s felt like my main source of entertainment is playing games, so I spend most of my time whether it\u2019s homework related or entertainment on a screen. Has anyone else felt the same and have you found any solutions to the slump in motivation from feeling stuck in one place?",

I cant even listen to my headphones during this time.\n\nAnd of course there was screaming my first day of classes last week. I missed the deadline for my first assignment.",

If this is what college is about, I really, really despise it.  \nI have a 1,000 word paper due for college composition tomorrow morning, and I'm just so tired and uninterested that I can't do it tonight. (I'm only writing this as a part of my obligatory daily reddit fix)  \n\n\nI cannot stand this method of \"education\" if that is what you want to call it..  I can and have learned more binge watching documentaries on Netflix about subjects that are interesting and actually have value in our world.   \n\n\nI have been fighting a goddamned war with severe depression and anxiety since the 6th grade (thanks public schools) and college just made it SO much worse. 6 weeks ago I went from mildly world weary and poor 26 year old, with half of their shit figured out, to actively severely stressed out, depressed cunt..\n\nI'm leaving college when the semester is done and I have no idea what might be next, but I can guarantee you that even sudden limb loss by landmine would be more interesting and worthwhile than continuing with this absolute drivel and rubbish that they call higher education. From what I've seen, it is nothing but intensive grammar school instruction with pretentious posturing and neo-liberal elitist culture. \n\nI am seriously flabbergasted that people ACTUALLY pay for this horse shit... People go into DEBT for this?",

      "text": "I have been doing full online for a while, and here's basically what I have had to do:\n\nSet a class time.  I know that sounds obvious, but it took me a while to get around to it. I would just sort of peek at the modules/calendar and note when things were due. This backfired on me, because it told my brain it was okay to wait since I had x amount of days and that it was plenty of time. This often resulted in my turning in things last minute because I waited so long and then had to frantically dash to get it done because I didn't have a visual deadline for myself. \n\nInstead, now I look at when assigned dates for each class and when they are mostly due and then assign myself \"lecture\" time to listen/watch what the professor has posted, or read the assignments. It helps me to just record myself reading out loud, and then I can listen back to it to sort of lecture myself and scribble in my notes the information that seems pivotal.  If you need to, look at the schedule of a previous term you have attended, note how many days you normally sat for a class, and the length. Set alarms/mark calendars, etc to remind yourself you have class. \n\nDon't deviate from the schedule unless it's a legit reason! It becomes way too easy to start losing the structure you gave yourself. \n\nPut your phone away. Close all other webpages, apps, etc. Set your phone timer to the assigned class time you gave yourself.  There are several apps that sort of cater to cutting you off on your phone until your timer goes off.  \n\nI know these seem like obvious things, but it's literally the only way I have been able to balance college with my ADHD. I'm someone that is always good at being on time for things appointment wise due to anxiety, so it probably won't be much help much if you're someone that's late frequently. As much as I always fought restrictions when I was younger, structure really is a good way to handle things without getting overwhelmed by our own brains.",

SEPARATE WORK SPACES. If possible, try to have one place where you take classes and one place where you study. This helps to create a mental separation and two different focus modes\n\n2. HOBBIE DIVERSITY. I absolutely love to play games but I found that if I play in my down time, next time I'm in class I will be thinking about the game. What I try to do is play some phone games (recently I have been playing Among Us with my brother on my phone), read, exercise and try new stuff (cooking, painting and photography have been my new best friends)\n\n3. SELF CARE. I have suffered from a burn out more times than I can count so what I try to do is save a day (or half a day, usually it's Sunday afternoon) where I do absolutely nothing. And I mean nothing. I just lay on the couch watching TV or reading and sometimes napping\n\nI know these aren't much but I hope it helps!",

Your brain will begin to associate that time, area, and desktop with school and it will help you to stay focused.\n\nAlso, keep your phone far away from wherever you are and block social media websites for however long your need to work(I used to have a plugin that did that, but I forgot what it\u2019s called) so you don\u2019t have more distractions.",

I always left the room the entire day and moved throughout campus as I did work. I think I felt motivated to do work because everyone else was also doing work and accountability played a role too. I couldn't just lay down and get on Reddit bc you know I was out in public.\n\nAnyways, I joined a virtual library where there's students from all over the world which ensures there's someone there at any time of the day. It's been incredibly helpful. I'm now on top of all the video lectures and sometimes even get ahead  \ud83d\ude0f\n\nMy next step is to hopefully start working out to help my lower back pain from sitting all damn day. \n\nHere's the link to the discord server I'm using: https://discord.gg/WsVaXFG",

It's just because I'm too busy busting my ass at a factory just to live through the pandemic along with several crucial certification courses to ensure that I never have to slave and get hurt at manual labor jobs ever again and with such a busy workload, it becomes so hard to even focus. \n\nLike, this teacher is hard but he is actually a fair and kind and really stand-up guy. I hate the fact that I'm letting him down by being such an utter failure.\n\nIf this were an in-person class, I would nail this. However, it's not and I'm failing unfortunately.",
