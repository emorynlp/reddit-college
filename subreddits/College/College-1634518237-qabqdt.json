  "text": "I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice. I\u2019m so stressed in school and I keep skipping my classes because I have no motivation to go. Spring semester is coming up and my advisors have told me to take a bunch of really hard classes. I don\u2019t see a way it\u2019s possible for me to handle all of the stress. I\u2019m a junior so I\u2019ve kinda ran out of the easier classes I can take.\n\nCollege is just making me so depressed and hopeless. What do I do?",

      "text": "It sounds like you are burnt out, if I were in your situation, I would do the following things.\n\n1. **Take a breather**, chew some gum, find some time to sit down, and go over your plans and really think about what you want to do with yourself. Weigh your options out, don't walk into things without an idea of what to expect.\n2. **Time management**, if there is one thing college is good at, it is exposing peoples' lack of time management. What I do is at one point in my semester, I plan out my next semester so that I can meet my advisor prepared and with an idea of what to expect during the following semester. Any downtime you have throughout your day, take advantage and get things done. Get assignments done early so that you have more time, later on, to focus on studying or other assignments or even relaxing. Avoid procrastination at all costs. Give yourself time to be flexible. \n3. **Work hard**, but don't push yourself overboard. Don't become lazy, but give yourself time to relax and do things you enjoy whether that be reading, video games, friends, etc. If you have good time management, you can find time for this. Don't follow the \"rise and grind and struggle\" non-sense, it causes burnout. If you are like me, I get frustrated with assignments so I walk away and come back later, but since I don't procrastinate, I am able to do that and become more productive since I have time.\n4. **Plan ahead** and always have a plan. The more prepared you are for the future and the more prepared you are for the next day, week, or even month, the more confident you will become. Don't let that confidence turn you lazy, but it will reduce a lot of stress you may have, it reduces the ability to overthink things and to doubt yourself.\n5. **Take care of yourself** physically and mentally, make sure you are eating, exercising, getting a good night's sleep. \n6. **Don't let the short term ruin you**, think long term and set long-term goals that are realistic. If you fail a test, stay positive, find out why you failed and ace the next test. It is okay to fail, but so long as you learn, develop, and grow from it.\n\nI know it's long, but this is all the advice I can think of, I hope this helps you out!",
