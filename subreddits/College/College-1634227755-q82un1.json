  "text": "I've been miserable the past year dealing with the college admissions process.  You can check out my post history for details, but the TL;DR is that I was abused as a child in a way that precluded me from being a high achiever in high school.  The best school I got accepted into was my safety, UNC, but I wasn't given any scholarships because of my performance.  I had middling ECs, a good test score (35 on the ACT) and a low GPA for the level I was competing at (3.86 UW).\n\nIt's made me feel contempt for my college.  I'm surrounded by peers who were given scholarships because the school values them more.  UNC views me as being deserving of becoming a debtor to line their endowment, and nothing more.  But I didn't apply to any less-selective schools that likely would have given me more money.  Likely it was due to my mental health.  I was dealing with a lot of trauma last fall and the isolation from COVID-19 didn't help anything. \n\nAnd the worst part is, I can't even transfer out.  I can't undo the $15k I took out for this year, much less get scholarships to transfer to cheaper schools because those are reserved for freshman and just don't exist.  My mental health for the next few months is hinging entirely on me getting enough scholarships to pay for all of school for next year, and then the years after.  And, of course, that's always way harder to do once you've started college.\n\nBut in the meantime, I'm miserable.  I'm angry that my school values people who didn't deal with half the shit I did more solely because they had opportunities I didn't.  It's making my mental health even worse, because along with dealing with the trauma from my childhood on its own, I have to live with the knowledge that I'm **still being hurt by it** because of how much debt I'm in.\n\nMy only recourse is that maybe by going to UNC, the fact that it's a \"better school\" than any that would have given me financial aid will help me make more money to justify the higher cost.  But that might not even matter because my major is CS.  I don't like being angry, and I don't like holding nothing but contempt for my school, but I also know they think I'm a worthless piece of shit.\n\nI need scholarships.  And therapy.",

      "text": "Well, what is the expected amount of loans you are going to take over four years at UNC? Their stated tuition is around $9k and the total estimated cost for four years, including living expenses, is around $96k. \n\nThe general rule of thumb is not taking out more loans than your expected starting salary. For CS you can assume that is around $70k. If you can get out with under $35k in loans I would call that reasonable. Are you doing FAFSA, looking over state aid, and taking the tax credits? Have you met with a financial advisor and are you using federal loans?\n\nYou do need therapy. I think you would be much happier if someone helped you walk through these emotions and build self-respect. It's completely normal for a lot of students to go through the issues you are talking about.",

I'm paying full price whether I want to or not so I need to either somehow reduce the cost that UNC charges or get outside aid.  That money needs to be paid and I don't have a source to pull from to bring it down aside from the 2 aforementioned ones.\n\nTo bring down the cost, I've done a couple of things. I'm currently on the cheapest meal plan and am planning on going without one next semester. I'm also trying to become an RA to save on room and board as a sophomore-> onwards.\n\nTo get scholarships, I'm... Applying for scholarships.  This is where my well-being is predicated.  I don't see myself being happy unless this works out. And, as I mentioned, the odds are stacked against me, which only worsens my mental state.\n\nI'm seeing a psychiatrist Wednesday.",

              "text": "\"I'm also trying to become an RA to save on room and board as a sophomore-> onwards.\"\n\nI can't see how you would need to take loans totaling more than the expected yearly salary figure as is. But especially if you are doing this. I was guessing your total loan amount would be something like $8-10k/yr going forward.\n\nCan you explain exactly how much you are projecting to take out in loans and how you got to that figure? It looks like you are getting really worked up over what might not actually be that bad of a situation. You are working with much higher costs than you have seen before as a kid, so you have to remember to contextualize it. You can take on this investment (treat it as an investment, seriously) using lower-interest federal loans and graduate into a job making $30-35k more than you would have without the degree. The difference in salary should make up for lost income during college, cost of college, and financing cost (the interest on the loans) within maybe 5-7 years. Probably less if you get a promotion or bonuses, which is likely over a period like 5 years. You'll be able to pay off the loans themselves in just a few years if you continue to live on a student budget. \n\nThe biggest risk factor here is graduating and being job-ready. I would much sooner be concerned about your mentality toward college and self-confidence than student loans. However... if dropping out with debt concerns you, know that if you stick with federal loans you won't go into a situation where you cannot afford to pay. You would be able to pay 10% of your discretionary income, not much, and have it forgiven after 20 years. That is the absolute worst case scenario if you stick to federal loans.\n\nI recently got worked up over a health situation. I knew the facts in my head but even then I was still worked up because sometimes our minds jump to worst-case scenario mode. So in addition to the psychiatrist, I really want you to make an appointment with financial aid and have them walk you through estimating the total cost as well as your strategy for handling the cost.",
