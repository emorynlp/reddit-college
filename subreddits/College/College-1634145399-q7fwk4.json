  "text": "College is literally going to be the death of me. I already went into college extremely depressed with extremely bad anxiety disorder and it only gets worse every day. Im a bio major, switching to chem and when i say i have 6 hours of fucking homework thats the minimum per day. Every single day at this fucked place i wake up, go to class, come home around 5pm and do homework non stop until i finish or pass out around 1-3am. Im only a sophomore and if the rest of college is really like this id easily rather but a bullet in my head. Im physically and mentally trying my hardest and my grades are still bad. Im not going to drop out unless i have a good plan which i really want to. I just dont know what to do anymore one day im just not going to be able to take it and blow my brains out",

Seriously, in 20 years no one will care about your college gpa.  Be sure to tap into counselors and school mentors to figure out a path that makes sense for you.",
