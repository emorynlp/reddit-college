  "text": "College is literally going to be the death of me. I already went into college extremely depressed with extremely bad anxiety disorder and it only gets worse every day. Im a bio major, switching to chem and when i say i have 6 hours of fucking homework thats the minimum per day. Every single day at this fucked place i wake up, go to class, come home around 5pm and do homework non stop until i finish or pass out around 1-3am. Im only a sophomore and if the rest of college is really like this id easily rather but a bullet in my head. Im physically and mentally trying my hardest and my grades are still bad. Im not going to drop out unless i have a good plan which i really want to. I just dont know what to do anymore one day im just not going to be able to take it and blow my brains out",

Seriously, in 20 years no one will care about your college gpa.  Be sure to tap into counselors and school mentors to figure out a path that makes sense for you.",

I just ask and ask and ask until someone agrees to meet with me, commiserating with others helps you lessen the workload and realize you\u2019re not alone. Plus working with others can help you retain knowledge easier and give you something to look forward to instead of your desk at home.",

      "text": "What kind of work do you want to do?  Really dig deep and figure out what you really want to do.  Then focus on doing that.  Either way you will have to do stuff you hate to do.  But at least you will have that goal in front of you.  There are many paths to take to attain a goal. You can start down a path and correct as you go, but there is always going to be some dreadful bs to contend with along the way.  It doesn\u2019t stop when you\u2019re out in the marketplace as well. You always need to take action, measure results and adjust accordingly.\n\nReach out to anyone who has gone through your program and get some mentors.  Many people before you in worse situations have overcome these slumps.  Seek them out and use their knowledge to help you navigate and reduce your load wherever possible.",
