  "text": "hi everyone apologies for the weird post and formatting i\u2019m on mobile and this also just sort of popped into my head. i\u2019m a sophomore in college and i\u2019ve realized that ever since school started all i\u2019ve been doing during the week is going to campus for class and to study in between classes. occasionally i\u2019ll meet with a friend for lunch, but i haven\u2019t really met that many people in my classes either. i usually just head back to my dorm after classes... and feel strangely unfulfilled?? i am trying to get involved through clubs but most of the ones i am in only meet once or twice a month. i just feel like i should be doing more? does anyone else feel this way?",
