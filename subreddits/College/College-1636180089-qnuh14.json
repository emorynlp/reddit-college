Like others have said, it\u2019s really nice to be able to write on the PowerPoints. You can also easily switch the colors you are writing with if you like to color code. You can also view all of your ebooks on it. You also don\u2019t need to carry a bunch of notebooks, pens, and highlighters. Since all of my textbooks are ebooks, all I bring to class is my iPad (and Apple Pencil, but I bought an iPad case that has a slot for the pencil so they are always together), some notebook paper (in case we need it for in-class activities), and a pencil/pen. I don\u2019t even need a backpack. It\u2019s so nice. Best decision I\u2019ve made in a long time lol.",

I still print out my notes and some other stuff around test time sometimes because for some reason i get overwhelmed if it\u2019s all on the iPad, weird I know. Only down side I think is that an iPad needs to be charged. The new iPad 9th gen is the same as the 8th (one I have) but you get twice the storage for the same base price if you want the cheapest one.",

Also, I tend to get headaches from looking at electronics, and I wouldn't want to stare at a device for any longer than I already have to. Then again, it really just depends on your situation. Do you have the extra money to spend? Is paper and a laptop working fine for you now? I know ipads can be really helpful for some people, but I also know people who bought one thinking that it would instantly improve their grades (and it didn\u2019t). I would recommend starting the quarter without one and seeing how it goes. A couple weeks later, if you\u2019re still thinking that it would be a good investment in your education, I say go ahead and get one if you can afford it",

Notability is like $10 and for an additional $2 it makes your handwritten notes searchable (like type in \u201cproductivity\u201d and it will find that word in all your notes even though they are handwritten). It\u2019s definitely saved me time and effort just with that feature. You don\u2019t have to go for the Apple Pencil, there are a few different pens on Amazon that work and they often have cheaper replacement tips (I do have the pencil and my fianc\u00e9 has a off brand one, so I will admit I\u2019ve never changed the pencil tip but my fianc\u00e9 has changed his repeatedly. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s actually cheaper in the long run because of this). You can also order a matte screen protector that makes the iPad feel like your writing on actual paper but it does wear your tips out (I\u2019ve been using the same tip for two years with that protector though so\u2026). Also the notability app lets you doodle in your notes which is scientifically proven to increase the memorization of information (when the doodles pertain to the notes. Like we were talking about orthodoxy and wedding traditions in Greece in one class, so I doodled all the different components that goes into those traditions and I didn\u2019t need to look up those notes once). Plus I can game between classes, which is nice. The battery of both the iPad and pencil are pretty sturdy so I usually just plug the iPad in at night and plug the pencil into the iPad on my drive to school. The pencil charges super fast and I usually don\u2019t even need to charge it everyday",

I used to forget my notebooks but now all of them are in one spot and it\u2019s a lot easier to color code notes now. I used to get anxious that I\u2019d fill up my notebook before I finished a class so I\u2019d try to cram as much as I could onto one page when I used paper. My notes are much neater now that I don\u2019t worry about space. In my circuits class we end up redrawing the diagrams often so I enjoy that I can just copy and paste my previous drawing. \n\nI also like when I can get textbooks on it so I don\u2019t have to carry them around or go home to do my homework with them.",

I have a hard time even now as a junior in college with all of the paper I\u2019ve used to take notes (I\u2019ve almost filled up an entire 3 subject notebook for one class so far) and I would absolutely love to buy myself an iPad and Apple Pencil in the future.",

I got my textbooks as ebooks and to study I\u2019ll read the ebook (or watch lectures, zooms) on my iPad and type on my laptop. Sooo much easier than doing a split screen and not having to carry around a bunch of books.",
