Or am I frying my brain every semester for straight A\u2019s for nothing significant to come of it?\n\nAnyways, if anybody knows how straight A\u2019s in college benefits you let me know, or if it\u2019s actually completely pointless let me know. I\u2019ve been told most my life that straight A\u2019s is so important and gives you better opportunities and chances and gets you into higher paying careers but I don\u2019t know how\u2026\u2026", "author": "rinkinky", "created": 1632742200, "retrieved": 1632945570, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"hei2h59": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwf2xx/does_a_40_gpa_in_college_and_being_in_honors/hei2h59/", "text": "It doesn't mean much in the \"real world\", but if you're looking to transfer to a 4 year school then it'll definitely help!

A very high GPA will impress some prospective employers, but your college major, relevant work experience, and soft skills generally matter more. An applicant with a 3.3 GPA and some relevant work experience from an internship or co-op will typically be considered a stronger applicant than someone with a 3.9 GPA but no relevant work experience. Having an in-demand major also matters a great deal, so your job options with a 3.3 GPA and a mechanical engineering or accounting degree will be better than your job options with a 3.9 GPA and a history or psychology degree. \n\nFinally, your college GPA also stops mattering much at all once you have a few years of professional work experience, because at that point it's your work experience and skills that matter to prospective employers, and not your college performance.", "author": "clearwaterrev", "created": 1632752208, "upvotes": 1}, "hegny5k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwf2xx/does_a_40_gpa_in_college_and_being_in_honors/hegny5k/", "text": "I think it helps you stand out, but companies have their min GPA requirements and tbh that\u2019s all they are really looking for to weed out the the applicants. \n\nMind you, colleges *love* their honor societies and alumni also love to brag about them years after they\u2019ve graduated, so it does help on the connection front. \n\nIt\u2019s just not the end of the world if you don\u2019t have all As.", "author": "rudumbdumb", "created": 1632744667, "upvotes": 4}}}
