  "text": "I currently major in business with a concentration in finance. I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT. I can\u2019t talk to my professor in my state school because they just kinda laugh at how late I declared my major (end of sophomore year) and how I\u2019m behind everyone else in the program. I don\u2019t feel like I connect with anyone in my major either because they all seem snobbish. I\u2019m thinking on just switching to marketing because the classes I have to take are interesting to me. What do you guys think?",
