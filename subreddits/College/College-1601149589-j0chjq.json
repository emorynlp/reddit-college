I paid for all of these and still dropped them since I felt I was fighting to keep my grades up and was basically teaching myself all the material.

She made it clear in the revised online syllabus that this was optional and wasn't meant to be exactly like our in-person discussions were where we'd have a planned conversation structure, but to genuinely *discuss* the material - any questions we had, if we thought it was really cool or upsetting or reminded us of this new TV show we just started. If we didn't have as much to say about the class stuff, we'd just chat about what we'd been up to the past week. This was in the early stages of quarantine, which soon became a long, painful stretch, and it was really beneficial to know I had people who were looking forward to seeing me and hearing from me once a week.\n\nSome students may want opportunities for more personal engagement with *each other* (and maybe you too!). It may feel weird to do that within a professional/academic scope, but maybe something like an \"open chat hour\" in addition to formal discussion/office hours.

Our homework and quizzes then cover that material, and when we say \"I still don't really understand how to do *x*, can you show or post a more detailed example?\" he says it was covered in the lecture video and if we've watched that, we'll understand how to do it. Know what's covered in your async material!!! It's fine to reuse old materials, absolutely, but make sure they're covering and teaching what you think they do!

Please don't use invasive online proctors. They just add extra stress to the students. For example, my university uses Proctorio and have had a great number of issues. Proctorio cuts out mid-test, fails all of the students, and leaves professors with the mess. Proctorio says people with ADHD or anxiety or the like are cheating due to more eye and head movements. There is some evidence that Proctorio has trouble with anti-blue light glasses and even students with darker skin tones.

Asynchronous classes are a dream come true. Some of the things I really enjoy are:\n\n* Only necessary assignments are due. In some classes this might just be exams and quizzes, whereas others have 2-3 assignments a week. On the flipside, I have had classes where assignments were due out of the textbook every single day and that was a worse experience than just taking an in-person class. Most of those assignments were filler or just intended to track whether you were reading or not. ^(*One of my classes used a custom-made online textbook that literally tracked how many pages you read and how much time you spent on each page. There were checkpoints you had to reach every day and minimum requirements for time spent on a page. That was painful.*) I'm 22, not 14. If I fail to keep up with the reading, it will be evident on the exam.\n\n* Intuitive discussion boards. Discussion boards are way better for class discussion for me since I'm not very assertive in-person, but if the discussions involve meeting minimum word counts or following certain formats, then it gets to be a pain. If a student is capable of answering the question in 50 words but the professor requires 200 words, then the question should be more complex. As for formats and sources - if the discussion board is intended as a submission destination for formal work, then that is one thing, but trying to have discussions with other students with formal requirements is a headache. \n\n* Regular contact from the professor. I think at least a weekly email with assignments due, what is expected on the reading, updates on course material etc. is the best, but sometimes the engagement from multiple emails a week is nice. I think if the emails come less than once per week I start to forget about the class a little bit. \n\n* Flexible reading. My favorite online classes have just offered up the material and made it clear that it's the student's responsibility to get through it before the exam. Other than that, the student chooses when to read, in what order to read (insofar as the material is concurrent), etc. \n\n* Opportunity for extra engagement. Sometimes if I have a class I really enjoy, I like to try things at a higher level than what is required for the class. Before COVID I would go to office hours to talk to professors but now that's not an option, so some courses have offered zoom office hours which is nice.\n\n* Prerecorded lectures over zoom lectures. Zoom is nice for two-way engagement but I prefer going through a lecture purely as a listener. I find it easier to take in all of the material at once instead of getting sidetracked with questions and digressions.

After class office hours: wait 10-20 minutes until after the class ends, then hold open office hours without people having to make an appointment. That way, with the 20 minute buffer, people won\u2019t just hang behind because, they will wait and come back because they have a question they would like to ask you. \n\n2. Having a question at the end of discussion: one of my professors requires that we come up, as students, with a question at the end of each of our discussion answers to engage other students and responses due at least two are mandated. \n\n3. Uploading the lecture PDF or slides: if you pre-record lessons, this is something I highly recommend. Personally, I do well in in person lectures so long as I can engage the lecturer: if there is nothing for me to do to engage, that I lose a bit of interest due to how much longer a lecture takes than reading: thus, for this reason, I highly prefer the professor to upload the PDF or slides of the presentation so that I can use that and then have a complimentary with the lecture. \n\n4. This one might seem small, but it would be very helpful to someone like me: include your video and microphone policy for in class in the syllabus. I am always torn between wanting to make a connection with the professor as if we were in the classroom and also not leave them alone as the only video broadcaster, but on the other hand, have been in situations where - for unspecified reasons - the professors felt uncomfortable with their students leaving videos on. If the latter is the case, I would like to know beforehand. Most universities cannot require that students have their video on, however, it would be nice to know the professors preference for their classroom. \n\n5. Video discussions: Assignments requiring you to make a speech or analysis on camera to submit as a discussion; those are incredibly fun, in my opinion, As it allows us to get a little creative and maybe go to film at a special location away from people, use visual aids, etc. \n\nGood luck to you - I hope that you and those around you stay well", "author": "al_the_time", "created": 1601163921, "upvotes": 28}, "g6quq3b": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j0chjq/what_have_your_best_online_classes_done/g6quq3b/", "text": "Make videos of them actually explaining the material/assignment/project and then allowing us to message her with any questions or problems anytime of the day.

Even if I were able to make them, I've heard lots of complaints about live questions derailing the lectures so that the professor cannot finish all the content they had lined up for the day.\n\nIn all, I dislike any form of mandatory meeting, because people have had to change their schedules drastically after losing jobs and trying to find new ones, and the beauty of online learning is that you can rewatch lectures and other learning content before you ask questions. This helps students get answers more immediately, and prevent professors from getting overwhelmed with questions. I don't think that any live sessions should take attendance either, because it simply doesn't make sense to do so. Since there aren't scheduled class times posted before enrollment (at least at my school), you could end up with scheduling conflicts even if you were normally available during the time that the live sessions occur. I think the best option is to do live sessions and post recordings of the session afterwards, so that you satisfy both sides. Of course, I still prefer pre-recorded and focused videos, but I'm perfectly willing to settle for recordings of live sessions because some people want to have them live. Also, I prefer asynchronous because I learn much faster than most students and like to stay ahead, but I'm fine with synchronous classes as long as the assignments for the next week are posted ahead of time.", "author": "para_lyzed", "created": 1601156105, "upvotes": 6}, "g6q863a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j0chjq/what_have_your_best_online_classes_done/g6q863a/", "text": "Best is subjective, but for me:\n\n-They\u2019re all synchronous and attendance is taken and mandatory \n-You can get randomly called on to answer a question\n-breakout rooms", "author": "Asleep_Seesaw", "created": 1601155028, "upvotes": -5}, "g6q1v4m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j0chjq/what_have_your_best_online_classes_done/g6q1v4m/", "text": "Best one for me was surprisingly an asynchronous class last semester, but my professor was amazing. She would upload videos of her lectures online and would make written outlines for us to study. In addition, our two scheduled class times were optional zoom sessions where we could show up to ask questions about the material, basically office hours. Then she would hold an additional office hours during the week if we needed it. It was a ton of work on her end, but I really appreciated it.\n\nWe also posted on discussion boards based on the lectures and took multiple choice quizzes based on the readings. All in all, she put so much effort into maintaining structure in the class and forcing us to actively engage with the material, but it never felt like she expected too much. I also liked that she kept up constant communication with us and took our advice into consideration when making changes to the curriculum.", "author": "discodolphin1", "created": 1601152906, "upvotes": 210}, "g6pv8j2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j0chjq/what_have_your_best_online_classes_done/g6pv8j2/", "text": "Best one for me had online discussions where we upload a video to explain case study/concept  over answering multiple discussion boards.
