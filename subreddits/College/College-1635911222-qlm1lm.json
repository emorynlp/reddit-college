  "text": "I got a linear algebra midterm which I\u2019ve studied for somewhat but still fuzzy about concepts and it\u2019s been a shit show on these practice questions. The exam is at 9. Should I pull an all nighter and get less sleep and study more or just sleep early and take the exam on a good nights rest banking on me remembering things?\n\nMy thought process is if I stay up until 2, I will get about 5 hours of rest. But if I sleep now, I get like 7, and then take the exam with a good nights rest, allowing me to probably remember information better.\n\nWhat do y\u2019all think?",

      "text": "Ok.. if you can't do the practice problems BUT you think that a bit more practice will help you. I would say to pull the extra hours.\n\nHowever, if you are trying to get these problems and still have issues with them after like... an hour of studding I say call it quits. Don't push yourself too much, it isn't worth the stress and the sleep loss.",
