Essentially I have a very rude, inconsiderate roommate who doesn\u2019t listen to me, gets mad at me for hanging out with my friends, and is very mean. I\u2019ve been trying to stick it out longer but at this point i feel like i\u2019m walking on eggshells when i walk into my room. This space doesn\u2019t feel like my own and i have anxiety about being in here. \nThe issue is I live on an outdoor rec living learning community floor. I love everyone on my floor, they\u2019re super sweet and friendly. I love this hall and everyone in it. I\u2019d be really sad to leave, and if I did leave the hall my only other option is single room that is $1000 more a semester. I met a girl a few doors down who\u2019s super sweet, needs a roommate, and we hit it off. I sent in a request to move in with her and she sent in a request asking me to move in too. My RA encouraged me to stay on my floor and knows i\u2019m moving, but the only issue is is that I don\u2019t know how to tell my roommate. if we\u2019ll be on the same hall I want to keep things as respectful and cordial as possible, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll take it well at all. I have no idea what to say without pretty much saying i\u2019m moving out cause shes mean. any ideas how to let her know to keep things at least somewhat less awkward in the future?", "author": "spookypeachy", "created": 1632365293, "retrieved": 1632800790, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hdxjtk9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptlx8u/how_to_tell_my_roommate_im_moving_out/hdxjtk9/", "text": "White frankly make up some excuse if you really don't want to make things awkward does the sunshine particularly bright into your room at some point in the day.\n\nLike right before sunrise or sunset you could say it's just annoying you in your moving rooms to one that has a slightly less direct path to the sun the sun that way you don't have to constantly keep the window blinds closed or something early in the morning or late at night to watch TV or something if it reflects off your television screen or your laptop screen that can be annoying for some people.\n\nOr just say you're moving rooms don't provide more information just say Hey I'm moving rooms see ya.\n\nIn general if your roommate isn't going to get another roommate that might be They might be happy about the fact that they are getting a single for the price of a double.
