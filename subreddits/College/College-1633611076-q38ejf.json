  "title:": "How bad is it to get a B in important class for your major?",
  "text": "I am a senior and already have a high gpa so a few Bs or Cs will not hurt my gpa much so I am not concerned about getting a B or C. What I am concerned about though is getting a B in a class that is very important to my major. The way this semester is looking I may be getting Bs in 2 out of my 4 classes. I just had a mid term this week and I scored an 81% on it. Now that may not sound bad however it is the lowest exam score I have received in over 2 years. The frustrating part is I didn\u2019t receive an 81% due to lack of studying / effort. I got this grade due to weird exam format ( multiple choice with strange wording and tight timelimit). So I feel that the score doesn\u2019t really reflect my knowledge well and it is frustrating. In my other class I feel that I will manage a B at best due to the professor having very unclear expectations on the exam.\n\nAnyways am I over reacting or what? I feel very discouraged getting an 81% after studying very hard. Not trying to brag but I typically score 90 and above on exams because I put in a lot of effort. I wouldn\u2019t even care about getting a B in an elective but this semester it looks like I May getting 2 Bs in my most important classes.",

If you plan on further education (grad school, med school, etc) it may sting a bit, but can probably be made up for elsewhere in your app, particularly if you're an otherwise good student and have other strengths that you can show off.",

              "text": "What's your area of study, and is your goal a master's or a PhD? I'm pretty sure that your GPA is enough to get you into a master's program in any field, tbh. For PhD, it depends a *ton* on the field. Also the tier of school you're shooting for, but PhD programs in general tend to be competitive. You definitely have a shot for PhD programs straight out of undergrad if it's a field that cares more about GPA than research, but if not you can just take a gap year or get a master's and spend that time building up research experience and setting yourself up for good recommendation letters. The B's won't be a huge hit to your app since your other grades are good, but of course it won't help either. For most programs, the lack of research and recommendations is probably going to hurt you more, tbh, but again that's field dependent.",

              "text": "A B isn't a bad grade. I think you're worrying unnecessarily. \n\nMost employers/ hiring managers know that academic success is not the same thing as professional success. You don't need to earn top grades in college to be a top performing professional after college. \n\nFrankly, unless you want to go to a very selective grad program, a very high GPA isn't even that important. Employers who care about GPA generally look for applicants with a 3.0+, or maybe a 3.5+ if they are very selective. \n\nAdditionally, your college GPA only matters when you are applying for entry-level jobs. When you have been out of college for a few years, your work experience and skills will matter much, much more than anything you accomplished in college.",

      "text": "Sorry I just have to comment again on your post because I lurked through your history and you're convinced you have a \"low\" IQ but you post here saying you have a 3.8 GPA? Like... what? Unless your school has crazy grade inflation and/or you're in a really easy major, I'm just going to put out there that I'm extremely skeptical. Are you sure you don't just have a low self-esteem problem? Unlike you, I actually have had a formal IQ test and it was pretty damn high and I still have to work my big-fat ass off to get a GPA in the same range as yours-- I'm a realist and know that most people couldn't do what I do even if they worked as hard as I do and I'm thinking maybe you need a reality check to help you realize that maybe you aren't actually dumb and there are a lot of people who couldn't do what you do even if they tried as hard as you do. \n\nSorry to be harsh, but many college students get a very skewed perspective because college students are smarter than average so when a college student is \"below average\" they are often actually still above average compared to the general population. I'm lucky enough to currently be working with a group of literal geniuses and I feel dumb as fuck every day but I'm self aware enough to realize that if you compare me to Joe Schmoe I'm in a pretty good place with regards to brain power. \n\nI also checked, and you're in a biology major. I don't buy for one minute that a biology major with a 3.8 GPA has a \"low\" IQ. I mean, it happens, I'm sure. But I think the more probable scenario is that you're much smarter than you realize and that you are perfectly capable of doing grad school and succeeding in life. \n\nAll that being said, as a biology major you'll REALLY want research experience when applying to grad school. It's harder to find opportunities after you graduate, but these opportunities do exist, so if grad school is your goal and you don't get in anywhere definitely take some time to gain experience and then try again. Research experience would boost your app significantly.",

          "text": "Hey , thanks for the feedback. I do struggle with self esteem also. It is possible I don\u2019t have a low iq but instead have a learning disability of some sort. I can do very well on memory based exams and essay / written short answer exams. There are certain exams and lab practicals I can ace while the class average is 50-60% but I believe many of those people did not put in the same time I did.  However, I would say I am below average in problem solving/ analysis. I guess you could call that fluid intelligence ( like IQ). I struggle to figure out things on my own without being shown the answer first. For this reason, I kind of have an identity crisis where I don\u2019t believe I am smart enough to succeed in grad school. In fact, that\u2019s the reason I don\u2019t have any research experience. I briefly tried volunteering in a lab but felt dumb so I ended up quitting. Another reason I don\u2019t have any research experience is because I feel it is time consuming ( time I could spend studying). I know that\u2019s a bad way to look at it, but like I said I put in a significant effort towards studying. Gpa is one of the only ways I feel like I can prove myself so that\u2019s why getting a B kind of stings, especially when I knew the material well and feel like the format held me back.",
