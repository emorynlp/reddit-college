  "text": "I have untreated adhd and I\u2019m only in two classes, both of which are online. The problem is the combination of not having classroom structure, having adhd and having to work full time have made it really difficult for me to accomplish my work. I\u2019m getting treated soon for my adhd but my grades in both classes are abysmal. \n\nIn English I have a 0 and in math I have like a 7, plus I\u2019ve missed most of my tests and like seven classes. Should I just drop out and Reenroll once I\u2019m getting help, if I do that what will my current grade do to my future grades? Or should I just get as much work done as I can and try to bring my grades up a little bit and just retake the classes again?\n\nI currently go to the only community college in my area but it\u2019s one of the top ones in the country, I\u2019m not really sure how to handle this situation and the stress of it is just making this snowball.",
