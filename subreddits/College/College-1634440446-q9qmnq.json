  "text": "I've failed my CS course, bc of lack of motivation. Failed a class for the first time, got Cs and Ds for the first time and just overall feel awful about college rn.\n\nI do like school. Learning environments are great. I want to be successful, but idk what the hell is wrong with me. I just don't turn shit in. I just wait and wait. And sometimes idk how ppl work, do well in school, have free time, and socialize. Just wtf?\n\nI have a low GPA of 2.6, and just my god....what can I do? I feel like I gave a half hearted attempt at every class I took. Just when you have no direction, you just to float above failing I guess.\n\nIdk how to feel better about this. At the moment I have an essay due that was already extended for me that I still haven't done. I just want to be better",
