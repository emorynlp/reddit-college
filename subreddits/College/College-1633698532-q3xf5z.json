  "text": "Hello. I\u2019m a first year in college. I\u2019m decent with my work, I am not the best at it but I try my best even when I know it\u2019s wrong and turn my things in on time. \n\nMy major is sociology and I have a D in that class all because of one exam I did kind of poorly on. I studied for a whole week and even asked the professor what\u2019s a good way to study for her exams and she just shrugs her shoulders. But she also wanted a paper due on the same day as the exam. So I was really struggling to juggle on writing a paper, reading 4 different short stories, and studying the slides. \n\nI also have financial aid because my parents don\u2019t make much income even combined and I don\u2019t want to lose that. \n\nI used to never study in high school because well.. high school and college are so different now. \n\nI really need help to be less stressed and a better way to study. Especially at home because I commute(I only live 10 minutes away from my school) Thank you!",

I dogsit for my sister and I also have a part time job while attending classes(morning to afternoon) and my dad picks me up and drops me off from school so I don\u2019t have enough time on campus at all. :( I have Fridays off but they close the learning center so early. I did go there once but I didn\u2019t have enough time at all to stay.",
