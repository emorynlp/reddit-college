  "title:": "Do I retake a class I failed?",
  "text": "I am currently in MATH1296 (Calc 1) and at risk of failing. I have just struggled with transitioning to college, and have kind of accepted my fate within the class, which is my only class I am struggling in.\n\nI was originally undecided on my major, but now that I have chosen a major (finance), I no longer need credit for Calc 1. I can instead take MATH1160 (Pre-Calc) to fulfill the required math credit. \n\nSo I have 2 options;\n\n1.) Have Calc negatively affect my GPA, and instead take Pre-Calc (confident I would pass with ease).\n\n2.) Retake Calc for a better grade (not as confident I would do a ton better), which would result in my low grade being erased and no longer negatively affecting my GPA.\n\n\nAny and all advice is welcome, thanks!",
