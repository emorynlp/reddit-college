  "text": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m active duty US Air Force looking to get my bachelor\u2019s in CS while I\u2019m in, hoping to become a SWE/SWD when I get out. I\u2019m in the process of finding a college to apply to. Are there any particularly good degree programs that are 100% online? I\u2019d particularly love to hear from anyone that has gotten/is working on their degree while in the military or while working full time. \n\nI posted a [more long-winded version of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/qi3u3k/enlisted_air_force_pursuing_cs_degree_advice_on/) before if anyone cares to read it; hoping I\u2019ll get more replies if I\u2019m more straight to the point. \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated!",
