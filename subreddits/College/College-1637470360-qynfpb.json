  "text": "looking for advice here. i haven't received grades on anything for over 6 weeks in one of my classes. it's a remote class, we have multiple weekly assignments and quizzes and have had a midterm but i haven't gotten a grade back for anything. i messaged my classmates and this is happening to all of us. no one has any idea how they're doing in the class. multiple people have asked the professor and they told us they're catching up with grading (weeks ago). i know they are probably going through something but this class has been so messy. the online modules are also weirdly structured. full of incorrect due dates and broken links.    \n\nme and the rest of the class are worried because we haven't gotten any feedback. i don't think it would be fair for any of us to get a bad grade since we are well over halfway done with the term and don't know how we're doing or what we need to improve on.   \n\nhas this happened to anyone else? what can i do if i get a bad final grade? can i appeal it? i've never appealed a grade and i don't like being a shit stirrer but i'm trying to get into a competitive program and this class is a prereq so a C or D could really bone me",

      "text": "You might drop a very polite and short note to the head of the department about this.  Just say that you are a student in Dr. Smith's econ101 class (or whatever) and you are concerned that something might be wrong because he hasn't graded anything yet.  That you contacted him a few weeks back and he responded that he was just backed up however he has still yet to grade anything.  Say that several other students are concerned and you just wanted to make sure they were aware of the situation.\n\nIf anyone else tells you to contact the dean, do not do that.  The head of the department is the next rung on the chain of the command.",
