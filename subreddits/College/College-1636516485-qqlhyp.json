  "title:": "I never had girlfriend in college, I regret but I don\u2019t k ow how to fix it",
  "text": "I never had girlfriend I tried to hard to find girlfriend but in the first year of college, 1 girl that I tried to approach she left me because She asked me to study together and she used me to have good grades because I was so good in math, later I tried to approach a trainer from a course and she didn\u2019t want to me and rejected me, later I tried with another girl that I was so in the same course, and when I tried to talk with her she never answers my texts, later I tried with a friend of my group of friends and obviously she didn\u2019t want me because it could ruined our friendship, on at least there was 30 girls more that I wanted to approach but each time that I stalked them I saw that they had already boyfriend. In many times I tried too hard to get near and talk with woman but any success than only a simple conversation or about the courses, I had been so depressed all quarantine because I couldn\u2019t had girlfriend and the social anxiety that I suffered in that moment, maybe for bullying of High school but in any case I am so bad right now I don\u2019t know how to fix and finally have girlfriend, I am so fucking depressed about all this, I never get so effort probably in college but I want to change and try to approach, maybe I wasn\u2019t persistent enough or never did more effort to talk with them or so naive that they didn\u2019t really like me but I really didn\u2019t know how to do that. Please help",

It\u2019s a lot of responsibility to be in a relationship and to make it work. It takes a lot of time too and you already have school so it\u2019s tough to balance everything.",

You should learn how to be friends with women and from there it will be easier. It\u2019s simply as asking someone out on a date. You just have to make sure you\u2019re not doing anything that scares them away. Learn how to be a man. Read, work out, have manners, etc. And since you are out of school, it\u2019ll be easier since you won\u2019t be focus on studying at the same time",
