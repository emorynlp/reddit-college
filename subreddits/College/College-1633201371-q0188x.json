  "title:": "Was told to go to a different school\u2019s graduate program by our chair director",
  "text": "Okay, so I want to know if this has happened to anyone else with their department. (Sorry if weird format, I\u2019m on my phone)\n\nSo I was super excited to talk to the head chair director of the graduate school of my department; I\u2019m super invested in my major and want to do my best in the department! No specifics, but the school I go to is a top school in my state (USA), so to get into graduate school here is super good for resumes, and was the top reason for me to get into this school. It was over zoom and the person was very nice while talking, and then they discussed about the program\u2019s acceptances. They told me they only accept students from other outside schools, and not those who are at our school\u2026.. basically saying that even though I\u2019m in one of the top places in the state for my major, I can\u2019t get into their program because I\u2019m already apart of their bachelors\u2026. I asked why they do this and they said it is because they want their lower division students to learn from a vast range of different professors and to larger their experiences. They never mentioned this in orientation meetings, on the website, or from my advisor. To me this was super disappointing and doesn\u2019t make too much sense. We are at a high-level school with super excellent students, and you just send them away? \n\nI\u2019m saddened by this and kind of lost motivation because of it. Has this happened to anyone else????? Is this a common practice? I\u2019ve never heard of this from anywhere\u2026.",

              "text": "Yeah. I can get where that approach comes from - if you are only exposed to one way of thinking, your education can end up being narrower than if you attend different universities across degrees. It fails to account for individual differences in circumstances, though, and can create family issues. \n\nThere is also an issue of accepting or hiring graduates from the same institution when we are talking about faculty positions (i.e., in nearly all cases, one cannot be hired back into their own department full-time, especially if the position is tenure-track, after finishing a PhD from the same department). The reasoning there is because it makes it look like the university produces graduates that can't get hired anywhere else (which, to be honest, is rather stupid and fails to account for stellar individuals who happen to be location-bound). It could be some of that same reasoning in this case, too...they don't want to accept undergrads into a graduate program because it makes it potentially seem that they produce undergrads who can't cut it at other universities.",

      "text": "It is often considered \u201cincestuous\u201d to stay at the same school for PhD. Master\u2019s and then getting a PhD elsewhere isn\u2019t as bad. This is because you have already gotten the perspective of this department\u2019s profs, already benefitted from their expertise. If you want to learn and grow as much as possible, you need to look elsewhere and learn from new people, their expertise, and their perspective.",
