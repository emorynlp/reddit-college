I don\u2019t particularly enjoy my roommates so I have been studying in the libraries and eating in the dining halls, I\u2019ve looked into some clubs and organizations, and I just can\u2019t seem to find \u201cmy people.\u201d", "author": "Demmelat0r", "created": 1632535118, "retrieved": 1632946006, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"he6juiu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puxckb/how_do_you_find_your_people/he6juiu/", "text": "Everyone says clubs of similar interest which is a great start, but I actually recommend maybe going out of your comfort zone and joining something you never thought you\u2019d join.

It was easier to fit in when I was a freshmen stepping out of my comfort zone. But after taking (non-consecutively) three semesters off from school, I feel like I am coming into campus with a completely different perspective, let alone development. I still talk to random people when I feel comfortable, though for \"my group\" I've found two people to be of interest and I get along with them we'll -they're roomies, but I dont hang out with them a whole lot. I've just been spending lots of time in solitude, and I'm still learning how to laugh alone and laugh at myself in a fun way. For some reason people don't open up to me like they used to.
