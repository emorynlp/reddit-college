  "text": "What do I do?\u2026 my neighbour has $500 speakers with so much base that he just blasts all day everyday. It\u2019s 1130 pm right now and he\u2019s still going. This happens everyday. He plays music for more than 5 hours straight with no consideration of me. I send him texts so often asking politely for him to turn it down but he\u2019s not getting the goddamn memo. I have my final exams this week, I don\u2019t understand how someone can be so blindly inconsiderate.",
