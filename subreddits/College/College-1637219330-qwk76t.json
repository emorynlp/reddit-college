      "text": "Personally, that would be my favorite option. I can\u2019t remember if I ever did 4 but I definitely did 3 in a row like that. Getting everything out of the way like that is nice but it will suck around midterms and testing days. As long as you use your days off of class wisely, it won\u2019t be too bad. \n\nBring snacks and water, especially if any of the classes occur around your usual lunch time. Make sure you get a decent amount of sleep the night before and be ready to take notes all day. Keep track of when everything is due and work on it little by little so you don\u2019t have a bunch of assignments/tests you\u2019re working on the night before since things will probably all be due on the same days. Allow yourself to rest after a marathon of classes TR and let MWF be your main homework and study days.",
