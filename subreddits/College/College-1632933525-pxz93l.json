  "text": "Hi everyone! :) I am currently a 3rd year student studying Human Rights and Equity Studies. I have autism and some psychiatric disabilities, so I'm only taking 3 classes. But I also work 15 hours a week at my on-campus job. It is the heaviest workload I have had since starting university. \n\nI also have to commute one hour each way, which eats up at my time. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed by my workload. I've been eating unhealthy and stopped exercising because I am either too busy or too tired. It's even hard to do necessary chores around the house.\n\nFor those of you with multiple responsibilities - how do you balance your time effectively? I use a planner which is helpful, but I'd love to hear other suggestions. I have a feeling once assignments start to be due, I'll have an even harder time and I'm scared!",

      "text": "Hi. I have a full-time business and a part-time course load. I use a Google calendar to allocate time to different things, to make sure I've set enough time aside for each one. I set alarms on there as needed. I also use Trello to break tasks down.\n\nA trick from my first undergrad, when I often had multiple end-of-term essays due at the same time, is to create your own deadlines. Then block off time for research, minideadlines for outlines, etc. The hardest part is following that.\n\nIf you're living on your own and can afford it, a meal delivery service can take the edge off planning that part of your life.",
