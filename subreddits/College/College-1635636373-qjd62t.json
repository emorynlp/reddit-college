  "text": "The club rugby team at my college has been struggling to put together a roster, we just can\u2019t find enough people who want to come out and play. So, I\u2019ve sorta taken it upon myself to go on a little recruiting spree. What I\u2019m doing is looking through the old rosters of the varsity sports teams here at school, and then shooting emails to the guys who aren\u2019t on them anymore. So, if I look at last year\u2019s football roster and find a kid who\u2019s not listed on the current year\u2019s roster, I\u2019ll send him an email asking if he\u2019d like to play rugby. I\u2019ve sent about ten such emails now, and I\u2019ve gotten a few responses. However, a majority of them have not responded, and I\u2019d like to just check in and make sure that they actually saw the email in the first place- I don\u2019t want to be pushy or anything, but I would also like to get a concrete answer. I understand that it\u2019s normal and encouraged to send follow up emails to things like your professors or clubs that you\u2019re interested in joining, but I\u2019m not sure what a follow up to an individual student would sound like. Would it be socially acceptable to do such a thing? If so, how long should I wait before sending another email?",

Reply to your own email or send a fresh thread, either is fine.",
