  "text": "College started a month ago, before joining I had seen this professor's profile, research and was quite impressed. I possibly wanted to do my Masters dissertation with him. \n\nWe have lab sessions which said professor takes. I was performing experiment assigned to me. It was done by a batchmate in the session before it. The said batchmate tells me to do experiment in X way which I find very dubious. Like, we were supposed to find a quantity (Wavelength) and the said classmate used a ready-made chart of wavelength which frankly made the experiment pointless. Whereas the instruction sheet told to do it in Y way. Mind you that we have done experiments in way that are not given in instruction sheets before. \n\nLet me tell you that I have a lot and lot of self doubt so even if I know that the X way to do stuff is wrong, I go and ask the professor to confirm. He's super condescending and asks me to figure it out on my own. By the end of lab session he asks me- \"so... What was your question again?\" I say it and he is like \"I generally don't say this...but this question was frankly stupid\". Fml. \n\n\nI would highly appreciate your advice on this. \n\nTL;DR - Fucked up by asking a super super obvious question to professor, he said that my question was stupid and was condescending to me. I wanted to work on project with him in future (because his research aligns with my interests). So I don't know what to do.",

You can have a good time working for a great PI on somewhat engaging material or a terrible time working for an awful PI on stuff you actually find interesting.\n\nPut it another way, bad PI's will ruin your enjoyment of good things while good PI's will make you excited to come in. Your advisor's personality is way more important than where they work or what they research. So... choose wisely. \n\nAnd maybe don't chose this asshole.",

The best way to handle these situations IMO is to confront the professor directly. See him/her during office hours and express how you felt belittled and disrespected. It's worked for me in the past, and honestly if the professor can't see that he/she is in the wrong, leave the course or bring it up with the department head.",
