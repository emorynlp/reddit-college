I wanted to work with him on project.", "text": "College started a month ago, before joining I had seen this professor's profile, research and was quite impressed. I possibly wanted to do my Masters dissertation with him. \n\nWe have lab sessions which said professor takes. I was performing experiment assigned to me. It was done by a batchmate in the session before it. The said batchmate tells me to do experiment in X way which I find very dubious. Like, we were supposed to find a quantity (Wavelength) and the said classmate used a ready-made chart of wavelength which frankly made the experiment pointless. Whereas the instruction sheet told to do it in Y way. Mind you that we have done experiments in way that are not given in instruction sheets before. \n\nLet me tell you that I have a lot and lot of self doubt so even if I know that the X way to do stuff is wrong, I go and ask the professor to confirm. He's super condescending and asks me to figure it out on my own. By the end of lab session he asks me- \"so... What was your question again?\" I say it and he is like \"I generally don't say this...but this question was frankly stupid\". Fml. \n\n\nI would highly appreciate your advice on this. \n\nTL;DR - Fucked up by asking a super super obvious question to professor, he said that my question was stupid and was condescending to me. I wanted to work on project with him in future (because his research aligns with my interests).
