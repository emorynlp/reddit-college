Every professor is different.\n\nFirst, I'll start with why I might give someone a higher grade, and there's really only two reasons:\n\n(1) I fat fingered something and typed in the wrong grade somewhere.\n\n(2) The final grade does not fairly reflect the student's ability at the end of the semester. Basically, some students may have done really poorly on an early assignment (I teach mostly freshmen), and then they get their bearings later on. I usually only really care when I have a student who is on the bubble -- it takes a C to pass, so I carefully look at the C- students to see if this is the case for anyone.\n\nOther professors may be more open to adjustments, so here's some things to keep in mind when you approach them about this:\n\n--We've already \"reconsidered\" your grade. We're aware of what we're putting in, and we know that a 79.4 is only 0.6 points away from a B-.\n\n--Why you want a higher grade isn't very important. Need to keep financial aid? Want to transfer? Headed to grad school? Parents will be mad? You're personally disappointed? Why you *want* the grade isn't nearly as important as why you *deserve* it.\n\n--Once submitted to the registrar's office, grades may be very hard for us to change. For me, I have to get the head of my program and the dean to sign off on it, then go down to the registrar, wait in line, and give the business to the clowns who didn't process the request. Ain't nobody got time for that.\n\n--The most important thing is to have a clear reason why you believe your body of work in the class means you deserve a higher grade. Correcting shortcomings from earlier in the semester is a decent reason. Committing to do better is not.\n\n\"I'm 0.5 points from a B-, and failed quiz #2, but got a B+ on the midterm which was cumulative and covered the quiz #2 material.\" That's a decent reason for adjusting a grade.\n\n\"I slacked off earlier in the semester and got a lot of Ds and C-s, but you can tell from my Cs and C+s that I really committed to doing better. Also I worked super duper hard on the final essay.\" Move along, move along.\n\n--Don't try to flatter us. Everyone tries it, no one succeeds, and we can tell from your grades whether your claims about \"really learning a lot this semester\" are true. And, if you're grade grubbing, odds are our opinions about whether you really did learn a lot differ.\n\nIf you can *demonstrate* that you learned a lot though, that matters. \"I did poorly on essay #1 because I didn't have a clear thesis statement, but you can see from the organization in essay #3 that I took your criticism to heart and learned from it\" might do well. \"I learned a lot, but still wrote bad essays\" does not.\n\n**Final Thought:** I know the standard advice is \"it doesn't hurt to ask,\" and from the student's perspective this is probably true. But, professors are people too. We don't like giving students failing grades. It's one of the worst parts of the job. Making us give you a failing grade twice sucks.\n\n--\"I missed 8 classes, slept through 3, and was always on my cellphone\" puts you on the short list for the circular file.", "author": "bl1y", "created": 1576603043, "retrieved": 1632947812, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 792, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fbciei5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ebyoa7/writing_prof_here_again_some_notes_on_asking_for/fbciei5/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1576724638, "upvotes": 1}, "fbbhz81": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ebyoa7/writing_prof_here_again_some_notes_on_asking_for/fbbhz81/", "text": "My course syllabuses in every one of my businesses classes explicitly state to not email asking for a grade bump.

I was also in contact with my professor from the beginning of the semester when I noticed I didn\u2019t have a grade for the Chapger 1 homework I had completed, and so my professor was super understanding and gave me a 100 for the homework section of the course because I *communicated* like a decent human being instead of waiting until the end of the semester to go and beg.\n\nMy personal pet peeve is when students do the whole \u201cI need an A in this class or I\u2019m going to lose my scholarships and then I\u2019ll have to drop out of school and live in a cardboard box\u201d (maybe a slight exaggeration but you know what I mean).
