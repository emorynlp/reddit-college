  "title:": "Writing Prof Here Again: Some Notes On Asking For A Grade Bump",
  "text": "Obviously your mileage is going to vary. Every professor is different.\n\nFirst, I'll start with why I might give someone a higher grade, and there's really only two reasons:\n\n(1) I fat fingered something and typed in the wrong grade somewhere.\n\n(2) The final grade does not fairly reflect the student's ability at the end of the semester. Basically, some students may have done really poorly on an early assignment (I teach mostly freshmen), and then they get their bearings later on. I usually only really care when I have a student who is on the bubble -- it takes a C to pass, so I carefully look at the C- students to see if this is the case for anyone.\n\nOther professors may be more open to adjustments, so here's some things to keep in mind when you approach them about this:\n\n--We've already \"reconsidered\" your grade. We're aware of what we're putting in, and we know that a 79.4 is only 0.6 points away from a B-.\n\n--Why you want a higher grade isn't very important. Need to keep financial aid? Want to transfer? Headed to grad school? Parents will be mad? You're personally disappointed? Why you *want* the grade isn't nearly as important as why you *deserve* it.\n\n--Once submitted to the registrar's office, grades may be very hard for us to change. For me, I have to get the head of my program and the dean to sign off on it, then go down to the registrar, wait in line, and give the business to the clowns who didn't process the request. Ain't nobody got time for that.\n\n--The most important thing is to have a clear reason why you believe your body of work in the class means you deserve a higher grade. Correcting shortcomings from earlier in the semester is a decent reason. Committing to do better is not.\n\n\"I'm 0.5 points from a B-, and failed quiz #2, but got a B+ on the midterm which was cumulative and covered the quiz #2 material.\" That's a decent reason for adjusting a grade.\n\n\"I slacked off earlier in the semester and got a lot of Ds and C-s, but you can tell from my Cs and C+s that I really committed to doing better. Also I worked super duper hard on the final essay.\" Move along, move along.\n\n--Don't try to flatter us. Everyone tries it, no one succeeds, and we can tell from your grades whether your claims about \"really learning a lot this semester\" are true. And, if you're grade grubbing, odds are our opinions about whether you really did learn a lot differ.\n\nIf you can *demonstrate* that you learned a lot though, that matters. \"I did poorly on essay #1 because I didn't have a clear thesis statement, but you can see from the organization in essay #3 that I took your criticism to heart and learned from it\" might do well. \"I learned a lot, but still wrote bad essays\" does not.\n\n**Final Thought:** I know the standard advice is \"it doesn't hurt to ask,\" and from the student's perspective this is probably true. But, professors are people too. We don't like giving students failing grades. It's one of the worst parts of the job. Making us give you a failing grade twice sucks.\n\n--\"I missed 8 classes, slept through 3, and was always on my cellphone\" puts you on the short list for the circular file.",

After having brain surgery last November, I finished 3 of my courses with As and 2 with a medical \u201cno grade\u201d to be finished within 9 weeks of the next semester. Surgery went fine but recovery was much harder than expected, and I ended up taking the whole next semester off. I had a 4.0, and my professors kept emailing about how I need to take the final and hand in work, but I was not capable of doing so and I got 2 Fs. I am back this semester working better and I just got a 4.0 again. I\u2019m in an accelerated BA to MA program, and want to earn a PhD after this. I have a 3.6 because of those Fs and while a 3.6 doesn\u2019t look bad, two Fs in grad level classes looks horrible on a transcript! If you were the professor in my situation, would you approve an appeal to have the grade removed from my transcript? I know I can get the administration on my side, but the appeal process starts with the professors and I feel stuck.",

Never got below a 100% on ANY of them for the whole semester. His tests made no sense to me so I got an F, two Ds and a C. I came in for help throughout the course of the semester and every single time he told me to just keep doing what I was doing because I was on the track to the B I wanted. Two weeks before the final I told him I was really struggling with the practice tests, he told me that I needed a B or a high C on the final to get the B in the class that I wanted. Judging by my test scores, that wasn't going to happen. I got a really low C on the final and my grade was 79.54 and he refused to give me a B in the class, even though the syllabus says the whole science department has to round up.\n\nI believe my counselor changed my grade after he submitted it, but that didn't really matter to me as much as this guy seeing how much work I put in to every single assignment and deciding that I didn't deserve a B in his class.",

I emailed my professor (normally wouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s 0.06%!) and she graciously raised me up to a 90. Shit happens, and if you can show that you put in effort, it pays off.",

Without my asking, the professor bumped me up. I guess only 0.15% points gets me to 89.5%, which rounds up to 90%.\n\nI'm thrilled, and it was very nice of them. I had perfect attendance, paid attention, never missed and assignment, did extra credit, did all optional assignments.  The whole class bombed one test -- pretty badly. I got a 51% on that, IIRC, and was above the median for the class.\n\nWhat should I do? Can I thank them? They didn't have to fudge me the points. Should I? How?  I'd like to, but it feels awkward.",

Aside from not having the kind of win/loss mechanic that defines games, college does not have the telos or purpose of a game. The purpose of a game is a sort of entertaining engagement (I don't actually think we have a single word in English for this), while the purpose of college is education. College has some game-like elements (rules, competition, judges), but it's different purpose means it's not a game.\n\nAlso, I have no idea in what way you're saying the system is broken.",

Almost every other student I've met is worried about money, loans, grad school, jobs, and a ton of other such stuff that *wasn't* as big a problem for current professors while in college. When \"extenuating circumstances\" are limited to deaths in the family or physical ailments, you discount all of the other BS that comes along with growing into an adult and living by yourself for the first time after a shitty school system that hasn't been enough. Sure, these circumstances don't by themselves deserve grade bumps, but if you see a student deal with this BS that has visibly impacted their grade, cut them some slack and allow some extra-credit assignments, or at the very least stop shaming them.",

I\u2019ve gone through some personal issues that have caused my grades to slip, which has caused me to lose scholarships, but never once did I go to my professors and beg for a grade bump just because I felt entitled to it. \n\nThe only time I\u2019ve ever asked for a grade bump was when the online textbook wasn\u2019t registering my grades for the online homework even though I had completed every assignment, and even then I tried to contact tech support before going to my professor. I was also in contact with my professor from the beginning of the semester when I noticed I didn\u2019t have a grade for the Chapger 1 homework I had completed, and so my professor was super understanding and gave me a 100 for the homework section of the course because I *communicated* like a decent human being instead of waiting until the end of the semester to go and beg.\n\nMy personal pet peeve is when students do the whole \u201cI need an A in this class or I\u2019m going to lose my scholarships and then I\u2019ll have to drop out of school and live in a cardboard box\u201d (maybe a slight exaggeration but you know what I mean). Again, I have also lost scholarships due to a low GPA so I understand those students\u2019 frustration, but it\u2019s not your professors\u2019 fault that you can\u2019t keep up. Extenuating circumstances happen, but if you communicate properly then 99% of the time professors will work with you. If your professor won\u2019t work with you it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t communicate properly or just didn\u2019t put the work in. Also, unless your scholarship requires a 4.0 then it\u2019s unlikely that one class would bring you below the requirement.\n\nI\u2019m going to shamelessly share this post in a few class Groupme\u2019s that have whiny students in them. Normally I don\u2019t like being *that* person but professors don\u2019t deserve the amount of complaining and begging they get at the end of every semester.",

You also cannot do much if the professor fucks up. Recently got a bad grade on an assignment wherein the assignment was ripped off by a professor from another university's grad level class (I'm a junior), where neither the TA nor the professor were able to help out. When asked for help and extra resources, they did not respond. The assignment was given out *the week before finals* and due *during finals* (which isn't usual at my uni), and they weren't on campus nor had they *read* complete assignment/ know what it entailed. Sure, I could communicate, but how do I point out his apathy? I can't, because I may have to take another course with him next semester. Call me entitled but I deserve another chance.",

I have several mental health diagnoses so I understand the mental health situation (that\u2019s part of the \u201cpersonal issues\u201d I was referring to that made me lose my scholarships). Unfortunately, some students like to self-diagnose themselves with things like depression and anxiety and use that as an excuse for everything without acknowledging any their poor choices that may have contributed. For example, my roommate claimed to have depression but she also partied 3 days a week and spent all of her time doing work for her sorority instead of going to class or doing her homework. Then she would go to her professors and tell them that she\u2019s been too depressed to get out of bed and that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t been to class or done any assignments. Those people cause those of us who truly struggle with mental health to lose credibility.\n\nYour professor truly sounds like a bad professor, and I\u2019m not denying that those professors exist. My 99% thing was just an expression, bad professors probably make up more than 1% but I really do believe that there are a lot of entitled students who will try to get by doing the bare minimum (or less) and then blame the professor for their less-than-stellar grade. And again, those students can cause students like you with truly bad professors to not be taken as seriously.\n\nMy comment was directed at those entitled students who like to make excuses and blame others for their bad grade when in reality it\u2019s at least partially their own fault. That was not directed towards people like you. Best of luck to you in dealing with your bad professors.",

      "text": "I'm struggling hard to achieve an A that's impossible to achieve at this point. I have an 87 in the class and only the final exam left. It is worth 150pts and I need 170 to break that A. \n\nHere's what is killing me. This is my first semester back in 20 years. I have busted my butt and received A's in all my GE classes. This semester I have also:\n\n\\-Moved 3 times\n\n\\-Dealt with living with a sociopath who deemed I was his property and would harass me for weeks\n\n\\-Had a messy break up with my BF\n\n\\-Underwent a botched surgery and was on pain killers for 2 weeks (I never missed a class, I never asked for an extension on a test and still managed to pull B's on my exams and practicals).\n\n\\- Massive bureaucratic issues with financial aid, school admins and declaration of Major issues. \n\nI had one really bad practical exam that my prof. knew I would do poorly on because it was, straight-up memorization of 150 terms. No physiology because there wasn't time to teach it completely. She apologized to me at the start of the module and told me I was going to struggle with this because I need to learn stuff logically, I don't memorize well. I got a C on this exam.  Since then I have gotten high B's and Mid A's on my exams. \n\nMy Prof told me the other day I should be hella proud of myself. 70% of the class has either dropped or failed by now. and I'm still mid-range grade for the remaining students. I can feel all the pride in the world, but that's going to nothing for my GPA or acceptance into the program. \n\nI'm not one to be a victim. I have since found a stable apartment, rid myself of the sociopath and reported him, stabilized my relationship and recovered from the surgery- I'm also back on track with my health seeing a nutritionist and PA monthly to ensure my health stays in order. \n\nI have, I guess done remediation of my life because I never dropped my determination for the class. I just feel there needs to be SOME way to take all of that into account. when determining the final grade. \n\nI get it... If I bomb the final with a D- I don't deserve a boost. but... even getting a B at this point or a low A has got to show I'm serious about this and have bled, cried and sacrificed to learn this content fully.   \n\n\nSorry for the vent- and thank you for reading it... I guess I really needed to get that all out.  Giving up my career and returning to school has been a massive life change and I'm doing my best... but the last 4 months have been beyond insane.",

A better parallel would be if you did not receive a performance based bonus because you were ill or had family commitments.  Sympathy for your situation does not mean reducing standards.  No one expects 100% all the time, but it may mean you do not always earn the A.  (Also a prof.)",

The numbers are the numbers, and if a quirk in the grading gets you a lower grade, [well...tough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzl-2g5HhaI)\"\n\nIt certainly is easy for a prof to say \"those are the numbers, and that's the class rules,\" but I think we need to go past that and recognize what our grades represent to the wider community. On your transcript I am saying \"Johnnie earned this grade in my course.\" How confident am I that the first essay should be 15% of the total grade and not 10% or 12%? And did I really pore over it closely enough when deciding between a C and a C+?\n\nI'm consistent enough and have enough assignments that I trust things to shake out correctly in the vast majority of cases, and I know there's a range of arguable grades in most cases, and so long as I'm in that range, I'm okay. But, if I know a grade is not a fair representation of how the student performed, the honest thing to do is adjust the grade to reflect how they student in fact performed rather than being a slave to the assessment rubric.",

Grading is much more subjective in a class where you write essays versus a class where solve mathematical equations. In the latter, our grading is much more clear-cut. If you fail to do a certain step in the solution correctly then you aren\u2019t awarded the points for that step. There is no way the grader can re-read that assignment and suddenly award you more points if they\u2019re following the grading script. \n\nThat means the grade-grubbing at the end tends to be more \u201cwhat extra work can i do\u201d, and not \u201cmy performance is better than it looks on paper\u201d. Students are given the grading script to see for themselves what they missed, so they rarely find anything to argue over.\n\nThe only time we would \u201cbump\u201d someone\u2019s grade is if they did poorly on one assessment piece very early on and did wonderfully afterwards, but as you said, we can see all the grades when we enter the final one, we\u2019ve already considered bumping up those students, and we\u2019ve decided against it. Once final grades come out - they\u2019re final. Changes can only happen by a formal independent re-grade of the final, previous grades cannot be negotiated, and we have no power to just go in and fudge things a bit.",

Not to mention that 9/10 students will go the dept to complain, so that's a complaint form to fill out, a grade book request to submit, a meeting with the dept's deputy chair.\n\nMost F grade complaints end when the grade book shows the student did fuck all, but some students have had the gall to chase things to the end. Ds are better grades because sure you pass, but most don't get the credit transferred if the student goes to another school.",

Conversely, if your opening message indicates that you read the syllabus, I'm already modestly more open to having this conversation.",
