  "text": "Hi, I will be going for my first semester for Computer Science classes in the Spring semester and wanted to truly dedicate myself on proper study strategies for preventing burnout and being able to balance some social time, while still getting the most amount of sleep as possible. If need be, I'll forgo more social time for sleep. (Can't really function as a zombie lol)  \n\n\nFor those in engineering and Computer science, how do you study/do projects?   \nSince I was a biology major before, my main methods have been:  \n1. Full Readthrough of material once to absorb main concepts. Try not to reread any material unless necessary, or try to reference material I don't understand. Reading is said to not be *as active* learning as doing active recall.\n\n2. Active Recall- Using Flashcards/Anki, answering practice questions to test and apply knowledge. If I don't know something, I look it up, make a flashcard and add it.\n\n2. Spaced Repetition-If I'm doing something like Chemistry or Anatomy or math- I will typically have a daily goal of doing a certain amount of practice questions on the material covered, either everyday or every other day. So that I'm familiar with the material. \n\n3. Study everyday with small breaks- Depending on the day and how busy it is, I give myself time to go over all the subjects I need to, fully focusing on the material for say about 25-45 minutes, then giving myself 5-10 minutes to decompress, then continue studying. If I have alot of free time, I will commit 8-10 hours studying or doing projects.  \n\n\nSo for those in engineering, and or computer science right now, how do you study to make the best use of your time and avoid burn out and/or sleepless nights? Do you ever give yourself one day completely off to not study and relax? And Do you believe with proper organization do you avoid sleepless nights?",

For me I just run though any problems that we have for practice because the test is bound to be on the same principles, they just change like the givens or scenario around a bit from the practice.",

Rather than looking over notes over and over why not look up projects online that pertain to loops in python and look over the concepts and see if you can recreate the project. Still repetition, still gets it in your head, but allows for more practice which is important in CS. Practice",
