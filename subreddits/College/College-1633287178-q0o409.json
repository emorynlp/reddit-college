  "text": "So I\u2019m a sophomore but I\u2019ve never been to university and I have no idea what to hold when I go to campus. \n\nI\u2019ll probably be taking my iPad + apple pencil, phone, keys, kindle, a notebook, and some pens. Definitely lab reports too. \n\nWhat do I hold though? Do I get a backpack or a tote bag? It sounds like a stupid question, but I genuinely don\u2019t know what people take to university.",

If you have a lot of heavy stuff and you don\u2019t want to carry it on your back another option is a rolling backpack or laptop bag. \n\nYou may also want to bring some other stuff like a water bottle, snacks, extra masks, headphones or ear buds, your calculator if you are taking a class that needs one and you already have one. But don\u2019t buy a calculator until you know which one you need.",

I\u2019m not saying it to be mean, but I genuinely don\u2019t know what people take to university.\n\nEdit: sorry if I offended anyone, but I genuinely thought people didn\u2019t carry backpacks to university. I understand now that it\u2019s okay to carry one, but I tend to overthink and nitpick every little thing and I didn\u2019t want to be judged. Anyways, I\u2019ll also be carrying one haha.",

But this definitely depends on the types of classes you\u2019re taking so think about what you might need during class and bring that along. \n\nBut just bring whatever you think you\u2019ll need and then adjust after a couple weeks.

Don't use a tote bag, your shoulders will thank you for that by the time you graduate. Bring headphones. Bring a water bottle. BRING SNACKS AND FOOD FROM HOME TRUST ME ON THAT!!! Wear comfy walking shoes, bring a hoodie too, some of the classrooms get cold. Dress however you want, no one gives a shit about you or what you wear. Bring all supplies you need for classes. If you require text books, see if your campus has lockers, especially multiple textbooks every day. They're a drag to carry all the time to and from your place. Even if you're driving. If you do drive then just leave shit in your car for emergencies like spare clothing and a sleeping bag. Phone charger always is a must as well. And you don't need so many notebooks and binders, just write notes on your iPad or laptop. Download a good note taking app (OneNote or notion) to eliminate notebooks. If you do better writing, then have 2 notebooks. One notebook you bring to class for messy notes you can edit, the other leave at home and make your notes aesthetic and neat for studying. \n\nHope this helps! - a 4th year",

You probably don\u2019t need to bring your kindle while you have your ipad. I would try to cut down on bringing your expensive gadgets all at once because you don\u2019t want them stolen. For instance, if you need your laptop one day then do not bring your ipad unless you absolutely need to. I would also recommend bringing pencils and a highlighter because they do give out handouts to look through too. I also recommend those notebooks with a folder attached in the subject divider/cover because it\u2019s easier to put your notes and your handouts in one place for each class.\n\nPack a couple of bars in your bag (or any snack) and bring a water bottle. Your wallet, tampons, extra masks, etc as well. If you live somewhere where the weather changes quickly consider bringing a hat or gloves or extra socks during the winter. If you\u2019re taking a lab make sure to wear tennis shoes not sandals or flip flops.",
