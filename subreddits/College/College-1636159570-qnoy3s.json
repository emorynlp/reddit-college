  "text": "So I saw this on campus job that I really want and it said to put two references. \n\nThis job post was posted yesterday and the applications are due Sunday \nI sent email to two professors and one prof emailed back quickly and one prof is not responding, and now that it is weekend, I dont think any professor would respond. \n\nShould I try to just submit the application with one reference, or just keep try to find a reference during the weekend?",

You also don\u2019t have to ask a professor, you can ask a previous employer as someone else said, if you ever did and volunteering you can put the person in charge of you there as well.",
