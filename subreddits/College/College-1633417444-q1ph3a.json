  "text": "Feels like if you fall behind for 1 second the next 30 minutes is totally useless. Makes it so much worse that a lot of STEM professors tend to be really bad at emphasizing what's actually important and what's just tedious proofs that we'll never see again, and after 15 minutes of proofs resulting in the final useful theorem it stays on screen for like 5 seconds before they move onto the next slide.\n\nI've basically stopped attending in-person altogether and just reading textbook and watching lectures when necessary. I thought I hated zoom university, but in-person lectures just feel like a total waste of time to me. I literally have no clue how I made it through college beforehand without recorded lectures.",

I personally think online classes are better because I can get the recorded lectures and can replay the parts I missed or didnt understand.. I guess textbooks and youtube would hopefully save my grades",
