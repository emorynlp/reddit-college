  "text": "I often find myself going over several Google pages just to classify and summarize information, and recursively search for new information in a \"Wikipedia-style\" process. This is especially true when I'm writing a paper or doing research in general.\n\nMe and some friends wanted to build something that goes beyond search, so we are working Willow. A smart search engine. An interactive decision assistant. A place for collecting idea.  \n[https://www.ai-company.cloud/willow](https://www.ai-company.cloud/willow)\n\nAll your feedback is appreciated!",
