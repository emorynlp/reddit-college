  "text": "As a senior, I\u2019ve realized that I don\u2019t fit in anywhere. Nothing works out with anyone and I have only a couple mild acquaintances in classes. Being in college for almost 5 years with almost 0 connections makes me concerned. I\u2019m 100% certain , like something is genetically wrong with me. Plus I\u2019m ugly which no amount of lifting can change so that kind of fucks with my dating/social life.",

It pretty much comes at no cost at that point.\n\nFor me, i was able to work out many of my personal issues, one of them being my shitty social situation. Please give it a shot.",

      "text": "I've been in your position before. When you have no friends, you start to doubt yourself. This makes you nervous and unconfident, which puts people off, and it's an endless cycle. Being ugly usually isn't a major factor, but again it can hurt your confidence. \n\nMy suggestion is to start small.  Make it a goal to talk to one person a day.  Even if it's a 5 minute chat with the person sitting next to you in class. Just say hello, ask how they're doing, and that's it.  \n\nOnce you have that down, try to have extended conversations.  \n\nOver time, you will build confidence.",
