  "text": "I\u2019ve seen so many instances where people have gotten degrees- masters even- that don\u2019t even really use them. What\u2019s the point of college? Am I better off getting a certification for something to make a living off of ? Any insight is greatly appreciated!! I\u2019m 18, and just want to turn my life toward something. I already have lots of experience working with children, and I love doing art.",

When i finished turned out there aren\u2019t any demands for marketing grads so i studied accounting (double bachelor).",

What would that pay in your area? What would the required degree cost?  Reading the upper level course descriptions for the major, does it sound interesting?\n\nWhat job would you get without the degree? Perhaps at a daycare, or as a Paraprofessional.  What do those jobs pay in your area? Do those jobs have retirement plans & stable growth? What would those certifications take?",

      "text": "Whether or not college is worth it is a hard question with many unknowns. The upsides of college are lower unemployment rate, and typically more career progression/salary increase. However, it is expensive and it can be years before you actually see the benefits of college because student loans are using any extra money you make.\n\nHowever, there is the aspect that a college education makes you more likely to have cushy office jobs, instead of customer service or manual labor jobs. More regular hours, being around other college educated professionals, and possibly more able to follow your passion. I sent you a DM with some longer info you might want to check out.",

      "text": "Simple, do the research on what you want to do. I\u2019m not a psych major because it\u2019s an over saturated, underpaid field. I\u2019m an electrical engineer instead because it has strong job prospects and is work I enjoy. Also the price is variable. I applied to 20 schools and went to the cheapest. Some colleges offered me to go at $60k/yr, but I got a scholarship to go to a great school for free. So it really comes down to it\u2019s a waste of time if you don\u2019t treat it like it\u2019s your life on the line, because that\u2019s what it really is",
