  "text": "\nBefore I continue, I would like to state that this does not include professors who don\u2019t allow back tracking during their tests cause I get that. Alrighty then\u2026 so as we all know BlackBoard can be pretty odd yes? From a year I\u2019ve spent using BB, I\u2019ve noticed how tests can be taken in 2 ways\u2026 there is one way where each question is essentially it\u2019s own page, then another way where all the questions are on the same page. So what that means, is that for the each question being it\u2019s own page, you would have to click the arrow to go to the next question. But for the all questions being on the same page, you can scroll up and down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that said, here is the part that makes me confused\u2026 if professors allow back tracking for their tests, then why not just go ahead with the all questions on one page option? That is so MUCH EASIER than having each question it\u2019s own page. So for my [MATH] test yes? Each question is extremely diverse and makes you think so I skipped some questions I had trouble with so I can move on over and finish the test then just go back to those questions that I skipped. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell\u2026 each question was it\u2019s own page\u2026 and there\u2019s no thing on the side to where they have each question and I can just click on the ones I skipped. This was a 50 question test so what I had to do was literally click the arrow forward and back which that ended up taking so much time that I had to rush the questions I missed \ud83d\ude11\u2620\ufe0f. It made me upset not gonna lie and it makes me even more upset when other professors have that perfect feature to where all the questions are on one page. Because with my (COMPOSITION) test this week, all my questions were on one page, so for the questions I skipped, I literally just scrolled up and found them in seconds. See what I\u2019m saying? I had this same issue in A&P, where I would end up going to the end of the time limit because that one question being it\u2019s own page feature so I have to click the arrow constantly rather than scrolling up or down in mere seconds. If they had the number questions on the side like Canvas, then I wouldn\u2019t be complaining but because they don\u2019t it sucks y\u2019know?",

      "text": "Absolutely hate blackboard with a passion when it comes to exams. I dislike then professors do the option of one page at a time because then that causes issues for my computer with the internet and I lose time over that. Granted there was a time where my one exam had all my questions on one page but when I submitted my exam I literally got a zero because none of my answers actually saved. Luckily my professor allowed me for a retake within 24 hours but still. Blackboard is a bitch",
