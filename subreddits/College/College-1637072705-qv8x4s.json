  "text": "Hi! does anyone else here have to use ALEKS? \n\nCurrently im using it for my Quantitative Literacy class, and this is the 4th math class ive ever had to use this program, and all 4 classes ive ever had to use it in have been the worst math classes ive ever had the displeasure of taking. \n\nMath being taught in the way ALEKS teaches it is what makes people despise math and think that they're bad at genuinely simple fucking concepts. \n\nPunitive Learning aside, i just genuinely think professors who use it are doing their students an extreme disservice and considering this is the 2nd college class ive had with it, im genuinely pissed off that i keep going thousands of dollars into debt for these classes that make me miserable simply because the professors refuse to put together a real curriculum based around genuine learning and instead use this bs. Instead of getting real feedback for why an answer is wrong, its just \"wrong, now heres extra problems so i can waste more of your time. nope. no option to partially do something for partial credit.\"\n\ndoes anyone else relate? for this program to feel so inescabable for me it seems like not alot of people encounter it.",

      "text": "This may be something to bring up to the head of the department if you feel comfortable doing so. Get a group of students together and file a complaint. Granted, higher level math courses will not (and cannot) be taught in this way, but for lower level math courses it might be an easy way out of grading for the professors. I know it can be incredibly frustrating and I don't think something can be done about this current semester, seeing as it's almost over, but it is a possibility that if you bring up the issue now, that things could change for future semesters. \n\nAlso, if you are struggling with the coursework in general, don't be afraid to talk with the professor about specific questions you have, and/or other resources they may be able to recommend to you. The assignments aren't the most important thing, probably exams have more weight, so as long as you can learn the material for the exam, you should be alright.",
