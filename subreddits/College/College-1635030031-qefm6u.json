The stuff they teach is really useful but it is not intellectually beneficial at all. I don't think that it's worth the money when I can learn all of it from textbooks and YouTube. \n\n(I am an international student so I pay a lot. My family covers the cost. I am only going to university because my mom wants me to do so)",

If you focus on accounting (meaning a minor? Or a major?) you will need anywhere from 4-12 accounting classes, all of which will continue to get significantly harder than the one you are currently enrolled in. This is by design of course. Financial Accounting 101 is the first ever accounting class, and it should be the easiest. Advanced Accounting 501, I promise you, will be \u201cintellectually beneficial\u201d and likely not something you can learn from YouTube.",
