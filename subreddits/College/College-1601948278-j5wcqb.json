Every year, I take out $10K in student loans to help my parents with the burden of paying tuition. \n\nI am (was) also a National Merit Finalist. I just learned today that the University of Alabama provides full ride + dorm + stipend for up to 5 years of college for NMF. \n\nDon\u2019t know what to say.

I was also a national merit finalist and instead of researching my options better, I just ignored them because I had this misconception that all the schools that offered full rides for national merit scholars were bad. instead, I just focused on my dream elite school and I applied there ED. when I got in ED, I didn't even consider other options anymore. in the summer this year, I started freaking out about how much my elite college costs, and I even reached out to UT Dallas, which is another school with an extremely generous full-tuition-plus-study-abroad-stipend. however, it was too late to be a part of their national merit scholar program.\n\nI was really angry and frustrated for a long time, but now I haven't thought about that problem for a while. I think it's important to remember that all of us take different paths in life and the imperfect ones can end up being the best because it means that you're trying to see the light and live in the best way that you can.
