  "text": "To preface I have been going to college for only one semester but nonetheless it\u2019s already apparent that I will only skate by. I\u2019ve spent my entire life doing the bare minimum in school, and by that I mean always getting just good enough grades to get into a decent college. I thought maybe in college I\u2019d grow up and stop being lazy but I can\u2019t help myself I can\u2019t bring myself to put full effort in, I\u2019m starting to believe I never will. I want to work hard so desperately cause I want to learn and be proud of myself but all I do is let myself down, procrastinating, avoiding lectures, do ANYTHING but work on school. It\u2019s super stupid but it\u2019s all I know anymore, I try over and over to change it but I\u2019m just pathetic at this point. Anyone have any advice on how to get into good study habits? Because I\u2019m beyond sick of who I am.",

You have other options but you have to find out what they are. It\u2019s just that a degree has some value that will help establish a career. If it was easy, we all could be engineers making six figures",

      "text": "Hey friend, I know this feeling very well and it\u2019s miserable. It is not as easy as people say to just change your habits. Have you looked into your health? I felt like this my whole life then got diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune condition that left me feeling fatigued and unmotivated 24/7. It also sounds like you may have some mental health problems that are causing AND being compounded by your lifestyle. Maybe you should consider looking into this. My life has changed completely since being medicated and I\u2019ve managed to get into a really good uni doing a degree that I love because of it. In the meantime, try not to be so hard on yourself and instead try to take things step by step - congratulate yourself on the small things you ARE doing. The fact that you desperately want to change is already a such huge thing and a very good indicator that you have a good future ahead:) \n\nSome practical tips that worked for me:\n\nStart with very very gentle exercise and make it a goal to stick to it - yoga or a daily walk for example.\n\nChange your diet and drink LOADS of water. People don\u2019t realise how dehydrated they are. Get a water bottle and keep filling that baby up, you\u2019ll feel such a difference in your brain I promise\n\nMost important: accept that you will have good days and bad days. The important thing is to recommit to your goals DAILY, no matter how yesterday went. The focus is on the present and the future. Don\u2019t let thoughts about the past consume you. \n\nI hope things get better soon. I believe in you\ud83d\ude0a",
