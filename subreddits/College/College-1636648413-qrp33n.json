  "text": "Another mental health post, but I\u2019m really unhappy. I got into my dream program at my dream school and I\u2019m too depressed to be able to enjoy it. I\u2019m a bit older and in an insane college town surrounded by people way younger than me. I have a terrible apartment with roommates who are weird and I don\u2019t get along with and I have neighbors who party non-stop. I don\u2019t like the dates I\u2019ve gone on and I struggle to form connections and find things that stimulate me intellectually and creatively like I did at home. I mainly find it hard to not be incredibly calloused all the time. \n\nI am also in weeder classes, which the ones for my major are going OK (but getting way worse), but I\u2019m in one class that I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get above a C in. I also joined a lab way, way too soon and I feel like I\u2019m drowning in it. I do nothing but posture and try my best, but I\u2019m still wrong a lot of the time. It\u2019s getting to the point that I\u2019m having panic attacks before lab days.  \n\nMy goal was academia. But I really just think about going home and studying something different at a way cheaper state school. The only reason I haven\u2019t up and left is because I\u2019m halfway through my degree thanks to CC credits. If I restarted in a different field, I\u2019d lose a lot of that progress. And I really do love my major, but I just can\u2019t deal with everything else.",
