  "text": "Today I took the PSAT and it was not good at all, i knew like nothing and just ended up guessing. That makes me not even want to take the real SAT ,because i already know its not going to be good. But luckily i have a very good gpa so i should still be able go to community collage to get my basic credits than i plan on going to a better college to finish my degree. So my question is will me not taking the SAT affect my me getting to to another college after community?",

      "text": "in my xp & to my knowledge, no. I took early college credits back in highschool from Jr to senior year. although it was 2 years of college coursework, I had 1 year worth of college credit..I then finished my Associates for Transfers after 1 year in community college. after applying to csu, I just had to submit my financial aid & classes that I took in high school & college. there was no question from what I remembered that asked me for my sat scores, just ap scores. for reference, I took the psat & sat. I didn't even get a good score. in all honesty, csu especially just care if you have fulfilled the necessary requirements, like GPA, paperwork, etc",
