  "text": "I've not looked into college really at all, as I don't plan on taking out any loans for as long as is possible. I plan on enlisting in the Navy, and I would like to actually study something while I'm in. I've always been interested in laws relating to constitutional rights. Can you focus your studies on a single type of law? I always assumed it was like medical school where you have to study it all before studying any single topic. I dont plan on being a lawyer, just would like to be familiar with the laws and how to argue them. I don't want to study anything as a profession, I just want knowledge.",
