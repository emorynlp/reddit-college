      "text": "I go to an elite super rich school and i come from a poor underfunded inner city high school. As far as classes go its not hard at all lmao. Like middle school was harder. Idk if its the classes im taking or what but im chilling which was not something I expected and it seems that everyone else around me is struggling but im like yeah i didnt even have mid terms. \nAs for clubs and stuff i am BLOWN AWAY by the opportunities and different clubs and resources i have access to. Like i am so busy all the time because i took every opportunity because i never had these things in high school so im like making up for lost time. As for it being different i thought it would be harder but like i said above who knows. I also have no friends really but i also kinda expected it due to past patterns. Also @ the person who told me i couldnt get into this school and if i did i would t succeed screw u bc i am thriving! \nAha wow wrote a lot sorry about that. I hope you first few months have been going well despite it being different",

          "text": "> super rich school \n\nSounds about right for a super rich school. All schools have grade inflation, but the really rich ones have the worst grade inflation in my experience because the students are used to always getting what they want so they nag professors for higher grades and easier classes until they get their way. Happens at lower income schools, too, but low-income students grew up getting told \"no\" all the time and were forced to accept it so they back off quicker. \n\nA lot of elite schools are super tough, too, so your mileage may vary-- I'm of the opinion that your experience is more of a \"super rich school\" thing than an \"elite school\" thing (although there does tend to be a lot of overlap).",
