  "text": "Now that Thanksgiving break is over, I HAVE ONLY THREE WEEKS LEFT THIS FALL!! I blew off the 1st half of my semester (and regret it) and had to spend most of this month catching up in my Calculus 3 class. Now I have so much catching up to do with the rest of my classes and I don't even know if I'll come out of this semester with good grades. Is anyone else grinding as the semester comes to an end, especially with finals coming up?!",
