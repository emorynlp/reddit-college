  "text": "Dear high schoolers: \n\nWe are all excited for you as you receive your letters of admission.  This is a big milestone in your academic career and you've got big decisions in front of you.\n\nHowever, r/college is not the place to ask admission questions, nor to ask which school you should go to.  \n\n* If you have questions about admission (questions about your stats or chances, help for an application essay, what to do if you made a mistake in an application, what to do in high school to prepare for college, where you should apply, etc.), post in r/ApplyingToCollege\n* If you want opinions on which college is better or which one you should go to, post in r/collegecompare\n* If you have questions about federal student financial aid, post in the [FAFSA Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/avfpy3/fafsa_questions_get_help_here/)\n* If you have questions about making friends at college, post in the [Making Friends Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/b08xoy/how_to_make_friends_in_collegewill_i_make_friends/)\n\nEveryone wishes you the best and looks forward to seeing you on a college campus this fall.",

There's a lot of talk about academic programs (majors, minors, etc.), careers, living situations, dealing with faculty/staff/administration, discipline, extracurriculars, transferring, etc.  You can browse our front page to see a variety of topics.\n\nWe have the FAFSA megathread because one of our mods is a professional financial aid expert, and she answers everything that gets posted there.  We have the making friends and dropping courses megathreads because of the sheer volume of posts we get on those topics.  \n\nWe don't do admissions because there's a sub purely for that.  \n\nAnd finally, we don't do venting or ranting here.  We get sooooooo many posts from people talking about how they're depressed or anxious or mad or can't believe or can't even or are just ready to give up.  Someone created a sub purely for that.  Those posts often aren't off-topic for r/college, but damn they just bring the place down if we let them fester.",
