  "text": "I have so much anxiety about school right now I can\u2019t even sleep. This semester has been really difficult for me to keep up with and care about tbh. \n\nI\u2019m a really good student, I have a high GPA, I really strive for greatness. But I\u2019m at the point where I just can\u2019t even start any of my papers for my classes that are due soon. I know I should\u2019ve started already and with each passing day I get more and more anxiety about them. I just can\u2019t start. I can\u2019t get into it. I feel like the papers are going to be horrible and I will get a bad grade (which to me is a C+ or lower) but I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m like, fuck it who cares. I have never procrastinated like this ever and it\u2019s horrible but I just have so much anxiety I\u2019m like frozen. \n\nDoes anyone else feel like this? Any tips for just starting the damn things? \n\nI\u2019m a junior so this isn\u2019t my first semester of college but after being online for a year I am really struggling hard.",

      "text": "Yes. I think any good student feels like that at some point, just for the simple fact that they don't want to do something half-assed. The only thing you can do is accept that you may not score as high. It is ok. It happens, you will get over it. It doesn't show how good or bad of a student you really are, it's just a grade from many that you will get from now on. You will forget about it. You may also score high and do a good job. Anyway, anything is better than nothing. Any way to practice your knowledge is better then giving up. You will do a lot better if you try to not think about grades so much. Think about the energy you lose just worrying about the inevitable. Believe me, you will start really focusing when you clear your mind of that stardard you set for yourself. If you do your job, good grades will come anyway. Hope it helped.",

      "text": "Everybody feels this way sometimes. Don't beat yourself up about it, we all do stupid stuff lol. \n\nYa know, the easiest way to get rid of the anxiety your feeling is to get your assignments done. I struggle with this every so often and my stress comes DIRECTLY from my assignments that are creeping up on due dates. It drives me nuts. It makes me feel anxious. \n\nAs silly and straightforward as it is, the main reason why I do things prior to the due date is simply to reduce my stress. It improves my quality of life tremendously. It's totally worth the effort. That improvement goes throughout my college education and boosts my confidence. \n\nThe weird problem is that the anxiety that is caused by assignments makes it feel like you can't get the assignments done. That's the exact thing you need to do to make the anxiety go away. \n\nContrary to how the internet thinks life works, there are no simple tips or tricks to get yourself started. Discipline will get you started. You will get you started. You've done it before, you're a smart person. You know how to do it, you just aren't. \n\nThe earlier you get started, the better you're going to feel. Do it because you know you'll feel better afterwards. I triple-dog-dare you to work on one of your assignments for ONLY 5 minutes then you can stop. They won't be as hard as you think. You'll be fine. You're fucking smart. Do your shit so you can sleep and enjoy your life.",
