  "title:": "BTech CS then MS Physics or the other way round?",
  "text": "I am in between colleges atm, and very confused about what degree to go for. I have a slight interest(a seeming one) in physics and pure science, but i am daunted by the challenges in employability after a bs ms degree compared to a btech cse degree, which also allows more flexibility. Is it advisable to go for btech first and secure employability and then decide if i wanna pursue physics (also if its even possible to do so?) or pursue pure science first and then go for mtech in the cs field? What challenges could i face in each case? \n\nPs: i am getting a better college for pure science (iiser) and i know a little bit of python (still learning)and programming on the basis of which i think the field might be interesting",

      "text": "If you\u2019re considering a job within the computer science industry, I strongly recommend getting the BTech CSE.\n\nThe offers on which you\u2019ll receive and the money you\u2019ll make will be greatly influenced by your experience and skill set. Having four extra years with the opportunity to get internships and work on side projects will make you a more competitive applicants. And gaining experience is why I\u2019d also recommend you work for a year or two after you graduate before getting your MS. \n\nI\u2019m a CS major who wants to get an MBA. I plan on working in the city then going back to graduate school so I can eventually become a tech consultant analyst once graduate. This will also give me time to pay off some of my debt and save for grad school.",

              "text": "In that case, go with the Physics (or another science) degree. They\u2019re more employable than you think. So don\u2019t let the radio you from doing what you love and will be most relevant to the type of career you want.\n\nAnd always keep in mind these two things: in any career field a job is never guaranteed, and most people in their lives end up with a job that has nothing to do with their degree, meaning you will be able to find a job somewhere.",
