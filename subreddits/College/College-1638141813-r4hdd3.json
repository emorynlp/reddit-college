  "text": "Hey all, I am a double major in Strategic Communications (marketing/PR) and TV/Film. I have no idea what I want to do when I graduate. I\u2019m a great writer and speaker, and i\u2019ve joined a few clubs but none of them speak to me for a job. I could see myself working as a pr communications person in a company, or talking on radio/tv, or even doing legal work. I truly am struggling here. Law school or a masters degree sound like good ideas, but i\u2019m going to a private school now so i will already have hella student debt. I am a junior now btw. How the hell do i pick a career????",

      "text": "If you want to attend law school or want to have the option, you need to start studying for the LSAT now. \n\nYou could also get a job working PR directly after college to start making a dent in your student loans while you decide. \n\nWhatever you pick doesn\u2019t have to be the career you are in for the rest of your life. My math prof was an engineer for 15 years and then went back to school to become a math professor. My old therapist worked at a marketing firm for 20 years before realizing she wanted to be a therapist. \n\nNothing in your life has to be permanent unless you want it to be. Don\u2019t worry about it all right now.",
