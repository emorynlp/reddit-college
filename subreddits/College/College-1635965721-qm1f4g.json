  "text": "Hey guys I\u2019m resorting to my last option. I\u2019m a freshman in college and I have a speech due tonight. Theres a requirement of 5 people in my audience, and I have 3 slots open. If I don\u2019t have an audience of 5 people I fail and lose my financial aid which I use for my one year old daughter as i\u2019m a single mom. So basically, if any of you are cool with sitting in and watching my speech it would help so much. Its 2pm now and I\u2019m thinking of recording around 6. We\u2019d just join a zoom call and the video goes to my professor and thats about it. Message me!",
