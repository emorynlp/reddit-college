  "title:": "Can I get into a decent master's program at all?",
  "text": "I am about to be a junior next semester and currently have a 2.7 GPA right now. I also don't go to a very popular college and it's located in the city. I have low grades and I am thinking about either getting into a masters program for applied statistics, economics, or data science. I want to be a data scientist. However, I might have no chance because I got a few C grades in my early math classes and I had to withdraw from Calculus 1 twice. I am also interested in economics and I have a B and B- in the first two economics classes so far. I understand that I screwed up bad but I am thinking about changing my life around. I have a total of 5 w grades and I am thinking about trying to at least get into a masters program for higher education as that I am thinking about pursuing a career in data science or possibly a consulting/financial field like quantitative analysis. I have a total of 5 w grades on my transcript so far and I don't want to end up a failure. I just need brutal honesty. I am currently about to be a junior this Fall and if it's not possible for me to get into a master's program, what are some possible career choices for me? What else can I do? I don't have internships yet but I am looking for some experience in the field so that I can get accepted later possibly. Are online master's a good choice because I was just thinking about that. I also graduate in two years so does anyone have some advice for me?\n\nHow can I overcome 5 w grades and still get somewhere into a good master's program?? I withdrew from Calculus 1 twice due to unfortunate circumstances but what can I do to overcome my mistakes in the past?",
