  "text": "It was a Friday night, I had driven three hours to visit my friend at his dorm. Why exactly I did this? Even I struggle comprehending the query. Alas, my friend and I played madden for a bit while we passed the time. I should mention that I'm already pretty fatigued from driving all this way, so going to a college party wasn't very appealing. \n\nFast forward a couple hours, I meet some of my friends new college friends, we go to the party, it's crammed as all living shit. There might have been 300 people crammed in the first floor of a shitty frat house. The worst part was that there was hardly any booze at the party. Older people brought their own booze, but I wouldn't dare ask them for one. I ended up getting my hands on this pumpkin Busch, suprisingly not bad at all! I was essentially sober the whole time, getting knocked around all night, didn't want to talk to any of my friends new friends. I was basically whatever the halloween equivalent of a scrooge would be.\n\nWe were there for maybe an hour and a half, all of a sudden, a really cool frat guy bellows a phrase that I will never forget for the rest of my life. EVERYBODY SHUT THE FUCK UP!!! THE POLICE ARE HERE! GET THE FUCK OUT!!! I looked over to my friend, I start laughing at the absurdity of the situation. I forgot to mention that I was given a joint, or maybe a cigarette. (Is there a difference? I'm a freshman, please help) I had put it in my sleeve, and as I was walking towards the door, the son of a bitch falls out of my sleeve. I don't know where exactly, for I was focusing on acting cool around the cops. As I was evacuating the house, I turned around for one last look, I saw a young man angrier then an old man getting the wrong soup, getting tased. \n\nThat right there, was simply the only highlight of the night.. Am I thankful for the experience? No, I would've rather have gone home.",
