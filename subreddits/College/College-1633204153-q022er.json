  "text": "Me and my 2 friends want to get into the same uni in the united states, were from europe, our sat scores are 1420 1450 and 1480 respectfully, half of our activites were done and won together, we have generally similar cvs (outside of the essays ) and we plan to write the toefl together in about a week. Is there any chance we could get into the same uni? (Same major too) or should we give up and try to get the same state at least",

      "text": "Y\u2019all have great SAT scores assuming it\u2019s the same system as the US. What I would recommend is finding some schools in states where you\u2019re interested in going to and seeing their SAT requirements. Assuming it\u2019s around 1000-1200 like most non Ivy League colleges you should be able to apply to them and at least find one y\u2019all will all qualify for.",

Obviously, the more selective the school is, the less likely it is that you'll all get in (so Ivies and MIT and the like are a no-go) but there are a lot of great state schools that would probably take all three of you pretty easily.",

      "text": "Since y'all are international students, I assume that it's very easy to end up looking at the most prestigious and well-known universities. For any group of friends from anywhere, it's unlikely for all of the friends to get into the same university *if* that university is super prestigious, regardless of how fantastic y'alls applications are. However, the odds of you all getting into a state school would probably be pretty high. \n\nSo, if y'all are trying to get into a school like Harvard, M.I.T., UCLA, etc, then it's unlikely that you will all get into that school. But, if you're looking at a state school like Arizona State University, then y'all would be pretty likely to get into the same school. It all depends on the general acceptance rate of the schools that you're looking at. Some schools are just hard to get into in general.",
