  "text": " Is it appropriate to gift my math professor chalk?\n\n I go to UCLA as a math major. My professor is a male, I am female. His chalk is at the end of its life and he wont discard it, its disrupting class. I think I speak for everyone else in my class when I say that I am sick of watching him wave around his clearly ancient, white chode piece of chalk. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if he has been using the same piece for 20 years. It's broken, leaves terrible trails when he writes with it, and sounds like nails on a chalkboard because of the sharp edges. I have around 20 boxes of Hagoromo full-touch white chalk that I stocked up on before they went bankrupt back in 2014. This chalk is widely accepted as the best chalk you can get, and famous mathematicians have been known to use this chalk in the past.\n\nCould this be perceived as an attempt to get my grade raised?\n\n Could I get in trouble for gifting him this?",
