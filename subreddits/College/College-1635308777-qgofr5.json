It depends on the material and my interest but I usually focus on the big name stuff. you\u2019re expected to reread a lot and come to your own conclusions. There\u2019s been times I\u2019ve read the same book for several different classes.\n\nFor example, the worst novel I ever read for school was villette. I had to read it last semester and write a paper on the little girl Lucy Snowe had to care for at her godmother\u2019s. it\u2019s so boring I can\u2019t tell you anything about it beyond the superficial. I don\u2019t even remember anybody\u2019s name but dr John\u2019s and Lucy snowe. The gist is an arrogant AF xenophobic jealous pathological liar, Catholic hating 20 something goes to France to teach at a convent and finds love. I can\u2019t tell you why it was written or why she did what she did but I can recommend the book to you.",
