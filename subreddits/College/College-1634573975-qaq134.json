  "text": "I am currently in a hybrid taught biology class, at a junior college. We have been taking our exams online through Canvas. The last exam that I took, my instructor pulled the timestamp logs on the exam, and they had many instances of \"stopped viewing page\". This led to my grade on the exam being docked.\nI was on the page the entire time of the exam, as 50 questions in 45 minutes does not allow for cheating. Also many of the instances on her time log say that I stopped viewing and resumed viewing at the exact same time down to the second per the timestamp.\nHas anyone else ever had this issue? I'm really trying not to fail a class over something stupid.\nPer the canvas website if there's 30 seconds or more of an activity of a mouse it will also say stopped viewing. However that information alone was not sufficient enough to have my teacher reinstate my passing grade on the exam. \nHelp please!",

I would look up the appeals process at your school and you might have to go through with it.\n\nIn doing so, I would point out the issues that multiple students at other colleges have had with this; a specific example would be the Dartmouth medical school cheating allegations, which did end up getting dropped.",

          "text": "Thank you, that is helpful. \nI thought it would be enough to show her the issues with the timestamp and that the Canvas website says that it can happen from mouse inactivity, but she said i have to have IT prove that it could be related. I reached out to IT and I'm waiting on their response.\nI was also concerned to read on the Canvas website that it says these logs are not to be used for this purpose (ie determination of cheating), but that's what my teacher is doing.",
