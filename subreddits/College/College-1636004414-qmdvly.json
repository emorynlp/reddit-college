  "text": "I think she\u2019s entitled and spoiled. She gets 3,000 from her parents just to have fun and she doesn\u2019t even track her own money. She finally spoke to me after not talking at all. This is what got her mad:\n\nWe were at the gym talking to a guy about stuff. I thought she was trying to hook me up with him (because she\u2019s always looking to help me out in the dating world l which I appreciate) I got hella nervous and impulsively interrupted and muttered \u201cno,no,no\u201d Told her later I was sorry and I didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nI don\u2019t like how she doesn\u2019t understand my perspective. She later also embarassed me at the gym. We have a small school gym and we see the same people, I do care about not looking like idiots. First of all she told me to come to the gym for only 1 workout that was a few min and then leave. I told her on the phone how I don\u2019t like just going in and out of the gym like that. It reminds me of when I was too shy to be in the gym so I\u2019d go and leave. I wrote her this. In my text message I also told her it\u2019s \u201cjust as embarrassing as when I embarrassed you yesterday by interrupting.\u201d THAT statement blew it. That\u2019s when she said she got pissed. She says that that comparison is absurd. Like bro?? How do you not care what makes me feel a certain way? I come to gym and I say a snarky remark not gonna lie along the lines of \u201care we getting to work, or you just gonna sit there and therapeutically text.\u201d I said this after we were at the gym and she was writing me a long ass text message about how she doesn\u2019t get how it makes me embarassed. We only had 10 min before HER class to do what she wanted.\n\nLater that same day at the gym I\u2019m waiting to follow her routine and she sits at the bench right over and face times her boyfriend with full volume and ends up talking to his little brother. I was so embarassed as everyone was looking at and plus she was holding up space and not doing anything. So I ask to leave her and I left.\n\nShe sat me down for an hour to talk about how I DISRESPECTED her. I was so agitated when she said that. Sure I give tone sometimes and I did make that remark in the gym but I\u2019ve never held a grudge, never said anything purposefully mean or rude. Then she goes on the talk aboit how she\u2019s been disrespected her whole life and how she doesn\u2019t want to be disrespected by me. In my head im like bro wtf?? She also said that me encouraging and giving advice on her classes which she complains about bothers her. She said my statements were rude as follow:\n\n\u201cYou woke up early to study stats?\u201d I said this as an observation\n\n\u201cYou miss your boyfriend? Is that why you\u2019ve been a bit sad?\u201d She said a few days prior she\u2019s sad she\u2019s not seeing her bf.\n\n\u201cYou should go study then for your test tomorrow\u201d\n\nShe then goes to say how I left my sweater on her clothes rack. I said I\u2019m sorry and won\u2019t do it again and I forgot I left it there. She then proceeds to say that I messed up her clothing rack. I said o tried to fix them and put them back. And then she\u2019s like well obviously that\u2019s human decency but I still needed to fix them because they were messed up. I was like sheeesh I already said sorry and it\u2019s the first time.\n\nHer ex boyfriend of 4 years calls her aweful names and she still defended him but then had a problem when I make general statements?\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that she says I DISRESPECTED her as if I\u2019m obligated to treat her like a mom and I haven\u2019t even disrespected her. I think she\u2019s petty. **I told her Ill stop and watch my words but nothing I said was disrespectful, she then proceeds to not talk to me even after we discussed we would make an effort to change.** She even didnt respond when I asked her a question. We do everything together. I wish her the best at finding someone else to sit with through every meal and do stuff with, good luck. Really missed out on a relationship that couldve been. How will I survive another semester with her in silence? We really arent coming back together, its over it seems.",

I also am very much okay being on my own, I\u2019m 22 now and haven\u2019t haven\u2019t had a close group of friends since I was 17. So honestly, going back, I couldn\u2019t give less of a shit what a bunch of petty teenagers think. \n\nA couple years can be a HUGE difference in maturity in your late teens/ 20s\u2026.\n\nEdit: it\u2019s probably good to have a couple of friends, I would like some too that I see more than 3 times a year. But for the love of god, don\u2019t stick around with people who disrespect you and your boundaries, don\u2019t listen to what you have to say, use you for their own benefit, or just generally treat you like shit. I personally feel like I\u2019m better off on my own than with people like that, and now I have no problem saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d and leaving.",

I know you're looking for someone to validate your side of the story here, but at the end of the day this is all just petty drama. You either remove yourself from the situation and if you can't, engage with her at just the bare minimum level until you find yourself in a position to move out/disengage. You don't have to have an amazing relationship with your roommate, most people don't. No one needs this kind of drama in their life and hanging out or being friends with these kinds of people will do you no good in the long run. \n\nI know it might feel like I'm being a bitch right now since I'm not cheering you on about how right you are, but in the end the only person who has anything to lose from this is you. People like this will use, manipulate, and ruin other people's mental health and not give a single shit. Bit dramatic, but you know what I mean. Focus on what's best for you and your growth. Good luck with your situation.",

I fully agree the best thing to do is for OP is to remove yourself from the situation if possible (can you request to move to a different room?) or just stop hanging out with your roommate and only engage her about things necessary due to living together. Neither of you are obligated to be the others friend just because you\u2019re roommates, and if this petty drama goes on unchecked it\u2019s only going to get worse and make you both miserable humans and will likely affect more than just your living situation.",

I don\u2019t want to have to deal with telling my best friend to clean up their half of the room. Nor do I want to go to the gym with them, eat with them AND live with them. That\u2019s just too much\u2026it isn\u2019t summer camp. \n\nTo me it almost sounds like y\u2019all really need more \u201cspace.\u201d This sort of drama is the kind of thing that cropped up between couples over COVID \u2014 a little too much time spent around one another, not enough outside friendships and the like. So you start stepping on each others toes and focusing on the things that annoy you, not the solutions. \n\nOP, if you guys do reconnect (significant chance you may, sounds like you both just need time to simmer down), consider changing up the routine. Set boundaries. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the gym at ____ and then I have to go at ____.\u201d If she starts wasting time or whatever? Leave!

You\u2019re definitely the bigger person!\n\nTo me, you\u2019ve done everything you can. Don\u2019t apologize to her anymore! You\u2019re not a doormat she can wipe her shoes on. You\u2019re her roommate. Let her talk to you and hopefully she\u2019ll grow up and apologize for being a dick (uh, I mean jerk.

They had met her when she was living there with them when they were still together, but just recently got super close to her after they broke up. They started to take her side on everything and they would invite her and whatever guy she was sleeping with over for movie nights while my boyfriend was still living there. Then would be super controlling and defensive of her feelings when he eventually started to try and see other people as well. He finally decided to move out when they called him to yell at him in the middle of one of our dates. To top it off, when he tried to get his stuff back they refused because I guess before all this he had promised to watch their cat when they went on vacation and they would give him back his stuff afterwards. They also ended up giving away his switch to his ex.. or just letting her have it?? All we know is that it wasn\u2019t at the house when he was cat sitting. Oh yeah and a couple weeks ago his ex showed up with her new bf to drop his stuff off at his parent house with no warning? Just to see a reaction. He still has to pay rent too until the lease is over",
