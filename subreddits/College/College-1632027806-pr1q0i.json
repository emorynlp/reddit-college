It seems like everyone already has their friends and I\u2019m left out. I dont know how to approach people without being awkward/creepy. I\u2019m not involved in any clubs but I do workout regularly, I would love to approach people at the gym but that seems very creepy to me. I dont know how else to make friends, and quite frankly it\u2019s making me feel depressed.

You strike up conversation in mutual interests, become interested in the person if they are worth it, and be willing to shoulder the initial burden that comes with initiation conversation, because 90% of people seem to be absolutely awful at being social initiators. \n\nPeople are not particularly cynical, as it turns out.

Most of my friends are old lab partners), offer to start a group chat for some of your classes to work on homework together and ask each other questions (works especially well for more difficult classes).
