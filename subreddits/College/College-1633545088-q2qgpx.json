  "text": "There\u2019s this girl who is in a lot of my classes and she is SO chatty. She\u2019s a literal leech and draws in everyone around her in conversation. I can\u2019t hear the professor over her. There are 8 of us in class, including my professor and she talks right in front of the teacher. This is highly disrespectful to the professor, but she\u2019s so nice she won\u2019t tell her to be quiet. \n\nI hate this girl from earlier issues. How can I tell her to shut up in a nice way that won\u2019t make me look rude and create a new problem. Should I even tell her or just deal with it. It is quite distracting.",

      "text": "Tbh I would just tell her you can\u2019t hear very well & you\u2019re trying to focus on lecture. I know it\u2019s bad to lie but saying that you have actually hearing issues may make her realize that she\u2019s being really loud. Plus you never know who could be in the same position & is afraid to speak up. Good luck!",

      "text": "Can you not sit closer to the professor? Front rows are historically empty. I do it in my courses because I cannot stand children babbling about frats and shit. \n\nGo tell your professor that she's being disruptive. See if your professor will help. \n\nIf not, be direct and stern with her. Realize that she's not got a foot to stand on.",
