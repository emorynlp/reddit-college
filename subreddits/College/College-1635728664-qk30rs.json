  "text": "The country I am in has decided to shut down university for the rest of the semester due to Covid, regardless of how good things get, because our country keeps on going up and down in terms of cases. Our government is handling this like a pack of morons and making promises they can't keep, but anyway ..\n\nI am so fucking sick and tired of this. I usually LOVE studying and learning, but staying at home with my relatives I find it SO hard to concentrate, I don't feel like I am performing at my best and it agitates me. I wanna scream, or maybe cry?  I don't even want to be near people because I tend to snap or feel annoyed by them (I have anxiety), and I don't want to be like that. \n\nSo, how are you, as students, handling it? Any tips?",

Also, what's so \"idiotic\" about the argument that vaccinated people shouldn't have to wear masks?  That argument is completely valid.",
