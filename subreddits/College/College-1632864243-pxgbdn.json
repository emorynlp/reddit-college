I just second guess myself\n\nAccounting- I did good at accounting when I took 101. It came easy to me and seems like a good job. Busy season just scares me away. I also want a job with interaction and fulfillment. I also want a job that gives decent time off where I\u2019m not always at work or thinking about it.\n\nEducation- my mom is a teacher and says she does not like it. But I feel I\u2019d enjoy teaching. The pay somewhat scares me away. But I would like the time off, the interaction, and the freedom to pick a subject to teach. I also really like basketball, baseball, and football so I could coach.\n\nNursing- my entire family says I\u2019d make a good nurse. I feel the career would be rewarding and decently enjoyable for me. The night shifts and weekends somewhat scare me away. But I think the 36hr a week helps a lot. I also really enjoy science and learning about the body.\n\nSuggestions?

For the great deal of work they do, there\u2019s a reason why nurses complain for being under appreciated, and rightfully so. If just seems like based on your post, it may not be the best fit. Unlike accounting, nursing will almost always be a busy and high stress job.\n\nIf you consider teaching why not consider something along the lines of teaching in the sciences, particularly biology and anatomy/physiology?", "author": "kizeltine", "created": 1632880875, "upvotes": 2}}}
