Originally I did wanna go for electrical engineering but changed just before I start university for CS. I love CS but currently I am taking a CS class and we're talking about some electrical engineering stuff and it's really interesting. \n\nSo I'm wondering, to save time and money, if it would practical for me to go to the tech school in my area (my university is 4hrs from home but the tech school is in the same city I live in when I'm not at University) and get a degree in electrical engineering.\n\nIdk, what credits would transfer but I know it would be less then the original 2 years it takes to get the degree.\n\nIs this practical and/or a good idea?", "author": "samerkia", "created": 1632427967, "retrieved": 1632800767, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he0zfsu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu3nca/should_i_get_an_associates_from_a_tech_school/he0zfsu/", "text": "No. You'd be spending around the same amount of time (maybe even less) getting a CS degree that holds more weight than an associate's.", "author": "mrbmi513", "created": 1632440345, "upvotes": 1}}}
