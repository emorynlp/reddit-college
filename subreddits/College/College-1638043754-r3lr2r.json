  "text": "I am not sure how to do so or what college to apply to. I don\u2019t want to have to take any other extra classes, I would just like to know how to get my foot in the door for this position. I\u2019m 17 and from Michigan, I have no idea what to do or how to do it but I believe I have a passion for success like no other. I understand that I\u2019m going to have to put in hard work which I\u2019m capable of I just don\u2019t know how to do so. I\u2019m asking for help finding a college or trade school that will help me out with this career. My ideal position would be like filming sports games or the news on TV. Don\u2019t know how well asking Reddit for advice will work but it was worth a shot. Thanks",
