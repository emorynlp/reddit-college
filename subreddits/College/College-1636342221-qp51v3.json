  "text": "I consider my self to be very patient and I care about other people so much that when people don\u2019t consider me I get offended but I realize that I have higher standards than most which is a good trait to have most of the time. But when it comes to getting along with people it ends up hurting me most of the time. I have a good heart and good intentions. Long story short my roommate is someone from my hometown that I always let borrow my stuff. And he doesn\u2019t offer anything in return.. which I understand, I never ask for anything from him. I consider my self to be very self dependent and Introverted but social able at times. One day he said his parents got \u201cus\u201d a printer and I printed one piece of paper out and he was mad after he told me I could use it when I needed. He left the printer door open and I saw that he hid the ink for the printer. At the time I was mad but I let it go. It\u2019s been a little while I\u2019m still tight about it\u2026 I also asked him if I could have a muffin one night, he didn\u2019t remember saying that I could have one and He got mad. we have very different schedules, I always wake up before my alarm and I almost never wake him up. He stays up late and I go to bed early. I even bought ear plugs for this reason. We have different goals in life as well. This was not to bash on him, he\u2019s a good kid. But my question is after talking to him about all this stuff do I request to get a room bymyself for $100 more? I would much rather spend the remaining two semesters in a room by myself than with someone random or a roommate that compromises my mental capability along with my sports and schoolwork.",
