  "text": "\n\nSometimes when I do my homework, I\u2019ll get stuck in a question and review my notes and try again. If I don\u2019t get it right then after a few attempts, I\u2019ll ask my father for help. If I\u2019m really really stuck and he doesn\u2019t get it, I\u2019ll find the answer online and try and reverse engineer how they did it. Eventually when I do the work correctly and get the right answer, I\u2019ll submit the answer. Is this academically dishonest? If I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m that stuck, should I just intentionally answer the problem wrong after I figure out how to do it?",

If you can't figure it out, answer it wrong avoid academic dishonesty at all cost.\n\nSeriously though, what you get in class is just a proportion of what is out there. Learn more from others and the internet. It is only academic dishonesty when you're having someone work on your homework. Asking for help is necessary.",

Like I said, I use it to help understand the process and don\u2019t submit it until I\u2019ve actually worked it out myself, but I\u2019m still aware of the correct answer for that specific problem before I should know it. Maybe I\u2019m just paranoid I don\u2019t know.",
