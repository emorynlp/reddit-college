  "text": "I\u2019m not arguing that unintentional plagiarism  is good, should be allowed, or that professors shouldn\u2019t acknowledge accidental plagiarism. \n\nWhat im trying to argue is imagine it is evident that a student put effort in citing all of their sources. However they forgot to cite someone source in a paper. Then the professor reports them, why wouldn\u2019t they get the chance to simply go back and cite the original author since they did not have any bad intent in forgetting to cite? Why penalize the student if we are all simply human beings and make mistakes.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m not seeing the bigger picture and maybe it\u2019s good that unintentional plagiarism is punished.",

Someone's essay was 88% plagiarized and they just sent an email to them to redo it by a certain date. \n\nIt was probably purposely plagiarized and I wouldn't have felt bad if she got a zero because I specifically messaged the groupchat with the whole cohort and said \"they are using turnitin and it will tell the professors you plagiarized... Break out the thesaurus and rephrase!!\" And she still word for word plagiarized. Lol",
