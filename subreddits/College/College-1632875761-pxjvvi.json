However they forgot to cite someone source in a paper. Then the professor reports them, why wouldn\u2019t they get the chance to simply go back and cite the original author since they did not have any bad intent in forgetting to cite? Why penalize the student if we are all simply human beings and make mistakes.\n\nPerhaps I\u2019m not seeing the bigger picture and maybe it\u2019s good that unintentional plagiarism is punished.", "author": "Mr-Galoomba", "created": 1632875761, "retrieved": 1632945357, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"heocyu0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxjvvi/when_it_comes_to_accidental_plagiarism_why_dont/heocyu0/", "text": "My community college did.
