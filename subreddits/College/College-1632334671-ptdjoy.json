  "text": "Hi, I'm a freshman who's considering dropping a class for the first time. The class itself is 0 credits and is called \"intro to computer science\" but really it's an intro to the major rather than the field. We talk about things like how to get into computing careers and what to expect from the major. The problem is, I'm not a computer science major, I'm undecided. Most of the stuff we talk about and the activities we do straight up don't apply to me because the class works under the assumption that you already registered as a computer science major. So I'm seriosuly thinking about dropping it but I'm hesitating. How bad does a W look?",
