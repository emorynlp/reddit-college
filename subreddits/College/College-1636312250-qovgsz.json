  "text": "I have trouble focusing and tend to procrastinate a lot and it was a lot worse when we reached the peak of the pandemic. It was always Tiktok, Twitter, Youtube, Netflix, and etc. I have a problem getting distracted or not having the energy to finish assignments. Before the pandemic I was always focused on school, keeping up with assignments, and studying in the library. After a tough breakup a year ago, my mind went lost and I started becoming lazier.  I'm at the point that I'm aware of my mental state and should pick up the slack immediately before it's too late. I'm mostly on my phone and playing video games and I really want to get back to school. The addiction of being on social media and playing games till 3 am is getting worrisome. Does anyone have suggestions to keep me from being distracted or lazy? Any alternatives to focus on school more? Anything to fix procrastination?",

I say this while on Reddit at 2am (lol) but really do try to fix your sleep schedule. Even just 5 of the 7 days, force yourself to wake up at no later than 9am and take melatonin or similar to go to bed at a reasonable time and get \\~7 hours of sleep.",
