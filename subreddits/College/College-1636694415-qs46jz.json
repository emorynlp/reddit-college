  "text": "At first I went to college to major in Environmental Science/Policy but after I wasn't able to get into an Enviro class my first year, I dropped it. I considered getting an MFA, but decided against it because I don't know how secure that field is. Currently I'm looking into Data and Computer Science, but I still don't know which one would be the best. Really didn't think that hardest part of college would be filling out a declaration form but here we are...\n\nHow'd everyone else decide their major? What helped you make your final choice?",

This is something you have to decide on your own. \n\nDo the research, make pros and cons for each field of study, and try to talk to your advisor. That\u2019s the best I can give you, sorry :( \n\nGood luck!\n\n(I\u2019m music education, but my reasoning wouldn\u2019t really help you. It\u2019s just something I\u2019m passionate about and I\u2019ve known what I wanted to do since 5th grade.)",

      "text": "That depends on you. First answer the questions \nWhat do you like more?\nWhat classes have you enjoyed more?\nWhat kind of job would you like out of college or career path? \nWhich classes did you do better in? \nWould you have to take extra prerequisites core courses in CS/DS since you focused on MFA first? \nHonestly there is more to it but I\u2019d recommend talking to career people at your school. The hardest part of school is choosing your major.",

      "text": "At the time I picked my major I was really unsure what to do. So, I picked randomly, just something that seemed interesting for me. I know it was a bad idea, but at that time I didn\\`t have any choice. Fortunately, it turned out great. But I hope you wouldn\\`t be so reckless like me and at least try to use some [tips](https://ivypanda.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-major/) on how to choose or narrow down your choices. Hope it helps and good luck :)",
