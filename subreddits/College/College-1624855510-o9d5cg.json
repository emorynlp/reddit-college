  "text": "I started my freshman year with a group of six. two of them ended up being toxic and now we are at a group of four. one of those just graduated and I wasn't even invited to the grad party. found out on social media. and it made me realize that I think most of my friendships were made to pass the time and had no real substance. I have maybe 1 genuine college friend. anyone else in this same position? I feel so alone lol. How do I find a new friend group that's actually genuine? I have no idea how to fix this in my last semester",

Pretty big friend group freshman year, and then people drifted off, dropped out, graduated ahead of me, or I didn't want to be around them anymore. By senior year, I hung around with one friend, and she was more devoted to an off-campus BF than school. Graduation was a bit of an anti-climax. I have one friend I keep in touch with regularly now, and that's okay. We move on, we grow, we meet new people, we change. The same thing will happen with workplace friends. \n\nI was sad about it at the time, but have moved on. You will too.",

      "text": "Finding genuine friends is partly luck and partly a result of your actions. The main thing is to keep looking and increase your odds. And also be genuine, yourself.\n\nIf you want a deeper friendship, you've gotta both see that you really matter to the other person. That you'll go out of the way for each other. Friendships usually start out of convenience but if they're going to be really deep, lifelong type friendships the other person has to eventually realize they're more important to you than just \"someone you know\", and you have to see them signaling the same thing back to you. They have to feel chosen. So try to send out that signal.\n\nAs far as finding friends in general at college, it's ok if it's your last semester, it could still be a really good one. As long as COVID doesn't screw it up again, just imagine the guy from Yesman and try to be more like him (take all the opportunities you possibly can). \n\nOn that day when all the student clubs try to bring in new people, see if you can go and pick literally anything that remotely interests you, then go to one meeting each at whichever ones work with your schedule. Maybe you'll like the club but you'll at least meet other people doing the same thing as you, trying clubs on and looking for people to meet. \n\nTake all the opportunities you can manage while still keeping up with your schoolwork. \n\nSmile (briefly) at people if they make eye contact. \n\nIf someone in your neighborhood or building is being friendly, talk to them. \n\nTalk to people even if they're weird or a different age, as long as they're not creepy. \n\nTalk to the classmates sitting next to you about class and see if they seem friendly or want to exchange numbers for homework and stuff. \n\nIf anyone invites you to anything, go. Or at the very least say you can't, but invite them to something else. \n\nGo to free events. \n\nBe around campus as much as possible; study there instead of at home. \n\nIf you see someone doing something out of the ordinary like making a film project in the middle of campus or a group chalk drawing at 2am, walk up and ask them about what they're doing. Them doing something weird usually negates the rule of it being awkward to talk to strangers and they might respond well and start a random friendship.\n\nRemember that other people are feeling like you and want the same thing. If you have a sort-of friend on the fringe of your social group, make sure to include them and make them feel like you WANT to be THEIR friend, specifically. You'd be surprised at how much that means to them.\n\nI know college is a really good place to make friends, but if it doesn't work out for you, keep trying afterwards. It'll be harder, but you can do it. Just don't feel like college is the be all end all of making friendships as an adult.",

      "text": "I graduated a few years ago and had a similar situation. My friend group was about 7 people. 4 people knew each other from high school (2 from one high and 2 from another high school), me and another kid met the 4 through dorm and the last kid met through class. I realized during college that the friendship was not as genuine as i had hoped. They were nice friends to have but i started to realize that there were mini groups within our group and i was not part of any of those mini groups. Outside of the school year id rarely hear from them (unless the random group chat message). One time i found out of a summer party one of them was having because another friend sent a message to the wrong group chat asking at what time it was. \nAfter we graduated, from what i know probably 3 of those friends see each other on a regular basis, 2 others will try to see them once in a while and me and the other kid rarely ever see them. I think the other kid sees them a little more than me. If i see them once a year the other kid probably sees them twice a year.\n\nAt least from my experience(not saying this is the only experience), most friends you have in college are not genuine. Its mainly just to have the college experience. Sure you may have a few friendships that end up lasting a lifetime, but most of the friendships die once graduation ends because most people were just friends to have parties with and to have a group of people so they dont feel lonely.\n\nEdit: forgot to answer the question. If you want to fix it, its tough cause its your last semester, but i would say, say yes to every (or most) social outing, plan things and invite people, do your school clubs (hiking club for example) and invite people to do things. This is going to be tough because if your school was like mine, everybody kind of has their group set by now. I tried finding a new group this my last year and failed. Part of it was me socially shutting myself and part of it was the few times i did try it seemed people weren\u2019t eager to let someone join their group. Dont waste time,  semesters go by quicker than they seem.",

Combine this with high school friends not lasting as long as I thought they would, the pandemic decimating potential friendships and tbh my current friendships too, I was one sad puppy for most of it - didn't have many friends at all.

Also don't put too much pressure on this having to be the best years of your life and that you have to be a social butterfly in order to make the most out of college - it's okay to be alone. What is not okay is to feel alone when you're out with others.\n\nJust find ways to make friends off of college (which yeah, is kind of hard without work or college in my case). Online friends are just as valid as the ones in real life!",

Keep sticking it out and don't feel bad about how many friends you have. \nIf you feel comfortable, I'd definitely encourage you to talk with your closest friend about why you consider them a good friend and how you can continue to be good friends to each other in the short and long term. \nI'm finding these people myself too still, and I definitely filtered a lot of friends out in this past year since COVID stress really shined a light on people's toxic qualities.",

          "text": "I graduated in 2020 as well. I have my partner who I met and college and one other friend who I talk to regularly and see a few times a year. I cut off most of the toxic people before COVID happened, I just think that friendships are hard to maintain post college because the friends you do make rely on you being in person. You start off with a big group of \u2018friends\u2019 your first year because you never want to go to the dining hall alone. Then once you\u2019re in an apartment you drop some of those \u2018friends\u2019. You don\u2019t want to be the only person in your dorm alone on weekends, and if you live far enough away to not be going home all the time you make enough \u2018friends\u2019 that you always have something going on. You make some friends in your major so you have someone to sit with in class, you pick up some friends from being on intramural sports or in other clubs. Now that I\u2019m out of college I realize it\u2019s unrealistic to keep most of these now that everyone is in a different town, or in my case different states. \n\nA lot of people we are friends with in college are for the purpose of not being lonely on a campus full of people, but the real world is much better suited to introverted people who only have a few close bonds to maintain.\n\nIf you wanted you could live in a city and do the roommate thing again post college, but you probably eventually lose those people when they go to live with a partner or have a kid. I wish everyone I was friendly with in college the best of luck and I am grateful they were there for me even if they were just someone I could work with in class, and I hope they have meaningful relationships that make them happy, whatever that may mean for them.",

I know the basics about each of them, but there\u2019s not enough time to catch up with each of them regularly and have a close bond, the same goes for friendships. It\u2019s also helpful to be able to spend a Friday or Saturday night alone because there won\u2019t always be someone available to go out with you, or to come over. Being able to spend time with just yourself is an important skill because of you can\u2019t you settle for subpar partners in friends throughout life.",

          "text": "2021 graduate but agree 100%. I had to recently cut off a toxic friend who I considered a brother and who I did everything together. He turned extremely toxic, manipulative, and narcissitic during lockdown and I had to deal with all of that as his roommate and with other shit going on. Fell into a depressive cycle where I felt like I was alone by myself. Fortunately, some \"genuine\" good friends of mine helped me out and looked out for me and now I'm doing better. Trust your gut instinct about people and cut off ties when things don't work out. It is not worth your mental health/sanity to repair a toxic relationship/friendship. I've tried and came out broken and hurt. But most importantly of all, keep your genuine friends close and let them know you're there for them too. Consistently half of America has reported symptoms of anxiety and depression since COVID-19 started with young adults reporting higher rates of said symptoms as well as suicidal ideation.",
