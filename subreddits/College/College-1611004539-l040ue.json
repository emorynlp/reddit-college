I don't understand why. People just don't care about doing well enough to pass for some reason. It really blows my mind. How had these people been passing before being in the group?! \n\nLast semester I was assigned a lab partner with whom to complete 5 formal lab reports. The reports were beasts to finish, honestly. So he suggested we split the labs and do them individually, while sharing the fifth lab. Fine, okay. Whatever works. I agreed.\n\nHe failed both of his labs, barely putting effort into them. I had to bring the grade up to passing by getting As on mine. I did most of the fifth lab as well. That  guy would have failed if I hadn't done that, and I really don't think he even cared. This was a senior-level class too. How do these people get this far?!",

What is wrong with you as a communicator if you can't get into a zoom breakout room and talk to someone for two minutes? I have to communicate with people I don't know well in small/large groups over zoom all day. You can tell your breakout group what you ate for breakfast and discuss whether or not it was healthy. Maybe you are talking about more extensive groupwork, but same thing. Can you really not relate to your peers with all of the tools that we have? I've got to work in teams with people I don't know well all the time to keep the university running, and I imagine it's the same in many institutions.",

In my field (Finance) it would be a shame not to assign real world cases.  \n  \nMy experience is that good students tend to seek out good students as long as you allow students to form groups themselves. And adding some form of peer-evaluation with grade consequences typically also helps with free-riding.  \n  \nI hope group assignments also help in developing teamwork skills, but even if they don't, I simply don't see a way around them (an alternative would be to allocate way more teaching hours to my courses so that I can give individual assignments, but I think that's pretty unlikely).",

However, maybe the weekly meetings and such will keep groups accountable.  I didn't know the class was going to be structured this way and I might have looked into different options had I known.",

I even took all the messenger logs, gdocs modification history,... everything to the professors explaining how they're straight up being vindictive and lying but it didn't matter. They just said \"Well we do believe you looking at the evidence, but we also know you can do it just fine next time, on your second try - on your own - so don't worry about it.\" If I wasn't a grown man I'd have taken a fat, steaming dump on their desk right then and there.",

I understand people who are working jobs on top of it but at the same time I think in a lot of cases that experience and frustration your experience is valuable for you down the line.

I put every assignment off until the last possible second. Anxiety for letting the kids down is making it just a terrible experience for me. I hope its not the same for them.",

Plus it's basically customer service at the same time.\n\nI like building things from scratch or solving problems by either coming up with a different/hopefully better way to do something, or by building on existing ideas to make them fit unique scenarios.\n\nHealthcare is more rigid. There's not much room to think outside of the box. You memorize regulations, you memorize steps, you memorize techniques. Everything has to more-or-less follow exactly what others already researched. I'm not saying there's zero room for coming up with new ideas, it's just fairly limited in how free-form you can get.\n\nI like programming and working with data. I like finding a problem I haven't seen before, and applying what I know from other situations, coming up with a solution for this problem.\n\nA friend of mine in nursing school once pointed out to me that I could probably look at any of her lessons and at least somewhat understand some basics of it, but she said whatever the hell I am doing is voodoo magic lol.",

The last place I worked, I didn't care for the DON, but overall the company was good.\n\nThe company I work for now uses an automated system to determine staffing. It's all based on how much care they need. They actually say that a setup only shower should take an employee no more than 3 minutes. Total dependence? 20 minutes. Everyone is reduced to numbers. They want 1 cna to care for 30 residents and responsible for cleaning rooms. No separate housekeeping. I swear on any given day, the place has 5 supervisors and 2 workers. They consider management to be the director, the nurse, sales, activities, and dietary. They can all boss the cnas and cmas and have us going every which way.\n\nThen they want the med aid to be responsible for everything. If something goes wrong, the med aids get the blame. Lazy cna that they won't fire sleeping? Med aids fault. But if we tell them to get to work, we are told it's not our place since we aren't part of the management team.\n\nWe are supposed to do med order while at the same time helping with deep cleans. They literally at last inservice said \"med aid has to help with deep clean I said, \"we do except on med order days. It takes over an hour and a half to two hours to oder since everyone uses different pharmacies and several multiple pharmacies for same person\". Director said \"you still have to help with deep cleans\" !#$%#. Let me just clone myself. They don't understand how time works. They want us to fit 12 hours of duties into 8 hours and it's not working. Everyone is cutting corners on everything.\n\nSo our new time clock won't let us clock in from break unless we have been on break at least 20 minutes. If med aid is on break, they said we have to still give prn meds. Well, time clock asks us when we clock out if we were asked to work off the clock. I keep clicking yes. Director said that doesn't count. I said if I am popping out a pill and giving it to a resident, I AM WORKING! That's exactly what my job is. There's no way to pretend that isn't working off the clock. Going to be interesting how this plays out lol.",

It goes against academic policy to work together (even studying), using StackOverflow, etc. If the professor or department finds out, you get kicked out of the class for the first offense or kicked from the program for the second offense. It is worth noting that this just randomly started happening in my Junior year, so I'm not sure if it's a recent policy or if it's just a higher-level class thing.\n\nNever really investigated why, but I assume it has to do with actually *learning* the material, as it's super easy to copy code. It isn't a bluff either, I've seen people kicked firsthand for academic dishonesty, from class anyway, I've yet to see someone kicked from the program.",

Last semester my Database Systems class had a final project in addition to the actual final, and the teacher made it optionally a group project. Back in the 2000s when I had first been in college, a few of my CS classes would have group assignments with presentation. I think the CS capstone class allows for group work, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis reminds me of the time I was at a computing competion at another school back in 2006. They were designed for groups of 2 students. I did one for C# and a web development competition. On the C# competition, we just designated one of us to do the typing as we both threw ideas out. We got 1st place. The second place team was also from my school, and they only got 2nd because of some silly mistake. Anyways, one of those guys joined me for the web development team. We shared the keyboard just jumping back and forth, finishing each other's ideas. We thought it was the funniest thing ever. We don't know how it happened but we were cracking up so much we'd get scolded to keep it down. You know we got 1st place? Lol. We threw together a really sloppy ASP.NET site with an SQL database.\n\nSpeaking of copying code, we had a student one semester way back in 2004 going through and recovering deleted files on computers in a lab used in one of his CS classes. Teacher caught him turning in work without even changing the comments! Luckily it got sorted out and the students he copied were not penalized.",
