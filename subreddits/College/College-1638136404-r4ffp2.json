  "text": "I\u2019m currently in a community college majoring in Biology that requires us to also take Chemistry classes like gen chem, org chem, etc\u2026 and unfortunately, I\u2019m on the verge of failing my biology class. The deadline to withdrawal has already passed and our final exams are coming up in about 2 weeks, what should I do??? Idk if I\u2019ll be able to still withdrawal from the class, but if I\u2019m able to, what\u2019s gonna happen if I\u2019m majoring in Biology but withdraw from the \u201cmain\u201d class?? Would I still have to take it next semester in order to advance into the next biology course? I\u2019m on financial aid btw. Note: O\nI\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m much better at gen chemistry than biology so this is one of the reasons leading me to this unsolved conflict .",

Maybe speak with your prof and see if they have any recommendations (you really should have done this as soon as you started having issues).  You will have to retake the class until you pass to take any further courses that require it as a prerequisite (and also in order to graduate).",
