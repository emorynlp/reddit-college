I'm currently in a situation where I don't know when I will be able to study so having asynchronous online classes has been a huge support. I can work on it little by little whenever I want during the day. Some classes may be better taught face to face, such as maths or science, but Psych and English are fine online imo.",

              "text": "No, that would only be if the class was online *and* asynchronous. Sorry for the confusion, I guess we just assumed that since it was online, it would be asynchronous too. But it looks like your class is synchronous, meaning that you will have to attend your classes online during those set times. If it was asynchronous, you wouldn't have been given a time. But still, the benefits of online classes that I mentioned still apply to some degree - you still have the freedom to study/work on assignments at any time, even though you have to attend the online class at a set time.",
