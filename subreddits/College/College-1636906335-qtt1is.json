Use that time as \u201cyou\u201d time. Watch Netflix, read a book, go to the gym, whatever you like to do that puts you in a good mental state.

I work with a prof who can't fall asleep as early as most people -- never earlier than about 2am. Once she got tenure, she refused to teach classes before noon because she knew she was the most fresh-minded in early afternoon.",

For me, I get assignments during class that I like to work on immediately after while I\u2019m still thinking about it but maybe your professors assign work to be done prior to coming to class that you all go over together. Lastly, how hard is it to get to campus? In undergrad our parking situation was so bad that it might take an hour to park if you didn\u2019t get there super early. If this is the case for you getting there early may be a good idea. Hope this helps",
