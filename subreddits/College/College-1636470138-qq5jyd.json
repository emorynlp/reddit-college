  "text": "If I have felony arrests on my record? I've never been convicted of anything but I have arrests for assault with a deadly weapon three different times, drug possession felony, burglary and grand theft. Note none of these charges stuck but I still have slot of arrests that look pretty bad when you search me.\n\nWanted to make sure it won't be a waste of time can I still get student loans or use my degree? I want to do biochemistry\n\nThank you i tried to post this already but don't see so sorry if I posted twice",

Biochemistry is a great major so make sure to talk to any college counselor (the more you talk to the better).",

      "text": "If you're going to do biochemistry, I'd advise you get involved in internships or volunteering in the lab. Or else you'll likely need a PhD to do anything with it. Even a masters nowadays usually wont land you a great lab job. Hence why I switched out of biochem for computer eng. I'm in a co-op program and pretty much guaranteed a job after undergrad. If you're not certain you can get a job, then I wouldn't go personally",

      "text": "I think that going to college (and successfully completing your major) shows that you are putting in an active effort to define yourself beyond your arrest records. At the very least it might make the difference between getting the job or not. The best way to indicate you\u2019ve made an effort to change is to have hard physical evidence that you put in effort beyond what is expected of you. \n\nThat being said - definitely talk to SEVERAL professional sources about which subjects may be available to you, because some may be a waste of your time. If anyone digs hard enough (which many employers do these days) than despite not being convicted you might still be marred by your actions. Innocent until proven guilty, but the police blotters hold onto the information regardless. \n\nI would imagine it to be difficult to prove that you are trust worthy given grand theft and burglary - you probably won\u2019t be the first pick when it comes to a position involving high end lab equipment. \n\nThe odds are against you, but if you do your research you can give yourself a life far better than if you do nothing at all. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope it all works out in your favor!",

The campus I currently work in has a whole department for formerly incarcerated people, in order to help them get through and get their AA degree. It might be much easier to transfer if you have a history of succeeding in courses already. Best of luck to you!!",
