  "text": "I went to community college for my first 2 years and now I\u2019m transferring to a CSU (Long Beach, Fullerton, or Northridge) for my last 2 years next year and completely on my own for college. I think my debt will be high but not crazy high since community college saved so much money, but I\u2019m still stressing since for my career I have to go to grad school. My career pays decently but not that well ( I want to do social work) and I\u2019ve been working to save money but I feel like I can only realistically pay for a few months of living expenses then I will have to rely on student loans\u2026 and my parents are too \u201cwealthy\u201d for me to receive grants but too poor for them to actually be able to pay for my college, which sucks. (Thankful for my parents, I don\u2019t expect them to pay, I just hate how middle class students are screwed over). I\u2019ve payed for all of my community college out of pocket. \n\nHow are y\u2019all getting through financially?",

I don\u2019t want them to struggle. Not blaming my parents at all, they did the best they could with what they had.

What got me through was working all through college. In specific, I would recommend an RA position which gets you food and housing paid for. I will say, I did have to work up to 3 jobs at once before but it was worth it as I was able to pay off my loans shortly after graduation. For my masters, my previous work experience during undergrad helped me land a graduate assistantship. Not saying it will be the same for you, but getting at least one good undergrad job and knowing how to save can open up opportunities later on.",
