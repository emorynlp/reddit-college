  "title:": "Is it rude to message my professor over the weekend?",
  "text": "We had a forum discussion due this Friday and part of it is reacting to two other people. I have done my part on Monday, and I was waiting for others to comment. However I saw that my professor graded my assignement before Friday ( he never did that before as he waits for us to react to other people too) and he gave me a 65 percent. I always got a 100 percent before with a feedback that says great work, but there is no feedback to this one. I have no idea why I would receive such a low grade and I  want to reach out to ask what I did wrong, however I don\u2019t want to be rude and bother him over the weekend, but I also don\u2019t want him to say that I reached out too late. Should I wait till Monday? What\u2019s the proper etiquette? Thank you",
