  "text": "I took two years off after high school to deal with some personal stuff, and am supposed to be starting college in January. I have a meeting next week to register for classes, but I just got an email saying I need to do these placement tests to ensure I go in the right classes.\n\nReading/writing isn't an issue. I've always been pretty good with those. Math though. As I was looking through the practice questions, I knew how to solve under half of them. Apparently my brain *really* didn't retain any of the math information. \n\nWhat do I do? I don't think I can panic study in a few days to reremeber it all. If I complete the placement test and it shows I don't know what I'm doing, will it affect what classes I can take? Do I get put in some refresher math course? I have an undeclared major, I'm deciding between a psychology or a biology degree if that changes anything.",

They should be able to stick you in the class that matches your skill set. \n\nIf you do poorly on the placement test, it's because you need to learn more math. \n\nJust take the placement test the best you can.",

      "text": "The best thing you can do for yourself in math is do make sure that your foundational skills are in place.  Get on Khan Academy and go all the way back to the beginning (the beginning-beginning, I mean it!).  You'll fly through material at first, and that's great, but the moment you're not clear on *why* something works - never mind the *how* \\- that's when you slow down and start watching the explanation videos.\n\nPay particular attention to fractions, division/grouping, and all that middle-school math-as-language material - it'll be reinforced hard in Algebra II.  \n\nThis may seem like \"baby\" math, but one of the most common things I see is students struggling in a class not from the current material, but from some gap in their background skills.  In calculus, for instance, it's usually weak algebra that's the problem, not the calculus itself.  Particularly with a gap, you'll have forgotten some things.  That's okay!  You still have time to build those skills back.  \n\nConsistent practice is more important than *lots* of practice - twenty minutes a day, especially on those basic skills.  When you start class, you may want to get in touch with the tutoring center at your school right away.  A good tutor can both help with current material *and* diagnose and fix any background issues - but bear in mind that it's a specialized skill and not everybody is trained in it (commercial break for some shameless advertising: \"fixing\" adult math learners is literally my specialty and yes I am taking new clients...) so you may have to go outside the school's tutoring center and hire someone privately if you decide you'd like either extra help with class and/or someone to guide the building-back-skills process.",
