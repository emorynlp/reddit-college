  "text": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/q3bgbc/i_messed_up_and_helped_another_student_on_a_test/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nA few days ago I made a post about how I helped a student over discord while we were taking an exam (over Zoom, cameras on). Immediately after, my professor emailed me about provided answers to a student taking an exam.\n\nThat day was filled with anxiety, worrying about my academic career.\n\nMy professor and I spoke the following morning. He said \u201cwhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d I told him I didn\u2019t know what I was thinking, admitted full responsibility to it, apologized profusely, and offered to shut down the server.\n\nHe said I didn\u2019t have to do that, but I\u2019m shutting it down during exam times. He said the syllabus said that it was an automatic zero. He wasn\u2019t going to do that to me, and he may \u201ctake off some stupidity points\u201d but not tank my grade. He mentioned my high test and class grade, and that \u201cI didn\u2019t actually do the cheating.\u201d I don\u2019t think he will take any points away, but not sure yet. It would be VERY generous and I would feel incredibly lucky if that were the situation, as he has every right to do so.\n\nNeedless to say, no student is your friend (unless you know and hang out outside of class) and you don\u2019t need to risk your academic career to help one. Don\u2019t cheat!",

People work hard for their degrees, and when someone who hasn't put an effort to passing something does and ends up in the same place as you, that stings. It sends a message that you don't need to try, you can just coast by on someone else's back.",

If a person complied in letting the other person coast by, then let them both be? You do realize the person who complies because of a similar philosophy faces huge repercussions as well? At the end of the day, unless it's a academia-heavy career where qualifications matter more than the character you obtain through university and the rigor of coursework (which almost always translate to competence on the job), then let them graduate with an alright GPA coasting their way through. \n\nWhen they enter the real world, 98% of the time they will not be able to last or will face a significant delay in their ability to find success and fulfillment in their career path after slacking in college. I don't see how snitching on them and putting their higher education and career thereof in jeopardy helps them more than learning down the line post-grad. I think there's more risk involved here and potential for roadblocks. It can be easier for this person to realize after they graduate with some life direction cushioning that they are not where their hardworking peers are because they preached that message of mediocrity.",

Or an engineer who copied answers during their mechanics exams? And this also applies to classes people may not believe are \"important enough\" to be honest in. If you're willing to take such a huge risk and compromise your integrity for a relatively small payoff, I wonder what people would do for things with larger payoffs. \n\nNobody likes cheaters. Don't go to college if you don't think it's going to further your education and help you learn skills in your career. If you have a degree, other education or past experience, people assume you know what you're doing. If you haven't taken that seriously, then there can be real-life consequences.\n\nI don't believe that when cheaters enter the real world, 98% of the time they won't last. Many will continue to bullshit their way through life and consequently affect someone else with their lack of knowledge. Others will misuse their privilege to continue to make life unfair for the rest of us. \"Life isn't fair.\" Why can't we do something to make this statement as false as possible for the rest for us?\n\nOnly on Reddit can someone be downvoted and labeled as egotistical or self-righteous for denouncing *cheating* lol.

I remember in HS when some kids asked me for help(to cheat), I couldn\u2019t say no cause of all those things combined. \n\nMaybe some people got bullied in HS and that same fear carried on into college.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of factors in play and I personally believe that someone who was pressured into helping someone else shouldn\u2019t get the same kind of penalties as the one asking for that help.",

I was very apologetic and sincere with the professor(he was surprised by that), never reported it just changed the grade to a zero. He said it happens all the time so like dont worry.
