  "text": "I just got my first F on an upper division test in my life and I feel like crap. I am doing fine in the class with A's and B's on the homework and quizzes but I just suck at the tests. Currently sitting at a 73% in the class and I really nervous I won't pass especially since I have a job offer lined up afterwards.",
