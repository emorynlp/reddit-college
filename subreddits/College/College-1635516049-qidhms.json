  "text": "Just to realize during office hours this morning that I was doing next week's assignment! Someone else was asking about assignment 7 and I thought, \"Hmmm I can't find this problem on here what is she talking about?\" So I go back on our class page to check and I see that I've been working on assignment 8 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\n\nI honestly should have known something was up when the questions involved something in the reading we hadn't covered yet but I just thought, \"Oh maybe she just wants us to read this part and do a problem like that ourselves.\" \ud83e\udd21\ud83e\udd21 This is for calculus by the way. \n\nShe said I could turn assignment 8 in today and then 7 next week. Thankfully I was doing the problems correctly when I asked about it but it did take me a few hours of struggling before feeling like I did it right. But since I did this one correctly, then I'll only need 30 minutes to do assignment 7 she said lol",
