  "text": "I've noticed in the last couple of years that there is I increase in the amount of people that love to say how pointless college. I get that school isn't for everyone, but honestly I don't what I'd be doing if I wasn't going to school. Everyone now thinks that they'll blow up on tiktok or open a buisness, but in reality this is only a small % of people. A trade is another good option as well but that's not for everyone, therefore college seems like a good bet for a lot of people. It's become a quite toxic environment around attending college and I find it quite weird.",

      "text": "If you're talking about the opinion of people in general, in particular young adults, of getting a college education nowadays, my guess is the exorbitant cost, which is at an all-time high. Many people have to go into debt to manage it. Meanwhile, unless you are wealthy, wages are stagnant. So people are more questioning and less trusting about the real value of their education now. \n\nThis together with the disconnect between education and jobs- at least in the US, there is no guarantee there will be any market at all for your major or training.  You can choose a practical concentration like medicine or law of course. But they suit only a small percentage of people. you can just drop into many fields with no college at all and receive on-the-job training. So lots of people are wondering, what value does a college education really have?\n\nYou may mean something else though.",

Now you have to drop another 20k+ for your masters to get a high wage job, or have any hope of getting top level positions, which there are still no guarantees even after you spend 100k+ and 6+ years of your life.  \n\nBasically unless you are very sure about what you want to do with your life or have parents money to blow, there is no point in racking up that debt. You could be getting actual job experience and figuring out what you really want to do while making some money.",

I work with skilled trades on a daily basis as part of my job. I have tremendous respect for what they do. It\u2019s great that they can earn high wages early in their careers. The one down fall everyone wants to gloss over is the span of career and average top pay. A lot of skilled trades have a physical component to them, once the body ages, it gets harder and harder to do. I see & hear trades people complain about not quite being able to do certain aspects of their jobs, and passing work up because their knees are bad or back\u2026 etc.  My thought has always been if you want to do a trade, fine, just have a long term plan on working your way to owning your business and being the boss, or you may be out of a job due to physical limitations before you\u2019re interested in retiring.",

I think most people working an office job can respect the value that people in skilled trades bring and respect that they have highly specialised skills. The issue is the reverse, where many people in the skilled trades do not understand or refuse to acknowledge that people in the office space also have their own set of skills that command high wages.",

That way if you're tired of your career and looking for something new or you can't find a job after graduating, well, trade schools are cheaper and shorter than a 4 year institution. As compared to you go to a one year trade school, work in that trade for a few years, then think \"damn I'm tired of busting my ass all day, I'm gonna go to school\". And now you're in your mid 20's to early 30's trting to finance 4 years of tuition and doing 100 level bs assignments with 18 year old kids that keep coming to class late lol. Just my two cents.",

Then I realized I don't want to spend more time and money on a graduate program because I don't enjoy school. I also realize that my program gives me no marketable skills. I'm one semester away from graduating and don't care because I want nothing to do with my degree, but but stigma of not finishing it up is keeping me in. Going to school for 15 years then going to school again drives me nuts. That plus life events have made it even less enjoyable.

But there are a lot of students that do not seek out advice or concern themselves with any sort of value propositions when making decisions. \n\nWhen creating a college to career path, seeking out advice from multiple people (on topics from tuition to networking) and being an initial skeptic is the easiest thing you can do to end up with an outstanding self-investment opportunity. \n\nIronically, the people who are concerned about tuition and debt related risks are probably the least exposed to said risk. If you have spent time thinking about it, you are generally much more knowledgeable about the risk and know how it will apply to your situation.",

Convince a bunch of 18 year olds to spend tens of thousands of dollars (or more) on a degree for a career that they have likely never done. Going to college shouldn't be the default for people who aren't sure what they want to do. Maybe CC for a few classes, but that makes the cost almost negligible. Why not try a few jobs over a couple years and see if you actually like the industry before making such a huge financial commitment to a degree? \n\nThe bloat in degree programs is another issue. General education is what K-12 is for. College is for specifics. If you are majoring in Biology, I fail to see why spending a semester taking art history is necessary.\n\nI just shit on college quite a bit. I don't think it is pointless any more than going to flight school if you want to be an accountant. It depends on why you are going.",

If you are majoring in Biology, I fail to see why spending a semester taking art history is necessary.\n\nYou're blaming college for doing what it was originally intended to because other people chose to make college something that it wasn't supposed to be. \n\nCollege was never supposed to be a jobs program. You're receiving a liberal arts education because college has historically always been about giving you a well-rounded education. And I'm glad your general education covers everything a strong liberal arts education apparently does, but mine did not and I do appreciate having classes in subjects such as philosophy and history and the sciences which help elevate the mind. In any case, the *vast majority of jobs* do not correlate to a specific major and even those that do, often don't require a full degree. Of the top careers one can pursue from undergrad, investment banking has no clear degree (finance is the closest but most of what you learn in a finance degree is not directly applicable), consulting obviously has no clear degree path, and SWE technically does but anyone in a CS program can tell you that what you do as a software engineer is entirely different from a CS degree so even that isn't very applicable. In today's world especially, when most top jobs recruit through junior summer internships which are recruited by the time a student is a junior in the fall, college classes themselves don't and were never meant to serve as the primary way for one to receive a good job. \n\nCollege has always been principally about education, not job hunting.",

                  "text": "Agreed with that but that's mixing cause and effect and the top colleges also boast their strength in the liberal arts just as much. That's why 6 out of the 8 Ivies don't have an undergraduate business school; business, as a professional career, was viewed as no bueno for a liberal arts education. Same reason why most of the Ivies don't have a nursing undergrad (Penn is the exception, there might be others.) This is also why places like Harvard and UChicago historically do not have any professional schools for the undergrad and were incredibly slow to adopt stuff like engineering. \n\nIf you look at how college is structured, it's obvious that the primary focus at most historic and top colleges is not around jobs. It's something they've had to adapt to, not something the school was built for. [You can read here about the evolution of career services in higher education](https://nacada.ksu.edu/Portals/0/Clearinghouse/advisingissues/documents/Dey%20Cruzvergara%202014.pdf). You'll note that they only start in the 1900s because nothing really existed before that and you don't really see actual career centers until the *70's*. Keep in mind that outside of the West coast schools (Stanford, Berkeley, etc.) almost every university that is considered a top university today was founded before 1900. When you consider how many things exist at a university and then compare that to what exists for job hunting at a university, it's clear that even today a university's functions are not predominately centered around job hunting.",

      "text": "Well, one of the reason is that a lot of people are forced to go to college, but they are not intelligent enough. If not for the abnormal development of the Western labor market, these individuals would benefit more from pursuing a more labor intensive career. But now they are in college because labor intensive jobs are scarce.\n\nSecond, in the US, state funding for public universities has been declining since the 70s. As a result, universities rely heavily on tuition to stay operational. So tuition has been on the rise. Many people today work more than 20 hours a week while attending college full time. That's simply stressful.",

      "text": "There are a series of reasons.  Touching on a few, in no particular order:\n\n(1) A fairly new reason is that many are deceived by propaganda.  Over the past few decades, an anti-education philosophy has become a tenant of right-wing political and religious extremists.  A steady stream of exaggerations, misrepresentations, and outright falsehoods about college are presented.  In truth, of course, millions of mainstream conservatives and members of mainstream religious groups go to college.  The biggest danger to extremism is people who think critically.  That is what college teaches.  Demagogues need people who unthinkingly accept whatever they are told.\n\n(2) Some are indeed jealous, or have a poorly hidden inferiority complex over not having gone to college.  Statements such as, \"It took more to get my high school diploma than it does to get a college degree today,\" or \"I didn't go to college, but I've got common sense,\" are giveaways.\n\n(3) Many people feel that college is a financial scam.  They point out the large increases in cost over the past few generations.  They don't understand that decades of creeping inflation has vastly raised prices on many big ticket items.  Compare the costs of a car, a house, or a hospital stay to 1980, and you will see a similar increase in prices.  Wage growth did not keep up with those costs either.  Today, a new Hyundai Accent costs the same as a new Ferrari did in 1970.  My parent's new home cost $6K in 1959.  \n\n(4) Some people point out the quick reward of a career in the trades.  Particularly, the good money which is made within just a few years of starting.  Meanwhile, many college grads don't get the nice office, big salary, and stock options for a few decades.  The trouble is, when that college is grad is starting to do well, the now middle aged tradesman is beginning to struggle to keep up physically.  By 50, he may be unable to continue that physical work.  I would add that I have never met the \"250K per year plumber\" everyone who downs college seems to know.  College grads on average continue to earn much more than non-grads over the course of their working years, and that includes factoring in the cost of college.",

Even unpaid ones are better than having to pay thousands for job training. Everyone is at least in the same boat with regards to how financially stable they are. \n\nThen, maybe in their 30s, they could opt to go to college when they are more financially secure. But no, people think this hurts our \"educated workforce\" even though they can learn the same, if not more, on the job.

But I've always wanted to be a writer. Now that I'm 2 years into a 4 year degree, I'm realizing that I probably didn't need to go to college, because I already knew how to write well enough to do what I wanted. I'm also seeing my brother get a job right out of high school with no degree, and it makes me resentful of the fact that, in a way, I was forced to commit to 4 more years of school, when actually I don't like school anymore. Also, I've just become aware of trade occupations, which actually interest me more. Plus, I still don't know how college will help me get a job. So I diss on college in hopes that others will realize it's not all sunshine and rainbows.",

First two years is just a background in high ed. Last two years is a basic exposure to the career field you want that you wish they could have taught you in the first two years. I would go so far as to say that theybshouod move 300 and 400 level classes to the first two years of a bachelor's, and then require all students to spend 1 more year interning in the career field they want, and boom you have a bachelor's degree and you're ready to start work with an education background and firsthand experience in the career field you want. 4 years is a decent chunk of your life and money.",

      "text": "Honestly, I think media hysteria around what happens to those who don't have \"good outcomes\" from college is a huge part of it. The media loves to talk about kids who take on huge amounts of debt and don't end up with a good career. However, the reality is that almost all 6 figure+ debt is taken out because of graduate school (think medical school for example) and we know that college is very much a lucrative thing to go into. \n\nFor example, my friend took out roughly $50k in student loans to go to college. He went to a top university, he's going to have a job in IB paying $100k base and 50k+ in bonus. So he'll be making $150k+ as a 22 year old. Obviously, he's ecstatic, and trust me they don't hire anyone who doesn't have a college degree (in fact 90% of the people they hire have a prestigious education, much less a random college degree), but his story isn't in the news because it's not as interesting as \"kid takes out $100k in student loans to end up without a job.\" For example, [look at this story](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/09/poor-students-saddled-with-college-debt/405313/). They state:\n\n> That\u2019s more federal loan debt than low-income students take on at the for-profit giant University of Phoenix, though NYU graduates have higher earnings and are less likely to default on their debt.\n\nWhat they fail to state is that the average NYU grad literally earns more in starting salary than the average household in America. They mention the story of Rebecca Arthur, a Tisch grad who took $25k+ student loans in order to study at NYU, almost presenting it as the usual outcome rather than any of the numerous successful NYU grads who also took out student loan debt. \n\nPoint is, people have been sold this story about the horror stories of student loan debt which has created a distaste for college. That coupled with popular media perception of college being not worth it (fuelled by particularly, rich white men like Thiel and Musk telling people that it's useless even though a) they went to super prestigious schools and b) we know college is one of the best way for FGLI people and minorities to progress through income classes) has led to the current atmosphere which attacks the value proposition of college. And more recently, we've had the pandemic and the introduction of online classes which has further hampered perceptions of whether college is worth it. \n\nI definitely agree with you that there are other options that are good for some people, but college is by and large a fantastic option. Just do your research and know what you're getting into.",

There's a reason that over a third of college graduates work in jobs that don't even require a degree. \n\nDon't get me wrong, a degree in an in-demand profession like nursing, engineering or accounting is well worth it in terms of lifetime earning potential regardless of the of the cost of college.  A CDL or Real Estate License is also worth it. My point is, there are many viable career paths that don't require college.",

      "text": "So much of college was a waste of time for me. It was mostly just a refresher of what I already had learned in high school. I suppose they do it that way, just to bring everyone up to speed (some people don't have diplomas). I just hated having to pay for classes that taught material I had already covered. I tried the CLEP, but to be honestly that test was WAY harder than the actual class. Just felt like a shake down. I thought the electives were just a waste of time, and had nothing to do with my major in the end. I wish college didn't waste your time with arbitrary credit requirements, and would streamline your education and get straight to the point of your major. \n\nOh, plus it's expensive. Thanks, Reagan.",

      "text": "i only diss easy colleges because at some universities/colleges in the united states, literally anybody and their mother can get in and graduate. ditto for high school. bachelor's degrees from harvard/caltech/the top all the way to the bottom are all devalued by institutions nearing diploma mill status.\n\nphysics is not required for high school graduation or community college or university in certain majors. So theoretically a student could graduate from college without knowing why a wrench or screwdriver makes it easier to turn nuts and bolts. In fact, given the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of college graduates in the United States, there must be quite a few that have.\n\ni would somewhat argue the same for community colleges, though i doubt restoring rigor to community college would make employers value the associate's degree.\n\nbut if college and high school were made harder SJWs would attribute it to systemic racism or the rich trying to make it harder for low income people.",

      "text": "1) trades is studied in college. Not 4 year degree but still. \n\n2) extremely high prices and stagnant wages. You wouldn\u2019t want to go to school for 4 years paying 5-20k per year only to make something like 60k per year and have to worry about post-tax income. Plus, it\u2019s even worse if you don\u2019t have a set plan. Also, some jobs require a master\u2019s to stand out. Like take for example, psychology. \n\n3) people genuinely have a passion for other stuff. I know someone who got accepted into engineering but they dropped out to pursue barbering. They are way happier now than before. \n\n4) lack of ambition. On the other end of the spectrum, I know people who went into college but don\u2019t see themselves as worth it to go to college. \n\n5) get rich quick schemes are very alluring especially to people of backgrounds with lower income levels. A certain individual I know had a 3.6 GPA and could\u2019ve transferred to a more prestigious university; however, they decided to instead drop out and trade stocks. They were likely pulled by the \u201cMake $25k in one day\u201d and stuff. \n\n6) hours",

They are very very very against any kind of student loan relief, saying people chose to borrow the money so tough shit.  This is always joined by \"I went into the trades and I make more money than anyone I know who went to college and I don't have any student loans\".  I've seen it a million times.  Not saying there is zero truth there but this is an extremely common refrain from republican voters in particular.",
