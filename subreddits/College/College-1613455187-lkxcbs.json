  "text": "Online learning has completely obliterated my ability to do well in classes.\n\n I've always been a great student but recently I've been struggling to complete the most basic of task. It feels like I'm not getting an opportunity to catch my breath. The moment I finish one assignment theres 10 others that need my attention leading to this depressing endless cycle of work.\n\nIn the before times, when university was open, I was completely fine attending 6 hours worth of lectures everyday. The courseload didn't weigh on me as much as it does now because my day was segmented. I liked walking from class to class and enjoying the company of others in my Lecture hall. However, now just the thought of opening my laptop to watch a lecture causes me immense boredom and anxiety.  There's absolutely nothing to break up my day anymore. I do nothing but stare at a screen for 9+ hours watching lectures and typing out assignments EVERY day. Nothing changes. nothings new. There's just been me, my laptop, and zoom for the better part of a year. \n\nI just feel stagnant and that I'm loosing steam power. I'm not sure how much more of this I can take before I snap and I just wanted to see how everyone else is holding it together?",

My youngest went from being an A student to fighting to have the energy to complete any assignments at all, in just one year.\n\nAnd it isn't just my kids, either.  Our high school is having so many problems getting students to complete work that they've resorted to begging and even revised the grading (missing work is now a 50% instead of a 0%).\n\nIt isn't even just the students.  Both kids have instructors who haven't graded work in weeks.  Last semester, one of my eldest's college professors didn't grade any work all semester.  My daughter still doesn't know what letter grade she earned (she chose the P/F option).",

This isn\u2019t learning. It\u2019s mental torture. It\u2019s mental agony. Humans weren\u2019t made for this. But yet we survive. My only hope. Online learning disappears.

Just spending some time outside if you can be safe about it will help immensely. \n\nAnother thing that has really helped me is joining study groups for my class. We started with a groupme chat but ultimately found a few people I click with and we jumped over to discord and hand out in the voice channel twice a week or so just hanging out, working on hw, or discussing something that confused us from class. It helps get that level of social interaction out that\u2019s missing from in person class. \n\nAnd Ofc as many others have mentioned, reach out to the mental health available through your school.",

I'd go to my zoom lectures and other students would have done the reading and were participating in discussions, and I couldn't even bring myself to look at the material or do the homework. \n\nIf I could go back and change anything, I would drop all but 2-3 classes. I also started counseling through my college at the end of the semester, and I think if I had done that for the entire semester it would've helped, I really recommend looking into it.

Of course, if you\u2019re procrastinating because of other stressors in life (e.g. family, health issues, etc.), then obviously also ask and get extensions. If I had a student that came to me and said \u201ci can\u2019t stop procrastinating, I don\u2019t know what to do\u201d, I\u2019ll probably try to unpack it a little for them to see why they\u2019re procrastinating. No one just \u201cprocrastinates\u201d, there\u2019s normally an underlying reason (e.g. you hate the work, you don\u2019t understand it, there\u2019s competing timelines, you\u2019re burnt out and unmotivated, etc. )",

Tomorrow I\u2019m going to destroy my own soul by medically withdrawing from school, which means way too much to me because I\u2019m disabled to hell and back and I\u2019ve worked so hard for so long to advance and graduate... but now that I\u2019m finally a senior, I\u2019m so physically ill that I might just... die? Idk what will happen. No one seems to have answers. \nAnyway, I work my ass to bone because when I feel accomplished in school, I know that I\u2019m succeeding despite the things that hold me back. But now I can\u2019t even handle one class. My dumb self forced my body to a breaking point trying to force myself to read, study, do something whenever possible. And today during that class\u2019 lecture, I was balling my eyes out from the agony I was in, but still taking notes. \nPlease don\u2019t hurt your health by trying to force yourself to churn out assignments at unreasonable rates. Scale back so that school is comfy again; join a club to have something that\u2019s similar to a class in structure, but is more importantly a highly social environment/ online vibe. \nLook at yourself objectively. Your health, your happiness, and if this way of living is absolutely necessary. Do your best this semester. I hope to be back in school to finish what I started, but if I don\u2019t, then certainly I\u2019m a (currently) living cautionary tale. \nTake good care of yourself.",
