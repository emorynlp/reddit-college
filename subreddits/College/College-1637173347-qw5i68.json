  "text": "It has been like two months since college started and today the burnout hit me again. I haven't had this existencial crisis since the last school year, and I hate it so much. \nI tried to skip biochemistry class today to take a walk alone with music, and it has resulted in questions like: \"why I am even studying?\" \"Why I am in a biology degree?\" \"If I don't work my ass off to get a good grade, I won't be able to do a master\" and the ultimate crisis of all: \"I don't want to study just to throw everything in the exam and forget about it a month later. Is there anyway to avoid it?\"\n\nI had a two weeks of intensive lab practices, 4h everyday with 4h of class everyday. That was like half month before. And I have been skipping classes because I always feel tired. I get to Monday with more or less energy and motivation, but I'm burnout the next day and the rest of the week. I don't understand why. I'm tired of feeling like this.",
