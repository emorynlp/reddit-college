  "text": "I\u2019m 17 years old and considering going to community college in the fall of 2022 after I get my ged. I got kicked out of high school last year due to bad attendance and I\u2019ve basically lost all my friends. I\u2019m hoping to make new friends and build a new social life at community college. Is any of the party crowd in community college? I only went to one party in high school and I never got to live up the partying experience, ive also only had one relationship. I find it impossible to make new friends without high school and I\u2019m hoping to search for an environment like high school and I always hear people say it\u2019s high school 2.0. What is community college like?",
