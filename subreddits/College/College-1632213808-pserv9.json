  "title:": "I\u2019m miserable as a Bio major. Is it stupid of me to switch my major to philosophy?",
  "text": "I got into Bio because I love animals and I love our planet, and I wanted to be able to study and work towards conserving them/it. However, I believe I might not be cut out for STEM. \n\nI\u2019ve never been mathematically inclined and Chemistry is kicking my ass. Not to mention I haven\u2019t even started my math prereqs which includes physics. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m able to retain all of this information I\u2019m getting in both chem and bio, like all of the processes, systems, chemicals and stuff used in the different processes\u2026it\u2019s mind numbing. And at first I found it fascinating. Now I really just don\u2019t care. \n\nPhilosophy on the other hand I\u2019ve found absolutely fascinating and have been into it since freshman year of high school when I read Myth of Sisyphus. I\u2019ve taken much more philosophy classes than is required (before I declared for bio) and I love the profs in the philosophy department. Every science professor I\u2019ve met has seemed like they had a stick up their ass. I think being a philosophy professor sounds like it could be a great role for me\u2026it\u2019s just such a drastic change in direction and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d tell my parents and girlfriend\u2026I\u2019ve changed majors before\u2026",

      "text": "I'm a philosophy major. So my response might seem biased. Philosophy is highly sought after by employers. It shows advanced critical thinking and communication skills. I found several articles online supporting this.\n\nHaving said that, you will be writing a lot. I just dropped Latin because I don't have the time it takes to learn a new language, read 3 books at a time, and write 5-8 essays a week. But, I love the material that I'm studying. So it doesn't feel unnecessary.\n\nPhilosophy literally means the love of wisdom. Hope this helps.",

      "text": "You absolutely can change majors and it's not stupid to do so. Stupid would be paying for and getting a degree in a subject you really don't care about. If job prospects matter to you then ask to talk to an academic counselor or someone (maybe a professor in the philosophy department if you know them well enough) about what sort of jobs you can get with a philosophy degree. Look into getting a minor in something more general that might be more job market friendly. But it is absolutely not stupid for you to switch. It might be expensive and people might feel some type of way about your choice but in 15 years their thoughts won't mean a damn thing.",
