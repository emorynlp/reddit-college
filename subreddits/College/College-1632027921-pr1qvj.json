I don\u2019t seem to click well with many people even as an extrovert which kills me, my roommate talks to a completely different group of people who have never met me and want nothing to do with me, and tonight I got left out walking for 3 hours around campus cause they barely ever responded to my messages while telling me to go to different places that they then moved from. I do not have any in person classes as they all got slowly moved online one by one. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here and I don\u2019t know what to do moving forward", "author": "Good_Proof_8356", "created": 1632027921, "retrieved": 1632801475, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdgwdx8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr1qvj/thinking_of_dropping_the_semester_so_i_have_an/hdgwdx8/", "text": "If you\u2019ve already moved in I think you\u2019ve passed the deadline for a refund.
