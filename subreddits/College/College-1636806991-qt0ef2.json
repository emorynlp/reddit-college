      "text": "Make better choices. I lost a shit ton of weight while having a ton of meal passes for a dining buffet. I\u2019d probably get an egg white omelet and toast everyday for breakfast for example. I\u2019d limit myself to one hash brown. I\u2019d have a burrito bowl instead of a burrito. Maybe a turkey sub instead of meatball. The only thing I had was water and sometimes diet soda. Even quitting that is good. All these choices lead to better habits. Once you want to min/max by tracking calories and exercise, weight loss becomes even easier. By adding in those I felt I wouldn\u2019t be guilty eating out with friends, having wings or pizza once a week.",

      "text": "The gym is not going to appreciably help you lose weight. It can help bring out muscles you want if you do weight training after you lose the body fat by changing your diet, though, and release endorphins and be a fun hobby, so it is beneficial in that way. You can experience a change in body composition (fat v. lean mass), the degree to which you do dependent on your genetics, just from starting to weight train though.\n\nIn terms of diet, if you\u2019re determined to be exact and most efficient about it, you need to find your maintenance calories first, and get a scale. Get a food scale, and weigh every thing that you eat, and log it. Keep weighing yourself until you find your maintenance calories, checking by weighing yourself each week and seeing if the level of calories you ate per day that week made your weight stay about the same or up or down. This process will take weeks and maybe months, but it is accurate. \n\nOnce you find your maintenance calories, cut them by at most 500 calories so you lose weight 1lb/week. Still, weigh all of your food so you know exactly how much you are consuming. Keep at that until you have lost all you want to. Keep in mind that as you lose weight, you might have to lower your calories a bit more since your body is just burning less since you weigh less. \n\nNot buying the meal plan can be a slippery slope. It\u2019s easy to buy takeout, even \u201chealthy\u201d takeout. Ideally, you should try to make at least 1, hopefully 2 (or 3!) of your meals per day so you know exactly what is going into them. It can be super basic stuff like eggs, toast, greens, rice, roasted chicken, etc. Making your own food makes it easier to track. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t be afraid of taking a few maintenance calories days here and there. It\u2019s nice for your metabolism to get a break and good for your mental health. I don\u2019t endorse all-in cheat days since that messes too much with me and can wipe out the whole week\u2019s progress pretty easy, but a day where you eat at maintenance and perhaps have a bit more of a special meal or something is great. Good luck!",

Make it as easy for yourself to do what you need to do as possible. This may involve not buying certain foods that are unhealthy or making sure to buy healthy foods that you actually like the taste of. Among other things. You can do this. \n\nThe last piece of advice that I have to give is to motivate yourself with what you love. Think about why you want to do this, keep that in mind, and celebrate the small steps. It\u2019ll help you stay motivated, and oftentimes we feel motivation after we start something and feel rewarded for it rather than before. Love the person you want to be into being, show yourself a little more of what you\u2019re capable of as a unique expression of life!",

I suggest u do some lifting, eat a lotta lean protein and veggies, cut out carby shit.\n\nBtw most ppl don't mention this but getting in shape a lot easier if u fix up other issues at the same time.

Pay attention to how you feel after eating. If you normally feel fat or pooped like you need to just sit down because you couldn\u2019t possibly move after that meal, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Eat less and wait 20 minutes and see if you actually needed the other half of that meal. It\u2019ll really surprise you how little food it takes to fuel your body.",

If you\u2019re having a bad day and go, \u201cscrew this grade/studying\u2026I deserve to have pizza. That\u2019ll make things feel a little bit better.\u201d Or something along those lines. Don\u2019t constantly treat yourself. And portions are important too. Watch how much you\u2019re eating and when. If I\u2019m thinking about/craving something indulgent because I\u2019m \u201chungry\u201d, I think about if I would still be hungry if I only had another option like blueberries (I love blueberries don\u2019t get me wrong, but compared to a cookie\u2026they\u2019re different). And then make sure you\u2019re drinking enough water. Cut out extra calories, so don\u2019t drink soda very often. Sugar gets stored as fat if it isn\u2019t burned off, and all food eventually gets stored as fat if isn\u2019t burned off. And stress can also obviously make you gain weight, so make sure you\u2019re taking time to relax and also check on yourself mentally. Alcohol is a big culprit with weight gain college too. Lastly, make sure you\u2019re incorporating enough protein in your diet so you feel fuller for longer. I\u2019m vegetarian, but I am still able to incorporate enough protein, so it\u2019s totally possible. I eat dairy-related products/eggs, just not meat/meat related products. I ended up finding out I needed to be gluten-free about two years ago, so that was a bit of a struggle but I\u2019ve managed to adapt. But it\u2019s hard some days where I really just want a nice gluten filled pizza and can\u2019t. But having to be GF kind of changed my perspective on food too and made me realize how much we depend on comfort food to make us feel better.",
