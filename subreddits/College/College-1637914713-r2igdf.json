  "title:": "How Do Some Students Take More Than 3 Courses Per Semester?",
  "text": "I've heard of some students taking 4 or 5 courses per semester but I can barely manage 3.\n\nI'm a comp sci student. This semester I'm taking an advanced comp sci course along with a business course and economics course. \n\nAll of my time in my day is devoted to studying. Including when I'm on the toilet. I give myself around 20 or 30 minutes of free time in a day. That's it.\n\nAm I doing something wrong if 3 courses are making me feel like this? Because I keep hearing of college students (including STEM students) who work part time alongside their studies and I honestly have no idea how they do it. And I also hear of some students who take MULTIPLE comp sci courses in one semester???? How??\n\nIs it just my college that is putting heavy workloads on students?",

      "text": "Some colleges are easier, some majors are easier, some professors are easier, some people are just smarter, some people learn quicker, some people study better, some have better time management, etc. etc.\n\nAlways lots that play into it. I still did full-time courses when I worked full-time(sometimes 60 hours a week too) and I was fine. I'm just a student now and I take 21 credits and spend roughly 5 hours a week on HW and studying. That said, I've been in the military for 3 years and I am very efficient with the time I do spend working.",

      "text": "I\u2019m also a CS student and take on average 4 classes to fulfill a 12 credit minimum. I have to take some summer classes to keep on track with my credit requirements.\n\nYou\u2019re struggling because CS is a hard major. There\u2019s a reason why the dropout rate is so high. It requires a lot of hard work, studying, discipline, and resilience to get through the coursework.",
