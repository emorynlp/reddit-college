The value of a master's is that it gives you a specialized skill. In fact, I'm not even sure there are \"broad\" masters-- specializing is the entire point of the degree. \n\nI'm getting a master's in a field completely unrelated to what I received an undergrad degree in. It took me several years to figure out what I wanted to do. I'd recommend waiting on the master's if you're not sure what you want to do, because it's a significant (and expensive) decision to make, so you want to be sure the choice is \"right\" for you.\n\nI dabbled in community college after my bachelor's but before settling on a new path to take, so if you're really not sure and just want to try things out you may want to try this as it's relatively low risk.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632775657, "upvotes": 2}}}
