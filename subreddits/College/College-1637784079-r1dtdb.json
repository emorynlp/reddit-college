  "text": "I\u2019ve (23F) been a server since I graduated high school for about 5 years now, and I want to go back to school. I pay all my bills on my own (rent, utilities, car, phone, insurance, etc). I was originally planning on only taking around 5-6 units, but then I found out that FAFSA usually gives you extra money on top of the money for tuition, so I think I can afford to take more units. \n\nI was planning on either taking Mon-Wed-Sun or Tue-Thur-Sun off. I\u2019ll be at a community college until I transfer. Any thoughts or advice??",

      "text": "Time management is going to be key. If these are intro gen ed classes then they will be easy but time consuming. I'd start with online classes so you can go at your own pace. I'd also work ahead as much as possible for the suprsise assignments or projects.\n\nI only have one day off and since I'm a CS major and a junior then one class will either be 4 or 5 credits depending if there is a lab. I do about 20 credits a year and I'm on my fourth year and three classes per semester is what I can manage well with work and the workload the classes supply. I still learn but struggle a lot less. I made the mistake of being overconfident my first semester and took 21 credits with a 40+ work week. That semester took a few years off my life.\n\nThe first semester is going to be the hardest since it's something new and challenging but once you get in the rhythm of things and figure out what you can handle then the following semesters will be easier. It'll take me 6 years to graduate instead of the traditional four but I'm perfectly fine with that, and as long as you don't try to compete with traditional students then you will succeed.  Also, no shame in dropping a class if you can't handle the workload. Keep your sanity, trust me. \n\nA good tip is to try and get a day off from work at the same time a day off from school so you can use it to either catch up, work ahead or just chill out and decompress.",

      "text": "In my experience, it's easier to find Tuesday Thursday classes then Monday Wednesday classes. 12 credits plus a 40 hour a week job will definitely be difficult but could be doable. I don't know how comfortable you are with the curriculum, whether these will be courses you were exposed to in high school and taking at a college level, or if it's all brand new content. Right now there's also a lot of hybrid options or online only classes that should give you some more time and flexibility.",
