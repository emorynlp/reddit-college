  "title:": "Should I be insecure of being late compared to former classmates?",
  "text": "I graduated HS last year, all of my friends entered college and I couldn't due to my low admision score for college. So I've taken this year to study and hopefully enter next year. If I enter to a bachillerato(usually a programme where studrnts enter if they got a few points less than the limit of admision of the career) (called like that where I live) its a programme that lasts 1 year and if approved, you get transfered to the career by itself for ex: Law (bachillerato of law) I do think my current mock results are leading towards that result and it worries me even more. In that case, I would be entering to study Law early 2023 where my HS would be on the third year already and essentially I would be 21 college freshman graduating from law at 25 compared to my HS at 23. Im a bit insecure about it, just seeing my HS classmates above me, level above. Can someone cheer me up?",

I was going into school while some of my friends graduated with degrees. \n\nOnce your are out and in the working world no one will care when you started school. The most important thing is that you follow through. Whether that takes 4 years 5 years or 8. No ones going to know. I personally wouldn\u2019t of done well in college if I went straight out of highschool. But you got this and don\u2019t worry about what others think.",

      "text": "I am sitting here at 27, could easily get her jd degree and my college classmates have their jd now.\n\nI graduated from undergrad after 5 years and took a year off (I gig jobbed) now 2019 I got an internship then the pandemic. So beginning of 2021 I started working on what I need for a masters in information science. \n\nBasically because of side work I need my cpa license and I need a crap ton of math and coding to get caught back up. It\u2019s been too long or I never had it.\n\nSo I am not in the same place as I was in 2018. Yes I am struggling socially at the moment. That\u2019s another story.\n\nBut I am better off with the time off.",

      "text": "You shouldn\u2019t be insecure. Would you like your mother (assuming you don\u2019t dislike her) to feel insecure in her clases if she decided to change careers and become a lawyer? Maybe not. So why beat yourself up when you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong or even anything society sees as wrong. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others too much, it only hurts. You are doing what you have to do to be happy and advice your education. Not even the judgiest of mean classmates would judge you for that. And new people you meet in college will probably not care even after you tell them.",
