I'm an undecided major and I'm currently in the 1st semester of my sophomore year. Until now I always thought I'd do something in the science field which is why I've taken science courses and just Gen eds. Engineering was always something that interested me but it wasn't until now that I'm seriously considering switching in. But the bad part is that I'm literally 2 years behind the degree plan(I was just told by my counselor) because I haven't taken calculus or intro engineering classes. I\u2019d basically have to start as a freshman cause most of the courses i\u2019ve taken don\u2019t help me at all with a engineering degree. I genuinely don't know if I'm too late and if it's really worth it to change my major so late in. Has anyone been in a similar position and it turned out okay? Any advice?", "author": "lukestarkillr", "created": 1632515106, "retrieved": 1632800354, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he6tjlq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/purueu/major_change_into_engineering/he6tjlq/", "text": "2 YEARS?
