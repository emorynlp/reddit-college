He\u2019s in a new environment, desperate to make friends, nervous about going into any vaguely social situation solo. He sees you as the roommate he has the most in common with. \n\nIf you are freshman, I\u2019d give it some time before considering moving rooms just because it\u2019s a pain. Likely, he\u2019ll meet other people, make some friends who are glad to have him tag along- plus y\u2019all are going to fall into daily routines and homework will pick up. \n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d just try and shake him. You can be sneaky about it- casually ask him what his class schedule is while your on your phone and copy it down into your notes. Try going to the gym when he has class and you don\u2019t- go straight from class to get food etc. hang out in your friends room. Or maybe you want to just have some alone time in your room while he\u2019s gone and then dip before he gets back. Just be strategic with carving out some alone time and space for yourself. I think that\u2019ll force him to put himself out there a bit too- he\u2019s gotta eat so if he\u2019s gotta go alone and sit with the people down the hall so be it. Heck, he might find he gets on really great with them. You can help speed up the process by doing this. And you can take back control of when you spend time with him by being the one who invites him along- set  new precedent that you\u2019ll be the one who asks if he wants to join you when  you decide you want company. It\u2019s also fine to be direct and just tell him \u201cnothing personal, but I\u2019ve been around a lot of people today and just want some time to myself\u201d \n\nAlso if the compliments about your body make you uncomfortable just say something. Like \u201cthanks for the compliment. But I do feel a little weird with you watching me change.\u201d You can play it off in a teasing  tone- but bring his awareness to how weird that is and he\u2019ll be embarrassed and avoid it in the future. I think he is just trying to flatter you- from the situation it sounds more like he looks up to you than he is interested in you. \n\nAll that being said, if this behavior persists and it turns out it\u2019s just his personality and not him being nervous about starting college- absolutely move rooms. If you talk to the right person about how you\u2019re roommate is making you feel unsafe and uncomfortable in your own space, you know play it up some- they\u2019ll find you another room. You can\u2019t just switch rooms because yours is too small or your roommate is messy etc.-but if there is some psychological harm going on- be it your being bullied, obsessed over, getting unwanted sexual attention etc. they have to move you. It might take them a little bit to shuffle things around or find an opening, but you can move rooms any time of year when you\u2019ve got a legitimate reason like that. And if it does get to that point, I\u2019d start keeping track of the incidents so you\u2019ve got specific details to support your story. Also, bypass the RA in such a situation and talk to the head person for your hall.

I see mostly everyone posting that OP should immediately change rooms, and then I see very few people saying that OP should talk to him.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, I behaved/still behave very similarly to OP\u2019s roommate (but not to the extent that OP\u2019s roommate is behaving; I didn\u2019t stare at my roommate as they changed, in fact I just covered my entire face to keep from even seeing them as they changed). I tended to go out of my way socially to get people to like me, especially if we were friends. Deep down, I had a slight fear of losing friends due to not spending enough time with them. So, I constantly texted them and accompanied them wherever they went on campus to soothe this fear.\n\nThat was freshman year of college. I\u2019m currently a senior and have made many friends, many of which have developed into deep and long-lasting friendships. I grew from my freshman self, becoming less clingy and trusting in the friendships that I\u2019ve made over the last 3 years. It was definitely quite the growing process, but I\u2019m all the better for it. My sophomore year roommate wasn\u2019t too fond of my clingy nature, so I took the time to self-evaluate and self-correct, starting that process of growth.\n\nIt sounds like your roommate has found a friend in you, someone he can trust. Being so far away from home, he\u2019s probably looking for some way to make the campus feel like a place where he can belong and people he can trust to make his environment more accommodating.\n\nPlease give him a chance, but also address your issues with him. If my sophomore year roommate hadn\u2019t brought up how uncomfortable I made him, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today socially. Be honest with him. But be gentle as well. You don\u2019t know what sort of baggage he may be carrying with him from home.
