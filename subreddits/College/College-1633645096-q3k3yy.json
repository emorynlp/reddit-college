  "text": "I'm 24. I've had to work full time since I started school at 18 so I've been going part time. I took a year off after getting my associates degree but started up again last fall. I'll be done with my bachelors in about a year and a half. \n\nI hate school so much. I can never focus so I fall behind and its so stressful managing a 9-5 and school work. I manage to get A's and B's somehow but still it doesn't feel fulfilling like everyone says. It just feels like a waste of money and it is so stressful. It just feels like it's taking me so long to finish since I have to go part time. I tried to go full-time this semester so I could finish sooner but i couldn't handle it with work so I had to drop a class. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? I'm only going to school so I don't have to work in a call center the rest of my life but I don't know I'd my bachelors will even help. It feels so pointless and it feels like nobody I know can relate. Everybody I know seems to love college so much and I feel like a failure for hating it so much and for taking so long",

I work for a fast food restaurant, and at least once ever shift I get yelled at by irate customers who make a big deal over cheap food. That being said, I have at least the comfort of knowing that at least with a bachelors, if I apply to other jobs they may be more willing to accept me. Even if it is outside of the field I got a degree in.\nI would suggest trying not to ruminate on hating college. Usually I\u2019ll try to write down one school accomplishment a week, and I like to look at those when I\u2019m feeling frustrated.",

I left after failing out my second semester and went to trade school. I\u2019m sober now and not blowing it this time. This is my first term at this new university. I transferred from community college, moved here, and accepted this position as a machinist one town over. wish I didn\u2019t have to work so much but I need the insurance and company is paying for half my tuition. Thankfully they have me on weekend shift and understand that I cannot work any other days. \n\nWe were dealt a shitty hand and it\u2019s up to us to play it to win.",

So you have two options: 1) endure and get your degree (thankfully, there is a finish line to college) or 2) quit and go work in the grades instead (pays amazing).",
