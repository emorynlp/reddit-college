  "text": "   Excuse any typing errors please, I\u2019m on mobile at work right now. I\u2019m 21 this year and started my 3rd year of college in August, and I have lost all motivation to attend my online classes or complete any work. I am only taking 11 credit hours at the moment because I was dropped from my 3 credit hour class for not attending. I work 24-36 hours a week but only on weekends and I have nothing but time to complete my work. \n\n   My issue is that with the pandemic, my mental health has taken a steep decline. I mean, I wasn\u2019t exactly mentally healthy to begin with but now I\u2019m even worse off. I can\u2019t get any sleep and when I do fall asleep I can\u2019t get out of bed. I\u2019m just really struggling right now, and it\u2019s showing in my grades. \n\n   I\u2019m only barely passing one of my four classes and it\u2019s too late to withdrawl. My depression isn\u2019t an excuse for how shit I am at time management and I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t complain to my professors about being depressed because who gives a fuck, honestly? I\u2019ve kind of accepted that I\u2019m going to take a really bad hit to my GPA, and lose my scholarship but I don\u2019t know where to go from here.\n\n  There\u2019s pretty much no coming back from my situation because I have more zeros and absences than I do time in class, so my question is... what do I do now? I feel like I should take a break from school but I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ll come back. I\u2019m feeling really hopeless right now and I have no direction. What would you do if you were me?",

      "text": "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, and a lack of motivation is tough to deal with. I\u2019m in my 4th year of school and have dealt with this feeling before. \n\nWhat got me out of a rut like this is meeting with my professors. Basically I just say \u201cHey, I haven\u2019t been trying my best, and it\u2019s showing in my grades, but I want to improve. What can I do?\u201d\n\nIn my experience, professors generally want you to succeed in their classes, and having a conversation with them is incredibly motivating. \n\nThere IS a path for you to get your grades up, but you won\u2019t find it until you talk to your professors about it. Reaching out to them is the first step. Hope this helps!",

I\u2019ve shown them that I don\u2019t care so of course they won\u2019t care either. \n\nI more so meant can I come back from this in the long run? Like, is college even still an option? If you saw my grades you would probably agree that passing these classes isn\u2019t happening.",

You might be pleasantly surprised if you reach out to them. \n\nYou\u2019re right I haven\u2019t seen your grades, but I had a friend with a ZERO in all of his classes after midterms, and he finished with straight C\u2019s, so it can be done!\n\nBut to your point, you can definitely come back from this in the long run. One bad semester will not ruin your college career",
