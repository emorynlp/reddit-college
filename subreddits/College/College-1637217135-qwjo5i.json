  "text": "Heres the brutal reality of college: If you're lonely and dont have a social circle to get you through all the BS, you'll most likely fail or not get anything out of college.\n\nI have so many regrets. Going to community college, not latching onto friends the first week of school like everyone else does, not joining a frat, not talking to my professors, not taking core classes throughout the year instead off all at the end.\n\nClass is a joke. I show up just to make my professors happy and even then I'm just another number catering to their exact teaching structure and wishes. I'm still young but at 23 I felt like a ghost in my classes and at a different stage in life than others.\n\nI'm transferring to an online university to finally finish my degree and have at least something from it. I like online courses 100\u00d7 better than in person. I just think \"this could have been a module\".\n\nEdit: Do you guys think im a loser?",

I have no motivation to go to classes when I feel like I dont belojg and what im learning is a pointless, unecessary struggle.\n\nIn my case going to an online college will make it strictly about the education and piece of paper. Im going to be working a shit ton and try to form a social circle around my coworkers.\n\nYou can say I'm running from my problems but at the same time I need a fresh start and some hope.",

              "text": "The problem here is that if you're not engaging with *anything,* you're digging a deeper rut socially, and you're spending all that financial aid for nothing. For all you know, maybe someone would have talked to you in class and that would have been your new best friend (or you could have talked to them). Or you could have seen a flyer for a cool event where you'd meet folks. Or you could have gone to office hours and found a new mentor. If you're not doing those things, then of course you're not gonna feel you belong.\n\n\n\nAs for the \"fresh start\" thing, what are you gonna do if you get to work and it's similar to what happened here, where either you don't socialize soon enough, you don't click with the coworkers, or it's a work environment where no one really wants to be friends outside of work? Are you gonna stop going to work? If this social thing is a problem where your go-to is \"I'll quit and do something else\" it seems like it's worth taking time to figure out other ways to work around that before you hop into jobs.",

Do what you want, if you don\u2019t want to be a social bird than don\u2019t, but at the same time realize it\u2019s not too late to join into the social groups, make friends and experience different types of people. Not everything is dependent on the first week, month or year of college. Life is what you make it.",

There are countless people who go to college to do the work, get the degree, and get a job, nothing else. Your \"brutal reality\" is true only for a select few, definitely not the majority like you make it out to be. You don't have to feel down about your experiences just because it doesn't align with what society expects you to experience.",
