  "text": "Should I ask an AP Physics teacher from 11th grade for recommendation letter if I\u2019m going into Business??\n\nOr \n\nShould I ask an AP Psychology teacher or Business Studies teacher from 10th Grade for a recommendation letter?\n\nMy AP Statistics teacher and precalculus teacher from 11th grade left the school so I can\u2019t ask for one from her. \n\nRight now I have a guarantee letter from my AP Research teacher from 12th grade as I took his class for multiple years. But I need two more \n\nThe counselor also changed this year and i have not build connections with him yet but I was closer to my old counselor (who left)",
