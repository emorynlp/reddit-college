  "text": "So I went to this alternative school to finish high school and it was a great school, they treated us really nicely and it was legitimate too, but they printed off my name on my diploma and spelled it incorrectly. This is obviously a problem because it's not me, and not to be picky but I don't want a diploma with my name misspelled, so I have called and emailed my high school secretary time and time again, and every time I call her she kind of says yes that sucks I'll try to get you a new one. But she says this every time I call, then doesn't do anything or contact me back. I don't get what I'm supposed to do, I need my diploma. I've been calling this school about it for a month now. I don't want to be rude but I plan to go to college, and they need to see proof of high school graduation. This isn't something I can just wait around on. How should I handle this?",

But the secretary is not where the buck stops.  So try that first\n\nIf that does work you can file a complaint\n\nhttps://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-complaint",
