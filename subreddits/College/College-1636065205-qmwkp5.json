  "text": "Oof, oof, oof.\n\nSo, I\u2019m getting my first taste of adversity here in college today. Midterm grade in one of my classes finally came back, and it\u2019s a 59. This test was worth 10 percent of my grade. \n\nI\u2019m frustrated and disappointed in myself. I was doing really well in the class too, diligent about readings, assignments, and discussion boards. Then the midterm came around and kicked the ever living shit out of me. My grade today dropped from a 91 to a 79.\n\nSeeing as this was my score even with a concerted effort on my part (I\u2019ve taken this class very seriously) I don\u2019t hold out too much hope for a redemptive score in the final exam, which is worth 20 percent of my grade. I\u2019ll try my damndest, but I\u2019m feeling pretty demoralized at the moment. \n\nAnyone gone through anything similar? I want to bounce back from this.",

      "text": "i don\u2019t think your grade is weighted properly on the platform you\u2019re using. your grade shouldn\u2019t have dropped over 10 points considering its only worth 10%. you received 5.9/10 points towards your final grade, i don\u2019t think its a massive deal considering it\u2019s not a huge chunk of your grade. obviously still do your best on your final, but this midterm isn\u2019t the end of the world",

              "text": "sometimes the platforms just average everything together, not taking into account every assignment is graded with a different weight. \n\ni know the feeling, but i\u2019d say learn to ignore the total grade your platform shows and pay attention to the individual grades. do the calculations on your own, if you\u2019d like. it helps when i do the math to figure out what grade i need on a final or something to maintain the final grade i want",

      "text": "If you've been putting in the extra effort then your professor probably notices if it's an in person class. Ask him if you two can go over the exam during office hours and what you did wrong to see how to improve for the final. Any decent professor that sees someone actually cares about their grade and is attempting to correct it won't hesitate to help, especially now when some younger students are used to the COVID year where people could put no effort in and just P/F a bad grade.",
