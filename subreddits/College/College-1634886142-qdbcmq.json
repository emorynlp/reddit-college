  "text": "# Hi everyone! I am currently a 2nd year student at a community college.\n\n**I\u2019m the worst student you can imagine.**\n\nMy grades are not that good. I would like to get all B\u2019s if possible (3.0 GPA), I don\u2019t plan on going to graduate school. Overall, i have a 2.7 gpa. i do very poorly on tests, as I don\u2019t know how to study. i am unable to manage my time, as I am addicted to Reddit/TikTok/YouTube/Instagram. I am a procrastinator when it comes to getting assignments completed. I\u2019m currently taking 3 classes right now, and I feel overwhelmed, and I don\u2019t even have a job. I also get distracted very easily, and have difficulty concentrating on tasks.   \n\n# Anyone overcome this? How did you do it?",

      "text": "Well it sounds like you already know your problem\u2026.. managing your time. If you\u2019re on iPhone there\u2019s a \u201cscreen time\u201d setting that you can limit the amount of time per day used on apps, and I highly recommend you trying it out. Not only will it \u201cforce\u201d you to work on school work, but when \u201ctimes up\u201d you\u2019ll be reminded to start your work. Really only advice I got for you is limit the screen and get your assignments done first, think of Reddit/tiktok/whatever as your \u201creward\u201d for getting all the work done for that day. Get it done early in the day and you got the rest of the day to do whatever you want! Use sticky notes for a to-do-list if it helps, visually crossing off assignments after you do them and seeing what you have left for the day can be good for motivation. Hope this helps, I\u2019m finishing my associates this semester.",

      "text": "i kind of used to be the same way. i don't necessarily know what happened that changed that but i guess at some point i was like \"i need to get my shit together\" and started by just doing the bare minimum for my classes. i know it's easy to get distracted, but put your phone out of eyesight and just take small steps toward finishing those assignments. take breaks when needed, but i wouldn't recommend using those breaks on social media since that would seem to distract you from your work completely. also, working smarter and not harder really is the way to survive college classes. just take baby steps toward getting better grades and dont give up!",
