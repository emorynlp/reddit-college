For challenging yourself beyond YOUR boundaries. For not giving up and prioritizing what you knew needed to be prioritized. Well done <3",

He didn\u2019t get recognition at school despite how hard he realistically worked & tried to make it work. \n\nPlus, sometimes the time management requires people to stay up late because they can\u2019t fit it anywhere else. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this clears up what I\u2019m talking about.",

If you\u2019re one of those students, and you\u2019re also incredibly intelligent, then yeah you can just breeze through.\n\n\n\n\nGood time management is a very valuable skill, but it can\u2019t give you more actual hours in a day.",
