  "title:": "abused by the director of admissions",
  "text": "The director of admissions called me and abused for 20 minutes on the phone. It was unacceptable. She accepted my late application for Spring 2022, but now the admissions committee is sitting on it. For two months they didn't do anything. I finally confronted them yesterday and they admitted that they hadn't seen the application since I turned it in. If I hadn't talked to them yesterday, they would have put my application in the trash. Why on earth would the Director of Admissions accept a late application if they were never going to look at it?",
