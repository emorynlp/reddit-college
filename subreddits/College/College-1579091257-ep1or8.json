The ONLY reason the freshman 15 exists is because there is a big population of freshman that effectively ends up eating a lot more than they did at home while still burning the same amount of calories.\n\nYes, you *are* surrounded by junk food at the dining hall, but that's no different than being surrounded by junk food at the grocery store. Healthy options exist at both places and anyone who truly wants to eat healthy doesn't have to try hard to find a lot of good options.\n\nAs a person who lost a lot of weight and closely examined dining hall food, I would suggest the following:\n\n1. Eating lots of \"basic foods\" like fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs, etc. (because these items are pretty universal in terms of their content and they aren't something the dining hall can get a junky version of).\n2. Don't always avoid the yogurt, granola, and milk, but be aware of what type they have. My dining hall has very cheap yogurt (I'm used to Chobani, which to be fair is probably too expensive for them) that has more sugar per cup than our ice cream there. So if you ate the yogurt you might as well have picked the ice cream. The granola is likely full of flour and cheap grains (healthy granola contains mostly nuts and seeds but this is expensive and therefor unlikely to see).\n3. Go for the meat items (chicken, pork, and fish are usually the better options). These are typically all okay and something the dining halls are good at. The one thing I would look out for is heavy sauces, they will often *double* the calories.\n4. If you want to regularly eat the main line items that aren't healthy, my advice is to pair them with healthy options (and therefor they will make up less of your plate and you will still be full). For example: using the main line's chicken alfredo on a salad you made or getting a lot of vegetables and adding in a bit of the orange chicken.\n5.

Healthy options are there, no matter what your school or schedule is like.\n\nIn my opinion, there are 3 primary reasons that cause the \"freshman 15\" (which is not limited to freshmen or college students). \n\n1. Significant life change. Many just left their parents home, where they are use to balanced meals. They left their high school sports teams.  They have freedom to eat whatever they want and do whatever they want. Bad choices are to be expected.\n2. Stress. School is stressful. So are new jobs, and busy season, new kids, divorces and so on.  Neglecting self care and overeating are common results. Additionally, it can be tough to find time to cook, so people choose fast food. (That's an excuse though.)\n3. Lack of knowledge.  This is understandable. There's simple a lot of bad nutrition info out there. The info that the US Gov pushes ([myplate.org](https://myplate.org)) is made of recommendations that are most profitable to the Ag industry. They recommend 3 daily servings of dairy enen though over 65% of the planet cant digest dairy. They recommend 4 servings of grains (bread). Humans didn't cultivate grain until recent history. We didn't evolve for that to be a significant source of nutrients.  I would recommend anyone concerned with their health and nutrition to do their own research. A good starting point is \"Lies my doctor told me.\"  Dr. Ken Berry debunks many common health myths that have been perpetuated by bad science.  He examines what was wrong with the original science that supported the claims and presents counter evidence to prove it as false. He also gives sources for additional research. (It's available on audible too.)\n\nMy simple advice: \n\n1. Track your calorie intake.\n2. Reduce or eliminate breads/grains. You don't need them. You can get carbs elsewhere.  \n3. Limit refined sugars.  Get rid of soda.  \n4. Don't surround yourself with junk. If you are taking food back to your room, don't bring junk food. Bring fruit. If you aren't hungry enough to eat and apple, you aren't actually hungry.\n5. Drink water. If you feel like you need a snack, go drink a 16 oz glass of water.
