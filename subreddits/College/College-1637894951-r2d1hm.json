  "title:": "Dual Degree in BBA/Physics as a Transfer Student",
  "text": "Heyo, I'm currently planning on going to community college to do the 2+2 program due to financial circumstances. With that being said, I'm currently planning on a dual degree in Supply Chain Management and Physics when I transfer from community college to a university. To make sure that it's plausible in terms of transfer credits, I researched course equivalencies and suggested courses to take in community college by the university I'm planning on transferring to and it seems like there's an overlap for the majority of the courses. Extra classes/courses I would have to take for transfer credits would be around 6 classes.\n\nSo, I was wondering if I do transfer over to the university and attempt a dual degree, would I have to take an additional year (so 3 years in the uni) or more than that?",

Summer courses could definitely alleviate some burden when the time comes. \n\nWould you say taking an extra year could unlock more time for extracurriculars, work experience, networking, etc. or would that same level of extra coursework remain?\n\nThanks again for the advice!",

              "text": "No problem! I think if you took an extra year along with taking a few courses over the summer, you could potentially have some extra time for networking, extra curricular, etc. It really all depends on how you decide to schedule your semesters and your time management skills.",
