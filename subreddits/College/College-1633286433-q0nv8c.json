  "text": "So im majoring in CS and i fell really behind in my class thinking ill be able to catch up and now I feel like I cant catch up and im just lost with everything. I have a project due and I have no clue how to even start it or what to even write. Im gonna be honest I think im gonna fail and what makes it scary for me is that Im trying to major in CS so im terrified. Its to late to drop this class without a W. I know W are bad but im on academic probation because of dumb mistakes I made. I just dont know what to do. Is it bad if I just take the W. Im 100% planning to retake this class and hopefully replace the W or F that I receive. I just dont know if I should stick with the class and try my best and just get an F if it comes down to it or just drop it and take the W. What should I do.",

      "text": "Idk I took an F once and then I retook the class and got an A. The F will appear on my transcripts but doesn't affect my GPA. I did this to avoid a drop that counts against my 6 drops. And if had dropped it I think I would have had to repay the financial aid. \n\nI would ask the college if they will replace the F with a new grade first.",
