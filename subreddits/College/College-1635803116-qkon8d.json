  "text": "I'm a very, very anxious person. I'm always anxious when I have to start my week on Monday. However, I have an American professor, and being around him calms me down. I become hopeful. His voice is soothing and he's supporting of his students' research paper. I feel lucky that I can start my Monday with his seminar.\n\nDoes anyone else relates to that?",

      "text": "Some people give off good vibes and have soothing voices, I don't think that's weird at all (unless it becomes inappropriate). And its understandable especially since you say that he's supportive of his students - that can be motivating and make you more appreciative of his teaching so you may not feel as anxious to come to class. It's fine, don't think about it too much. We all encounter teachers who leave a positive mark on us, he sounds like one of them!",
