The seniors of the program advised us it will be hard but there hasn\u2019t been a student to flunk out in YEARS. On canvas we can see the class average, who got the highest and who got the lowest. Everyone is making high 80s, 90s, even 100s and I\u2019m making 40s and 50s. My professor posted another test grade and surprise! I\u2019m the lowest grade. I can\u2019t even bring myself to finish this paper due at 8am. I\u2019ve been in college for 5 years since I keep changing my major. I\u2019m scared I will be the first student to fail in the over a decade. I\u2019d rather drop out than save myself the lifelong humiliation, but I can\u2019t fathom the thought of not having a path and disappointing my entire family, so I have to keep trying but it\u2019s so hard because I know the content of the courses will not get any easier.", "author": "offlinebrat", "created": 1632711834, "retrieved": 1632800187, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"hefjkbh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw8ebd/dropping_out_as_a_first_gen/hefjkbh/", "text": "You need to do several things:\n\nShort term: \n\n1. Visit your professor and/or class TA to help you understand the \"basics\" of the class as to build a solid foundation of knowledge. All classes get more complicated as the semester progresses.\n\n2. Dedicate extra time to studying until you are caught up and then establish a routine to keep pace with the class demands.\n\nMedium to long term:\n\nVisit your college advisor to find  the shortest path to graduation  There is no such thing as a \"perfect\" major. Changing from major to major all you are doing is wasting time, money and the opportunity to make real money. Focus on a practical major to get a job. While on your first job after graduation, keep learning on the side and change paths if necessary, but please stop changing majors in college.\n\nA college diploma opens lots of doors. There are some job postings that says \"college degree required, all majors welcomed\". Get that darn piece of paper which shows an employer you are committed to completing a job (in your current case it is  graduation from college).\n\nFollow the \"fun\" subjects as your hobbies after you start working.", "author": "coqui82", "created": 1632713113, "upvotes": 19}}}
