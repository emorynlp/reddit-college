  "text": "I accidentally turned in my narrative essay to a wrong class and I can\u2019t take it back. I\u2019m so upset at this moment because my professor for the class that I accidentally turned in my narrative essay for, has told us that if we turn in a wrong assignment she\u2019ll give us a bad grade. I already emailed her apologizing for my mistake and asked if I could show it to her the correct assignment during zoom class. She hasn\u2019t responded back. I don\u2019t know what else to do and I\u2019m so pissed that this happened to me! Now I\u2019m just stressed that she won\u2019t give me a good grade for the midterm.",

Also, she did tell us that we\u2019re not allowed to send her assignments through email so that\u2019s why I asked her.",

      "text": "If you can email the correct assignment over, I would. I don't understand teachers who have that rule. That said, I have a professor who has that rule and because something I submitted somehow had the content deleted, he allowed me to email it over. Some make the rule but they're willing to make exceptions...worth a shot! Good luck.",
