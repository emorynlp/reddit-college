  "text": "Hello everyone, so as the title states, I\u2019ve withdrawn from a class before about a year or 2 ago now but I had to recently withdraw from Chemistry this semester and now I may have to withdraw from Calculus this semester as well. I have a 68% in the class and one of our exams haven\u2019t been graded but I know for a fact I did very poorly on it, I studied for the wrong sections. We have a test next Friday and that\u2019s also the last day to withdraw. Any advice?",
