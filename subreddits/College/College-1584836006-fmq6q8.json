  "title:": "Need advice! Parents arguing while doing online classes during COVID-19",
  "text": "Hi all. This is my very first post on reddit and I\u2019m on mobile so I apologize if I violate any rules. \n\nDue to COVID-19 my college has decided to move online for the remainder of the semester. Now I\u2019m home all day since my job is also shut down for at least a month. My problem lies with my parents. They constantly argue which means I can\u2019t focus on my school work. I always try to remind them that I\u2019m studying, but that seems useless. \n\nMy mom is currently still working away from home as of yet which means I do get some peace and quiet during the weekdays. My father usually keeps to himself during the day. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add that coffee shops and all restaurants have closed their lobbies.\n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m trying to study for online classes while in self isolation, but my parents constantly argue and I have no where else to study.",

      "text": "Lots of excellent suggestions: Here's more that may not already be in the thread:  \n\\* Pretend there's a bad soap opera playing loudly on the TV in the living room. That way their arguing won't be so distracting  \n\\* Assuming at least one of your parents is watching TV, set them up with a pair of headphones for the television as a gift so they can 'hear the TV better.' That will reduce arguing considerably.  \n\\* Get the other parent a cheap music player (old iPod, etc., ideally something you already have) with headphones and load it up with their favorite music. Much harder for them to argue if they're entertained and distracted.  \n\\* Do they always argue? If not, then they may just have pent up anxiety that needs an outlet.  \n\\* Instead of asking them to stop arguing, remind or suggest to them some task you know they believe is 'urgent'. \"Did you check the news yet today? Have you taken Spot for a walk? Is neighbor Ida alright?\" This seemingly innocuous question will plant the seed for a behavior change. Might take some time to find the best category of suggestions, but when you find it, it's awesome.  \nYou may have to help start the behavior you're suggesting. For example, you suggest a parent walk the dog / visit the neighbor (safe distance, of course) / check to make sure the sky is still blue (needs to be something the parent thinks is important or valuable in some way). They resist and you suggest, \"No problem I'll go with you.\" You start the walk and then remember that you have an urgent paper to write / turn in / work on. Go home and study.  \nThey can't argue if they're not in the same space.",

I know it is embarrassing and all, but it let's them know what you are up against. Tell them your options, if any and ask for suggestions. Tell them how you feel. Sometimes they can be totally understanding, you never know.... Let them know that your dorm was your safe space where you could study, but now that you are home, you are finding it increasingly hard. Be honest. They don't know what you are struggling with unless you say something.",
