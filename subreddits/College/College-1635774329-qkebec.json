      "text": "Potentially.\n\nIt's not a simple answer. You should speak to an attorney in your state and a financial planner.\n\nDepending on the amount of savings, it may or may not be worth it after the expense of having the proper paperwork and structure for the marriage set up. This is one of those things you will be paying someone decent money to set up right so there are no issues later. I would expect to pay $5k to go through the process from beginning to end (assuming your finances are pretty basic) so take that off of the expected savings.",

So for quite a few people there is a potential middle five figure benefit.\n\nIt's really all case by case. Some people won't benefit at all. A student couple with wealthy families who won't help with college would be the perfect candidates for it.\n\nIn financial planning, popular or simple isn't always the best option. Sometimes it is worth being unorthodox. A lot of people pass on exploring lucrative solutions simply because they think they are too complicated or not possible. Often they are not.",
