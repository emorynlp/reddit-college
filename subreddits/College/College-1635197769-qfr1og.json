      "text": "1. If your city has an Amazon returns wholesale site, go there on the weekends and get good at buying returned goods to sell on Ebay/Marketplace.\n\n2. Provide a custom service to students that is normally expensive or isn't marketed well to them. Tailoring pants is one example: the shops around me are run by boomers and none of them have websites. You can learn this in one week practicing on Goodwill pants and charge $10-20 per pair thereon after.\n\n3. Tutoring high school students. It pays much better because their parents are involved and more motivated. If you have a really good standard testing scores and studied a lot for them, that tutoring pays *very* well (if you can show your students have a high average score increase, we are talking easily $50/hr in cities).\n\n3. Passive income: with existing money or money from jobs, look into checking account bonuses. If you are saving money or there is some volume in your spending, it might be a good idea to open a new account once in a while. It's common for them to offer a few hundred dollars if you do something like have $1k in payroll go through over 90 days. Your mileage may vary. No real credit score affect, just read the fine print on and remember to close it.",
