  "text": "I wish I was making this up. First our classes were 90 minutes long, and that was probably the perfect lenght honestly.\n\nThen they decided to make them 3 hours long. Okay, it was already rough, but I could handle it.\n\nBut now they decided that our economy class with be in 10 hour blocks. 10 HOURS! Wo thought thats a good idea? I have no idea how I am supposed to pay attention to one thing for that long. Not to mention there is only one break during those 10 hours (30 minutes in the afternoon).",

But like do a test run on the weekend where you try to be focused for 10 hours and check what works. It might be good if at the end of said day you do something to decompress, I'd recommend skydiving, but hmm, a beer or going somewhere put headphones on and dance like you give a damn are valid choices a long ass bath in the bathtub is also a good idea.",

In my 3 week minis we are online, bur they are required to show 48 contact hours in that time\u2026 so we do 16 hrs/week. I make my mini sessions about 4 hrs, 4 days/week.. if we did it in 1 day/week that would be an impossibly long class.\n\nIs it some accelerates tech program?\n\nI guess based on your other comments your stuck riding this train out, so my advice: coffee, doodle while you listen, and get up and stretch often as possible.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you.",

Do your classes get recorded? \n\nIf you are obligated to be there and can't skip...i feel sorry for you. i myself have become a master in zoning out the bullshit and daydreaming and somehow my brain turns back on whenever something relevant is being said that i need to write down.

Don't be embarrassed to just stand and stretch occasionally once or twice an hour. Have to keep the body in check to endure that kind of commitment or you'll burn out quick.Good Luck!",
