  "text": "I\u2019m on an access to he course and haven\u2019t done referencing in ages. It\u2019s the Harvard referencing style What in struggling with is for  example I\u2019m doing an assignment on psychology right now and I\u2019m searching about stress / stressors acute and chronic i found on simplepsychology.org a good paragraph about how big life changes disrupt normal routine and it makes us use more mental energy blah blah blah so i can rephrase that and reference the simplepsychology.org site. However in the next paragraph it says \u201c according to rahe (1972) people who stay under 150 lcu in a year stay in good health\u201d this is where I\u2019m confused because if i want to use that quote in my assignment how do i reference that because i would be referencing a reference? Do i reference simplepsychology.org and and reference rahe (1972) aswell? But then there is no website of what rahe 1972 said it? All i have is the surname and year?? And when i search rahe 1972 it\u2019s just other websites referencing him?",
