      "text": "I would do a controversially fun opinion, like \"chips ahoy is better than oreos, change my mind\" or some dumb shit like that, im sure you or anyone else can come up with a better example than mine lol. Idk might sound stupid but to me thats what i would do. Also maybe hang up the steven crowder picture if you do do that so it goes with it and people understand the joke.\n\nMaybe if youre a good drawer and you keep doing good drawings on the board maybe someone will notice.\n\nThis is a hard question honestly, i even feel kinda stupid for the suggestions i gave lool.",
