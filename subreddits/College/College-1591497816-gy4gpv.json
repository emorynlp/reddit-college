  "text": "Hey all you fresh-eyed 17 and 18 year olds, heed this warning because I didn't when I was your age. \n\nDo NOT stop exercising once you get into college. I did a good job of this the first two years myself but then got a girlfriend, classes got harder, and I let myself stop exercising. I am 6'2\" ~165 and have been since I was a freshman, turns out that your physique truly has nothing to do with your stamina, strength, what have you.\n\nThis message is doubly as important if you're attending zoom Univeristy the first semester as you're REALLY not going to go anywhere. Learn discipline now and maintain it cause it is a lot harder to get back 4 years down the road!",

I think time management is extremely important in college, or work towards a goal and then reward yourself. I'm trying to get back into swimming again (started off at the wrong time since I'm stuck indoors lol) because it's a lot more funnier than running on a treadmill, so another thing, do exercises that you're more interested in and more likely to put effort in as well. I'm really hoping I'll finally lose weight at some point. Sorry this was long, good luck.",

I was relatively semi-fit in high school but now I\u2019ve lost a lot of the gains I had in high school and have gotten a decent gut. Starting good habits early will help you keep them. Exercising is also a great mood booster and stress reliever which is clutch in college.",

Then I adjusted my diet and saw what was working, and what didn't. \n\nIt turned out skipping breakfast did nothing, but replacing lunch with a salad and only drinking water and unsweet tea had me losing 4 lbs. a week. If I didn't have a scale to see trends, I wouldn't have known what worked and what didn't. \n\nWithin just a few weeks, I managed to lose 20 lbs. without any change to my exercise routine besides weekly 20 mile bike rides. \n\nSo, remember kids: weigh yourself in the morning so you can see if what you're doing is actually working.",

              "text": "There are a milion things that I would love to tell you, but too much information wouldn't be productive.\nMain points:\n1. First of all, check out AthleanX on youtube. Je is a profesional trainer who has been uploading gold tier videos about working out for over 10 years now. \nMost of what I know comes from him.\n\n2. The best thing would be to ask a trainer at a gym, or a friend who works out, because they can also help you with your form. And if you think that you don't want to listen to your friends because they might not know anything - know this: there is no program that fits all. Your goal should be to get a rough plan an to always improve on it based on what you learn or how you feel about some exercises.\nYou WILL make mistakes, everyone does, it's a learning process.\n\n3. There are a lot of workout plans, my best friend and I basicaly change our plans every month. \nYou have to keep searching for what suits you best, and try new things to shock the muscle and work it from a diferent angle (figure of speech, most muscles only pull one way).\n\n4. The basic plan would be: \nLegs. \nChest, triceps. \nBack, biceps. \nShoulders. \nAll in separate days (4 in total).\n3 exercises for each muscle. 3 sets of 6 to 10 reps for each exercise. (Here you can watch an AthleanX video for each workout. He has a video for everything).\n\n5. If you haven't worked out in a while or ever, you can start at home. Do some push ups or squats every time yoi go to the kitchen or the bathroom. This will activate your muscles so that when you go to the gym you already have a bit of strength.\n\n[Personaly, during quarantine all I do is push ups, squats, pull-ups and sit ups. I do them every few hours and a more intense workout before taking a shower.]\n\n6. You do not need any equipment to work out. Gyms are great for isolating and working muscles, but you can do almost everything at home. I and a lot of my friends have created full workout routines for ourselves during the quarantine.\n\n7. Consistency is key. You don't need to wourkout extremely hard, that will just lead to burnout before you see any results. In this situation you can definitley say that quantity is better than quality.\n\n8. If you want to improve your health, strsnght and apearance, you have to become a person who likes to work out, that's the only long term strategy. Don't work out to reach a certain goal. BECOME a person who is physicaly active.\n\n9. It is a journey, you will make a lot of mistakes, you will learn a lot. And if you keep at it, it will improve your life (no joke).\n\nThat's all I can think of right now.\nHope this doesn't discourage you.\nGood luck!!",

Simple things like getting a side of veggies instead of fries or not getting that extra serving. You don't have to change your life entirely.

However, the promises that she makes are completely unfounded. Her video titles include \u201cDo this everyday to lose fat,\u201d \u201cDo this for six pack abs,\u201d etc. In reality, if you want to lose fat or get a six pack, you need to be in a caloric deficit. One or two of these videos per day are not going to make up for an excessive caloric surplus. Secondly, if you want to build muscle, you need to implement a program that focuses on progressive overload. Doing the same video day after day (which is what her \u201cprograms\u201d advertise) is not what you want to do for muscle growth. Again, if you just want to get your heart rate up, these are great. But don\u2019t be swayed by her misleading video titles.\n\nFor beginners, I\u2019d recommend finding your maintenance calories and either bump those up or down depending if you want to lose fat or build muscle. If you\u2019re trying to build muscle, implement a progressive overload program. Track your calories using myfitnesspal and ensure you\u2019re hitting your calorie goals.",

You started too hard, burned out and trained your mind to think that working out is hard and sucks.\nMy advice would be to not go to the gym from the start. \nStart working out at home. Start by doimg like 10 push ups, and 20 squats (if you jave the opportunity it wouls be great to add pull ups to this [the pull up is a very important exercise]).\n\n2. The key is consistency. Don't pish yourself very hard 1-3 times a week, instead do easy to medium intensity exercises every day. You don't have to do push ups until your bones start to crack (OPM joke), instead do as many SETS as you can with low intensity.\nExample: you stand up to go to the bathroom, on the way there do some pushups and squats.\nGo to get water, do some push ups and squats.\nTaking out the trash, find a bar and do some pull ups.\n\nThis kind of low intensity training has amazing results.\n1. You will build a habbit of working out a bit.\n2. Even though it's low intensity, it WILL give you results.\n3. Eventualy you might start to feel like training at home is too easy and go to the gym (which isn't a requirement).\n\nAll in all, try it out, good luck!",

As much as I heard others say \u201cno ones watching you\u201d I still couldn\u2019t get over it in my head. The one thing that helped me realize no one is, is once I became a regular. I stopped watching other people in between sets and just preparing for my next set\n\nOne thing I suggest (which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve thought about) is considering a trainer to show you around/spot you or watching YouTube videos. I suggest Jeff nippard. A trainer or Jeff both have workout plans you can follow and show you how to focus on each muscle, how to do the exercise etc. \n\nBest of luck! If you have any questions done hesitate to ask me",

Went from between 155- 160 at the beginning of the first semester to 137 by the end of the second semester. I struggled to gain weight again. I had to constantly eat out to do so.\n\nI've also lost weight during the other years, but not as much (went from 144 - 137 my junior year, my most recent year). Reason for this is I eat a lot less during the school year because I'm so busy doing homework/studying that I don't have much time to eat (I can't eat and do homework/study at the same time) and during my freshman year, I often threw up the food I did eat due to the stress.",
