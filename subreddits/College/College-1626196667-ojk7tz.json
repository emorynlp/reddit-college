      "text": "Short answer: not really.\n\nLong answer: i have a BA in psychology and a BS in communication sciences and disorders. I have a desk job completely unrelated to either of those, and all the jobs I've held since getting them have been like that - the BA \"requirement\" in the job listing was only ever a barrier to entry for the jobs I've had, a quick yes-or-no criterion that the ATS could auto-reject a candidate for not having just to reduce the number of applications that a human has to sift through when hiring. \n\nThe only thing that a bachelor's degree in either of my fields is really good for is getting a master's. You need a master's at minimum to actually practice in the field, as practice requires licensure and to qualify for the licensing exam you need a master's degree. *Technically*, i could work as a speech-language pathology assistant, or SLPA, with my BS, under the direction of a licensed SLP per my state's laws. I could do therapy and administer tests as ordered by the SLP as a SLPA, just not diagnose, design treatment plans, order tests myself or interpret the results. But, in practice, those positions are basically reserved for grad students working toward getting licensed. I finished undergrad with close to $50k in student loan debt and wasn't excited about adding to that amount by going right on to grad school - there's basically no funding available for master's programs if you don't get a fellowship, just unsubsidized loans or private loans. Concurrent MA/PhD programs are really common in both of my fields, and it's also really common to \"master out\" - get that PhD funding, then turn in your thesis and dip after 2 years once you get the MA.",

My BA in English and MFA in Fiction enabled me to make a professionally successful run at teaching full-time as a composition professor for 10 years... but teaching in higher ed (or anywhere in America, really) is so grueling and financially suicidal that I quit this year, despite loving the work.\n\nI'm going back for a second Master's in a more lucrative career field. Hopefully I'll return to teaching once I can subsidize it. \n\nGenerally speaking, though, most people don't work in their degree fields. It's best to aim for something with transferable skills and assume you'll need to switch fields, switch jobs, etc. This is why, ironically, people who major in the liberal arts often out-earn their peers in STEM. STEM majors may earn more money directly after they graduate, but have trouble transitioning to managerial roles later in their careers that require more \"soft\" skills--the kinds those students, sadly, tend to scoff at.\n\nIf you're in STEM, study writing and hone your interpersonal communication skills. Maintain creative pursuits. You'll set yourself apart from your peers.",

I work both as a mentor but also as a data analyst/researcher, as well as doing programs. \n\nWhile they might seem unrelated they totally are. Most of my focus and area of specialization as an undergrad was in social change aka change making. So understanding systems/tools/mechanisms to make social change both individually and within whatever system or organization I\u2019m in. In my masters I focused on educational systems specifically and researched gaps and shortcomings in the higher education system. Now to be very honest I specialized in higher education systems outside of my country as the was my desire, but life and COVID happens so I\u2019m working domestically, which I\u2019m still very pleased with.\n\nUltimately, I have two degrees in social anthropology, and no\u2026 NOBODY becomes an \u2018anthropologist.\u2019 That\u2019s a big misperception I find people have, they look for a degree with a clear \u2018whatever-*ist*\u2019 (biolog*ist*, computer scient*ist* ) or are looking for jobs in that way. Instead I found in my personal experience and in the experience of many around me, it\u2019s just as much about the network you develop in school that leads you to a job. Similarly finding your own personal schtick leads you somewhere. One of my fellow grad students realized they wanted to go into reporting through an anthropology lens. While working on her Anthropology degree she built up a big network of anthropology professionals to provide interviews and stories for her and she eventually landed a job reporting. Other folks on here have gotten degrees just for the sake of getting a degree and go into a completely different field.  If you know your preferred field wants a degree but doesn\u2019t care what degree, that\u2019s fine too! There is no perfect way. So, to me the question of whether a persons degree and job are related is entirely dependent on what someone makes of their degree while pursuing it and their willingness to pursue job fields that might not appear related on the surface, but underneath are deeply related. \n\nHave you thought about a degree in parks and rec management? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I was talking to a National Park Ranger and they told me they had a degree in forestry and parks management ya know.",

But you're right that it's harder than a lot of other fields, so if you really want/need money and stability right away you should probably pick something else. Biology can be very employable if you focus on biochem, biotechnology, and stuff like that. Or a geology major can be a path to serious money in the natural resources field if you're willing to sell out and work for the mining or petroleum industries",

I work in the medical device industry because I have to pay back my loans before the interest kills me, I\u2019m 23 and if I had stayed with in the ecology route I\u2019d be living with a bunch of roommates in my college town until at least 25. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that, but my love for the field was not quite strong enough to keep on with that life after four years. \n\nSome peoples priority for a job is to love being at work, for some people it\u2019s getting as much promotions and raises as possible, and for some people it\u2019s about making enough to live and then getting a lot of vacation time.

Mostly just making some models and drawings of existing parts, and inspecting some parts. Not quite what I wanted to do (mostly pure design), but I don't hate my job either.\n\nWhat they say about engineering always being in demand is a lie. Entry level engineers are very much not in demand. Way too much supply at that level. The demand is only in the experienced level. It took me more than 260 applications to get my job.",

I do use things I learned in college from that degree in various aspects of my life, but journalism is an unstable, low-paid career and I found it difficult to find a job, any job, when I graduated into the recession. I'm very happy where I landed! I did briefly land a \"dream job\" after years of taking \"whatever pays my rent\" and did that part time on top of my day job thinking I'd transition... and it turns out I literally hate the current landscape of digital, celebrity journalism and I'm way better off in TV and writing novels. Sometimes your dream at 16, 18, 22 isn't conducive with who you are as a person and where you best thrive day-to-day. (I'm an introvert with serious anxiety and fast-paced digital journalism was not for me. I like a desk job with set hours, no frenetic \"everything always on fire\" pacing, industry security, 401K matching, and great health benefits.)",

For now I\u2019ve accepted a position that\u2019s pretty unrelated to my degree, but I\u2019m keeping up with the job market and still hoping to transition back into the field within a year. If wildlife and the outdoors is really what you\u2019re passionate about, I\u2019d continue pursing it.

Are you into blue team (defensive)? Then a SOC, threat detection/analysis, traffic analysis, is for you. If you\u2019re into red team (offensive), then an internship focusing on penetration testing is for you. There\u2019s also less technical roles, like ones focusing in cyber risk and governance. Edit: I will note that the market for penetration testing is a little saturated because *everyone* wants to do it. Not many companies can keep SOC analysts, so personally I think the demand is a little higher there.",
