I have a desk job completely unrelated to either of those, and all the jobs I've held since getting them have been like that - the BA \"requirement\" in the job listing was only ever a barrier to entry for the jobs I've had, a quick yes-or-no criterion that the ATS could auto-reject a candidate for not having just to reduce the number of applications that a human has to sift through when hiring. \n\nThe only thing that a bachelor's degree in either of my fields is really good for is getting a master's. You need a master's at minimum to actually practice in the field, as practice requires licensure and to qualify for the licensing exam you need a master's degree. *Technically*, i could work as a speech-language pathology assistant, or SLPA, with my BS, under the direction of a licensed SLP per my state's laws. I could do therapy and administer tests as ordered by the SLP as a SLPA, just not diagnose, design treatment plans, order tests myself or interpret the results. But, in practice, those positions are basically reserved for grad students working toward getting licensed. I finished undergrad with close to $50k in student loan debt and wasn't excited about adding to that amount by going right on to grad school - there's basically no funding available for master's programs if you don't get a fellowship, just unsubsidized loans or private loans. Concurrent MA/PhD programs are really common in both of my fields, and it's also really common to \"master out\" - get that PhD funding, then turn in your thesis and dip after 2 years once you get the MA.", "author": "tehzephyrsong", "created": 1626271783, "upvotes": 1}, "h55lwye": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ojk7tz/for_ppl_who_have_received_a_degree_do_you_have_a/h55lwye/", "text": "Majored in Biology.

I work both as a mentor but also as a data analyst/researcher, as well as doing programs. \n\nWhile they might seem unrelated they totally are. Most of my focus and area of specialization as an undergrad was in social change aka change making. So understanding systems/tools/mechanisms to make social change both individually and within whatever system or organization I\u2019m in. In my masters I focused on educational systems specifically and researched gaps and shortcomings in the higher education system. Now to be very honest I specialized in higher education systems outside of my country as the was my desire, but life and COVID happens so I\u2019m working domestically, which I\u2019m still very pleased with.\n\nUltimately, I have two degrees in social anthropology, and no\u2026 NOBODY becomes an \u2018anthropologist.\u2019 That\u2019s a big misperception I find people have, they look for a degree with a clear \u2018whatever-*ist*\u2019 (biolog*ist*, computer scient*ist* ) or are looking for jobs in that way. Instead I found in my personal experience and in the experience of many around me, it\u2019s just as much about the network you develop in school that leads you to a job. Similarly finding your own personal schtick leads you somewhere. One of my fellow grad students realized they wanted to go into reporting through an anthropology lens. While working on her Anthropology degree she built up a big network of anthropology professionals to provide interviews and stories for her and she eventually landed a job reporting. Other folks on here have gotten degrees just for the sake of getting a degree and go into a completely different field.  If you know your preferred field wants a degree but doesn\u2019t care what degree, that\u2019s fine too! There is no perfect way. So, to me the question of whether a persons degree and job are related is entirely dependent on what someone makes of their degree while pursuing it and their willingness to pursue job fields that might not appear related on the surface, but underneath are deeply related. \n\nHave you thought about a degree in parks and rec management?
