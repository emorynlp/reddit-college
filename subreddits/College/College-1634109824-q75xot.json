  "text": "I just saw a post on r/chanceme .\nThe person had good scores like 4.01 gpa and 1520 sat score and still people were like it's very low, you probably won't get in. It frustrates me that you have to have so much extra curriculars and awards and still be able to maintain a 1600 sat score and 5 gpa and still they would be like 'hmm not good enough babez' like what the fuck? Let students live a little damn \n\n(Fyi: I'm not applying there, I just had this thought)",

They obviously can't accept everybody, so what do they do? Raise the bar. Those stats aren't enough because simply because MIT can get better students with even more impressive applications. And why wouldn't they try to get the best students they can? It would be foolish to do otherwise.",
