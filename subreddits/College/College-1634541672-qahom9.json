  "text": "hi all. i\u2019m a senior in high school taking two dual enrollment courses through a local tech college this semester. i was curious if it was common for college courses to be 100% online. like zero face to face via video call. this is how my art 101- art history and appreciation course is. i find it really hard to keep up with everything without ever talking to the professor or my classmates. i use a planner and calendar but still struggle to turn things in on time due to the professors preferred website for assignments (blackboard, can\u2019t get notifications from this on my phone nor email). the stress i\u2019ve endured from this course has caused my hair to literally start falling out. crying rn because i didn\u2019t turn in my idea for a project, even though it\u2019s probably forgivable. it\u2019s just really odd to me that i\u2019m paying hundreds of dollars to take a course where i\u2019m having to teach myself. thoughts? \n\n(also, this could be all on me and that i\u2019m not ready for college classes quite yet. i\u2019m also taking math 120- prob and stat and doing just fine because the class meets on mondays and wednesdays via video call for instruction. i love both art and math, just not the layout. i can\u2019t drop the course either without losing hundreds of dollars :(. idk what to do. )",

      "text": "hi! i took dual enrollment courses throughout high school and most were asynchronous. im full-time at cc rn and most of them are asynchronous too. my school uses canvas so I unfortunately can't help you out on the blackboard problem. something that might help if your calendar is through google calendar is sharing the blackboard calendar to the google calendar and from there you can see due dates. i just saw this in the google calendar settings for my canvas calendar for notifications: \"New events An event is added to this calendar\" with \"Email\" as an option, so im 99% sure it would send you emails to your gmail when a new assignment is posted. i know you are a senior but if you decide to take any cc courses later in the year check ratemyprofessor.com. the reviews will give you somewhat of an idea of how a professor organizes their modules (like if their asynchronous courses have pre-recorded lectures or notes). i hope my response helped somewhat. good luck on your courses!",
