  "text": "This Saturday I\u2019m taking an exam that is required for all education majors in my state. Because of the accommodations I receive due to being blind, the test will be nine hours for all four subtests: English, math, reading, and the essay portion. How can I get through this? I\u2019m planning on bringing protein bars and water, but I\u2019m only allowed a 15 minute break and any other breaks I take will count against my time. Thank you.",

          "text": "I wished I could have taken the tests over multiple days. Sighted teachers have 4 hours but I get double time. Does not feel student first or they are not considering my wellbeing, but at least I am being accommodated. My hope is I pass everything, but if I don\u2019t, it is fine because I only have to take the subtest I failed.",
