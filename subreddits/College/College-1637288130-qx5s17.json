  "text": "I am a sophomore in high school and my parents didn\u2019t go to college so they can\u2019t really help me on this matter. I go to school in Mississippi but my academics are pretty good. I just don\u2019t know where to start when deciding what college to go to and where/how to start looking. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a long process so I want to be informed on it. Does anyone have advice? (It can be on really anything\u2014e.g. scholarships, programs, extracurriculars, etc.)\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Find a field that you are interested/passionate about, but keep in mind that you might decide in the future that the major you're taking isn't for you. Choose a school with a wide variety of majors so you don't pigeon hole yourself into a field. Also, don't choose a super niche major that has literally no transferable skills to other fields. Aviation is the first major that comes to mind that is like this. \n\nWork hard so you can get that scholarship money. But also don't work so hard that you only have 2 years of university left after AP credits and inadvertently pigeon hole yourself into the major you went into. \n\nBottom line, keep your options open and have fun.",
