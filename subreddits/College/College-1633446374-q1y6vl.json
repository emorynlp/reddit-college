  "text": "By the time I graduate university, I will hopefully have 4 semesters of research, but I can't help but fear that this won't be enough. In my uni, they recommend/push for students to start research either the spring semester of their first year or the fall semester of the second year and continue until graduate. I am a third year and am just starting research, so I feel way behind on the game.\n\nI plan on attending grad school and was wondering what an acceptable/expected amount of research would be",

      "text": "Depends on your field. In some fields, you can get into grad school with no research, whereas others expect quite a bit. Realistically, 4 semesters is enough for most fields. However, *quality* matters more than *quantity*. Four semesters of first author, publishable research is always going to be better than 7 semesters of being a lab monkey. That being said, lab monkeys get into grad school too. I can't think of any field where \"only\" four semesters will disqualify you for grad school. It's more than enough in most cases.\n\nEdit: To be clear, there are many, many labs that won't even take any undergrads below junior level because of how little someone below that level is able to contribute. It actually seems weird to me that your school pushes research at the freshman level. I think it's a good thing, tbh, that they are pushing professors to allow freshman to get what will be a valuable experience, but at most schools professors are very, very hesitant to take on younger undergrads so there really won't be too many people you'll be competing with for grad spots with that much more research experience than you.\n\nEdit 2: But of course it depends on field. My guess is you're in biology or psychology? These are the only two fields I can think of that might allow younger undergrads into labs and also be competitive enough for grad school that students may feel pressured to start their research experience that early. I'm in a field where you can get into PhD programs with no research experience, lol, so it seems weird to me, but as I said your mileage may vary. Even if you're in psych or bio I still wouldn't worry though because 4 semesters is still a solid amount of research experience.",
