  "title:": "Should I approach her outside the gym?",
  "text": "So I'm in college and there's this shared campus gym that all the students go to workout (except the NCAA athletes, they have their own gym). Anyways, I keep noticing this girl (actually these two girls) that keep going to the gym at the same time as me and the same particular days of the week, and I think it's been at least 4 times over 4 weeks (I've seen her once every week so far). \n\nSo I know I could approach her in the gym if I wanted to, but I think that would be creepy for her, and I'm also there to workout too. \n\nIt isn't a big deal at the end of the day if I never meet her, so instead of trying to talk to her inside the gym, I would talk to her outside of the gym. Would it be okay, say, if I some how, ran into her on campus, and approached her that way? I could probably recognize her (especially if she was with her friend) in public. I think she had seen me in the gym before multiple times as well, because I usually go when class schedules are busy for most students, so it's usually not that busy in the gym.\n\nShould I just mention to her how she looks familiar, and start some conversation that way?",

      "text": "I guess I am going against the grain here - but why not say \"hey\" at the gym... that's all it needs to be, then if you see her out and about that is your stepping stone- you've already said hey, so she should be able to place you (to remember from the gym) and see if she is receptive continue talking. If not- leave her alone. \n\nWe see posts on here all day long that no one is making friends at school, and I think it's because we have been so conditioned to 'not talk to strangers' that in an unfamiliar environment people just don't know how to do it. \n\nA stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAGAIN though - can't stress this enough- if she if giving you any indication at all leave her alone",

Basic stuff that you probably know, like needing help with your workout routine, where certain equipments are, then venturing into asking about her major, what classes she\u2019s taking.\n\nIf you think she has something mildly interesting (her phone case, stickers, aces sorties), you can compliment on that\n\nIt also depends\u2026 do you want to talk to her because you want to be her friends or date her? If it\u2019s the latter, then I wouldn\u2019t want to be approached like that.",

Its weird how: they won\u2019t approach a man, don\u2019t want a man to approach them and then complain about being single or lonely. Its all in all, redundant and sad.",

              "text": "You have to think of it from a woman\u2019s perspective. Some women have past trauma in regards to men or certain situations where they were cold approached. Some just don\u2019t like being approached period. Being approached by a random person, especially a random man could be intimidating. Some women don\u2019t have any issues with being approached. It depends on the person. As a woman that works as a facility manager at a gym I can attest that most women don\u2019t enjoy being bothered or simply talked to when they are working out. It\u2019s not a social setting for some people.",
