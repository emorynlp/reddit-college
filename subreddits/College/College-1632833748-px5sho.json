I procrastinate, I\u2019m lazy, I\u2019m tired after I get off work and don\u2019t have much energy, but I still want to do well in school. \n\nLike most of us, I work full time (from home) and have problems of my own, but I set designated times for me to study/do assignments. During study I don\u2019t have electronics/entertainment nearby or on so I can focus, but often times I find myself eventually getting bored or uninterested.. or if I\u2019ve been reviewing notes/going over things for an upcoming test, it feels like I\u2019m burning myself out very quickly because I\u2019m taking in too much information or I\u2019m stressing myself out about doing well or whatever. I tell myself that this needs to happen because it\u2019s important to me, but I don\u2019t act like it.\n\nI want to break this habit because it\u2019s holding me back from doing better than I know I actually can in school. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.", "author": "downvotesNkarma", "created": 1632833748, "retrieved": 1632945431, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hele135": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px5sho/how_can_i_improve_my_study_habits/hele135/", "text": "Doesnt your school have a learning center or tutoring center?\n\nThe general tips are breaking stuff down into blocks with clear goals (so not : study chem for 3 hours ) but Y chapter and X vocab for 60 min, and 15 walking break.  Rewrite notes and make concept maps of that chapter 30 min)\n\nDo active learning\n\nTake a lighter load.  If you are working full time it is super hard to do this.  You are just plain tired all the time.\n\nYou really wont get done any faster if you fail or do poorly and the stress and issues will be with you a lot longer than the class", "author": "TheRightSideOfDumb", "created": 1632836323, "upvotes": 2}}}
