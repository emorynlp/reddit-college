  "text": "So I\u2019m pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in environmental biology. Math has always been my point of weakness. I\u2019m taking a calculus class that\u2019s required for the degree, and not doing so well. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed between working and juggling math with my other 4 classes so I\u2019ve fallen a bit behind. For context we have online worksheet assignments that contribute to our marks. I fell behind a few weeks back and started using the helpful example button to fill out the assignments when I hadn\u2019t had the time to actually read the unit. As a result I have a 60% in the class despite getting a brutal 28% on my mid term. This and a statistics class are my only required math classes for the degree, so my overall grade isn\u2019t as much of a concern as simply passing and getting the credit. \n\nRight now I have two options, I can continue in on this class and use as much as possible of my 20 days leading up to the final to study and practice and hopefully get my credit. I only need a 40% on my final exam to pass, but based on the format of the last exam and all the excess pressure that still makes me nervous. If I do pass, my grade will likely be in the 55-60 range. \n\nI also have the option to withdraw, which most online sources advise. Obviously I\u2019d drop the class and get a W on the transcript, but since this is a required class id take it again next semester. I do think if I was more focused from the start and knew ahead of time what I was in for, I\u2019d do better in the class, but doing that would both throw 1000$ of tuition down the drain, and would make my next semester where I have to take a chemistry class significantly more challenging. I\u2019m aware this all essentially boils down to my own preferences but I\u2019d love any advice, especially from people who have had to make similar decisions in the past",

      "text": "There are a number of factors here.\n\nThe first is financial aid. If you drop a class and end up falling below full-time standing (12 credits), you'll be forced to immediately repay the excess financial aid (and will not be able to receive financial aid the next semester until you do).\n\nYour academic standing matters. If failing the course would drop your academic standing below an acceptable level (or you're already on probation), you may not be able to afford the risk of failing.\n\nThe grade replacement policy matters. Some schools average the grades from all attempts. Other schools only count the highest grade. If you're in the latter sort of school, you might as well just gut it out. If things work out, you've got the course for credit. If it doesn't, you just take it next semester.\n\nThe relevance of your GPA is also meaningful. If you're just doing a bachelor's degree with no plans to immediately pursue further education, then all you really need to do is barely scrape by with enough to graduate. If you're planning to go onto a Master's program, a bad math grade is a huge red flag for almost any discipline that isn't purely in the humanities. If you're planning to attend something like medical school, you have no good options - medical schools take a look at every grade and attempt in their evaluation regardless of what your school does.",
