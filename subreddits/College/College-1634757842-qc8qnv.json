  "text": "i talked to her about this last week and she STILL never fixed my grade! i have a D in her class over it and if I get this grade permanently on a report card i'll be pissed. i'm just in so much disappointment right now. i do the work, i put in the effort, but i get 0s for no reason because the professor can't keep on track? I would be content with just a C for the love of god. i'm tired of waiting for my damn grade to be fixed because it might be too late already (a D in my records for one of the simplest fucking college classes).",
