  "text": "I made a post awhile ago about my professors being really understanding about the situation. I\u2019m on mobile so I\u2019m not really sure how to link.\n\nMy grandfather didn\u2019t finish high school and was very, very proud I was going to college and succeeding. I really wanted to just reschedule my finals but I figured I\u2019d go anyway because what a way to honor him, you know?\n\nI crushed my finals. I did really well. I\u2019m a/b honor roll this semester. In light of the stress that has gone on with him entering palliative care, I still somehow managed to study and pull together what I needed to.\n\nJust wanted to update you guys. This community was really supportive. Thank you all for the kind words on my last post.",
