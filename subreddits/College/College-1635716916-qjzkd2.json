  "text": "There\u2019s a whole lot that goes into this but I\u2019m gonna try to keep it as brief as possible\n\nFirst off I have to clarify I never used to be socially awkward or anything like that, in fact the opposite. In high school I was a social butterfly and was friends with every group of people. I\u2019m witty and funny and easy to converse with, these are things people say about me, apologize if I sound arrogant. Just wanted to say this so you know it hasn\u2019t been a problem for me before.\n\nBut anyway, I feel like due to covid and all the lockdowns and shit I lost all my social abilities. I mean maybe not all of it, but something has clearly changed for me to be almost 2 years into college and still 0 friends made. I feel like all the time not interacting with anybody outside my family (which would literally just be my mom) made my ability to converse with naturally go away. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of trying either. Even really simple interactions like someone talking to me while waiting in line for food will just somehow make me slightly nervous and I\u2019ll act stupid. It\u2019s fucking my head up because I\u2019m so lonely and feel so pitiful for having no one to talk to except my old high school friends, who I think have realized I don\u2019t have any friends here based on how often I text them.",

      "text": "Im in the same boat. Only main difference is I am really shy around new people. I was bullied a good amount in elementary, middle, and freshman year of high school, so I am really reserved and picky with who I become friends with. At this point I cant tell if its just bad luck or if theres something about me that people really dont like. I tried joining a club swim team (I have swam competitively for 7 years and was supposed to swim for a d3 school before the school cut the team) they went made their decisions mainly off of our attitude during the 3 days of tryouts, I did not make it of course, but everyone I spoke to did. I tried getting a group of people including me to lap swim together (we all did not make the club team), but they stopped talking about it immediately after I created a group chat for it. No one in my classes really talk or conversations dont go past 1 class. My high school friends are hard to reach right now so hopefully I can find out why and hopefully they just aint ditching me.\n\nI am honestly thinking of transferring again, hopefully things get better, but I cant keep up this disappointing semester after semester shit anymore. I would say try joining clubs, but from my experience that did not work. Just keep trying to talk to people. Good Luck to you, hopefully things get better.",
