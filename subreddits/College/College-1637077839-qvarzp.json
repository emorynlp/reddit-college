If you don't feel safe getting on the roads in inclement weather, then honestly, no one can dispute that, nor should you be punished for it.  If Covid-19 has taught us anything, it's that we can adapt classes around events beyond our control - doesn't mean your professor will, but they *can*, should they want.  I live in snow country, and I regularly tell students to use their best judgment: I've had plenty a day where I was traveling to class and realized ten miles out that this wasn't a good idea.  I do not want the injury (financial or physical) or death of a student on my hands because I pigheadedly insisted that they show up for class during a snow storm.  \n\nIf you've got a professor who can't understand this, then perhaps you should have a chat with their department chair.",
