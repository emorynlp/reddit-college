  "text": "Hello I am a sophomore at a JUCO(junior college) transferring to a major university in the spring. My major is in Psychology. I changed career paths not too long ago from being a doctor to a pa(physician assistant). My advisor wants me to take general chem l and general bio ll with labs next semester together. All together I\u2019ll have 17 hours, not to me mention a job. This is my first ever job and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to handle this load. Should I push through or submit to my woes?",
