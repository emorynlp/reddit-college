  "text": "I always did really well in high school but I think with just feeling not at home at my university, plus the whole living at home thing while my peers are dorming and not having the whole commute plus how the pandemic has just made everything so uncertain and just so odd\n\nI entered university a few years ago back when it was normal thinking I was sure I wanted to do International Relations but down the line I realized I would he miserable in that line of work. I was thinking I'd do political science because I already have the perquisites for that and I did really well but that was something I realized I liked reading about but not as a job. \n\nRight as I was deciding I wanted to do marketing, especially something in fashion and how online shopping is a multibillion industry, the pandemic hits halfway thru my first year. \n\nEver since that, I haven't been able to perform in my classes as well as I would've liked. I saved so much time from the commute and I don't want to go back to in person classes again but it's so frustrating and disappointing when it seems like you're trying everything and not doing as well you would have liked. \n\nI think it's that plus some health issues feeling sleep deprived and just super upset about everything but my temper has become so short just thinking about anything waking up makes me so upset and almost angry. Fortunately I don't take this out on people around me but so much of it is reflected back to myself and it's like I'm beating myself up internally over it. \n\nDo you guys have any tips to help with this or similar journeys? I'll be booking with a new therapist to see if she's a better fit (also a BIPOC WOC immigrant therapist similar to my background) so I hope that helps. Thanks",
