  "text": "So college is about to start, and I had an almost 5 months long vacation. Is it bad that I didn\u2019t really do anything that is productive? There are days that i was productive but then i\u2019ll go back in a slump for weeks. All i did were sleep, watch movies/youtube vids, and read. Half of me is guilty and half of me is saying that it\u2019s okay since i wouldn\u2019t have this much of free time in college.",

      "text": "A lot of my classes had ungraded (you got 100% for doing it) 1st assignments, reduced weight 1st assignments or just started assignments a week or two after the semester started. This basically acted as a warm up period to dust off the cobwebs from my brain from doing zero academic anything for 4 months. Hopefully your school does the same system.",
