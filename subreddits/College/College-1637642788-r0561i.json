  "title:": "One F in college",
  "text": "I might get an F in my Calc 1 class this semester, this is my first F in college and after this semester I'll have 48 credits in total. (if I pass calc 1, if not ill have 44). In my other classes this semester I have A's and B's. I have a 3.44 GPA rn, how bad will this F affect my GPA if I fail? I might be able to get a C if I make an 80 on the final, however. I'm just kind of scared and stressed about if I lose my HOPE scholarship because It's expensive and I don't wanna have to stress too much over the price of college. Also any advice on taking calc 1 I most likely will retake it next semester.",

It\u2019ll give you a good accurate description but honestly from a guesstimate. it\u2019ll probably decrease to like 3.16 or 3.2 assuming you do well in your other classes.",
