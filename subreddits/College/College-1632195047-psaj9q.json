  "text": "So I've been diligent about work so far, and good about checking the syllabus for whats do and when. However, today I realized I missed an assignment and my prof doesn't take late work. Do I not even try?\n\nFor context, I participate and do very well in this class typically, and the date for this assignment was only ever spoken aloud. I'm great about listening in class but having ADHD i just don'y always process it. I couldn't find it in the syllabus and I had to click to the assignment (that i was unaware was due) to find it. I take full responsibility for this fuck up but have to acknowledge that this setup is prone for missing work, which has already happened to other people in my class",

      "text": "Faculty here.  For an ordinary assignment, I'd just take the loss and move on.  The assignment slipped your mind or escaped your attention, and you didn't complete it on time.  It happens, and it's not the end of the world.  Just use this minor incident as extra motivation to thoroughly keep on top of all the due dates for your various classes in the future so that this situation doesn't happen again.\n\nIf you absolutely feel like you can't let this go, my first suggestion is to try harder to let it go.  But if that doesn't work and you have your heart set on asking the professor for the special privilege of turning in the missed assignment late, then I *strongly* urge you to be *very* polite when making your request and to not say or write *anything* that could even *remotely* be interpreted as you trying to emotionally manipulate the professor into doing what you want (e.g., don't say your scholarship will be in jeopardy or that your parents will disown you if you don't get an A, or anything like that).  I also wouldn't bring up your ADHD at this time, as that too can sometimes come across as an attempt to excuse your actions or to gain special treatment.  If you are concerned in the future about ADHD affecting your performance, you need to go through your university's official channel for disability-related matters; the campus disability office will determine whether you're entitled to an official accommodation, which will then be formally communicated to your professors.\n\nSo, in my opinion and experience, it would be better for you to just take the loss and move on, but if you insist on asking for the favor of turning in the assignment late, be polite, and be prepared to accept whatever answer the professor gives without complaint.  If the professor says yes, then good for you, and be sure to do a good job on the late assignment.  If the answer is no, then say thanks anyway and move on.  A year from now, you'll hardly remember this incident one way or the other.\n\nGood luck.",
