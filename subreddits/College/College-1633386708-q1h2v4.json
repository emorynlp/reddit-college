  "text": "Someone I was briefly friends with is telling people she\u2019s going to email the college I get into (im a senior and have not yet got into any) and try to get me kicked out? Mind you she supposedly has proof of me bullying her from Freshman year!! We\u2019re seniors now. I don\u2019t care about her but I was worried if I can get deferred from colleges if she does that. Should I be worried?\nedit : We had a couple of those petty text arguments/fights and there were rude exchanges but I dont think I said anything that horrid. It was 3 years ago so I don\u2019t remember.",
