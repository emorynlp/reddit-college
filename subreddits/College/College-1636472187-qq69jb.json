  "text": "Alright, so my birthday is coming up soon and I\u2019m inviting around 8-10 people to do an escape room, watch a movie, and dinner on Saturday. The age group is between 18-22 and we\u2019re all broke college students. With that said, should I pay for everything or pay for everyone for either the escape room, movie, or dinner? I feel that would be a lot of money for me, even if I pay for just the movies or dinner but I can manage paying for everyone at least for one of those things. Would it be wrong to ask them to pay? I\u2019m just worried they won\u2019t have money but they said they\u2019re down and I have to pay for everything. Or is there a better solution?",

      "text": "If you are expecting people to attend the activities that you selected, I would expect you to either cover that entire expense or plan on some (or all) of those individuals to not attend. This is similar to hosting a wedding and mandating guests pay $X,XXX towards the exclusive resort you selected to hold the event at.\n\nIt would be better to ask the others how they would like to celebrate with you. That way you all can agree on something that is fun and affordable for all.",

      "text": "They said you should pay for everything?\n\nI mean, if they are your friends they should understand you don't have that amount of money (and it will be easier each one pay for himself). But, if they rly don't have it and you want to celebrate with them you can also switch to something less expensive. Maybe just the escape room and dinner, or just the movies and dinner. Or watch a movie in your house, idk",
