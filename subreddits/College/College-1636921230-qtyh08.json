  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m coming on here to ask if this is a fair thing to ask my prof. \n\nSo we had a midterm (sept. 27) which I missed for personal reasons which she completely understood, and she was planning on doing another sitting of the midterm anyways so she asked me to come to that. That sitting was on Oct. 13, i did the midterm in a different room due to accommodations I have. This exam went to her mailbox and during the next class on oct. 20 I asked if she had graded it and she told me she hadn\u2019t gone to her mailbox to even pick it up but she had graded all the midterms from the Oct. 13 make up test. \n\nBy the time i got my grade it was Oct. 22nd and she told me to come by her office hours to pick up the exam but her office hours was the day of the midterm 2 (oct 27) and the time interfered with my schedule.  \n\nI noticed on midterm 2 she had recycled questions from the first midterm and i was upset because I didn\u2019t get a change to see my first midterm at all. \n\nI was planning on going to talk to her and see if there is anything she can do scale my mark in anyway. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone doing this and i\u2019m just trying to make sure it\u2019s a fair thing to ask?\n\nLet me know!",

      "text": "What is it exactly that you want to get out of this? In terms of \"scaling\" your grade, would you just hope they count all of those questions as correct (regardless if you answered them that way)? What if they just don't count those questions at all, possibly resulting in a lower overall score for you if you go them correct? I will say your situation is not ideal, but I don't really see a way to do anything here (or necessarily a good reason to) without causing additional issues. It also sounds like, and maybe I'm just misunderstanding, that your test was availble to look at before you took the next one, but your schedule just didn't work out (which wouldn't be the instructor's fault). Like I said, sucky situation, but I don't think contacting the professor is a good idea, given that there doesn't seem to be anything they can do at this point.",

      "text": "I think you have a fair question for your professor!\n\nYeah, you should've expected some questions to be the same or similar if exams in this class were knowingly cumulative. But, if grading the previous exam also included correcting it to show you the correct answers to some questions that could've been repeated ones on this latest exam, then your peers who got theirs back had a clear advantage over you.\n\nYou also did all that you were supposed to do in making up the last exam. That means that your professor, in turn, had a reasonable amount of time to grade it and get it back to you as she set the makeup time herself, suggesting an expectation of her own to have grades available in time for the most recent exam.",

          "text": "Yea this is how i feel! I feel like my peers had an advantage seeing their corrected midterms vs me who didn\u2019t \u2014 i definitely felt that her marking it later in the week while she gave everyone else their midterms back really sucked. \n\nHow would you go about bring it up? It makes me nervous",

              "text": "First, I'd wait to hear back on the current exam if you haven't already done so. Even if you feel like you did good or bad, you don't truly know until you get the grade back. That way, you can potentially strengthen your argument by pointing out repeated questions that you may have gotten wrong on this one. You can say that there's a chance you wouldn't have gotten them wrong if you had extra study material in the form of corrections that everyone else received. I'd also emphasize that you did all you were supposed to do by taking the makeup and current exams on time, previously asked for some feedback but didn't get it, and recognize that there could have been some expectation and preparation on your part for a cumulative exam. You can express that you understand how time-consuming it can be to grade work, correct it, and get it back to a student to show respect and consideration. Then, I wouldn't ask for a particular way to be compensated for the issue to avoid coming off as picky or an \"it's my way or no way\" attitude, but rather ask how she might consider a way to account for the gap in available study materials. As always, it's natural to thank her for her time and consideration.",

      "text": "No, don\u2019t ask.  you got a make up and she graded the exam in 2 days.  \n\nThis is why people aren't more accommodating-  there is a schedule that would have allowed you to do things in good time, you wanted and got special dispensation, , but people cant change the nature of time.    You already saw the questions and if you werent\u2019 sure of the material you could have studied those topics more",
