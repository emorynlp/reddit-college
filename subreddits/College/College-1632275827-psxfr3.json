For the last 2 years I've been selling stuff I produce myself on eBay and earn $1200-$2500 a month. I only have to work an hour a day and don't have to spend on gas or anything. \n\nBut every time I explain this to my family they still see me as having no job and urge me to go out finding one. I know it might be unacceptable to the society's norm because I don't go out there interacting with the world and it's not something I'd write on my resume when I graduate. Among the friends I know, no one's ever done something like this and it makes me feel weird about myself....\n\nSo my question is, do you consider it a real job? Should I stop this and go out there to find one?", "author": "dead---space", "created": 1632275827, "retrieved": 1632800901, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "comments": {"hduhp7h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxfr3/do_you_consider_selling_stuff_onlineworking_at/hduhp7h/", "text": "If you have a reliable and consistent income, it\u2019s a job.", "author": "JupiterRocket", "created": 1632320231, "upvotes": 2}, "hdsuua1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxfr3/do_you_consider_selling_stuff_onlineworking_at/hdsuua1/", "text": "> So my question is, do you consider it a real job?  \n\nI'm not going to answer your question.  \nI'm going to challenge you with 3 questions that will hopefully help you understand the answer:  \n\n* When you go to rent an apartment, the landlord should ask to see several pay stubs to confirm you earn enough money to afford the apartment. What documentation can you provide to serve this purpose?  \n* An employer is required to deduct taxes from your paycheck to pay for your Social Security Fund. The more you earn, the larger your fund will be. Are you contributing to your retirement from these earnings?  \n* Your ability to access credit, which is important if you choose to buy a home, hinges upon your financial history of earnings and paying your bills in a timely manner. It's certainly not life or death that you start earning & paying at the first moment of your 18th birthday or anything, but you do need to start someday. If not today, then when?  \n\nIf you were to legitimize your small business and start issuing invoices for sales and so on, that could actually address several of those points.  \nTaxes will obviously eat into your profits, and doing all of the accounting will take some of the fun out of the activity, but it gives you the financial records you need while letting you maintain the freedoms you enjoy...", "author": "VA_Network_Nerd", "created": 1632279845, "upvotes": 8}, "hdsplqy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxfr3/do_you_consider_selling_stuff_onlineworking_at/hdsplqy/", "text": "I\u2019ve done it myself and it can take some work, but I\u2019d still consider it more of a side hustle than a job.
