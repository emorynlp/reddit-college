  "text": "My friends and I were messing around and looking up our professors on google search. We found one of our professors phone number online and they dared me to call it. I did call it and it was in fact my professor I quickly hung up and didn't say anything. I then decided to look up my number on google to see if it would trace back to me and it sure did! Should I confront my professor about it and apologize or am I overthinking and just forget about it?",
