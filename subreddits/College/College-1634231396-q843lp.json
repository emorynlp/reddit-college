      "text": "Use studying as an opportunity to distract yourself from thinking about the break up. My ex and I broke up last year after a serious two-year long relationship, but commuting to college and studying helped me move on. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, and that you can\u2019t really control how you feel, but it\u2019s important to keep yourself busy (without burning yourself out!). The heartbreak will go away as you develop and stick to daily habits. Also, talk to friends and family more often. You got this! :)\n\n\n\nAlso listen to the other commenter. Follow the advice I wrote to the best of your ability, but don\u2019t feel bad if it takes a while to get things rolling. Just do what you can.",

      "text": "Studying while going through big emotions and traumatic experiences is nearly impossible (there's research on this). This won't help with how you're feeling, but there is something called the \"state-dependent effect\". When we are learning, our emotions are actually helping our brain form routes to access that information later. Not just emotions, but physical states (chewing gum, sitting in the same place in class, etc.). So this effect says that we are better at recalling information we've learned if we are in the same state as when we learned it. This means since you are in a sad emotional state right now when studying, make sure you're in that same emotional state when you take the exam. Listen to a sad song before the exam. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut also, give yourself grace. This is a major moment in your life and your productivity is not the most important thing right now. You can get through this!",

      "text": "Alright to be real with you the advice you've received so far is not good. Based on the demographic this subreddit attracts it's fair to assume most of these people have never been in a serious relationship. All the advice you've gotten so far is people just repeating what they've read elsewhere. \n\nI'm a bit older and have been through my fair share of breakups. My advice is to take this as an opportunity to mature and realize that just because you are feeling bad and depressed doesn't mean the world stops. As an adult, you will have to continue to take care of your responsibilities, even on days when you don't want to. People will be relying on you, whether it's co-workers or your future children. You will have to get up and get what you need to do done. Only after you've taken care of your responsibilities should you allow yourself a moment to mourne.",

Like if you need an extension of the test, go for it and ask and tell the professor how you\u2019re going to keep yourself accountable. Be open to negotiate.\n\nAnd if \u201cworst comes to worst,\u201d always know it\u2019s just one fucking test. This is not going to determine the rest of your life so take the time to allow yourself to feel heartbreak.",
