  "text": "So i heard alot about colleges in America and how many students there are having these wild experiences. Sleeping around, drinking, having fun and doing all kind of shit.\n\nIt isn't like that in my country, I also go to small college and we are apperently going to be in groups do to covid. So I really don't think any of that will really happen for me. However i am hopeful about couple of things.\n\nI want to work on myself by building my confidence and being more out going. I want to give my best at studying and work hard, however that will go a little bit harder \ud83d\ude02. I don't plan on drinking and going to clubs because if I didn't grow to like alcohol by 18 I doubt I ever will lol.",

Been alone a lot of the time and no parties. Make sure you talk to people in your major, and ask people to hang out too ( I\u2019m too scared to do that yet lol)",

                      "text": "> From what I seen there are no gay students.\n\nThere are gay students-- they're just most likely in the closet because of homophobia. I think about 5% of the population is estimated to be gay (give or take) which is high enough that there are definitely other people around you that are gay, whether you know it or not.\n\nHow to best handle being gay and wanting to meet someone in the lgbt community when you're in a homophobic place depends greatly on your culture and your local laws, so tread carefully, but I know in the US back when being gay was illegal there were still places where lgbt people could go to meet others. The only problem is that it wasn't always safe, and while it's become safe in the US it might not be safe in your country so you may want to look into finding where the lgbt crowd in your country hangs out but also be sure to proceed with the appropriate level of caution.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth, *most* American schools aren't all that much like what you see in movies (wild parties and shit). There are some schools with a reputation as being \"party schools\" and we have something called \"Greek Life\" (fraternities and sororities) that people do if they're into that sort of thing, but really most students just go to school to get their degree and aren't really involved in that sort of thing. I'd be surprised if the American cultural phenomenon of \"the college experience\" applied to more than a small percentage of college students.",

However I guess you are probably right  about this...\n\nYou are prob right about closeted gay guys but they are same as straight for me. If they pretend and are  closet as well i doubt I will get to become good friends with them either. Also yeah don't worry I will be careful and I will be looking for lgbtq+ friendly spaces.",
