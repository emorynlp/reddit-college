Sleeping around, drinking, having fun and doing all kind of shit.\n\nIt isn't like that in my country, I also go to small college and we are apperently going to be in groups do to covid. So I really don't think any of that will really happen for me. However i am hopeful about couple of things.\n\nI want to work on myself by building my confidence and being more out going. I want to give my best at studying and work hard, however that will go a little bit harder \ud83d\ude02. I don't plan on drinking and going to clubs because if I didn't grow to like alcohol by 18 I doubt I ever will lol.", "author": "Itchy_Word_1523", "created": 1631995840, "retrieved": 1632801525, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hddh1zp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqtjra/starting_my_own_college_experience_soon/hddh1zp/", "text": "Hey I\u2019m a freshman right now, make sure u make friends.
