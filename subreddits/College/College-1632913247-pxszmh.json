      "text": "If the school lets you then it\u2019s allowed presumably. However, your degree is essentially useless in the states unless it\u2019s from like Cambridge because it needs to be extremely well known for employers to take note of an international university or it needs to be in conjunction with an accredited university in the states through study abroad programs.
