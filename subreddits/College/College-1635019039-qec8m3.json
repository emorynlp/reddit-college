  "text": "There\u2019s a reason why 80% of people who get they hard levels of math suddenly suffer and can\u2019t muster good grades and enjoyment while taking these classes. \n\nThey are dreadful human beings to be around if this isn\u2019t your subject. They teach even worse. I can\u2019t emphasize enoughz\n\nMy grades are good but my whole experience and obese rive of keeping 4.0\u2019s while enjoying learning can be traced to beginning this series. \n\nYou can learn this subject on your own, if you are going to take it in college, learn it all before so you can avoid lectures and interaction with their misery, it\u2019s contagious.",

There's really no way to teach physics without using math beyond your level and profs are gonna be frustrated about your lack of prereq knowledge. If you haven't taken physics, then where's all this judgment coming from?\n\nHonestly if y'all are taking physics without calc I can see why there are so many issues. \"Algebra-based\" physics is one of the stupidest classes invented its basically designed so you don't understand anything because all the intuition comes from what you learn in calc which they clearly can't teach in that class but if you come in without basic algebra skills then I have no words for how badly your school fucked up by putting you in the class. You simply can't do physics without math skills. It's like taking a literature class without knowing how to read.\n\nEven the best physics prof in the world can't overcome students who lack algebra skills.",
