I would say it\u2019s very peaceful in the early morning and you can get some coffee to make you feel energetic. If you wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning you can still go to your classes and be in bed by 7-8 assuming you don\u2019t want to break up your sleep. It may sound crazy but it works for me, I love getting up at 4.",

      "text": "Why do you study better at night? Is it the lack of distractions when everyone is asleep? Is it the sense of pressure while waiting for the next day? Figure out what works about the night and try to incorporate it into your daytime studying before you make such a drastic change to your sleep schedule. Think of everything else you\u2019d be missing, including dining hall times, social times, extracurricular meetings, etc.",

It\u2019s peaceful and quiet \u2014 go to the library during the day, go to the silent section, hide your phone, and do the work. Same effect. \n\nCollege isn\u2019t some impossible mountain where the only way to summit it is to go to superhuman lengths. You don\u2019t need to warp your sleep schedule completely to study well. Take the intermediate steps first: start going to bed early and waking up early, place yourself in study spaces where you can work silently and without your phone, and do the work to balance sleep, study, and socialization.",
