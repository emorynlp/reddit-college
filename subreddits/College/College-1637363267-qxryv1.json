  "text": "Hi all. I am a second year here, almost done with my semester like everyone yay!!! So I am in two classes right now as my school does classes by quarters instead of semesters, so first quarter did two classes, this quarter two. Anyway, in one of my classes, I had like a 96% so I decided not to do an entire week of work, brought my grade down to a B, not a big deal as it will be an A at the end again. Anyway, right now another one of my classes is a 92% right now, done every assignment, 100% on all quizzes and lots of praise for the writings I have done. I have an assignment due tonight and I just have had zero energy to do it and zeor motivation. That season burn out is kicking in hardcore sadly. I do not plan to do it tonight and I am curious if you guys do any of that? I always feel kind of bad and guilty like a bad student to willingly let my grade drop because I am too tired and burnt out.",

      "text": "Faculty here.  If you don't want to do an assignment, then don't do.  The professor certainly isn't going to spend time tracking you down to force you to do it.  But, you have to be willing to accept the consequences of your decision, which as you know will be to get a zero.  If you are fine with that and your lowered grade, then I don't think your professor is going to lose much sleep over the issue.  \n\nHowever, let me assure you that you're not the first student in history to come up with this plan, and let me warn you that it can *and does* backfire from time to time.  Students will skip one or more assignments that they don't feel like doing, and their grade will fall accordingly.  Then, later in the semester, something will *unexpectedly* go wrong - they bomb an exam they thought they would do well on, they get a bad grade on a paper, they have a bad team for a group project and receive a low grade, etc., and so their final grade in the class ends up being substantially lower than planned.  If that happens, I can guarantee that you won't get any special consideration or sympathy from a professor who can plainly see that you didn't take advantage of all the points that were offered over the semester by submitting all of the assigned work.  So, if you're willing to live with this possibility, then do or don't do assignments however you see fit.  But if you choose to skip some of the work and then later things blow up in your face, remember where the responsibility for the situation truly lies.\n\nGood luck.",

They each take me like an hour, in this rare case this one would take probably two. The other class I have this quarter though\u2026 It\u2019s like 3 hours per assignment and I have two a week that is why I skipped a full week of it lol. I always do them now though.",

      "text": "Sometimes to just have to be kind to yourself and prioritise other things. I had this obsession with completing every little assignment in my English class last semester, to maintain 100%. But along with my health and other classes, I realised that it's not always possible. And although it might be a bit guilt-inducing to skip one (I felt like I was disappointing my professor by not submitting it, since they always complimented my work) I decided to start skipping the ones with fewer points where I could get away with it and not lower my grade. I figured I had enough extra credit points to make up for it anyway. My example is a little extreme, but the point is that even if your grade fluctuates greatly throughout the semester, if you can manage a good grade that you're happy with at the end, that's all that matters.",
