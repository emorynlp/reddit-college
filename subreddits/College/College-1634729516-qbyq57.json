  "text": "So I\u2019ve had extreme anxiety all throughout college, which has taken a toll on my health. In fact, my freshman year I was so nervous that I was getting sick with nausea before every one of my tests. Now I think I may even have some memory problems from it. However, more recently I\u2019ve started taking Ashwagandha capsules every day and have felt extremely better. Particularly the 3000mg ones from Bronson on Amazon. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to promote anything and I never do this, but I know how bad my anxiety has been and I wanted to offer something that I think could help others. It could even be a good alternative to other things people might be using. I know these things can be different for everyone, so it\u2019s not a sure thing, but it\u2019s worked incredibly well for me from the very start. I just suggest doing a bit of research on it to determine if it will be useful to you as well.",
