  "text": "I\u2019m 18 and a college freshman that is going to community college right now for free. I plan to finish my undergrad completely debt free. I get the first two years of my college completely paid for through a scholarship but I\u2019m worried about the last two years of my undergrad. I want to transfer to a university after I graduate from community college. I don\u2019t know how to pay for my last two years without going into debt. I work currently but it\u2019s hard for me to save a significant amount of money for my last two years of college.",

Significantly less than a private university which will definitely put you into debt, and although it might not be completely funded, it's better than nothing I suppose. You also may be applicable for scholarships, which can help you pay your tuition. I don't know the specifics of these, so questions like that would be for your advisor. There is probably information online somewhere about this. Best of luck!",

The state schools are more competitive and you're likely going to have less opportunity opportunity get grants or scholarships (from my expeifence) than a smaller private college. \n\nGraduating debt free in America from college is truthfully quite unrealistic lol. Most people aren't getting a full ride. Many people go to CC and have debt paid off or the 2 years are free but still pay the last 2 years when they transfer and have loans. But if you saved money vigorously during CC and worked during the last 2 years when you transfer you could have very little debt",

      "text": "Completely debt free is possible, but it will depend a lot on scholarships. Without knowing your GPA, your major, what colleges you plan on applying to transfer to, where you live, etc., it is difficult to really estimate it.\n\nOften state universities are cheaper than private, but find an excellent private university and they might offer an amazing scholarship package (although those places often don't admit many community college transfer students anyways). If you transfer from community college to a state university in the same state, many will give at least decent scholarships just for that. Keep a good GPA (3.0+) and most likely you will get at least some merit scholarships. I would be wary of dragging out your studies, as the longer you drag it out the less scholarships you will continue to get.\n\nIt's not easy, I did pretty well at community college and still had to take on 3k in loans (though I didn't work), but it is possible.",

              "text": "First: Always ALWAYS do FASFA.\n\nSecond: Look through any and all free scholarship-finding websites, there is even one put out by the government. Apply for any and all you are semi-qualified for. If they want a 500 word paper about you and you only have a 400 word one, send it in anyways. Even if you aren't full qualified, apply anyways! They want a wrestler but you like boxing, apply anyways. Look for local organizations which might offer some, community foundations, social clubs, etc. However, I applied for dozens and didn't get a single one. \n\nThird: Get automatically-applied scholarships from your university. Things like doubling the FASFA amount, grants for transferring to an in-state university (if you go to a public university), scholarships for having a decent GPA, etc. These are generally the easiest and, for me, were the most beneficial.\n\nFourth: Apply for competitive scholarships from your university. Often they will offer a select few of full ride scholarships (you can become full-ride though combining the previous types of scholarships together, but these are usually a single scholarship), often based on merit and being a model citizen. These can be difficult to get but if you are good and know people to write excellent letters of recommendation, you might be able to get one.\n\nFifth: Sometimes other financial possibilities open up once in college. If you are really good and/or can ingrain yourself with a professor, there are often awards available to people deemed to be the best student in your department. It can be a very nice surprise when halfway through the semester you find out you were chosen by your major's professors to get a extra $1000 and win an elaborately named award. These are often unadvertised, and unless you are near the top of your class you won't even hear of it. But they can be helpful.\n\nFor all of these though, luck often plays a big role. Best of luck!",

                      "text": "Second: Just type online \"scholarship search\", or \"scholarships\" or something similar. Read through the requirements and see if you are eligible. If you are, or even if you are not quite, apply. Apply for everything and anything. Usually they may want a short essay, a CV, etc. Some may ask for more but remember to consider how much the scholarship is for. You shouldn't spend much time on a $250 scholarship, but a $5000 scholarship you should make sure your application is perfect. Also, check out local social clubs. My local Community Foundation, Masons, Ruritan Club, etc. all give away scholarships\n\nThird: You don't have to, as most are automatically applied, but it never hurts to ask. Some universities also have scholarship offices which can be helpful. Usually people think scholarship offices only try to get people to apply for Rhodes Scholarships and other ultra-competitive scholarships, but they often do have scholarships even non-geniuses can get.\n\nFourth: Not entirely, ask at financial aid offices to see if you qualify to apply for any. If you have a respectable academic record and can get decent letters of recommendation it's worth a shot. In my experience though, these full-ride scholarships are rare. That being said, as I mentioned before, everything varies depending your major, GPA, state, and school.\n\nFifth: You could ask. They might not know though, as they are generally not well-known, are competitive, and you generally don't apply for them (you get nominated by faculty and then voted upon).",

Obviously if OP does and can live with parents for 4+ years he/she should though if the goal is debt free.\n\nEdit: Of course taking 18 credits per semester is also a good option for savings but I tend to not recommend it for working students (at least the ones in STEM) because it can be a GPA killer due to schedule overload. 18 credits a semester is a good choice for students who aren't working but are taking out loans because then they can maybe graduate a semester early. Bad idea if working because then realistically the chance of failing a class due to lack of time is pretty high.",

You will likely have to give up some (only some) of your social life, but its worth it in the end. In my case, I had loans every semester but still had to pay out of pocket each semester as the loans would not cover it all. I also want to mention I got some scholarships here and there. Every semester out of pocket cost me $600-$2000. Then in loans, I had 13k. The rest was paid by scholarships I had. I paid off half of these a year before I graduated and and last half 3 months after graduation. Overall, including the out of pocket costs each semester and the loans, I paid \\~20k. I would advise you to pay yourself first after every paycheck! Meaning, immediately put 50-70% of your paycheck into your savings right when you are paid. To help with housing and food costs, I would advise either getting a place with roommates or apply to be an RA on campus where you get free room and meal plan.",

My job I have at school is great since I do school during the day and work at night. Additionally, apply for every scholarship and grant that you can, since it will lighten your workload in the long run.
