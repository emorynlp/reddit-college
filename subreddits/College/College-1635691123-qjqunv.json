  "text": "I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m being told there\u2019s issues with my aid, my transfer credits, and my degree. I have looked through everything on my end, and none of that matches up to what I see. I also get these texts saying to check my student email, and there isn\u2019t any emails that match what the texts say. I have a hard time calling my academic advisor because I have severe social anxiety, and I\u2019m exclusively doing online right now. I\u2019m also about to switch to another CC, but this started before I started to transfer.",

I know anxiety can be a b*tch when it comes to stuff like this, but sometimes it just can't be avoided. The supposed things that are going wrong according to the texts are important for your degree and you have to stay on top of them, no matter what.",
