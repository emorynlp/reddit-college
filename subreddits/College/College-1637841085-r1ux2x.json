  "title:": "why do college students suck up to professors more than high school students do with teachers?",
  "text": "I'm on my second week of college, and I've come to notice that nobody argues with a professor or jokes around with them in college, unlike in high school, I've met classmates who's personalities completely change when they're around professors, they pretend to be all nice and interested and smart and they talk to them as if they're trying to make friends with them, but when they're out of campus they're completely the opposite of what they were. Is it because college professors have more power over your grades than high school teachers do?",

                      "text": "I don\u2019t know where in Europe you are from, but I know that a lot of universities and professors have different standards regarding how students should act around them. One of my friends studied in Holland and she told me that some professors would even let students call them by their first name. I study at a university in Italy and I would definitely think someone who was overly friendly or joking with a professor to be a little\u2026strange, because usually all the professors I\u2019ve met have been very distant and aloof, and definitely want to be treated like gods walking upon the Earth. Exams in Italy are based on oral evaluations so it\u2019s not uncommon for professors to remember you if you were respectful towards them, asked interesting questions and \u201cacted smart\u201d, and definitely do take note of that when it comes to the evaluation. I know it must be hard for you because college is very different from high school in many ways, one advice I can give you is to try and read the room, study the professor and how they behave during a lesson: do they like to make jokes? Do they enjoy students who make jokes? Do they want you to call them by an honorific? And change your behavior accordingly. It doesn\u2019t have to mean sucking up, sometimes it just means survival and having a college experience as smooth as possible.",

Plus, the environment in college is often more professional, which means people are more formal to establish firm boundaries with the adults they are teaching. The prof isn't meant to be your friend, so they don't act like one.\n\n\nAt least in the US, those boundaries will loosen as you progress academically. Some profs are different with students they've taught a lot or have worked with. In grad school, it's more common to be treated as colleagues since you're a professional learner by that point (a lot more group gatherings with students outside of class, and just generally a different dynamic). But in those cases, it's because the nature of the relationship has changed.",

Yes, they have power over my grade, but they also have power over how much I can learn from them. \n\nI came to learn, so those deeper conversations only come from a deeper connection. Therefore, I invested time into getting to know each Professor. \n\nNow, I know who will give me the easy-A, the recommendation, be a mentor\u2014these are all important. \n\nPeople said I was \u201cfake,\u201d (I wasn\u2019t) but now I\u2019m in a top uni from those connections.
