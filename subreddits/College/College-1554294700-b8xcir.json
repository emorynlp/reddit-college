The lowest I made is a 20% while the highest is a 69%.",

I think I was so anxious that it clouded my thoughts pushing what I needed to the back of my brain, so by studying right before, I knew I was prepared and way more confident. Also after I study I take a break to watch youtube or do whatever just to relax my nerves. Hope this helps good luck ! :)",

He would select 2 for us to write on. No assignment has ever given me more anxiety.\n\nI was overprepared. I spent HOURS creating fully-fleshed outlines for each prompt. The night before, I still felt unprepared so I decided to pull an all nighter and review. Needless to say, I bombed. Still haven't gotten my grade but I didn't even come close to finishing either of the essays. I broke into tears at one point in the writing. I absolutely loathe timed writing and to be forced to reference a random selection out of over 50 readings was cruel imo.",

      "text": "Honestly OP, I know the feeling but it basically comes down to not having studied enough or not having studied in the right way. First of all don't try to cram everything into your head on the last day. What you should be doing is learning the theory throughout the course, then when it's time for revision you quickly check you know all the theory (for maths it would be definitions, properties and theorems). Then you do exercises and previous exams until the questions become a matter of automation. It may not be necessary to go that far if you're naturally good at what you're doing, but if you're struggling then I recommend you do this.",

I figured out that I have a really hard time thinking about math in the abstract, but I'm really good at thinking about math in physical terms (things like money, motion, etc). If I just to remember how to calculate a derivate in a purely numerical sense, I get confused. If I think about differential problems as profit maximization or velocity problems though, it all makes a lot more sense. \n\nTL;DR: Rephrase information in a way that feels more natural to how you think. That way, you can recall the information in a way that's more intrinsic to your own thought process.",

Example: if you get test anxiety, be anxious while you study. Chew the same gum. If the exam room is going to be silent, study in silence. If it's going to be bright, study where it's bright.\n\nAlso, quiz yourself. Make test questions you think could be on the exam, and make sure you can answer them fully. Reword them, and try again. This way you know if you're connecting the right dots so you can access that information on exam day.\n\nSincerely, someone who is studying for her cognitive psychology class that keeps beating all of this into my head.",

If I was able to do a problem or remember something consistently while studying but start to blank before the exam, I just ignore it because it'll likely come back to me when doing the test and I feel like trying to quickly memorizing stuff will just stress me out and make me more likely to blank. It's worked pretty good for me.",
