  "text": "Canned beans or baked beans are delicious and doable in a microwave and so is microwaveable rice and you have yourself a whole meal. It\u2019s cheap as well! When I was in a dorm room I managed to make mashed potatoes in my dorm room (I don\u2019t put milk in mine) , chicken in my crockpot/slow cooker and frozen veggies in the microwave. Also hotdogs and beans and or rice could be a meal. Sausage as well if it can be microwaved. Have fun with your food creations! Many college students are tempted to eat ramen noodles because it\u2019s cheap and tastes decent but you can have a more fulfilling meal with a little extra work involved. Just some tips I would have loved when I was in the dorms.",

Maple flavored Beans i bought for about $1.85 from Aldi. They are already flavored and with the beans and the packages of hotdogs it can last a decent while.",
