  "text": "This is haunting me right now. I am in my third semester at the university. But I forgot a lot of things that have been taught to me on my first semester. I feel like this is only happening to me since my memory ability is a bit weak. I did study properly, but yeah its all gone after the exam. I don't know why. And I think my friend not really concern about this. This terrifies me cause why I go to college to learn and to forget all of them in the end.\n\nMaybe is there anyone who feel the same as me. Or any advice ?. That would be helpful to me. Thank you.",

No one(unless you have a photographic memory) is able to recite off information from all the classes they have taken out of the blue. I\u2019m a junior right now and concepts have to be linked together or brought up for me to be like \u201coh yeah I know what that is\u201d. \n\nAlso remember that if your do forget something in your career you can look things up. Doctors have to research symptoms to diagnosis something that isn\u2019t common to them, lawyers have to research precedented cases, no one will ever remember every concept they came across in college. Don\u2019t feel bad about it, seriously!!",
