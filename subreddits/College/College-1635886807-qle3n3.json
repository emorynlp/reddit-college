  "text": "I find myself have huge difficulty finding the drive to give and shit about this program anymore. I have made it 3 semesters in, but I find the work to be rather tedious and frustrating, which is not something I want to deal with daily for work life. I know not all jobs will always be \"exciting\" but holy shit is programming actually so boring. Remote schooling also really puts a dent into that as well.\n\nHas anybody here quite the program before, deciding it wasn't for them? I feel like I have been at that point since semester 2, but of course everyone tells me \"stick with it\". Now I am in a field I feel like I am forced to enter.",
