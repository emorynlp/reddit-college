  "text": "It's been almost a year living in the dorm, i had alot of problems such as loss of privacy, shared bathrooms, shared kitchens, but the wrost thing is sharing a room with someone, i tried really hard to cope with it, but i just can't, i had a lot of bad roommates, but this last one i just really want to get out, everyday he wakes up at 5 o'clock and turn the lights on and start praying for like 45 minutes, i told him several times don't turn the lights and be quite in your prayers, but he never listened to me, he uses all my stuff without permission, he refuses to use headphones, he always talking on the phone loudly, it's the wrost thing that I'm facing, i told the dorm administration they told me as long as he's not breaking the laws we can't do anything, i can move to a studio alone outside the dorm but i will cost me like 7X the price.",

      "text": "Living with roommates can be tough. If he\u2019s using your things without permission that\u2019s theft and you should talk to dorm administrators about it. Use whatever resources you can to remedy this situation, nothing should be more important than your own well being. \n\nAlso where do you live that a studio apartment costs 7x the amount of a dorm? That seems like you ought to be able to find a better deal.",

      "text": "Most people in dorms are 18-19 year olds away from home for the first time and don't know how to respect people's personal belongings because they're used to their family only.\n\nFind an off campus apartment with separate rooms, most likely will be cheaper if its 2 or 3 rooms than dorms. You would share the common areas but at least your bedroom/bathroom will be separate and you don't have to worry about them using your stuff when you're gone.",
