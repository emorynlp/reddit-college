  "text": "I've not been the best student. I have two midterms this week. The first one was in bio and I had it yesterday. Everyone seemed to do poorly. The other one is in chem tomorrow. I just did the review and I know literally nothing. Both professors drop the lowest grade. I'm really behind in class. Is there any way to come back this late in the semester or just I just resign to failure?",

      "text": "Yeah, it's possible for some classes. Bio, yeah, you I am pull off bio. But Chemistry? Oof... Chem isn't the kind of class you can fuck off the first half and make up with future test grades, the knowledge in chem is cumulative. Knowing the stuff taught before the midterm is vital to comprehending the information going forward. \n\nCan you do it? Sure, it is possible. Most schools offer some kind of tutoring services, if someone were to hit them up a few times a week, visit the professors office, watch some Khan academy vids, and really dedicate themselves to learning it, they can do it. Are you? You know the kind of academic discipline you are capable of, is it enough to catch up on half a semester of chem while learning the new shit? You don't have to tell me, this is something only you can answer with honest introspection.",

      "text": "What kind of chemistry are we talking about here? If its organic chemistry then youre done, just pack it up and realize you wont pass. If its general chemistry then of course you can come back from a bad midterm and especially if the professor drops the lowest grade.\n\nNow the way to come back from that is of course have a do-or-die mindset and realize that you CAN pass the class or get the grade you want if you put in the time. I would do a chapter a day or half a chapter if you can, doesnt have to be every day in a row of course. Take good notes, study the notes, do examples to reinforce the material, study the notes and examples every now and then, and thats pretty much it, that is if its general chemistry.",

      "text": "Hell yeah it\u2019s do-able.  This time last year I got a 32% on a midterm. I passed that class with a C-. Following term in the same type of class I got a 47%. Passed that class with a C. \n\nTakes a lot of extra work and reading but it\u2019s doable. I believe in you, if I can do it you can do it. Best of luck.",

      "text": "Depends on your hard work/ study and their syllabus . And the grade weight of each assignment. For example, if the midterm is 70% of your grade then 30% of your grade is HW. You won\u2019t but if you have a split of 30% exam 1 30% exam 2 and 30% HW and 10% quizzes then definitely is.",
