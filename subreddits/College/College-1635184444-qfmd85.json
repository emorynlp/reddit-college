  "text": "Greetings everyone,  \nI am a CS undergrad currently in my 2nd year. This semester, I was very excited about this one particular subject that I was looking forward to the most. Before going to this subject's class I always make sure to cover up some material from the recommended books. Now in class, there will be times when the concept that my professor elaborates on conflicts with the idea that I already have in my head. As a result of this, I would often make sure to ask questions and have discussions in the middle of the class. Now, this professor grew tired of my questioning and expressed his annoyance as well by saying that my questioning wastes other students' time. I didn't make an issue out of this and as a result, I started visiting his room during office hours to have my doubts cleared up.  \nNow earlier today, I went to his room to talk about this topic \"X\" that we discussed in class and I told him that I feel like that the solution that was presented in the X topic is false because, in the later pages, the book makes it clear that there is indeed a problem with this solution, but he disagreed and I asked him to elaborate why so, and he gave a very unclear, random explanation. And then I asked, \"Professor, I feel like I really don't the point that you are trying to make here. Can you explain to me this concept in the context of a topic \"Y\" that is discussed in the next few pages of the book?\".  \nAnd immediately, he exclaimed, \"Why should I? I am not giving you guys personal home tuitions. We will talk about it when we discuss this topic Y in class\". I kind of thought that it was rude of him to say something like this to me. He also said that I really shouldn't be studying future topics when I am too stupid to understand the current ones. He also held my quiz's performance against me (I tried to explain how I inadvertently got the question wrong, but I also let him know that I totally own up to my fault). So, in short, 3 things happened:\n\n\\- I was told that I was too stupid for not grasping his point and especially questions (even outside of the classroom).\n\n\\- I was told that he can't explain to me a concept further down the book because he is not my personal tutor\n\n\\- He made up this prejudice in his mind that since my quiz's performance was bad, I must be a stupid student.\n\nAnyways, hearing all this kind of hurts because this is the subject that I am really passionate about, and having someone (especially a professor with a Ph.D.) shame you for raising questions sounds strange to me. I feel like I had higher expectations from a university environment.\n\nI am interested in knowing what you guys think of this whole situation since I don't have anyone to talk it out with.",

      "text": "I think that your professor probably thinks you\u2019re trying to fit him into a box of what you think, where his thoughts are always \u201cwrong\u201d to you. Professors want to feel respected, and sometimes that\u2019s only satisfactory to them in the form of agreement. That\u2019s naturally not going to be in everything in many cases, but should at least be in something to show that you\u2019re trying to see yourself on common ground with your professor.\n\nAll in all, your professor could be taking your approaches personally in taking what you say as a lack of agreement, even dismissiveness, and being insulted by that. He might also be harsh in personality regardless, maybe because he could see himself as \u201cabove you\u201d as a professor who\u2019s already been through what you have going on as a student.\n\nGenerally speaking, your professor can be somewhat justified, if not entirely so, in suggesting that their job is to tell things as they see them. A tutor will go in more depth when you\u2019re regularly having trouble seeing things a certain way. Tutors are for students who are routinely showing signs of struggle in understanding. Your professor doesn\u2019t see him seeing things your way as a problem of his\u2014his job is to convey information, not understand that in which students have to share.",
