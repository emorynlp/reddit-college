Experiencing a few weird things for a majority of my classes this semester and I would like to find out if my perception is wrong or validate my claims by using actual black and white evidence.",

      "text": "Professors usually have academic freedom to conduct their classes as they see fit. The only times where intervention may be applicable is when they do things like canceling half the classes of the semester or committing violations of sexual harassment or discrimination policies. TAs usually report to the department and work under the supervision of the assigned faculty member. In any case, professors/instructors of record do not have the kind of \u201caccountability structure\u201d that, say, a customer service agent would have as they are not customer service providers.\n\nWhat exactly are these \u201cweird things\u201d that are being done? Do they violate law or any kind of major policy?",

          "text": "\u201cUsually\u201d having academic freedom is not the same as having academic freedom. Also, what is academic freedom defined as, are there any overarching documents, policies, or codes of conduct which spell all of this out.\n\nSo you are telling me that, in the US, where everything is highly regulated, there are a group of people who are a part of organizations which take in an enormous amount of money and receive federal funding, no regulations exist?\n\nI am not here to bash or rant, I am asking if documents like I am describing exist, and if so where could I begin to find them.\n\nHow is someone providing a service, which costs money, not customer service related?",
