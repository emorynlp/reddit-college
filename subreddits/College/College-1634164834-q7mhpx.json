      "text": "Professors usually have academic freedom to conduct their classes as they see fit. The only times where intervention may be applicable is when they do things like canceling half the classes of the semester or committing violations of sexual harassment or discrimination policies. TAs usually report to the department and work under the supervision of the assigned faculty member. In any case, professors/instructors of record do not have the kind of \u201caccountability structure\u201d that, say, a customer service agent would have as they are not customer service providers.\n\nWhat exactly are these \u201cweird things\u201d that are being done? Do they violate law or any kind of major policy?",

              "text": "There are usually policy documents available on the university website for faculty affairs. They're usually somewhere within the broader domain of academic affairs or housed within the purview of the provost's office. They don't typically govern specific classroom activities as every university, college, department, program, and even course differ in various ways. If you want a definition of academic freedom, I suggest Googling - there are tons of resources on it.\n\nIt depends on what you are asking as to what is regulated and what is not. Can professors harass students or break the law? Of course not. Do they freedom to design assessments, exams, etc. and teach their classes as they see fit without undue influence or interference? Yes. In many cases, complaints are usually because a student thinks something is unfair (sometimes they're right, and sometimes they're wrong). In other cases, there may be legitimate issues that are relative minor in the grand scheme of things (i.e., emails going unanswered for weeks, or things not getting graded in over a month), but there are usually no policies that say \"Professors have to grade XYZ by ABC time\" or \"Professors have to reply to emails within 48 business hours.\" Typically, these are things that students can complain about in their opinion surveys, which may or may not be addressed/ignored when enough complaints are made. Other kinds of complaints can stem from students not understanding or being in a good place to evaluate whether they are learning or not, or their expectations may not be in line with what the course is intended to provide (i.e., complaints about group work or getting upset because they are expected to read outside of class). In any case, there are not many concrete guidelines for how a professor runs a course due to the principles of academic freedom and the high degree of flexibility required for classes across campuses.\n\nIn short, if you would provide more details on what you find \"weird,\" then I can better assess what it is you think your professors should be held accountable for and then tell you more clearly whether what you're asking for likely exists.\n\nAlso, professors are not direct service providers as would be found in the general marketplace. They are hired by universities to conduct research, teach courses (regardless of enrollment levels above a certain minimum), and perform service activities. Professors are not customer service agents as such - they are experts in their respective fields who rely on that expertise to assess students' learning, more in the vein of a consultant in a client-based model. Some professors are passionate about the teaching parts of their jobs and knock it out of the park; some couldn't care less and do the minimum just to get by; some are somewhere in between. Regardless, there are many dimensions to a professor's job that are evaluated, and for better or for worse, student opinions of instruction often do not heavily factor into those evaluations beyond overall average scores.",

                      "text": "Sounds like some class management issues on his part. Have you tried speaking to him directly about the issues? If so, and if it was not resolved, the next step is to speak to the department chair about your concerns. Some things like office hours are codified into policy; others are not. For example, the requirement may be \"Classes must follow their respective syllabi,\" but those syllabi can be changed at any time/for any reason, and as long as students are notified, then there has been no violation of policy (though it can create stress for students and shouldn't be done unless necessary, there is nothing that says a syllabus cannot be revised mid-semester).\n\nWe are evaluated by a committee of other professors who assess what we have done over the course of the year and then develop an evaluation report, which the chair then signs off on. It has been similar at other universities I've been. Rules are laid out in the faculty handbook but are often again very vague as what one does and does not do in a classroom typically varies. It basically really amounts to don't harass students, turn grades in on time, create and follow a syllabus, get final grades in by X date, etc. As for how I teach classes, that's pretty much up to me.\n\nThe faculty handbook and all policies are available on our university's public-facing website. If you are at a public university, you should be able to find the faculty handbook for your university, as well, unless they have it hidden or restricted.",

In practice, I didn\u2019t cancel a class in 4 years so the one time I had surgery my chair just said feel bettter and didnt check that I had actually done my job.\n\nThis varies a lot by school.\n\nIf posted in r/askprofessors  what you think is weird you will get advice if it is weird.
