I lurk around the professor subreddit, so it inspired me to make this post, and I wanted to ask the students themselves. I have to teach an online course. It'll be fully online, so there will be no live sessions (i.e. asynchronous).\n\nI'm not really a fan of discussion posts or group work for many reasons that y'all don't like them and I never liked them as a student and as an instructor. The problem? In many institutions, the online departments require us to have student-student interactions. So, we have to include this component in the classrooms, and that's why a lot of professors/online course designers opt for discussion posts. In the US, we're required to make the class compliant with the ADA, so that also cuts a lot of options. \n\nI teach a class in the social sciences. The class will be anywhere between 40-50 students. \n\nDo you have any suggestions as to what I can do in my class that includes student-to-student interactions? Maybe there was something in a course that you enjoyed?", "author": "North_Log_4902", "created": 1632855205, "retrieved": 1632945458, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hemp0ni": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxd3vh/discussion_postsgroup_work_asking_for/hemp0ni/", "text": "Maybe Peer editing of essays can bring student to student interaction where they learn?
