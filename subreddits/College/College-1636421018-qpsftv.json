  "text": "For me I\u2019ve made a couple friends but I don\u2019t have a friend group or squad. Some days I spend entirely alone, which is starting to eat at me. Otherwise I\u2019m pretty okay with having the few friends I have somewhat made, even if we\u2019re more acquaintances than good friends! I just feel sad cuz everyone else around me grew super close super fast but I don\u2019t have anyone like that.",

It doesn't make sense because everyone told me it would be easy to make friends, and I made a huge effort to put myself out there; I really tried very hard. But it seems like everyone figured out within days and that was it, the window was shut. I knew this was gonna happen too. My friends from HS talk about what they're doing at college: going to parties, hanging out with friends, being normal people etc. I smile and be happy for them but on the inside I am angry at them for having what I don't.",
