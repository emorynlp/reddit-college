If there was an early-morning test, I would just come to school a few hours late in time for the next class.\n\nI\u2019ve had this recurring dream about weekly or more since I have graduated college 13 years ago: there is a new government mandate that after college you must go back to high school for an additional year. I keep skipping English or math class, and the teacher has caught on. I always end up stressing out because I\u2019m failing the class and have to tell my parents that they\u2019ll have to pay for another year of \u201ccollege high school\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Going back to my high school in the dream is always set in bizzarro high school since it\u2019s both familiar and foreign. In reality, I skipped school a lot whenever there was a test I was not prepared for. I never got caught, and I did this so much I couldn\u2019t believe no teacher ever said anything during the second or third make-up test that they administered.\n\nThey say when you skip school or don\u2019t pay attention, you\u2019re only hurting yourself.

Great class tbh.\n\n2nd was the first time i ever wokeup laughing from a dream. Long story short i was takimg a women in film class because it met requirement credits. In the class was 3/4th film majors who were all trying to break into the film industry. Night before a test i dreamt that the teacher announced to the class that everyone who scored a 93% or higher in the overall course he would put in a word to the states film and media head board (basically all the people lobbying for more benefits for film in my state that also basically know every job in the state and at minimum can get an interview for you). The teacher had us come one by one up to the front and wpuld tell us our current grade and how close we were vs how bad we were. I went up and was told 84% and how i was a failure and i was never going to make it in the film industry.\n\nNow, why did i laugh? Well, 1 i ddint care about the class or the film industry. As far as i was.concerned calling an 84% in a class i only cared about the humanities credit for was laughable. 2 (and this is the big one) that film board the teacher would put in a good word for us?
