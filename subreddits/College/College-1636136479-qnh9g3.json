  "text": "I\u2019m a psychology major with a minor in poli-sci and plan on going for my Ph.D once I finish undergrad and then maybe in the long run get into local politics. However, I also have a love for psychiatry and I would pretty much equally love to be in either profession. But of course medical school is very hard, the pre-reqs are difficult, and it takes a long time to get through (psychiatrists do a 4 year residency program after they get their doctorate). The reason I was thinking about doing this is so once I graduate I have the option to go to either med school or go for my Ph.D, and I\u2019d be able to balance my degree requirements with medical school requirements. I\u2019ve heard that medical schools don\u2019t like when you take core classes over summer and winter semesters, but I wanted to know some people\u2019s opinions on doing this is",
