  "text": "This assignment isn't a submission. The teacher asked us to perform a skit which doesn't make much sense considering the fact that we are engineering students. I really want to skip this one and I don't care about my grades. How do tell the professor that I'm gonna skip without sounding like a douche delinquent?",

My teacher didn\u2019t care that writing essays on world religion weren\u2019t relevant to my Computer Science major.\n\nAssignments won\u2019t be relevant to your major but the class which you are in. So tbh you sound like a douche delinquent already by thinking you\u2019re above it.",

      "text": "maybe explain a little bit of why you don\u2019t want to, but don\u2019t use the explanation \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have to do this, we\u2019re engineering students\u201d. If nothing else, maybe say you\u2019re uncomfortable performing in front of the class, or you could even go so far as to say you have social anxiety or something. I don\u2019t know you personally or why you don\u2019t really want to do this, but a reason like that may make the professor empathize with you. \n\nAlso, never make it evident that you don\u2019t care about the grade. Say, \u201cI understand if my aversion to this type of assignment will result in a poor grade, and I do not want this to be indicative of my work ethic as a student, but I do not wish to participate in the skit.\u201d\n\nYou may even want to see if the professor could offer a supplementary assignment that you may complete in lieu of the skit. I know you said you don\u2019t care about the grades, but this may make your professor more likely to let you skip it.",
