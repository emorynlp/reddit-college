  "text": "The title says it all. The first serious girl I am dating keeps telling me I need to find a hobby, engage with other people outside of my faculty but honestly, I don't know what I like to do or what I should do. I am completely lost. I understand what she means, cause right now all I have in my life is either related to my studies (friends, events, etc.) or something I can do by myself (going to the gym or cooking). I really should be looking for something else to look forward to in life, something to enjoy other than studying, cause it's not something sustainable in the long term. I am lost cause I don't know what to do. I wanted to start learning how to play the drums but I don't have enough money to pay for it. I feel tired of all this nonsense. Why is it so difficult to enjoy life?",
