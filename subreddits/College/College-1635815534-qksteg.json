  "text": "So I am starting at a new school and I've already been to another one. I'd like to not share my transcripts from my old school with this as I had done really bad in school due to some personal issues. I'd like a fresh clean slate and I was wondering if I must report my old college transcripts or if I can keep them away from my new college without getting into trouble",

      "text": "It is important not to try to hide this. Financial aid will easily find out that you previously attended another institution and your admission could be rescinded for falsifying your application. Second chances happen often because colleges understand that this is a common experience for students. You may end up on admission committee and need to provide justification of your past performance and how and why you will do better this time, but a bad previous transcript is not an automatic death knell. Good luck.",
