And even for those who are lucky enough to have an in-person ceremony, it\u2019ll be unrecognizable. \n\nPersonally, I do have an in-person ceremony, but no guests are permitted. My mom was my inspiration to achieve higher education in the first place and has been my rock through this journey, so not having the opportunity to share that moment with her in person is disheartening. \n\nStill, I hope that you\u2019ll keep in mind that a lack of a ceremony doesn\u2019t diminish your accomplishment in the slightest. You\u2019re graduating from college, which is a feat on its own, never mind during a global pandemic. I hope you\u2019ll find the opportunity to share and celebrate this momentous achievement with your family and friends. You did it! :)",
