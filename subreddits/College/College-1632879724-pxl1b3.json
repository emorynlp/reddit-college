I go to college fully online, and I live around 7 hours from campus. I decided this semester that I want to pursue graduate level study. So I\u2019ve been trying to find ways to enhance my degree. \n\nI\u2019ve applied for a RA program, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll get picked since I\u2019d have to be fully online. I was told that because of COVID some online only positions should still be available, so time will tell. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to a few other online psychology students, and one of them said a psych professor told her last year that our school sucks at helping online students prepare for graduate school. So I\u2019m discouraged that there\u2019s not a lot of options for me. She said the professor suggested to build rapport with some professors so they will remember you when it\u2019s time to write recommendation letters. But that advice doesn\u2019t satisfy me. \n\nIs there anyway I could enhance my degree without help from my school? I thought about contacting psychologists in my area and asking if I could shadow them, just to see what they would say. I figured if one agreed I could contact my school to workout a way to accommodate this in my degree plan. But I wasn\u2019t sure, I\u2019m hoping to get some insight or advice on what to do about this?", "author": "__REDMAN__", "created": 1632879724, "retrieved": 1632945412, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
