  "text": "Has anyone else not been taking college as seriously as they should in this past semester (fall 2021)? At first I thought it was just me struggling to adjust to my new college life and possibly burning out (I\u2019m a transfer and my current college is very different from my previous one) but after talking to many other students at my college they all expressed feeling the same way and having similar issues.\n\nI do not know if it\u2019s because this is the first semi-normal semester since the pandemic and people are having to get used to the norm. Has anyone else been having any motivation issues? Or issues with taking school work seriously?",

      "text": "I\u2019ve definitely been having this issue. My classes are hybrid. I don\u2019t mind in person. I dont mind online. (I actually prefer online ngl). But i really hate half online and half in person. Somehow it makes me feel really disconnected from the class. Not to mention, theres been some natural disasters at home (plus a pandemic). Its just been tough to keep my head in it. Im doing well in my classes but I dont have any of the enthusiasm for learning these days.",

          "text": "I\u2019ve also lost enthusiasm for learning. I do better with online classes but I like to have a few in person classes to keep me motivated to get out and meet new people. It feels more like I\u2019m floating through my classes though rather than actually participating, like you said just being disconnected.",

      "text": "I can also relate. I entered fall of 2019, so I really only had one normal semester of college. I\u2019ve gotten used to the online formatting, so this semester (most of my classes are in person, with the option to watch online for the bigger classes like ochem and biochem) has been a grand struggle. I don\u2019t really care about what I\u2019m learning anymore (I should be studying for an exam as I type this right now, ha) and my social anxiety has gotten worse. I also forgot how maddening it is to take an exam in a huge lecture hall.",

          "text": "I totally get that. I know I need to interact with the other students in my classes but its just hard because it has been a while since I\u2019ve really interacted with people my age despite having chances to. I just cannot bring myself to jump in the conversation. I\u2019ve also noticed that happening in my dorm as well. At the start of the semester the RA (my roommate) and the other residents were interacting and actually doing stuff together and now the only reason anyone talks or interact with each other it\u2019s to tell them to be quiet.",
