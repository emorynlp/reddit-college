  "title:": "Should I move back home for the rest of the school year?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman at a small private college about 30 minutes away from my home. My parents wanted me to experience on campus living, so they encouraged me to get a dorm room (which is where I currently live) also because I don\u2019t currently have a car, but I would if I commuted from home. \n\nI wanted to live on campus to feel more connected to the school, but I don\u2019t even feel connected to it anyway. The school is too small for me and feels dead all the time, and everyone just drives off campus all day. It\u2019s one of the reasons i\u2019m actually considering transferring after this year, because i\u2019m not happy here and don\u2019t feel like I belong.\n\nAlso, the dorm I live in is awful. It\u2019s suite style, so at least I only have to share a bathroom with 3 other people, but it\u2019s still awful. Nobody is friendly with anyone, everyone just stays in their rooms all day and my roommate and I are the only ones on the hall with our door open because we try to seem open and friendly. Things are constantly breaking around here, because I live in one of the oldest dorms in North Carolina. Not even the hall bath style freshman dorms have as much trouble as we do with shit breaking. And every other dorm seems to actually be fun. Living here is quite lonely.\n\nBut one thing I have loved is my independence. Living on my own has been fun, and although the most I would live at home would be the rest of my freshman year (until I get better upperclassmen housing or transfer elsewhere), I think I would definitely miss that feeling of living on my own, even though it would just be temporary.\n\nIf I live at home, I finally have a reason to buy a car, my tuition statement would be cheaper, and I could even get a job off campus that pays way more than my work study one. I\u2019m a musician too, so I would be able to practice my music without pissing off my roommates.\n\nShould I try this out, even for just a semester? I don\u2019t want to give up on my school but it\u2019s really hard to stay happy here.",

And 30 minutes isn\u2019t a bad commute either, it usually takes 20 to get to my community college. \n\nDo what you feel like will keep you motivated to continue school, and what to believe will be best for your mental health. Dorm life isn\u2019t for everyone.",
