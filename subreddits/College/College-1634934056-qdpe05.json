  "text": "I am afraid of failing my class and I don't know what to do. At the beginning of the semester the professor assigned us to groups that we would work with for all the assignments. Its supposed to be a team effort but no one ever want to do the work. When I bring up the due dates and the work we have to do I am ignored. One time we decided on a day and time to do the assignment, when I asked in the group chat if we were doing it no one answered me. Today there is a paper due and no one is mentioning it. I was ignored again when I texted the group chat about the assignment. I have no idea what I am supposed to do. How do I bring this up to the professor? I don't know what to say to her. I'm afraid she'll blame me completely.",

Group projects in academic settings are more of a you need to CYA by taking the initiative because you're bound to have one or more students not competent to participate.\n\nIn an employment setting, those people you mentioned would be fired and remaining people has to pick up the slack.",
