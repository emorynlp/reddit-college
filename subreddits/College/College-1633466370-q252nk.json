I also start by doing small tasks in the morning soI feel productive. The other thing is you feel motivated because you realize you wasted the day and it took the whole day for you to become motivated because your morning routine isn\u2019t very structured, now that\u2019s just an assumption but that\u2019s my best guess",

      "text": "Same. I work best from around 6pm to 1-ish am. Consequently if I can, I usually sleep from 2 to 10/11.\n\nLet me tell you, it will be hell later. I did a university required internship this summer and the company, while willing to be somewhat flexible with working hours, had mandatory present hours between 9am and 4pm (or maybe it was 3...? doesn't matter). Since I had to allocate time for commuting as well and I just couldn't go to sleep much earlier than my usual this meant that I was regularly doing 8 hour workdays on 3-5 hours of sleep until my sleep rhythm finally started to shift to accommodate. And even then I did more work in the last 2 hours of my day than the first 6. I'm still working with them but because I'm still doing university next to it I was put in charge of my own schedule, no mandatory presence bracket. I tend to be the last one at the office but my boss commented that I look a lot more relaxed and rested now than I did during the summer. \n\nIt's a tricky thing, because you definitely should continue, if this is how you are productive. That's just how it is. On the other hand, unless you're self employed later in my experience so far society currently doesn't really accommodate night owls. Try for a compromise between the two maybe.",

Staying up past 10 is near impossible. \n\nI like to be most productive during the day.... you know... when my classes are. Most of the world works on the first shift schedule. Having to make that transition is such a pain in the ass. \n\nYou can't tell your employer during work that you're more productive at 2 fuckin' am. They need you to be productive from when you show up until you leave. I've seen so many people get shit canned for this kind of stuff. Show up to work as if they literally rolled out of bed. Puffy eyed and useless. Trying to sleep during breaks and stuff.",
