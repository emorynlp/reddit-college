I'm not failing, but I see no relevance in the courses I'm taking. If I woke up and it was somehow the last week of school, I'd be ecstatic and relieved.",

We literally stare at computers for 12 hours a day, every day. Now that I realize my career in English would be just more staring at computers but in an office all day, I\u2019m leaving it. So yup, I\u2019m really happy that the semester will end soon and I can change my major and figure out what to do with my life. I wonder how other liberal arts majors are doing",
