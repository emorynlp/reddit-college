My school doesn't give refunds for dropped courses after August, so if I drop I'd be wasting $700 and only be taking 3 classes or 10 credits (1 class has lab section so 1 credit extra). \n\nThis would make me a part time student, but I'm not on any financial aid so that won't be much of a problem I think.\n\nShould I just take a C or a D or is it best to drop the course? I also have AP credit and am planning to do some courses over winter break at my local CC. Honestly I feel very guilty right now for making such a dumb decision and staying in the course past the refund deadline.

I procrastinated too much and In the end I decided to drop the class (halfway through the semester) instead of having a mental health crisis. I was out money, but for me it was worth it as I wasn\u2019t constantly stressed and on the verge of a breakdown. \n\nIf you being behind in the class is affecting you mentally, I\u2019d say drop it. If it\u2019s something you think you could catch up with, you could stay in it just to get the credits. Create a schedule with a catch up plan (make sure to put your other classes in there so you don\u2019t fall behind on them too). In the end, it might help you with getting your credit/ged requirements to graduate, which is never a bad thing.\n\nAs for whether it\u2019s ok to take 10 credits, it\u2019s ok to take whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. Unless you\u2019re on a visa that requires a certain number of courses or you need it for a financial aid requirement, the amount of courses you take doesn\u2019t really matter. The only thing it might affect is how soon you graduate.", "author": "growinwithweeds", "created": 1632686262, "upvotes": 3}}}
