  "text": "What should I do\n\nI\u2019m on my first semester of college, I\u2019m not where I want to be. I got accepted into my favorite school for the Spring semester and am still going there, but for the fall semester I decided to enroll at another school to transfer credits in the spring. However, I really hate it here, like really really hate it, and feel like I\u2019d be better off just working until I start in the spring at the school I\u2019m much more interested in. If I decide to do this, What do I say to the schools?",

Nothin wrong with saying that as it\u2019s ultimately your money being invested into the school you want to go to:",

That is assuming you\u2019d want the credits to transfer over.",
