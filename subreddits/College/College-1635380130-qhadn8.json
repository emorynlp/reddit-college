Even some of those students who look like they have everything together have taken a few gut punches to the grade book. \n\nThe most important thing to do now is step back, break the cycle of stress, realize what you are doing obviously isn't working, and make a plan for how you're going to approach it differently. An A might be off the table, but you're not too far gone to pull out a decent grade if you turn this around. \n\nFind what resources are available, study groups, office hours, even a private tutor if you need it. Don't be ashamed to get extra help, and don't expect things to get better if you try to just slog through the rest of the semester.",

      "text": "Hey we all go through that in one way or another. My advise is to just move on with it. You cant change the past so why dwell on it. I would suggest that since it doesn't come easy to you, you should spend more time looking over the background of what you're learning and maybe utilize other learning techniques. I have always been one to find other ways to learn something because I was never satisfied with how the prof would teach it. As for the unbalance in your life, spend the day relaxing and doing something you like. You can always use a day or two off just to recalibrate yourself a little and then to get back onto your studies. I hope this helps a little, good luck to you!",
