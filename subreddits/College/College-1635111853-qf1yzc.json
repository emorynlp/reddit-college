  "title:": "It is possible to recover academically in college after doing poorly in high school?",
  "text": "Through the span of my high school career, my grades have progressively gotten worse due to mental health and family-related complications. This has led me to get into a sub-par college. In the past few months, however, I have begun to recover a bit. If I manage to improve my grades and participate in extracurriculars within my first year of college, would it be possible to transfer to a better one the following year?",

      "text": "Yes, it is possible.  That\u2019s exactly what I did- went to a local state university with like an 80% acceptance rate, got the grades up and transferred to a much better university.  Just make sure you take courses that will likely transfer over and apply towards your prospective major or at least core requirements.  You don\u2019t want to be a junior and be playing catch up your last two years.",

      "text": "yes 100% possible. like what other people said, high school grades usually do not matter once you go to college, and even if they do, they do not hold nearly as much weight as your college grades. also, it shows improvement which is very good. i would also talk to your college advisor and reach out to the colleges you want to go to next year to make the process easier. best of luck, and i applaud you for recovering!",

It's happened to me and many other people I know. \n\n> If I manage to improve my grades and participate in extracurriculars within my first year of college\n\nUnless you're shooting for an Ivy, extracurriculars are unlikely to matter. Schools just want to know that you can do well as a student there, and your GPA is what gives them that information, so be sure to prioritize GPA above all else (not above your mental health though-- your mental health is more important than your GPA).",
