I try to communicate them as clearly as I can. I have what some would call \u201cmild\u201d autism and some dyslexia/sound processing issues (yes, I know that\u2019s not proper terminology\u2026) I sit up in the front. I try my best to understand what is going on but sometimes I need clarification. It makes me sick that people find amusement in that. I can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s wrong with me. Is it the way I talk? Do I just sound fckin stupid? Do I not notice it? What the hell\u2026 it\u2019s honestly kindof eating me up *not knowing why* \u2026 I am pretty good at masking, but I just want to know where I\u2019m slipping.
