People are friendly enough, but I don't think they know why they're in college. Very few people I've met in college actually want to be there, in general folks are unmotivated and seem to lack perspective on life (like, good grades matter, not because your parents say so, but so that you can go on to do something amazing with your life). It's a symptom of a different problem, but not something I want to be around. It wastes my time, their time and money, and does on number on our professors who are their wits end trying to turn them around.
