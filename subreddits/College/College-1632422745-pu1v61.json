I am considering applying to Swarthmore College. I want to study computer science and economics, but it seems like Swarthmore only offers a Bachelors of Arts degree for computer science.\n\nGiven that I am not that familiar with the educational system in the US and as someone coming from a scientific education background, I am a bit worried (or maybe skeptical) about a BA degree. \n\nIs a BA degree in computer science inferior in any way, shaper, or form to a BS degree in computer science?\n\nI heard that a BS degree is much more demanding and concentrated. It is more attractive to employers and allows you to cover your major on a much deeper level.\n\nI really really loved Swarthmore after a visit, and would love to join it. But I don\u2019t wish to wind up with a degree that\u2019s not equivalent to that offered by other universities.\n\nWould appreciate any thoughts.\nThanks! :)", "author": "Snoo79887", "created": 1632422745, "retrieved": 1632946129, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he0xhqw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu1v61/international_student_looking_for_an_advice/he0xhqw/", "text": "Just do wgu online and bust your ass they have business and computer science I think?
