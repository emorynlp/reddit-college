I constantly see videos of people dancing there traditional cultural dances such as Bollywood and traditional Mexican dances and it makes me happy. I also love the outfits that different cultures wear and would love to learn how to make them so that children have the opportunity to wear them and be proud of there there from/parents are from. I really want to bring the stories of different cultures to light. Seeing different cultural festivals and people in there traditional clothes and dancing makes me so happy and I really want to do something like it. This has been my passion and I've been having a really hard time knowing how to do this in college. Yes I know that there is Latin American studies in college , but I want to know if theres a career or some major that I can do in junction to Latin American studies or other options. Any advice is appreciated.", "author": "OliviaGG", "created": 1632447295, "retrieved": 1632946114, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {}}
