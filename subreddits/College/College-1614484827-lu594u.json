  "text": "I think I'm literally going through a patch where I feel depressed, lonely, and just exhausted.  But school literally just has sucked the life out of me. It's never been so bad before. \n\nBut my high school brother talks to me about his school work, and I feel horrible for it and I hide it. But I don't feel any sympathy. I really try to remember that he's younger than me, has less schooling under his belt. But he's spent the last week freaking out about a 800 word essay that's due at the end of the school year, and I'm just like, really? I write 1000+ word discussion boards weekly and turn in 5-10 page papers that I've bullshitted my way through because I didn't start it soon enough. Never had a problem. Like, this isn't a he problem it's a me problem. I'm obviously being a rude bitch. But I feel like I've completely lost the person I used to be for the education I thought would make my life better. All it's taught me is to find the key points and how to affectively bullshit my way through every assignment. I mean, I guess it's a skill.... \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know. I just feel like college sucks. I feel like I suck. And part of me is just tempted to drop out. But don't because I know I'll hate myself for it later. Anyone else feeling this?",

I loved doing research and crafting life-changing essays, taking time to develop a project, making multiple drafts and revising stuff, etc.  \n\nNow I just find the quickest and most bullshit way to get this assignment done so I never had to look at it again. I hate it. These are classes I really want to take and care about but the nature of the pandemic just has me looking at every assignment like a chore to hurry up and complete.   \n\nBefore this I grew with every class and assignment, seeing it as a chance to enhance my life and become a more proficient individual. Now I just see it as bullshitting practice where I just find the quickest and easiest way to bullshit my work.  \n\nAfter my speech today I legit wanted to cry just because I know I'm capable of so much better. Everyone applauded me and had helpful feedback, but the only \"feedback\" i needed was to stop fucking off. \n\nI read the stuff I write, and while it's better than the other students, I know I could do better than the bullshit I thought of 10 minutes before it was due. \n\nBut I hate this situation and my brain isn't clicking. Yeah I'm getting the work done in 'survival mode' but this isn't what I worked my ass off for years and paid to do. \n\nYoure not a lone.",

I would recommend Cal Newport's podcast \"Deep Questions\" for some advice on this.   \n\n\nNow that I'm almost done with college and thinking about my career, I'm starting to value the credits I have left. Believe it or not, there are a lot of marketable skills you can learn in college. And the most important thing to get from college are skills. I'd say don't drop out and also don't let college coast by. Think about where you want to go after, find out what skills are in. demand, and find out what courses or internships will let you cultivate those skills. Once you're done with college and see that you have plenty of great options from there, you will see that it was worth the time and effort. Being strategic will also help you enjoy learning in the moment.",

As someone who actually really enjoys learning, it's been a wreck for me. But also it's been especially bad because I had covid at the end of winter semester and since then I've been very fatigued and mentally blurry. I never got my energy back and I spend way too much time just staring at my work like it's a foreign language. Plus I GENERALLY have seasonal depression ANYWAY so it's just a shit storm. I'm pretty mad at myself for not brushing up on the curriculum of my classes during winter break. This summer I'm gonna watch crash course and do khan academy and whatever else lmao to get a headstart on the work. Because the semester is half over and I'm just figuring out the basics.",

That is actually a pretty big freaking skill; being able to write quickly and efficiently is important in almost every career. And I would bet that\u2019s not the only thing you\u2019ve gained. It can be really hard to see your own growth though. There is even a term, imposter syndrome, for how a lot of highly educated people feel like they are bullshitting or faking their way through things without actually being qualified for them; in reality they almost always are.\n\nHonestly just ... this year sucked for most people.

I then realized a ton of those people had come right out of university. Being put in an already tough educational system where you're constantly evaluated against other students and by your parents and where, by your perception, a disgruntled professor can needlessly put your future in peril due to an absurdly competitive job market - for damn near 20 years - is enough to really mess with a person. I really feel for people who haven't separated from that because it's really hard to see the light at the end. It's also dismaying to get out and realize no one actually knows what they're doing.",

I am extremely stressed out all the time. I cry multiple times a day and have since I started college. I have fought through it because I want to create a better life for myself (1st gen) but it has been really hard. Try talking to a therapist through your school. I do that and it helps A LOT. Also,  make time to do things that you enjoy and try to stay on top of your assignments. Create a specific workspace that is for work only. Make sure you are finding ways to spend time with supportive friends. It is very hard with COVID, but I have been hanging out with my coworkers (socially distanced) after work and I just talk through stuff with them, we play guitar, generally shoot the shit, etc. It really helps my mental health to have a space that is completely separate from college. Different town, different people, structured environment. I agree that college is not a healthy place to be, especially as a nontraditional student (I was never able to live in a dorm, I drive an hour to get to school every day and still live with my family) Ultimately, do what is best for you, and take your mental health seriously.

Instead of being in a class with a professor and students at your disposal for help and feedback it\u2019s just you and your computer. Especially being at home with all other distractions it can be hard. I feel like because we are all at home we can\u2019t really separate school and home life it\u2019s now jumbled up together and it can get so overwhelming! But just know you are not alone I feel like anyone in college despite their major is feeling the same kind of emotions. Myself included ! If you ever need to vent more or need a study buddy hmu ! We all need to help each other get through another semester!",

Eventually it got to a point where I'm starting to decline mentally since I had to juggle between my passion and the course.\n\nIt got worst when for the first time ever, me and my coursemate was enrolled into a C Programming class.

I'm sorry you aren't finding your degree fulfilling, that sucks. But I can tell you there's one really valuable positive. \n\nYou have many options. After college you will be able to work pretty much wherever you want and for good pay. I thoroughly regret following my passion and not doing CS. I did psych and it's a degree where you can't get a job with just a bachelor's, unlike engineering. It's easy to switch from engineering to another job later if you want, almost impossible to do the opposite. Maybe after college you can combine engineering with music!\n\nAs for your love of learning. Don't worry, it's not gone just sleeping :)",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s one of two issues from the post - your workload is or if it\u2019s too much for you, if it is drop  your class amount. \n-or you\u2019re just procrastinating and doing it to yourself then hating school for it. \nBut either way I think everyone in college does through this at times. It can be extremely exhausting and burn out it a real thing. It does sound like your burned out so do some research on how to combat burnout.",
