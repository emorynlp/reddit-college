However, over the past few semesters I've noticed the evolution of anti-cheat measures and they're just getting ridiculous.\n\nIt started with stuff like not being able to see the correct answers on old tests. Well, okay, that's annoying because like every other human being I like to see what I did wrong, and use my old tests to study for the midterm, but fine I guess.\n\nThen it evolved so I can't see even see what I got WRONG. Which really ticked me off because I had a terrible chemistry teacher last semester who made tons of mistakes all the time and I couldn't even go over the test with him because I wasn't allowed to see it, even after asking him if I could speak with him personally and go over it, he just ignored me. I ended up with a B that I felt like I didn't deserve.\n\nNow, when I'm reviewing my math homework, I can't even see if the answers I'm inputting are correct or incorrect. HOW COULD I CHEAT WITH THAT INFO??? It's old work that I already submitted! It's past the due date, nobody is still working on it! This was my method for reviewing for tests and quizzes in math up until now, by going back and rework my old homework...

To say nothing of the spyware/malware universities require you to download, use and run during, among other things, tests or routine assignments; every aspect of what has been described to me by others feels like something that would have given Bentham nightmares and which Foucault might have foretold in Discipline and Punish.\n\nBut I'll tell you how that regime of idiocy most likely happened.  A tech developer/startup came up with a whole bunch of stupid ideas, put those ideas together in a package and sold it to your university as a way to \"promote academic integrity.\"  They probably had a clever presentation with people who used all the right buzzwords to appeal to the hubris of university administration.\n\nBeing \"university administration,\" they care less about \"the experience of learning\" than the \"appearance\" of legitimacy, as measured by some external metric.  The salesmen likely pitched it in the same way ExamSoft found its way into colleges and graduate schools, potentially even as the \"natural COVID-related extension\" of that prior decision.  Note this is a common trick of sales people (who I hate almost as much as I hate university administration).\n\nYour professors, set in their ways, almost certainly found this series of proposals to be a one or more of insane, futil, unnecessary and stupid.  That is because your professors, unlike university administration, actually have endured the experience --- for better or worse --- of teaching undergraduates.  But just as the university likely negotiated certain agreements relevant to textbooks without your professors' input, particularly for survey/intro classes, they almost certainly negotiated agreement for whatever shit application you're being subject to now.\n\nI have heard horror stories of these anti-cheating applications.  [Nightmares and horror abound](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/college-students-are-learning-hard-lessons-about-anti-cheating-software/), all based on a non-solution to an imagined problem.  Most students do not cheat.  Some try, and they pay for it in the long run.  But a technological approach that assumes guilt until proven innocent is unworkable.  \n\nMy suggestion is that you complain.  Your fellow students almost certainly feel the same as you do.  Rally their support.  Create trouble for university administration.  Discuss the egregiousness of your experience with the software and its interface with relevant third parties.
