  "text": "I generally enjoy online classes, even prefer them. However, over the past few semesters I've noticed the evolution of anti-cheat measures and they're just getting ridiculous.\n\nIt started with stuff like not being able to see the correct answers on old tests. Well, okay, that's annoying because like every other human being I like to see what I did wrong, and use my old tests to study for the midterm, but fine I guess.\n\nThen it evolved so I can't see even see what I got WRONG. Which really ticked me off because I had a terrible chemistry teacher last semester who made tons of mistakes all the time and I couldn't even go over the test with him because I wasn't allowed to see it, even after asking him if I could speak with him personally and go over it, he just ignored me. I ended up with a B that I felt like I didn't deserve.\n\nNow, when I'm reviewing my math homework, I can't even see if the answers I'm inputting are correct or incorrect. HOW COULD I CHEAT WITH THAT INFO??? It's old work that I already submitted! It's past the due date, nobody is still working on it! This was my method for reviewing for tests and quizzes in math up until now, by going back and rework my old homework... HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO STUDY WITH ALL THESE BULLSHIT ANTICHEAT MEASURES???",

Last semester I also had a differential equations course where for the final exam we had to answer 86 questions, TWO times, first time it was no back-tracking and one question per page and it was 45 minutes, second time was the same questions in a different order but we could see all questions at once and answer em, this one was i think about 2 hours. You couldn\u2019t uncheck any of your answers AND YOU WOULD GET A NEGATIVE POINT FOR EVERY WRONG ANSWER. Like wtf some people actually got negative from the whole thing. And the cherry on top was that it got delayed a week because the guy who was supposed to input the questions into the forms lost electricity which was pretty common, YET NO ONE BAT AN EYE IF ONE OF US WOULD LOSE IT. \n\nPS. this was also the case for all of our math department courses. I\u2019m just happy I won\u2019t have any courses with em anymore :)\n\nPS 2. I also remember for our physics 2 course they assigned each TA to write and check our quizzes, midterms and finals,, but they all had such a vast difference in standards that in the end the average of two our groups were 17 and 14 out of 20. Sooo shit is good. \n\nPS 3. sorry if this was rambly. It was just like opening a can of worms",

Yet every time I look down it gets counted as my eyes diverting from the screen and when the teacher reviews the video they just review the parts the browser showed the error in and sometimes forget that I showed a blank notepad in the beginning.

It is extremely difficult for me to sit still while I take a test. The last time I used proctored software it flagged me multiple times because my line of sight kept shifting. Also flagged for using a pen even though the prof. said it was allowed. \n\nAll of these extreme anti-cheat methods are turning me off to online learning... Which sucks because I love online classes. It's easier to manage with everything going in my life and I love learning at my own pace. \n\nFor my own personal sake I've had to stop taking classes with proctored software.

The only reason any one who gets away with cheating is because the prof isn't looking hard enough or doesn't care. Students think they are smarter than the professor, but 9/10 you aren't. Your cheating measure isn't new. I've seen every trick in the book and see ones coming that isn't even happened yet. It just depends on whether someone wants to put that time in, and I do. Making sure my students know there shit is make it break for then getting into and bring successful in medical programs.  Other fields tend to not care as much.",

      "text": "I cannot even imagine being a student in the post-COVID era.  To say nothing of the spyware/malware universities require you to download, use and run during, among other things, tests or routine assignments; every aspect of what has been described to me by others feels like something that would have given Bentham nightmares and which Foucault might have foretold in Discipline and Punish.\n\nBut I'll tell you how that regime of idiocy most likely happened.  A tech developer/startup came up with a whole bunch of stupid ideas, put those ideas together in a package and sold it to your university as a way to \"promote academic integrity.\"  They probably had a clever presentation with people who used all the right buzzwords to appeal to the hubris of university administration.\n\nBeing \"university administration,\" they care less about \"the experience of learning\" than the \"appearance\" of legitimacy, as measured by some external metric.  The salesmen likely pitched it in the same way ExamSoft found its way into colleges and graduate schools, potentially even as the \"natural COVID-related extension\" of that prior decision.  Note this is a common trick of sales people (who I hate almost as much as I hate university administration).\n\nYour professors, set in their ways, almost certainly found this series of proposals to be a one or more of insane, futil, unnecessary and stupid.  That is because your professors, unlike university administration, actually have endured the experience --- for better or worse --- of teaching undergraduates.  But just as the university likely negotiated certain agreements relevant to textbooks without your professors' input, particularly for survey/intro classes, they almost certainly negotiated agreement for whatever shit application you're being subject to now.\n\nI have heard horror stories of these anti-cheating applications.  [Nightmares and horror abound](https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/college-students-are-learning-hard-lessons-about-anti-cheating-software/), all based on a non-solution to an imagined problem.  Most students do not cheat.  Some try, and they pay for it in the long run.  But a technological approach that assumes guilt until proven innocent is unworkable.  \n\nMy suggestion is that you complain.  Your fellow students almost certainly feel the same as you do.  Rally their support.  Create trouble for university administration.  Discuss the egregiousness of your experience with the software and its interface with relevant third parties.  Be creative in your approach.  If all else fails, seek to transfer to a university that is not screwing you out of your tuition money.",

Thankfully one of my professors has adopted the \"upload the entire class on day 1 and have everything due by the end of the semester, no periodic due dates\" method and I'm more in tuned to that class over any other. Mostly because she has so much more time to give constructive feedback to students who submit assignments early throughout the semester. It feels like a special little club of students who actually care about the assignments and want to learn vs the other students who just try to cram everything in during the finals week. It's such an enriching experience and also gives students who don't have time during a specific week to dip out and take some time off with no penalties. I think every online class should be structured that way tbh.",

Honestly not that concerning to me if it's just your teachers, but some random dude that is just working a min wage job? Very uncomfortable. \n\nThen there's a lot more issues. Like with the same proctor system, they had really fucked up expectations. Technically they made it clear nothing was to be on your desk or walls or anything. My desk is a full on desk, I have a desk calendar, a bunch of school books on a shelf, a printer on a printer stand with paper, a corkboard with pictures and stuff pinned to it, science posters on the walls, etc. I would have understood if they made me take it all off my desk the first time. They only made me remove the desk calendar. So the next time I had to take one of their exams, I removed the desk calendar. This person made me remove my books. Okay, I removed my books. Would have been really hard to cheat without being noticed, but whatever. The next time I had to take the test, I just made sure the desk calendar and books were removed. So they made me remove all the paper out of my printer stand. It just went on like this until I realized they were basically instructed to make us remove at least one thing every time lol. So I just left everything on my desk and let them choose the one thing I had to remove. It was so stupid and annoying.",

You don\u2019t make the bad students into good students but you do turn some good students off or make their experience worse/more costly.  Net negative \u201csocial\u201d or student welfare.\n\nLook, you want to cheat on my intro to x class?  I will try to prevent that if I can but not at the expense of the good students.  And guess what, when you hit my capstone you\u2019re gonna be fucked because there is no way to cheat that class, so if you want to graduate you have to learn it anyway.\n\nPareto efficiency is when you can\u2019t make anyone better without making anyone worse off.  I see no reason why that shouldn\u2019t apply equally to student learning outcomes versus social welfare.\n\nThat\u2019s my view anyway.

Making the tests timed and having answers being free responses instead of multiple choice, in my opinion, is the best way to go about this. Maybe even throw in an essay or two as a test grade instead of an actual test. With STEM classes, this is more difficult, but not impossible.",

I find out when the timer starts ticking that there were 120 questions, so I tried to keep a pace of 45 seconds per question to give me at least 30 minutes at the end to see what skipped problems I could devote more time to.  \n  \nAfter 112 multiple choice questions, and working slightly ahead of my pace, I am greeted with 8 essay questions, each expecting a full paragraph answer, and they were worth something like 5 points each whereas the multiple choice were just 1. I managed to get something down for all of them, but had zero time to go over skipped questions and wasn't able to flesh out my essays enough. That felt like a sinister setup, but the professor was actually not tech savvy at all and apologized after a bunch of us complained. We were all allowed another 2 hours to complete our tests.",
