First year was fine. Second year came by, I had some personal issues and some family issues, I thought my mind was fine but somehow I lost track of myself, I started to not go to class, I started to not be able to concentrate, to fail everything. All this made me hate this city. Shit keep coming, non stop, every time I thought \u201cwell, at least it can\u2019t get worst\u201d it did. The only thing motivating me was summer and going to my home town, seeing my family and friends. Got there, Started drinking a lot. Noticed I had developed a lot of social anxiety. I had fun don\u2019t get me wrong, everything was way better but I thought I\u2019d be happy and I just wasn\u2019t. It was merely a distraction. I could of transferred to a college in another city but I had planned on going on a exchange program to another country the second semester of this school year and changing colleges would\u2019ve taken that away. So here I am again, in this shitty ass city, studying something I kind of despise, living with nice strangers with whom I don\u2019t socialize with cause I\u2019m a bit too depressed. Just found out I probably won\u2019t be able to do the exchange thing and will be stuck here the whole year. I hate this city, I don\u2019t like the vibe, I don\u2019t like the life, I don\u2019t like the way it makes me feel. I feel like I\u2019m just existing and going through life without living, I feel like I\u2019m nothing surrounded by nothingness. I thought I could deal with coming back but I can\u2019t, everything I had distracted myself of has come back and my mental health is not at its peak nor has it been for years but I\u2019m too afraid of going to therapy. My mind handles stuff very poorly, It constantly dissociates to deal with life. Plus, I don\u2019t have money and I\u2019m sick so I haven\u2019t been able to go to class and I\u2019m running out of food and I don\u2019t want to go to the store but I can\u2019t order bc I\u2019m fucking poor.", "author": "Puzzleheaded_Army397", "created": 1632754841, "retrieved": 1632800198, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
