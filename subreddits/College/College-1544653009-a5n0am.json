  "text": "Hey I\u2019m not sure where to post this but I\u2019m kind of at a lost for what to do. It\u2019s currently finals week as many of you know and I have been studying my ass off. Today I had a midterm for my psych class that was set to be at 3:30pm, I know this because on the online finals schedule that every professor follows it stated 3:30pm was the time of the final. So me along with a majority of my classmates show up at 3:30 and waited but my professor failed to show. We spoke to the head of the department and they informed us that if the teacher does not show in the next 30 minutes then we were legally(?) exempt from the exam. Every person that showed up signed their name on a piece of loose leaf as proof of their attendance, we then brought the paper to the head of the department to get it signed. We emailed the teacher a picture of the attendance sheet and a small paragraph explaining that we showed and she failed to show up on time so we were directed to leave. Anyways, 4:30 rolls around and we get an email from the professor saying that the exam was actually at 4:30 and she stated this in class last week and since we were not there for the exam we would all have to reschedule it and take it with a proctor on another day. Now this is where I\u2019m at a loss because there was no follow up email or anything other then her ALLEGEDLY (i\u2019m emphasizing this because if she stated it I\u2019m sure no one would of showed up at 3:30)  stating last week in class that it was moved to 4:30. Is this something that is allowed??? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think this is extremely unfair to everyone. Does anyone have any experience with this or know of what I should do?? \n\nUpdate: I couldn\u2019t make it to the school because something came up (I had no final scheduled for today so my mom asked me to go with her to the doctor). However I did email the dean about the situation as well as my professor asking when I could reschedule the test because at this point fuck it I\u2019m just going to take it and I know I\u2019ll get a good grade on it anyways because I\u2019ve studied a hell of a lot. Anyways, back to the stuff you guys care about- no one has responded to my emails. I sent both emails out at around 9am and I\u2019m still waiting to hear back. Seems like I\u2019m not much of a priority \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNew update: my professor emailed me back and my new test date is Monday at 11. I also still haven\u2019t heard back from anyone else so that\u2019s disappointing. ",

Although, there was construction going on in the basement, right under the large classroom. During the exam we could hear drilling in the hammering - so loud it vibated our desks. It wasn't continuous but happened enough to be very distracting. ",

Since finals are often held at different times than the actual class periods it helps make sure you don't accidentally schedule yourself for classes that have their final at the same time. \nAnd our professors beat it into our heads what time to show up for the final if the time was different than what we were used to. Toward the end of the semester they mentioned it at least once every class period AND sent out emails the night before. ",

Instructors may make that kind of adjustment, but then would announce the heck out of it, including sky-writing and 16 different emails.\n\nIf the instructor had sent out a prior email/announcement, she would have been saying \"As I announced in this email (insert forwarded email) the exam is at 4:30\". \n\nEither the instructor meant to reschedule the exam and flaked out on telling that to students, or just got mixed up about the exam time.\n\nAs a student I used to have nightmares about missing the final exam. And now, eek. . .are you telling me I need to worry about it as an instructor?! (Thank goodness we no longer have a specially scheduled finals week, but just have a normal schedule.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the record, the department head bears some blame. They should *not* have told you to leave after only 30 minutes. Even without a flaky prof, stuff can happen (e.g., car accidents) and the dept. head should have gone out of their way to try to contact the instructor (and check for messages) and/or just had you all wait longer, or even said \"I don't know\" and let you all make your own choice. It makes me wonder if either their was some combination of the prof having a history of being irresponsible about things and/or if the dept. head had it in for her and was being passive aggressive. Unless the department chair has the power to waive the exam, they really shouldn't have told you all to just leave. (And maybe they DO, in which case they need to follow up).\n\n&#x200B;",

They can give the final to be take home and to be dropped off, or some professors at my school will say to come 30 minutes later if the final is super early, but they can\u2019t move the final that far forward. The right to change the syllabus is for assignment/test/quiz due dates and the change in the order the class is taught.\n\nI have had some professors get finals times mixed up, but all of them have always confirmed with us at the last meeting when our final was, and have either pulled up or asked us to refer to the syllabus.

For example, with a normal test, a professor chooses when its scheduled and how long we get, etc. However, during finals week, they have to stick to what the school lists as the official finals schedule. Even for online exams. My professor would normally give a week to take an online test and release it whenever he wanted. For finals, they're required to give it only at the time the school says. It might vary from department to department, but for the most part, at least at my school, they're pretty bound by what the school says during finals week. ",

                  "text": "They're typically the \"Department Chair,\" not a Dean.\n\nAlso, if something is called a \"School\" it's probably a college, not a department.\n\nIn the US we tend to use \"university\" and \"college\" interchangeably, but there's a bit of a difference. Think of a college as an atom, and a university as a molecule, so it's basically multiple colleges linked together on a shared physical space (not to be confused with a university system, which is multiple campuses across several cities).\n\nA typical university will have a College of Arts and Sciences, along with things like a College of Nursing, College of Engineering, School of Business, etc. (I'm not sure if there's a meaningful difference between College and School in this context; it may have to do with how much research they do.)\n\nWithin a college, you can then have multiple departments. This is especially true of Arts and Sciences, though you might not find independent departments in a narrower school, such as a school of nursing or a school of law.\n\nBut anyways, information dump over -- the right person to talk to is the head of the department. I wonder if other students are making the same mistake, because I see so many comments along the lines of \"take this to the dean!\" where the appropriate person is the department head.\n\n>EDIT: i see your flair my bad, i hope i wasnt being rude. Just trying to help!\n\nToo late, I've talked to the Dean and you are now on double secret probation which you can only be removed from my bringing me a double secret whiskey.",

The only reason I understand all of this is because we got a new dean last year and he's super involved in the departments. Pretty cool guy.\n\nIts possible they misspoke or it's different wherever they attend, though I highly doubt its the latter.",
