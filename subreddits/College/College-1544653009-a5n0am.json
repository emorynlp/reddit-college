It\u2019s currently finals week as many of you know and I have been studying my ass off. Today I had a midterm for my psych class that was set to be at 3:30pm, I know this because on the online finals schedule that every professor follows it stated 3:30pm was the time of the final. So me along with a majority of my classmates show up at 3:30 and waited but my professor failed to show. We spoke to the head of the department and they informed us that if the teacher does not show in the next 30 minutes then we were legally(?) exempt from the exam. Every person that showed up signed their name on a piece of loose leaf as proof of their attendance, we then brought the paper to the head of the department to get it signed. We emailed the teacher a picture of the attendance sheet and a small paragraph explaining that we showed and she failed to show up on time so we were directed to leave. Anyways, 4:30 rolls around and we get an email from the professor saying that the exam was actually at 4:30 and she stated this in class last week and since we were not there for the exam we would all have to reschedule it and take it with a proctor on another day. Now this is where I\u2019m at a loss because there was no follow up email or anything other then her ALLEGEDLY (i\u2019m emphasizing this because if she stated it I\u2019m sure no one would of showed up at 3:30)  stating last week in class that it was moved to 4:30. Is this something that is allowed??? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think this is extremely unfair to everyone. Does anyone have any experience with this or know of what I should do?? \n\nUpdate: I couldn\u2019t make it to the school because something came up (I had no final scheduled for today so my mom asked me to go with her to the doctor). However I did email the dean about the situation as well as my professor asking when I could reschedule the test because at this point fuck it I\u2019m just going to take it and I know I\u2019ll get a good grade on it anyways because I\u2019ve studied a hell of a lot. Anyways, back to the stuff you guys care about- no one has responded to my emails. I sent both emails out at around 9am and I\u2019m still waiting to hear back. Seems like I\u2019m not much of a priority \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNew update: my professor emailed me back and my new test date is Monday at 11. I also still haven\u2019t heard back from anyone else so that\u2019s disappointing.
