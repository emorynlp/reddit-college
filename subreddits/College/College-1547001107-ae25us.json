I took a break and I worked my ass off this fall semester and the final grades are in. My semester GPA was a 3.11 and my cumulative is now a 2.07 and I\u2019m hella fucking proud. I know I\u2019ve still got a long ways to go but I just wanted to share my experience. If you\u2019ve had bad semesters it can get better. ",

None of the ones I've been at have, so the one point difference between A and B part holds in many places.  It may not be exactly 25% but it can still drop you down a little hard depending on how many hours you have.",

She has been a great supporter and doing school together has helped us both. So having a good support system definitely helped. I took time to do little things for myself to keep me in the right headspace, whether that was having a night to hang out with friends or a few hours on Saturday to just veg out. Time to recuperate and refocus has been very important. Also I realized how much I wanted my education. So I met with my advisor about every other week, dedicated study time each week, checked out what assignments I had due that week, and with the big projects I worked on them a little bit at a time. I\u2019m a big fan of Bojack Horseman and there\u2019s this quote that comes to mind, \"It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day \u2014that\u2019s the hard part. But it does get easier.\u201d So I just kept chipping away each day as best I could and it paid off. ",
