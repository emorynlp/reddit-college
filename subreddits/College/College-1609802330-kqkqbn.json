They proposed to return to in person classes in the fall later this year, but I'm honestly not sure if it'll remain that way. I like online schooling more, particularly because my university is 2 hours away and I don't have to take out loans to live on campus. I actually get financial aid money back for once. Although, I agree I was halfway through the last semester and I was already mentally exhausted. I was taking 5 classes, and every single day and every single hour I was busy, I barely slept like 3 hours. This semester is online schooling, but I'm also working this time, which is also something I couldn't really do when I had in person classes and living on campus.",

There is a exhaustion I feel in my bones. \n\nThis upcoming semester is the last one for me, coupled with one of the hardest labs (again virtual) and a class I have come to loathe (Prob and Stats, or as my friend calls it, \"Problem stats\") it is shaping up to be a very challenging time. \n\nStout hearts people.",

Last semester I found myself often in my dorm just doing yet another virtual thing that is no where near the same as doing stuff in person. My roomate has also moved out which will add to the loliness I feel too - going from home where I have my family and friends to going back to college where I barely know people and will be lonely a lot is making me really anxious and sad inside. I\u2019m absolutely dreading going back because I also have a hard time sleeping at the dorms so am not looking forward to insomnia and it taking forever for me to fall asleep. \nTldr: Yes I am dreading it - home has a lot of pluses and comfort for me and college has none and I\u2019ve had a terrible experience so far",

I haven't had normal classes since March so I've been in quarantine for 10 months. Do I even know what human interaction with a lot of people is anymore?\n\nBesides I pretty much hate every part of getting my stupid ass degree and need a solid vacation.

These notes make calc 1 legible in a way where you can follow along and solve problems.\n https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx\n\n____\n\nSecond resource is a YouTuber prof named professor Leonard. He can probably teach calc better than any calc teacher you will have. So if you end up sitting through a lesson not understanding a thing, just pull up the same topic lectured by prof leonard and be sure to be taking notea AGAIN with him. Do these two things and success is within reach.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF797E961509B4EB5#menu\n\nCalc 2 at my school is the class which makes students fail and drop out of college/their major and switch to business or IT.
