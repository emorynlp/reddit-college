  "text": "So when I started my classes last year they were online. I took a English, history, and chemistry class. \nThe English class was really easy and the professor graded fairly. My history class was not bad but the professor was a harsh grader and strict. The chem teacher was absolutely horrible. His teaching method was bad and everything was all over the place. I stressed myself over every exam but the exams were actually not that hard. \n\nThis year I am still online for some reason. Taking similar course subjects like English, anatomy, and psychology. I don\u2019t know why but each of these classes have a similar experience as my fall quarter classes last year. \n\nThe English professor is very nice and grades leniently. The psychology prof is very strict on writing assignments and is a very harsh a grader. The anatomy professor is beyond horrible. He is behind on all lectures and doesn\u2019t teach well. Come exam time, they are not that hard. \n\n\nI feel like I\u2019m living in a loop. I wonder what next quarter will be like.",
