  "text": "Does anybody happen to know of any colleges that take novices for their women's rowing teams? I have never rowed before but am 5'9\" and physically active, and have recently become excited about the idea of rowing in college. I am currently a sophomore in college but I am going to transfer next year and one of the factors in my decision of where I go is having a school that has a rowing team where novices can walk on. One of the schools I'm looking at is UVM but for other reasons about the school, I'm not sure it's the best fit. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!!!!",
