Sometimes a text gets marked \"required\" when it isn't, due to the bookstore website or politics in the department. It may turn out that you need only like 2 chapters out of a 300-page text - the campus library usually has copies of all the required texts each semester, and you can photocopy or scan and email just the sections you need for your course. Or the prof might hook you up and post the sections on Canvas/Blackboard.\n\nIn the rare case where you have a custom textbook designed specifically for the course you're taking, you might be able to buy it off of someone who took the course last semester. You are allowed to ask the professor about this - they may still have the class roster from the previous term and can email those students asking if anyone still has their copy of the book to sell to another student, and they can put you in touch.\n\nTextbooks are a fucking racket, do whatever you need to do to get the information you need.", "author": "tehzephyrsong", "created": 1609436910, "upvotes": 3}, "ghmh9wm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/knq97e/college_starting_soon_and_the_books_cost_sooo/ghmh9wm/", "text": "The campus library usually has copies of most textbooks.
