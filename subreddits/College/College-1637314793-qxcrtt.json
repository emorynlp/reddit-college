      "text": "Yep. Make some nice food. Go outside. Do something new. Socialize. \n\nDon't get hammered or do anything super exhausting, might be a poor time to take a 10 hour hike for example, but you want at least one day off a week to let your brain relax.\n\nI'd suggest getting coffee with a friend and walking around somewhere. If you do choose to spend it inside being lazy still make sure to make good food, get some sun, and work out. Even if sun is I got 5 min walking to corner store for chocolate chips and work out is I played beat saber for 20 min.",
