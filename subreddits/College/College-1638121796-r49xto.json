  "text": "Hi everyone! As part of my senior thesis, I'm running a small test run for my survey before using MTurk next semester. Posting on reddit is an effort to diversify my set of respondents a bit. Thank you so so much in advance!\n\n[https://illinoislas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_8tVqMsfC5KPEAcK](https://illinoislas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8tVqMsfC5KPEAcK)\n\nEdit: This survey focuses on U.S. politics. Please take it only if you live in America. ",
