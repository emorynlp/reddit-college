(Kinesiology Degree)", "text": "Hello everyone. Just ranting here. Basically, I am a kinesiology major. I was a biology major for ONE semester, before I realized I wouldn't be good in that major. It may have just been my professors, however, I had passed that semester with a 3.5 (barely) and I knew it was going to get worse. In addition to that, I planned on switching to kinesiology as I wanted to be a Physical Therapist or Sports Medicine Physician (Assistant). I also knew that technically (especially if I majored in Bio, which I plan on doing), I could get into medical school with any major, as long as I had the pre-reqs, passed the MCAT, and had a good GPA. That said, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love Kinesiolgy, and I am doing a lot better in this particular major than Bio.  I am more passionate about it. Obviously, it's an \"easier\" major, however, it has less opportunity. I was planning on going to graduate school/medical school either way, however, I have no idea what I am going to do ***in between*** that. I am extremely worried because I do not know where to go or what to do. In addition to that, I have no idea how to get volunteer hours/medical hours for Physical Therapy/Physician/Medical School (don't know if I mentioned it, but I am a sophomore right now, so I have time to get hours). Does anyone have any idea what I should do as someone with no medical experience to get a job that will count as medical experience/hours? Any certifications I can get? Anything that will lead me down a good path before I get my masters/doctorate degree?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am currently planning on meeting with the career services of my school, however, I thought I'd also ask some people online who may have been in the same situation. Any advice is greatly appreciated!", "author": "MysticalElephant", "created": 1632274450, "retrieved": 1632946624, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdsps3o": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psx1y1/very_worried_about_my_current_trajectoryany/hdsps3o/", "text": "So, first, most kinesiology degrees don\u2019t fulfill all the requirements for med school- so if you think you might want to do that, be sure you\u2019re adding on a chem or biochem minor and taking all the additional courses that are required.\n\nSecond, as for a job before PT or med school, what about getting your personal training certificate? Seems like a logical choice for a kinesiology major.\n\nAnd as for volunteer hours, is there a pre-med or pre-PT club on campus? Usually they have tips for finding volunteer opportunities in the city you live in.", "author": "boilerlashes", "created": 1632277255, "upvotes": 2}}}
