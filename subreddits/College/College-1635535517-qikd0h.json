  "text": "Old lady comes in to sub in my Econ 101 class (packed class, 100+ people)\n\nShe starts off by saying: I am not Mr. Krieder, yes yes, I know. Shocker.\n\nWe laugh and gasp sarcastically, all goes well.\n\nShe has a heavy accent, maybe some kind of African accent, not too sure.\n\nShe says: Unfortunately, Mr. Krieder cannot be here. He is dead, he passed away.\n\nNobody says a word but I laugh.\n\nEverybody looks at me.\n\nTeacher: So he flew out to virgina for his funeral\n\nI laugh again\n\nEverybody is silent again.\n\nI think for a second.\n\nI replay what she said in my head.\n\nShe did not say \"He is dead, he passed away\".\n\nShe actually said \"His dad, he passed away.\n\nI need to move to Mexico and change my name.",

They ask us to see if there's an alternative, like getting a career advisor to come in and talk about the job market, or a librarian to talk about research. It's not ideal for us -- if we're cancelling, there's a reason, and we probably don't have time to track down some librarian -- but the administration says it wants students to get what they paid for, which is 15 weeks of instruction. I agree in theory, but not in practice.",
