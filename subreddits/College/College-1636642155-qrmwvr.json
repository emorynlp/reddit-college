  "text": "I attend a small university and I am, honestly, becoming frightened of one student on campus who has assaulted and harassed 4 people as of now, 3 of which are people I'm close with. \n\nEach bullet is what he's done to each separate person. I will refer to the violent student as V.\n\n\\- Student A: Strangled student A until they passed out. Later, shoved them into a wall and screamed at them and accused them of talking about V to other students. V needed to be pulled off of A. \n\n\\- Student B: Chased another student with a knife, screaming \"I'm going to kill you\". V has also made \"I'd shoot up the school\" jokes to student B.\n\n\\- Student C: C is friends with student A. C confronted V one day after the second attack. V now has called C a \"Bitch, Queer, Faggot, Whore\" and other slurs in public places upon seeing them. They are aggressive in these statements. \n\n\\- Student D: This student is being harassed in their dorm hall. They have had food, a bag of open garbage, alcohol bottles, and liquids smeared on their door, the handle, and in the carpet outside of their door. C and V live in the same dorm. C's door is always locked. \n\nThe most that's been done for these students are offered restraining orders. V is still on campus. I am concerned for the safety of my students and my friends. Students have already spoken to Dean of Students and V is still on campus. Can anything be done from this point?",

File police reports.\n\nC is probably not illegal but filing the police report to have a record of it would still be useful for that student. If something worse happens, you have a record of repeated harassment which would help that case.",

If the students are residential students (they live on campus) and are in the same res hall they should ask for a move, especially if they don't feel safe. Make sure that they report any violation of the restraining order (if they did get one) so that it is all documented.",

You could try to bring it up to your RD but there's not really much they can do besides tell the RA \"hey look out for individual ____. My suggestion would be to keep reporting incidents with him and maybe talk to whoever is ahead of your dean of students (at my school thats the Assistant Vice President). Be sure in these conversations that the other students are present because you can only do so much to advocate for them. If the concerns are heard directly from the student it has more weight behind them (in my experience).",

Even in a non-criminal case you would have to expressly waive that right on paper.\n\nThat is true with criminal and civil cases. The police were likely talking about criminal charges and you actually don't get to decide whether to pursue them. An individual cannot pursue criminal charges, only the government can. That's something the DA decides, though your desire can affect their decision. The police would have conveyed your desire in the report.\n\nYou do have the right to file a civil suit aside from whatever the government does with the criminal case. Civil suits are what individuals have the power to file and it would be about compensation, not jail time. The civil suit seeks the $500 you spend on fixing the vandalized door. The criminal charges from the government aim to put the person into rehab, jail, probation, etc.",
