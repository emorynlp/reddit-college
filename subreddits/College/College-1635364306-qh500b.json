  "title:": "Is getting a maths degree a good idea if we want to get into the world of finance?",
  "text": "I'm thinking about getting a bachelor's degree in maths and the getting a masters degree in quantitative finance. Is it a good idea or should I simply study finance directly? Or maybe get a maths and finance degree? Any tips? And if anyone has any information about how the pay is I'd love to know.",

      "text": "yes. you need strong math background for graduate-level economics/finance. plenty of econ students take their major requirements, only to realize their senior year that they need real analysis and all of that for grad school. but if you take math major, do not forget to also take the requisite economics courses!",

          "text": "Yes I agree with what you're saying completely, I don't want to study finance just realize that I need real maths in finance but I also don't want to study maths and then be completely clueless when it comes to finance, I'm thinking a maths and finance degree is what's best (I think we can see why from the name) but the issue is that I don't know if I'll be able to handle the workload. If you have any tips on productivity or just how to deal with large amounts of homework I'd appreciate it.",

              "text": "i have no tips other than self-discipline, which I sorely lack.\n\ni dont know if there is such thing as \"minors\" wherever you are, but if you are in USA, you could major in econ/finance (they are mostly the same thing at the bachelor level) and minor in math. But as you say, there is still a lot of work.",

      "text": "Mathematics degrees (especially in terms of upper division coursework) tend to emphasize proofs and a lot of theory that isn't very useful for applied math (such as finance).\n\nFor applied math, you generally want to emphasize Calculus and probability (with some discrete math thrown in). You don't much care *why* it's true so much as it's a useful tool for your purpose.",
