  "text": "I am a Junior, and like many others, had the Spring semester and entirety of Sophomore year moved online. However, I\u2019ve been so unhappy here since Freshman year because of many factors about the school, but I avoided transferring because of my so-called \u201cfriends.\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019ve looked forward to during the pandemic: coming back because of people who I thought were my close friends. I try making friends with other people, but my school is so small and cliquey. I modified my college experience for other people. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I lost all motivation for schoolwork, exercising, and life. I realize I am close to graduating, but every moment here is agonizing. I\u2019ve sped through so many things in life because I was so unhappy. I didn\u2019t want college to become one of these things. I don\u2019t want to be here for another year.",

      "text": "I went to the same college as my boyfriend, stayed there for 2 years until we broke up, transferred after that Bevause I was unhappy, but then I realized I transferred too late and ended up staying in college for 6 years. It took me forever to make friends because I transferred late and I left the friends from my first college behind so I had literally 5 friends in college. Transfer if you want but If you\u2019re close to graduating and you only want to transfer Bevause you have no friends, be careful because you might end up graduating later because of that. Tough it out even though it\u2019s hard.",
