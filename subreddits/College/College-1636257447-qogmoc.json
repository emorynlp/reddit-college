  "text": "Hey all, I recently graduated with a degree in Strategic Communication, I chose this major because I heard it was easy. I now know that was the most stupid decision I ever made. I really want to go back to college and study Computer Science to challenge myself, it is also something I really am interested in. Is it a smart idea to go back to University after graduating?\n\nThanks",

      "text": "YES! It is a smart decision if that is what you really want to do. I got my first degree in English because it was \"easy,\" just to find out there wasn't much I could do with it. I'm back in school now for my Accounting degree (for job opportunities, and because I didn't realize how much I actually liked accounting until after....) and am so excited. \n\nThe good thing about having kind of different degrees is you'll stand out after getting your CS degree. You'll know that PLUS know how to communicate - it will give you an extra edge.",
