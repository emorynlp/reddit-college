I also joined like 4 clubs freshman year but by luck I joined ones that never had socials/meetups outside of strict meetings and I didnt make friends from it.

I did make a couple friends freshman year but I barely had anything in common (I really wanted to party but they didn't at all).\n\nMy second year there I joined a sport and another club that assigned mentors and this helped me network really fast. Still, I hadn't been satisfied with my college experience since I didnt have a whole lot in common with my new friends, so I transferred to a college where I already had lots of friends.\n\nThe first year absolutely destroyed my self esteem because it made me think I was ugly and unlikeable.
