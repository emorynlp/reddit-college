  "title:": "Should I do football in college despite never playing it?",
  "text": "I have never done American football in my life because I simply was not allowed or had the interest to play. Lately, I\u2019ve gained the interest to play given that the college I\u2019m applying to has a football team. I am 5\u20198\u201d and 140 ibs. I run really fast. Would I have a chance at being able to make the team or should I just not even think about it? Be honest please.\n\nEDIT: It is NOT a college that is normally known for football",
