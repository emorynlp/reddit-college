  "text": "At work was talking about college and grad school applications with my coworker who is applying to grad schools and jobs this cycle. Their major was in computer science if that matters.\n\nSo I asked them what they had on their application/CV. They said they had two club positions, a hobby sport (they do hiking), six languages (ok they're minoring in two but still), two prestigious summer research positions, were published twice, had stacked like 400 volunteering hours and had worked in retail for a year. Is this even real or was I just being bamboozled?",

Forgot to mention the 50 min drive to school. Thankfully I can do homework at both my jobs, if it wasn\u2019t for that I don\u2019t think I could do it. I honestly have no idea how I\u2019m doing it besides looking at my future and how badly i want it. What a few years of little sleep to actually having a career I\u2019ll enjoy ya know",
