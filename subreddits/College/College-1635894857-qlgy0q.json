  "text": "I guess the hard thing for me is having to get up and go somewhere else to study. I really like to study in the library. I\u2019ll tell myself I\u2019ll go at 11, but I\u2019ll procrastinate and only leave my dorm at 1. Then I\u2019ll get to the library and suddenly my hair is the most fascinating thing ever. Then I put on my classical music and start looking at classes I want to take next semester, etc etc\n\nI really don\u2019t get how people can study for hours at a time, I don\u2019t think I can do it. Does anyone have any tips for me?\n\nAlso, how would someone go about studying for a history class?",

      "text": "Do you have ADHD? I\u2019m not diagnosing you, because I\u2019m not remotely qualified, but a lot of what you described lines up with a lot of what people with ADHD experience. I would suggest getting evaluated if you can, and if you\u2019re diagnosed, finding treatment. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t have ADHD, you might find it helpful to adopt the techniques that people with ADHD use. Stick to a routine, give yourself more time, set timers, break up your tasks into smaller tasks and check them off as you get them done, develop a caffeine addiction, etc. If your hair gets in the way, try to get it out of your way so it\u2019s easier to ignore. If you find yourself looking at classes, set aside time to look, then when the time\u2019s up for that, move in to something else. It\u2019s not easy but it gets better with practice. Good luck!",
