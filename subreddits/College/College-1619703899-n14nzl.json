I try my best and study really hard, since I want to join the Academia at some point. I got straight A's last semester and was trying to get a 3.7-3.8 GPA, but after a bunch of team projects I'm really struggling. One subject was always an A+ for me, but we got a D because another group member didn't do much. I tried not to care, because we were friends so I just thought 'bad luck, s\\*\\*t happens'.\n\nToday, we had another group presentation. We split the work between 5 people. I read 5 papers and explained my part (we had to record the audio, so the teacher only had to press 'play'). Expected same from the rest (you know, I don't want to bother other people telling them what to do, it wouldn't be nice). The teacher asked a question to another member and nobody answered (camera off, micro off). This person was online, talking with us on another chat and suddenly shut up. Like, pretending we wouldn't notice. So the teacher said like 'OK, you're 5 people, who can answer my question?' And the other 3 said (privately) they didn't know what to say, since they didn't even look at that part of the project. I had, so I offered myself and improvised something, while browsing Wikipedia as quick as I could.\n\nOverall, I feel tired and a bit sad. I worked a lot, and today it was a complete disaster (other projects were much better and people answered perfectly). Have you ever been in a similar situation? What can I do next time I have to cope with this? Would appreciate any advice or tricks...\n\n(I don't want you to believe I'm the *i-know-everything* person, I like group projects and being able to work with others is such a basic skill, but it sometimes is a bit difficult...)", "author": "EinerIstGunther", "created": 1619703899, "retrieved": 1632802705, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 669, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gwgkfp9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n14nzl/group_working_is_ruining_my_grades/gwgkfp9/", "text": "Working with other people is not only part of college but of life in general.

I currently study hospitality management and as you might guess almost all of our assignments are group project and reports. They are 10,000+ words long sometimes which makes them very difficult to do by yourself if you have a horrible group. However, I've got a few tips if you need to continue working with them or have bad groups in the future!\n\n1. Sign a contract with them that enables you to kick them out if they are not pulling their weight (this is a common practice in my uni). Sometimes threatening (especially with really lazy free riders)  group members with being kicked out motivates them.\n\n2. Meet together as a team before working on the assignment to discuss what each of you are aiming for (grade wise) and how you can adapt to each others aims, what your strengths and weaknesses are, ground rules and a schedule of deadlines that you all agree on(this is especially helpful for rigorous assignments)\n\n3. Try and sit down with them and discuss problems that you are seeing, please document meetings in some sort of way so you have evidence of what happened in case they are rude or uncooperative \n\n4. Talk to your professor in charge, the likelihood that they have encountered a group problem before is high and if not they may still be able to help you (maybe even assign you a new group)\n\n5. If all else fails you might have to do it by yourself/with the absence of one or more group members and sometimes you just need to do the work because it is your grade.
