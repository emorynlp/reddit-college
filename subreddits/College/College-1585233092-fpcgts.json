My home environment is not at all a good place for me to learn and I easily get distracted.  I find myself nearly falling asleep during Zoom calls and not doing work.  Unfortunately my previous methods of going to the library doesn't work when the libraries are closed.\n\nI really need help.  I was doing the best I've ever done in college with my hardest load just because I found a system that worked for me.  Now I have to figure out working 25-30 hours a week with the same amount of time for homework/classwork except now I'm less efficient and just sit on my butt all day playing videogames to relieve the stress from me not doing work (I know it makes no sense).  Any tips on how to be successful getting work done?  I haven't even looked at my math classes since they're pre-recorded and I don't know if I'll pay attention.  Any guidance would be useful, thanks.", "author": "Blutrumpeter", "created": 1585233092, "retrieved": 1632802073, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1191, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fllxlpw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fpcgts/new_college_new_me/fllxlpw/", "text": "For me I made a table of subjects-assignments.

If I am not sure to want/be able to do everything on my list that day (let's be realistic), I **prioritize the tasks and pick two that I find to be the most important** and tell myself that **they MUST be done today so I can have a downtime afterwards**. It helps me keeping a certain discipline, makes me feel rewarded, and keeps my stress low knowing that I can fully enjoy my hobbies. It also feels good to realize you may have done more than these two tasks on your list.\n\nNext: I would not wait until the very last day of the deadline set to start doing homework/studying for exams, even if it is tempting. You said that you haven't look at your math classes since they are pre-recorded. Then, **be proactive and watch them the day they are posted at a time when you feel good and fully awake. Put every distraction as far away from you as possible and keep only what you really need. Cut yourself from any sound that could be distracting other than the voice of your professor (with earphones for example). And when you're studying, wear earplugs.**\n\n3) **Set a goal everyday**, **divide your study time** and feel free to take a 10-minute break between your study sessions. For example, if you study one chapter for two hours, take a 10 minute break every 40 minutes. **Test your knowledge after reading it with some quizzes online or ask someone to test your knowledge with flash cards for example.**\n\n4) If you feel like you are struggling with an assignment, **contact one of your classmates right away (waiting = forgetting or not feeling like it later) and get them to explain to you some concepts or figure it out together.**\n\n I hope these tips will help you :)", "author": "iamapotato_yep", "created": 1585268755, "upvotes": 1}, "flltn2k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fpcgts/new_college_new_me/flltn2k/", "text": "Try studying in places that are similar to where you had class (ie. at a desk or a table NOT your bed or the couch)\n\nSchedule out your day.

I have been trying to wake up around 8 or 9 instead of like 10 or 11. Then set a schedule for working: I designate hours during the day that are 'work' hours (for me, 10-7) and then work for at least those hours.
