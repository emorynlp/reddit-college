  "text": "Since starting classes at Zoom University I've really felt like a completely different person.\n\nRight when I got the hang of everything and got into a nice schedule as far as learning and doing my homework I'm forced to learn from home.  My home environment is not at all a good place for me to learn and I easily get distracted.  I find myself nearly falling asleep during Zoom calls and not doing work.  Unfortunately my previous methods of going to the library doesn't work when the libraries are closed.\n\nI really need help.  I was doing the best I've ever done in college with my hardest load just because I found a system that worked for me.  Now I have to figure out working 25-30 hours a week with the same amount of time for homework/classwork except now I'm less efficient and just sit on my butt all day playing videogames to relieve the stress from me not doing work (I know it makes no sense).  Any tips on how to be successful getting work done?  I haven't even looked at my math classes since they're pre-recorded and I don't know if I'll pay attention.  Any guidance would be useful, thanks.",

      "text": "What I like to do is to **make a list of things that I need to do**. If I am not sure to want/be able to do everything on my list that day (let's be realistic), I **prioritize the tasks and pick two that I find to be the most important** and tell myself that **they MUST be done today so I can have a downtime afterwards**. It helps me keeping a certain discipline, makes me feel rewarded, and keeps my stress low knowing that I can fully enjoy my hobbies. It also feels good to realize you may have done more than these two tasks on your list.\n\nNext: I would not wait until the very last day of the deadline set to start doing homework/studying for exams, even if it is tempting. You said that you haven't look at your math classes since they are pre-recorded. Then, **be proactive and watch them the day they are posted at a time when you feel good and fully awake. Put every distraction as far away from you as possible and keep only what you really need. Cut yourself from any sound that could be distracting other than the voice of your professor (with earphones for example). And when you're studying, wear earplugs.**\n\n3) **Set a goal everyday**, **divide your study time** and feel free to take a 10-minute break between your study sessions. For example, if you study one chapter for two hours, take a 10 minute break every 40 minutes. **Test your knowledge after reading it with some quizzes online or ask someone to test your knowledge with flash cards for example.**\n\n4) If you feel like you are struggling with an assignment, **contact one of your classmates right away (waiting = forgetting or not feeling like it later) and get them to explain to you some concepts or figure it out together.**\n\n I hope these tips will help you :)",

I earned it. \n\nJust like the other grad student said. keep up your self care routine as much as possible. This is a super stressful time and it is most important to keep your happiness first before you worry about spending a little extra time on netflix. Hope this helps friends.",

Perhaps the biggest lesson I learned in College was that the world is a scary, unfair place that doesn't really have much concern for you as an individual.

I have yet to find something that really works, but what has worked for me is creating a to do list of all my assignments and then crossing off an assignment each time I finish one. I have tricked my brain into releasing lots of dopamine every time I cross something off. It feels good to get things done, but along with this, I have a daily schedule. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that strict but I tell myself \u201cI\u2019m going to wake up at 9am and sometime before noon, I am going to read two chapters.\u201d Something like that. It gives me flexibility to waste time but also forces me to squeeze in productivity. I know this probably wouldn\u2019t work for someone who requires a more rigid schedule, but it has worked for me. Another thing I do that helps with writing essays is I force myself to write for 20 minutes. I don\u2019t have to go for more than that, but I know that 20 minutes is feasible. And that at least gets me a good start on papers. \n\nGood luck, you can get through this! We can get through this!",

But here are some tips I'm trying to live by in case they help you:\n\nHave a normal routine: Wake up at the same time, get dressed, have breakfast, shower, etc - whatever you need to do to feel ready for the day. I have been trying to wake up around 8 or 9 instead of like 10 or 11. Then set a schedule for working: I designate hours during the day that are 'work' hours (for me, 10-7) and then work for at least those hours.  I am trying to work using the Podomoro method - which is 25 minutes working with a 5 minute break between each working session (and then a 15 minute break after 2 hours). That way I can switch between classes when I get bored.\n\nI was originally trying to do work for certain classes (especially ones with pre-recorded lectures) during the periods where my classes meet, but it doesn't always make sense because my classes were quite spread out so now I just make sure I'm doing it at a specific time every day.\n\nI have also been trying to FaceTime friends to do work, especially in classes where we have problem sets or other collaborative assignments, but even the company is useful for me in holding myself accountable.\n\nThis is only sort of working for me tbh - but I hope some of this stuff is helpful for you.",
