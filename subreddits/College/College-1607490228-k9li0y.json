  "text": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/k089ay/heres_what_might_happen_to_you_if_you_get_caught/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share \n\nFor those who remember my original post, I came forward about cheating on an exam with chegg and came out of it with a 0 on the exam and an academic integrity course. A lot of people in my comments said that I was idiot, shouldn't have come forward, it was bait, should've used a fake name and VPN, etc. I am going to insert an email my professor sent to us today. All I can say is, im glad I came forward. \n\nEmail reads: \n\n\"Class:\nIf you didn't use Chegg on Midterm Exam #3, you can disregard this note entirely.\nFor those of you wondering why I am spending so much time and energy on this, I have 81 students that have come forward (some of whom were honest with me and some that were not), 10 more that I have iron-clad evidence against that have not come forward, and 11 more that I am still investigating.\u00a0 That is half of the class.\nIf you were not honest with me, or if you are in the last two categories, you will not get another warning.\nFor those of you that\u00a0were\u00a0honest with me, I have a request: if the email address you used on Chegg was not a (college) email address, please send me what it was by (private) or email. That will help me immensely in narrowing down what is going on with those people I am still investigating.\nTo be clear:\nI have the following information of people who posted question and who viewed questions:\n\nThe date and time of the post/view.\n\nThe name registered with Chegg for the account that performed the post/view.\n\nThe email address registered with Chegg for the account that performed the post/view.\n\nThe IP address of the computer used for the post/view. (Which incidentally, is relatively easy to turn into an approximate street address.)\n\nFor many of you that used Chegg, this confirms what you told me in our meetings. Therefore there will be nothing further that happens beyond what we discussed, and I will be implementing the sanctions we discussed hopefully tomorrow.\nFor several of you that used Chegg, the data indicates that you were not honest with me. I will be contacting you in the near future to discuss this.\nSeveral of you used your (college) email addresses when registering for Chegg, and you haven't come forward. Think on that...\nSeveral of you used non-(college) email addresses when registering for Chegg, but nonetheless it was easy to figure out who you are. Think on that too...\nSome of you used someone else's Chegg account using their (college) email (or another easily-identifiable email) when they registered. Do you really want that person dragged into this? Because aiding and abetting also counts as a violation of academic integrity. Think on that\u00a0very\u00a0hard.\nAnd some of you registered with Chegg using a throw-away email address and a fake name. Which to my mind is a clear indication of pre-meditated intent to cheat. And some of\u00a0those\u00a0I have been able to track by other means, such as looking at when the posts and views happened (to the minute), correlating it to when the exams were submitted (to the minute), and then checking to see if the answers on the exam match the answers given by Chegg (many of which were incorrect, so it is relatively easy to tell when the Chegg answers were used). Those of you that I have tracked by this method will be hearing from me soon, and let me warn you that coming forward will be much better for you.\nThere are still a couple of people, however that I have not been able to narrow down to a single possibility (usually there are at most two or three possible students). I am making a request of those of you that I have already spoken with: If the Chegg account you used involved an email address that was not your (college) email address, please send me a message or an email with the email address that was used on that account. This will let me cross off some of the possibilities.\nSituations like these can either be a learning opportunity or a career-ending roadblock. I am all about learning opportunities when students demonstrate that they are willing to learn. But the chances for learning\u00a0 are about to run out. I am planning to start back in to this tomorrow morning, so those of you that have not yet come forward have a brief window of opportunity to do so. There will not be any more.\"\n\nSome teachers take this stuff immensely seriously. After it was all said and done, im glad I was safe rather then sorry and learned from my mistake.",

      "text": "Cheating is wrong. But the professor has a big fault in this massive issue as well. If many students cheated on the test, then there are a number of reasons. But there is 3 likely scenarios. First, it\u2019s the students who barely studied and relied on chegg to cheat. Second, it\u2019s the students who did study but used chegg because they were not confident or just wanted to check their answers. Third, the students cheated because the professor is so inadequate at teaching the material that some students turned to cheating in order to pass. If I was a professor and found out many of my students used chegg to cheat, I would still reflect if I am teaching the students correctly in order for them to succeed or at least pass in the class. Also, I think your professor is a total ass hole for going through all this excessive effort to catch the potential cheaters. I assume this professor has a god complex or is very narcissistic.",

One guy even came forward and said that he accidentally created a Chegg post (however that happens). I can tell you that the situation that your friend is encountering is much worse than the situation my class was encountering, and people still cheat. A lot of people want the easy way out. That being said, OP said their prof was a crappy prof, so that helps explain why people cheated. \n\nThere needs to be a balance here. Professors who suck need to address that. But you also just shouldn\u2019t use chegg besides for homework and what not. There really isn\u2019t an excuse for using it on an exam. If professors are focusing on catching cheating and not improving themselves, that doesn\u2019t make catching cheaters wrong. It makes not putting enough effort into improving themselves wrong.",

With online school they dumped coursework after coursework on us with no help, interaction or resources. They expected us to teach ourselves with 20 assignments a week (literally for me) and no breaks. That\u2019s why so many students are looking for easier routes to help us just pass.

I like to see it as a perk for all the shitty aspects of being online. You can always look stuff up on the job anyway.\n\nAmerica seems to have weaker privacy laws then, I guess. I agree that it's a bit silly (though I think it's horrible that you have to do that, it would personally terrify me). Is it normal for US colleges to have such strict requirements when taking tests online?\n\nRelative to the amount of things being constructed, the chance of structures collapsing is very slim. Of course it happens, but very infrequently.\n\nWe do have to have peer evaluations for group projects, but not exams wtf.\n\nMy original point still stands: it's much easier to BS an Engineering degree online than a Businessy degree online.",

You can't ascribe 4 identical pages of working to mere chance, and you definitely can't do it when they all make the same weird mistakes and all use the same strange notation that hasn't been taught. For 2 students to have identical work is enough to \"prove\" cheating. Google any single sentence, find the online source it comes from, and you have them too. \n\nThe only way to get away with it is to be lucky enough that no single marker/TA marks 2 identical assignments. If I mark one and then another assignment 4 hours later is identical for one question, I notice that. I get deja vu, I go back to check, and you're caught.

But when you have almost a whole class cheating then it\u2019s time to reevaluate your teaching methods and assignments. I had a teacher in one of my math classes that tried so hard to find so many different ways to help us understand the problems and get the correct solutions. He worked with us 1-1 during class time if we didn\u2019t get something. That was pre-pandemic but most of the class passed because of him. Sadly I found more teachers who just care about their careers and not actually teaching",

A good instructor doesn\u2019t leave students with that choice, because it\u2019s usually possible to do at least decently without cheating in my experience. But when GPA is *so* important for so many reasons, people are gonna do whatever they feel is necessary to maintain that.

So for me I didn't really see the benefit of risking extreme sanctions when I could just fess up and get minor punishment like I did. \n\nIf I did not say anything and was caught, I could risk expulsion from the class and suspension from the school. I keep telling people my professor is serious about this and people seem to not believe me. I did not want to risk that as I already made the dumb decision to cheat in the first place. I guess it really depends how much risk you want to take. In this case I played it safe.",

Seriously, every textbook ever is on Chegg (I use it to double check my answers).  \n3) Don't bitch and moan if people find questions that you also found via google.  \n4) If that many people are trying to cheat on your exam, then you better reflect on how you're approaching teaching.

But there's a lot of other ways to catch students.\n\n Some of the exams uploaded on Chegg are \"honeytraps\" with identifying information in the solutions. I've caught quite a few students that way, too. \n\nThe LMS also provides me with logs of how much time students have spent on the course and in each module/assignment/page, which lets me make a list of students that are likely to cheat. Anyone with very low engagement but surprisingly adequate scores is subject to higher levels of scrutiny. I sometimes ask students to do oral exams if their scores are anomalous. \n\nAll in all, it is possible to cheat undetected, but I can make it very, very difficult.",

You clearly won't benefit from remediation rather than actual punishment , and now there are multiple violations on your record , not one.",
