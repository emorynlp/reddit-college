A lot of people in my comments said that I was idiot, shouldn't have come forward, it was bait, should've used a fake name and VPN, etc. I am going to insert an email my professor sent to us today. All I can say is, im glad I came forward. \n\nEmail reads: \n\n\"Class:\nIf you didn't use Chegg on Midterm Exam #3, you can disregard this note entirely.\nFor those of you wondering why I am spending so much time and energy on this, I have 81 students that have come forward (some of whom were honest with me and some that were not), 10 more that I have iron-clad evidence against that have not come forward, and 11 more that I am still investigating.\u00a0 That is half of the class.\nIf you were not honest with me, or if you are in the last two categories, you will not get another warning.\nFor those of you that\u00a0were\u00a0honest with me, I have a request: if the email address you used on Chegg was not a (college) email address, please send me what it was by (private) or email. That will help me immensely in narrowing down what is going on with those people I am still investigating.\nTo be clear:\nI have the following information of people who posted question and who viewed questions:\n\nThe date and time of the post/view.\n\nThe name registered with Chegg for the account that performed the post/view.\n\nThe email address registered with Chegg for the account that performed the post/view.\n\nThe IP address of the computer used for the post/view. (Which incidentally, is relatively easy to turn into an approximate street address.)\n\nFor many of you that used Chegg, this confirms what you told me in our meetings. Therefore there will be nothing further that happens beyond what we discussed, and I will be implementing the sanctions we discussed hopefully tomorrow.\nFor several of you that used Chegg, the data indicates that you were not honest with me. I will be contacting you in the near future to discuss this.\nSeveral of you used your (college) email addresses when registering for Chegg, and you haven't come forward. Think on that...\nSeveral of you used non-(college) email addresses when registering for Chegg, but nonetheless it was easy to figure out who you are. Think on that too...\nSome of you used someone else's Chegg account using their (college) email (or another easily-identifiable email) when they registered. Do you really want that person dragged into this? Because aiding and abetting also counts as a violation of academic integrity. Think on that\u00a0very\u00a0hard.\nAnd some of you registered with Chegg using a throw-away email address and a fake name. Which to my mind is a clear indication of pre-meditated intent to cheat. And some of\u00a0those\u00a0I have been able to track by other means, such as looking at when the posts and views happened (to the minute), correlating it to when the exams were submitted (to the minute), and then checking to see if the answers on the exam match the answers given by Chegg (many of which were incorrect, so it is relatively easy to tell when the Chegg answers were used). Those of you that I have tracked by this method will be hearing from me soon, and let me warn you that coming forward will be much better for you.\nThere are still a couple of people, however that I have not been able to narrow down to a single possibility (usually there are at most two or three possible students). I am making a request of those of you that I have already spoken with: If the Chegg account you used involved an email address that was not your (college) email address, please send me a message or an email with the email address that was used on that account. This will let me cross off some of the possibilities.\nSituations like these can either be a learning opportunity or a career-ending roadblock. I am all about learning opportunities when students demonstrate that they are willing to learn. But the chances for learning\u00a0 are about to run out. I am planning to start back in to this tomorrow morning, so those of you that have not yet come forward have a brief window of opportunity to do so. There will not be any more.\"\n\nSome teachers take this stuff immensely seriously.

Second, it\u2019s the students who did study but used chegg because they were not confident or just wanted to check their answers. Third, the students cheated because the professor is so inadequate at teaching the material that some students turned to cheating in order to pass.
