  "text": "I currently have an accomodation to record lectures as I struggle with paying attention and taking notes at the same time (being treated for ADHD). This also allows me extra time on tests and exams, and allowing me to have water during exams (medication).\n\nI've been browsing the subreddit and I've seen it recommended a few times to get a note taker if you can.\n\nFirst of all, why does that make me feel bad? second of all, how exactly does it work? Do I meet them before class? Do they sit by themselves? What am I supposed to do in that situation? I have pretty major anxiety with people, so not knowing what to expect makes that worse.\n\nAny info or experiences you have would be great!",
