  "text": "Hello everyone. I'm currently taking a calculus based introductory physics class this semester, and got my second quiz score back today. I bombed it very very badly, and also bombed the first quiz I took a couple of weeks ago, so I had a mini mental break down today because of this (and because I have a lot of things going on in my other classes that is causing me stress too). However, I've brought the upon myself because I am super duper behind in the class, which resulted in me doing very badly on the two quizzes. This means that I will have to ace the next two quizzes and the final exam in order to pass the class (I've reached out to my professor and this is also what they said). I feel very stressed out right now because I'm overwhelmed by everything that needs to get done and don't know where to start. So I've come to reddit today to ask for some advice, and to ask everyone what resources they utilized when they took physics (especially ones for dummies, which breaks down the concepts so they're understandable and digestible). Is this doable (relearning nine weeks worth of physics material)? Does anyone have any advice or tips (in terms of physics, how to catch up when you've fallen behind, and for taking timed tests)? \n\nI also can't drop out of the class because I have to maintain a full-time status in order to receive financial aid and scholarships for this semester (am a low-income, first-generation student).\n\nIf it is of any importance, here are some of the topics my class has covered so far:\n\n* One dimensional motion (displacement, average and instantaneous velocity, speed, acceleration)\n* Equations for constant acceleration\n* Reading Position vs Time, Velocity vs Time, and Acceleration vs Time diagrams\n* two dimensional motion (vectors, including vector addition, subtraction, scaler product, vector magnitude, and direction)\n* two dimensional displacement (average and instantaneous velocity, speed, acceleration)\n* relative motion in one dimension and two dimension\n* projectile motion\n* Newton's laws and forces\n* friction\n* circular motion\n* kinetic energy\n* work\n* springs\n* power\n* potential, kinetic, and mechanical energy\n* conservation of energy\n* center of mass\n\nI'm sorry if this post is a jumbled mess as I'm not in the right mental state right now. Thank you so much, I appreciate any and all responses.",
