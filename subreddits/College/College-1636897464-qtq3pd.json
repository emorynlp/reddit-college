  "text": "I am most likely going to take the rest of the year off and come back in a years time due to what my doctor believes is depression.\n\nCurrently, my priority is to get myself into a better mental condition. I visited my GP and he prescribed me antidepressants (Cymbalta) and recommended a psychotherapist, which I will follow. I have reached out to my college counselling service will have a meeting with them in less than a months time. I will work on keeping up with basic self-care, i.e. good diet, sleep, exercise, etc.\n\nFrom there, if I am better, I might work on some online courses, maybe go to some clubs or something, volunteer, work on my hobbies and whatever I can think of that will get my mind going or get me outside.\n\n**For anyone who has been in a similar position or took a gap year for their mental health, what did you do for that year?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*edit: Thanks very much everyone for your advice!",

      "text": "I\u2019ve left school to take mental health breaks a couple of times\u2014 in fact, I\u2019m probably going to take the first half of spring semester off to deal with a long depressive episode, and return for second-quarter or summer term. \n\nAt this point, I generally know what snaps me out of it (though it\u2019s going to be different for everyone). It may sound counterintuitive / masochistic, but \u2014 Getting a customer-facing service industry job changed my life for the better and helped a great deal with my social anxiety / over-thinking / self-criticism. It was a great way to get back into the swing of \u201cnormal\u201d human interaction, in a low-risk and generally low-stress environment.\n\nFind a job that you feel some modicum of interest toward, that you think may help to \u201crecharge\u201d which ever energies have been depleted by your depression. Awkward with people / socially dissociated? Work a counter at a place where you have a chance to chat, smile, and make eye contact. Fed up with so much social interaction? Apply to a garden center. These jobs won\u2019t be excellent money-makers, but they can provide positive stimulus and something to do.\n\nVolunteering or taking a training course are also excellent self esteem builders, and can help return a sense of purpose. I spent two months in a women-only construction course, which provided a huge benefit to my sense of self-reliance and self-confidence. Going from there to briefly volunteering with Habitat for Humanity gave me the gratification, exercise, and (very important for me, as I had fallen so far from healthy executive function) a set schedule and tasks that provided tangible, satisfying results.\n\nVolunteering at an animal shelter is a consideration, but if you\u2019re already feeling not-too-great, it may not be the best move to be in an environment that can be super depressing, on its own. There are sure to be plenty of other volunteer opportunities in your area\u2014 If you\u2019re not strapped for cash, volunteering is a great way to spend time on something that will really help others while vicariously help yourself.\n\nGood luck, and please don\u2019t beat yourself up. It\u2019s very normal to take breaks from school. Focus on your own well being and your own journey. Even if you\u2019re reticent to admit you need the time off at first, you may look back at your time away from college as one of the best mental health moves of your adult life. I certainly do.",

      "text": "I deferred 30 years ago, and went back to finish and get then get my Masters.  Many, many years later, I deferred my Doctorate and never returned.  I regret none of it. Do not let a GP medicate you.  You need a specialist just like you would for a heart problem or cancer.  A psychiatrist is a lifesaver.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar boat at the moment. I work 20-30h a week at Starbucks but I can\u2019t handle school so I am taking the semester off. The rest of my time goes towards therapy + basic life tasks (laundry, keeping clean, hygiene, etc.). When you\u2019re depressed it\u2019s really okay if basic life tasks are all you can handle. I\u2019ve also been getting back into art/writing and that has been really helpful both for healing and for keeping me busy.\n\nTLDR; get a job if you want, maybe focus on some old hobbies, but it\u2019s ok if most energy goes towards managing mental health.\n\nAlso\u2014 highly recommend you see a psychiatrist as soon as you can if you are financially able, unless your GP is very comfortable with prescribing this kind of stuff. I had a bad reaction to the first med I tried and my GP just kind of threw up her hands and gave up\u2026 my psych has been much more helpful.",

      "text": "I took a year off for mental health as well. it was fall and spring 2020-21 and the pandemic improving and getting a job improved my mental health considerably. I definitely didn\u2019t do as much as I could have, but I indulged in some hobbies (building a pc, building a record setup) and those brought me a lot of purpose during my time off. Now I have a sweet entertainment room in my apartment.\n\nalso, exercising helps and so does a change in diet but those are both super daunting to me rn as I\u2019ve been struggling with my depression for a few months (different reasons for it though - life really hit me in the uterus this year)\n\nbut make it a goal to get outside at least once a day. even if you just walk around for 5 mins. I know it always makes me feel a lot better to smell the fresh air",

      "text": "similar boat here. good luck on cymbalta, I really hope it helps you; for me it was a complete waste of more than a year, had zero of the intended good effects, only the bad side effects. and the withdrawls are the worst illness I've ever experienced in my life so far, and they set in FAST (15 hour half-life on average, so make sure you don't miss a dose).\n\nas for the rest of it, I managed to get enrolled in an intensive outpatient therapy group over the summer, where I went for CBT and DBT for 3 hours every day, for 3 months, and it's been incredibly helpful, so if regular talk therapy doesn't do it for you, I'd really consider trying group. I thought it would be worse at first but I'm glad I was wrong.\n\nsleep is way more important to overall health and wellbeing than most realise. I don't know a single person, even doctors, who has a healthy sleep schedule or proper sleep hygiene. it's ridiculously difficult to have good sleep hygiene in this era, especially in school with so much required online. definitely focus on tackling sleep first out of the self-care list, and stuff like showering, brushing teeth, etc. then diet, then exercise. it's harder than it sounds though, unfortunately.\n\nanother problem you will run into is having no money, unless you actively have a job or your family is heavily funding you. taking a gap year after already starting university means you will most likely lose any/all scholarships you had been awarded before. I wish to God I'd taken a gap before starting last year, because the pandemic absolutely ruined my entire academic career as well as my physical and mental health.\n\ncampus counseling is a good place to start, but sometimes they have limitations on how many meetings you can have (at my uni the student health center offers 5 meetings maximum, then you have to transfer to somewhere else). if you have insurance, I'd suggest starting as soon as possible with someplace more long-term. the people in your college's counseling center can help you find one.\n\nultimately, try not to do something you may regret later such as accidentally throwing away all of your scholarships or delaying on starting recovery like I did haha, but do remember that at the end of the day your health and wellbeing will always be more important than social expectations of constant productivity.",

      "text": "I took off the summer this year, and honestly, it was the best thing I could have done for myself. I didn't get a job or volunteer, but I did dedicate a huge amount of time to a story I was writing (I write as a hobby) and took up a new sport (aerial silks) and started getting back into shape. It gave me a lot of time to think about my life and the path I wanted (which the anxiety over was a huge part of what pushed my mental health issues over the edge). When I came back to school, I had the peace of mind I needed to get myself sorted out. So far, I've maintained good grades and feel good about the changes I've made. \n\nAbsolutely follow up with a psychotherapist, though, and a psychiatrist if the psychotherapist recommends that you use medication.",
