      "text": "I had that exact experience. Changed my major multiple times and finally decided I needed to stick with one. My last two semesters I decided I didn\u2019t like major anymore and found one I thought would be a better fix. But it would have put me behind another couple of years so I didn\u2019t change it. I just spent the last year trying to graduate. Luckily I was able to find a job with the major I picked though.",

      "text": "Yup - I am an adult learner and realized after 3rd year (actually 4th year in school), but it wasn't worth it to change course at that point. I am 2 classes away from graduating now, and have done well throughout most of my degree. My interests are still tangential to my degree and I can pivot now, or with a masters degree. \n\nThat said - I am just exhausted and frustrated with my undergrad at the moment though, and not willing to dive into a graduate degree at the moment. \n\n(FYI - Forestry degree pivoting towards environmental science/conservation, policy/economics. Generally interested in interdisciplinary studies of humans and environment; not sure how to turn it into a job).",

I was previously in business loathed everything about it, but I thought it was too late after a couple semesters. \n\nHowever, my grades reflected my interest. I left the first college with a GPA of like 2.2 but now that I'm in a major I enjoy, and am taking classes pertinent to said major, this semester is looking like a 4.0 is extremely feasible, with a lot of cushion for my finals. My GPA wasn't hot last semester (had a lot of shit going on between moving, injuries, illnesses, death in the family, a lot of other shit) and I think was about the same as my cumulative GPA from the last college, but this 4.0 will sure as shit help that and I enjoy this program enough to where I'm confident that I am able to learn the materials and excel.",

If you start a degree, take a decade off, then come back, it's unreasonable to hold you to the standards from 10 years ago. Depending on the major, a LOT may have changed in that gap. The catalog for the year you start (or restart) is the specific requirements for graduation for you. *That* has an expiration. It may be that one class no longer counted as credit in the new catalog year. [Math -> Math Ed -> Math Ed Credential -> Math Ed -> Math Ed Foundational .. I only officially swapped from Math to Math Ed]\n\nCaveat being I only understand this with regards to my school. I've switched majors four times, but only officially once, because I want to maintain a previous catalog year. If my new major doesn't pan out, then I can go back to my old major without the requirements of the new catalog year (two more classes are required). It MAY be different in your case.",
