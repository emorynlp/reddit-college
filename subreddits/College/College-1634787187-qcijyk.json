  "text": "As someone from America who is going to start their first year of college next year I usually watch anything that is mainstream like \"Game of Thrones\" or \"Stranger Things\" but my favorite genre of all is space sci fi. During my senior year of middle school several years ago a friend invited me over to their house to show me a game called \"Mass Effect\" and it blew me away. The game was more like an interactive movie than a video game. The story was engaging from the get-go and the characters as well as universe was memorable. Before that I had no interest in space or sci fi.\n\nAfter experiencing \"Mass Effect\" through a friend I searched for anything that was like it. I binged watch shows like \"Firefly\", \"Farscape\", \"Battlestar Galactica\" and even an old 90s show called \"Babylon 5\". I devoured \"The Expanse\" novels.\n\nStrangely despite this I was not interested or excited much by real spaceflight or space exploration but during the quarantine I check out a show on Apple TV called \"For All Mankind\" out of boredom as well as curiosity and it showed me how exciting real space exploration could be. The first three episodes were slow but it picked up once it got to the training of the women astronauts. \n\nAfter finishing the first season I checked out any astronaut theme stuff I could find. \"The Right Stuff\", \"Apollo 13\", \"Hidden Figures\", \"First Man\", \"Gravity\", \"Interstellar\", \"The Martian\" and even a Russian movie called \"Salyut-7\" and an anime called \"Planetes\".\n\nMaybe I had this love for space in me all along. It just needed a spark and sci fi as well as astronaut movies/shows were that spark.\n\nI have always associated spaceflight and space exploration with the optimism of the 90s. I grew up during the space shuttle years.\n\nDuring my high school years I wanted to major in business to get a cushy office job that would pay for a nice vacation each year but now thanks to Apple TV and the recent things happening with space right now I think being an astronaut would be the coolest thing ever. I now want to major in engineering and even if I don't become an astronaut it could lead to a career that could help humanity. Advancements in electric vehicles and fusion power give me hope for the future.",
