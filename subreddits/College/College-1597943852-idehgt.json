Here's my take on them and a bit of advice.\n\nFirst, due dates are irrelevant.  Simply put, most assignments give you a week. You can't look at them as if you're going to 5 lectures on August 30th. Instead, you are going to 5 lectures between August 24th and August 30th.  \n\nSecond, they aren't lectures either.  Some professors may upload a lecture online, but most don't.  Instead, they are pools of resources.  Study guides, power points, articles, case studies, etc.  You have to read and learn the material yourself instead having a professor spoon feed it to you.  You won't have a professor repeating the contents of the syllabus every week.  You can read it yourself.  All in all, online classes give your more resources to work with, but you have to put more work into learning that information. \n\nAs for it not taking as much time, yeah, that's normal for some. Most professors and advisors repeat the same formula of 3 hours of work per credit hour per week.  In over 250 credits, I've never exceeded 1 hour per credit per week.  Looking back, I can't say there's been any significant difference in the amount of information learned in online courses versus in-residence courses. \n\nIt all depends on the professor, your academic aptitude and how much work you put it.  Some professors phone it in and your course is ridiculously easy and you learn nothing.  Some students have a stronger aptitude than others and can finish faster, while others will struggle to finish on time.  Also, you can put the bare minimum into your work and still get an A, or you can do more to try to learn. Read every article that is linked. Get on google and search the subject to learn more.", "author": "Inactive_Account", "created": 1597950515, "upvotes": 325}, "g28fvfj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/idehgt/taking_all_online_classes_doesnt_feel_like_college/g28fvfj/", "text": "If you're truly concerned about not learning enough, then take all that excess time and learn more.
