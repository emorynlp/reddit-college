Weed makes me anxious (like call 911 anxious...which i seriously did one time) but the cartridges my boyfriend has are ok for me and i feel comfortable if i get anxious near him. I actually really don\u2019t think smoking copious amounts of weed daily should be normalized (unless it\u2019s for a chronic disease). \n\nI actually take CBD oil and it is literally like taking a low dose of lorazepam.

Most of my friends from college/high school don't smoke so we just hang out and play board games or whatever. I do however have a good friend who smokes a lot and I hang out with him and his friend group. They always want to go smoke at least once while we're hanging out, and 2-3 times we've just ended up with like 10 people crammed into one guy's bedroom while they pass the bong around. It sucks cause I'm just standing there while they're all talking about getting high, the whole thing is kinda repulsive to me. Sometimes I just take the L and leave, straight up, cause it's not really fun anymore. \n\nOn a personal basis, I think it's fine to just communicate what you want to do or open up that you don't like it. In a bigger group you don't really have a say so you just have to deal with it. I think if you search for athletic people/high achieving students they'll probably be less into it (but I don't know the stats so it could just be the opposite). For me personally I don't wanna smoke weed because it's just self-destructive after putting so much effort into fitness, but I do drink sometimes and I'm open to edibles. Those are good alternatives, but doesn't really solve the root issue that you feel bored when people just wanna smoke weed. \n\nProbably the best course of action is to join a club or something where they have a plan to do something active/not involving weed by nature. Like a hiking club, or a sports team, or just something that does organized and planned activities. The people in those groups will likely be weed smokers but they probably won't be smoking at those events, at the very least.
