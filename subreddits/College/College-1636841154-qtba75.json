  "text": "I am studying hard and carefully for every one of my exams but when i have the paper in my hands i start reading very fast that i even don't have time to fully process the questions or the choices.\n\nUsually i will read a small part of each choice and jump to the next one or even choose it without reading the rest of the choices. This makes me loose alot of marks for information i already know and already studied.",
