  "text": " transferring from my small local college. I like large campuses with lots of people, and Ohio state\u2019s campus seems better. However, I wanna go to a place where everyone there actually is enthusiastic about the college, and WVU has a small college town where Ohio state doesn\u2019t. WVU seems like they have nicer apartments too.",

      "text": "I am going to guess you are somewhere near the West Virginia Ohio border. I'm from Maryland and I've visited friends that Ohio state a few times I used to party in Morgantown when I was a senior or just wouldn't have was a high school student it was fun. If you go to join the mountaineers do yourself a favor and learn the words to sweet Caroline before you even transfer it's a good idea you know universe West Virginia University is very much a party school but they also have a very good engineering program. Ohio state is a massive school with a lot of opportunities and it's one of the big 10 that that degree is worth a lot like like it will get you indoors they have a massive alumni now. Network and Basically you can't go wrong with either choice both have a very good like social atmosphere. Both are very fun both are very into sports tailgating is a hell of a life fun at either. It just depends on what program you're looking at West Virginia gets snowy Ohio a little bit less both are very fun and very interesting places with a host of majors that can offer some amazing opportunities.",

              "text": "Dude most colleges if you've got an associate's degree or are you transferring from a community college look at your grades from a community college more than your high school grades yes they will take them into consideration but you're a college student transferring not a first year admit from the high school so it might be worth applying to the school that you really want to go to if you've done well at community college you might be able to transfer however I would apply for transfer to the other schools as well just see what happens...\n\nIf you don't mind me asking I'm familiar with both schools but what are you planning on majoring in",
