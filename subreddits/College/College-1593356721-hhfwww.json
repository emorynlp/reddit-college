Here are some of the responses I\u2019ve gotten when telling people that this is my major:\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s cute\u201d (what the hell?)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard ed majors skip class a lot. Is that true?\u201d (I go to class, thanks for asking)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m (engineering/pre-med/etc) so I\u2019m taking a lot of science and math classes you don\u2019t have to take.\u201d (Good for you, I guess? I don\u2019t really believe that more difficult classes make a major superior to others, so I guess I just don\u2019t really get the point to this one)\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re selling yourself short?\u201d (No.)\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather be a child psychologist/social worker/lawyer?\u201d (I think for some reason the fact that I\u2019m *not* jumping straight from undergrad to grad school makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That\u2019s really not my problem, sorry)\n\nEDIT: I just remembered a bonus one: \u201cyou should try to get into a private school! Public school teachers make so little money!\u201d Fun fact: public school teachers tend to make more money than private school teachers. As a general rule, it\u2019s not a good idea to give advice when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. \n\nI think the more polite thing to do is to say something simple like \u201ccool!\u201d when someone says their major, or make a connection (\u201cmy sister has the same major!\u201d) or ask a relevant, easy-to-answer question (\u201cI heard the department of xyz is merging with your department. Is that true?\u201d). \n\nI\u2019m sure plenty of people in other fields have similar experiences. What weird/rude responses have you gotten when you tell people your major?
