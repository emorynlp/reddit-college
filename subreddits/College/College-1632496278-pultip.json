Multiple people in the class are having side conversations but as we are going through the notes I noticed that not only did I but other students around me had a few blanks and we were not sure of what to put. I ask my table partners if they have the missing blanks and they said no. Professor tells the class to stop talking but he is looking directly at my table partner and me so I stopped talking. Professor shows visible frustration whenever we ask a question or raise our hand about 97% of the time so in fear of him getting angry at me, I asked my partner instead of raising my hand. I later on then decided to raise my hand because we were moving forward with the PowerPoint and our notes were still blank. When I ask him about the missing notes he gets frustrated as if he is confused with what I'm asking but a student across from me comes to my defense saying \"No she actually is right the notes are a bit confusing can you go back?\" The professor goes back clearly upset and not willing to look at his own textbook to see what we are confused about but states \"fine I guess ill go all the way back to the beginning, back in my day in college you just had to keep up with the notes, this is why I don't like powerpoints they don't teach you anything\" and he continues to jab at the class. At the end of class, I am making my way out of the door and another student across from me is refilling his vape mod but the professor doesn't say anything to him. I am on my out of the door and Professor stops me, points his finger in my face, and says \"stop talking in my class\" I try to ask him why did he stop me as I'm on my way out of class and single me out like this in front of everyone but he did not want to hear what I had to say nor did he even take the time to listen to what I was trying to ask him. I have never seen him stop a student on their way out to tell them to stop talking in his class especially if he was referring to multiple people in the class like he claims he would have to stop each student that was talking but no he singled me out. He misunderstood what I was trying to ask him and instead of letting me explain he starts screaming over me saying \"I wasn't just talking to you I was talking to everyone\". As I'm trying to explain to him that I did not mean during classtime I meant right now at this specific moment he starts screaming at me in front of everyone. I stated that he was being very rude. Professor screams in my face \"Stop talking back to me, keep talking back to me and you'll just make this harder on yourself\". I keep trying to walk out of the classroom with my friend as he is yelling at me and he follows us into the hallway to keep screaming at us. He has never left his classroom before his students before. Only this one time to follow my friend and me out into the hallway to scream at us as we are trying to leave. My friend and I are so scared we were frozen crying at the end of the hallway by the doors to exit and he is just still screaming at us and being very aggressive. He then says \"You wanna keep talking? Keep making it harder on yourself I'll kick you out of my class!\", even though I was so choked up and on the verge of a having panic attack I could not even defend myself against his aggressiveness. The entire event was so humiliating and terrifying we felt too afraid and uncomfortable even going back to class after the break for our lab with him. \n\nI'm not sure a simple apology can fix this. I have too much anxiety to even go to class Monday in fear of him threatening me or screaming and getting aggressive towards me again even if I simply just ask him a question. I'm not sure I would even feel comfortable in his presence at the moment, especially not alone if I am required to have a conversation with him. I don't think it is okay for a professor to be able to be so aggressive towards students especially if it is visible that they feel threatened and are in no position to be able to defend themselves. And as a black woman, noticing that everyone else in the class that was talking was white or white-passing and he only stopped me I cannot help but to wonder if it has to do with the color of my skin.\n\nI WANNA CLARIFY THE MAN CAN TEACH! his class is not outrageously hard bc he gives you all of the information but he very disrespectful and rude and very very condescending! He makes it hard for you to even ask a question if you are confused about something and you are not allowed to take your own notes!!", "author": "justtpeachie", "created": 1632496278, "retrieved": 1632800329, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"he6ldy9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pultip/how_do_i_go_about_finishing_the_semester_with_a/he6ldy9/", "text": "Professors that can't teach or grade properly have no business being in a classroom.
