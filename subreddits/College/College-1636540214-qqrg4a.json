  "text": "Hello guys. I'm a student who studies engineering and I'm fairly smart and above average when it comes to academic performance but recently I have been very stressed. I can't believe that 4 courses are causing all this chaos. The worst part is how I see students take more than that and achieve lots. How can I get there? I do want to graduate earlier but at this pace I don't think it will happen. I don't know what to do. Especially when it comes to time management I am awful.\n\n I find some courses ridiculously stupid and the excuses I make are devastatingly bad. Has anyone been through this? \nI don't know what to do.  I could be doing better, way better if classes were maybe in person or certain things were not like how they are now but everything now just feels stressful. I haven't even attended one class in person, not sure if it is different either but I am clueless of where I stand now and what my next step should be. I have a lot of assignments due, some are late, others are to be done within a couple of days. It just feels bad.",

You won't succeed if you can't get stuff done. \n\nI've been lucky that everything is on canvas. I just always check the calendar for things that are due and finish them up. You need to develop the discipline to stay ahead. I see this to be extremely common in my younger peers. Procrastination and lack of discipline is what kills them. The young people at college still very much have childish tendencies. \n\nI really believe that discipline is a better indicator of success than intelligence. The person who completes every homework assignment before the due date will more than likely have a better grade than someone who doesn't. The homework is a tool to help your brain form connections to the content. If you're putting that off, you're effectively missing out on studying for points. \n\nI'll tell you from my personal experience that learning discipline to get assignments done is an incredible way to reduce your stress. I'm also an engineering student and I know how some courses can be. I only get stressed when I don't feel prepared. I've noticed that if I stay ahead of my studies, I don't experience stress at all. \n\nI had an exam yesterday that I'd studied for for about a week prior to the date. The day before the exam I hadn't studied at all. I had done all my studying and my brain was toasted from my other studies. That exam was cake. I was not stressed in the slightest. Out of the 60+ students, I was the first one done. 90% of the questions I knew the answers before finishing the questions. I'm still waiting on my grade but I'm confident that I did well and I don't have to worry. \n\nYou're in charge of your education. You need to take responsibility for it and get it done. I promise you that doing everything before hand is the best way. For one, it's literally the same amount of work. The only difference is when you do it. \n\nHow you learn discipline is on you. I learned from working 10 years where I had to show up and work every single day.",
