  "title:": "Should I include Community College on a Resume?",
  "text": "I graduated CC after 3 years, and I got my AA and graduated Magna Cum Laude, but in University I changed my major a couple times, and I'll be graduating after 4 and a half years. So 3 years of CC + 4.5 years of Uni ends up equaling 7.5 years for a 4 year degree. With that said, should I leave off Community College when applying for jobs, since it looks bad that I took 7 years to graduate with a BA",
