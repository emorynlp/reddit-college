Im terrified of college. Fucking terrified. I have passion for things such as art or healthcare. However I know as an Art major opportunity is limited and competitive and I will probably be poor for a decent amount of time. Healthcare, years and years of hardcore cirriculum and serious debt? No thank you. I could work in Real Estate? I do not want to work at all but If i don\u2019t i will die of deprivation. Should I major in business if i want a real estate job?

You should look at careers in the medical field that only require an associate\u2019s degree. Off the top of my head I know this applies to dental hygienists and radiologic technologist and technicians (people who operate X-rays and such). If you want to do real estate, look at your state\u2019s guidelines. You do need a license but not necessarily a degree, if I\u2019m not mistaken you can study for your certification on your own time. I would also look into realty groups in your area and ask if they\u2019re willing to take interns while you work on that. \n\nHowever, college can be fun. Some schools have a Real Estate major so you can do that. But\u2026since you asked, I fucking hated college lmao I don\u2019t want to discourage you but I want you to know there are some alternatives! What I regretted about college can be a post of its own but my advice is to move at least 2 hours away if not out of state, don\u2019t be afraid to take classes completely unrelated to your major no matter how awkward you feel in those classes, and at least give your school\u2019s mental health services a try. Hope this helps!", "author": "problematictragic", "created": 1632364216, "upvotes": 2}}}
