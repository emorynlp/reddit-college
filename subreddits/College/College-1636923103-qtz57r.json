  "title:": "Getting into Oxford or Cambridge or similarly-situated American Schools? (DPhil or PhD in History).",
  "text": "I went into undergrad as someone that simply wanted to earn a business degree and then return to my little Midwestern town to work as a loan officer. However, during the course of undergrad, I fell in love with reading and learning, particularly that of nonfiction. I am currently a law student at a T40 law school and I have a MA in History and Politics from a state flagship university. I graduated cum laude in undergrad and I earned a 3.95 GPA as a graduate student. As an MA student, I was fortunate to study at Oxford for a semester as part of the program. My time at Oxford, though brief, allowed me to study in such an intellectually invigorating environment with its the spires, meadows, and cobblestone streets.  I am currently pursuing a JD because I am somewhat interested in law, but largely for practical reasons.  I have always been interested in political history somewhat, so law was a decent fit, but I never considered getting a PhD (or DPhil.). Nevertheless, over the last year, I have been writing a history monograph (I won't reveal the subject), and have been spending hours upon hours digging through newspapers and archives, reviewing relevant literature, and doing the \"grunt work\" that a trained historian should be familiar with. I also have another project in mind that I will soon approach my former history professor about for a possible peer-review project. \n\nIn any event, I am thinking about trying to pursue a PhD in History, as I am clearly more passionate about it than law. I am not opposed to being a lawyer, but a career in law seems to me to be my next best alternative. That being said, I am largely interested in U.S. - British relations and the history thereof in the 19th century. That is why I am interested in studying at Oxford or Cambridge. In addition, I have contacts from both institutions that could write me letters. \n\n**My question:** I know you cannot provide me with any \"magic ball\" prediction, but (**1)** given two \"good\" letters from Oxbridge alumni, and **(2)** given that I hope to publish my monograph before I graduate law school (two years)(which I hope will reveal my ability to do my \"due diligence\" as a trained historian), which, by the way, will be an excellent monograph, and **(3)** publish peer-review research under a faculty here at my university (which I assure you will be \"good\" research), do I at least have a decent shot at admission? **I am more so asking, what are they looking for in DPhil admissions, and do I fit that mold at least somewhat?**",

      "text": "Some of you may cringe at my *cum laude* in undergrad from a state school. Let me premise that my undergraduate major was Economics and that I graduated with a 3.71 GPA. I was a full-time, year-round athlete and worked 40 hours a week (tutored economics and business courses 20 hours/wk during the day and between classes and toiled at a grocery store in the evenings and weekends after practice). It's kind of funny, but my \"hard\" classes (like \"Econometrics) are the classes that I excelled in and my \"blow-off\" classes (like \"Marketing Policy\"), are the ones where I got B's (mainly because I had no intellectual curiosity in taking those forced classes).",
