  "text": "Sorry if the formatting is weird for this, I'm on mobile.\n\nI'm a recent college freshman and for my stats class our teacher wants us to pay 17 dollars to submit our homework despite the fact that  we already use a program we can submit our homework on. Ontop of that her syllabus essentially says to not bother her with any questions whatsoever.\n\n\"Before reaching out, I expect you to\u00a0put effort into answering your own questions. When you ask me a question, I will ask you to show me what you've already done to find the answer, and if it's clear that you haven't read the course notes or the provided readings, you will need \nto do that before we revist.\n\nNot hearing back from me (such as having a question on an assignment) is\u00a0not\u00a0an excuse for not being able to turn the assignment in on time. Everything should be clearly explained in the assignments section of Canvas, including what format to submit your assignment in.\"\n\nMy friend says I should just stick it out because this class is a requirement for my major, but this isn't really the type of learning environment I feel will actually benefit me. Should I just suck it up or find another class that meets the requirements?\n\nTL:DR teacher wants us to use another homework submitting site for 17 USD and doesn't want to be bothered with questions.",

After reading some comments I realized that this is actually a thing, I'm feeling so lucky that in Portugal we just use Blackboard (at least in my uni) to turn in some assignments and homework and we were never asked to pay for it! The only thing I ever paid for was 15 cents for prints bc our professor had already exceeded her budget for the semester - I just finished my bachelor's degree and I'm starting my master's this month.",

Use ratemyprofessor.com before signing up for your classes next time and just know that you have to do what you can to make sure you pass.\n\nGood luck!",

She is telling you she is won\u2019t answer silly question you can google or formatting questions you can find on ththe syllabus. About the emails, she probably means you can\u2019t email her at 10pm when the assignment is due at 11:59 pm and use that as an excuse not to turn it in.\n\nConsidering it is *required*, I would stick it out or ask her for clarification on her rules. If you do not like her specific way of doing things, you can always get into another section with a different professor either this semester or next semester.",

It's not that she doesn't want to be bothered with questions, she just wants you to attempt the problem on your own before coming to office hours and asking her how to solve it. It's not necessarily for her convenience-- you will learn better that way.\n\nAnd to clarify, is this 17 dollars per homework assignment or 17 dollars for a program you can use for the whole semester? If it's the former, than yes, definitely drop the class/complain to the department because that's ridiculous. If it's the latter, that's honestly on the low side of what some classes will make you pay for (we love the 90 dollar access codes).\n\nJust keep in mind that the homework submitting site might be used department-wide, so taking the class with a different instructor might not solve the problem.",

What I do is I get emails Addresses from fellow students and ask them. Also, there usually is free tutoring at schools in n the library or go to the department and ask where free tutoring is. Your professor should have office hours. Go to the face to face to ask rather then sending email. This is unfortunately with the territory of going to uni.",

The online platform (as crazy expensive as it can be) was designed to integrate homework problems with an e-textbook. You can read, highlight and annotate the ebook and then to demonstrate your mastery of the concepts you answer homework problems. If you are stumped you click the 'read' button next to the homework Q and it takes you to the appropriate section in the textbook to learn how to solve the problem. Grading is instantaneous and the program provides the student with study metrics. My school just started using Cengage for our math courses this summer. Previously the course I'm taking used a different textbook and did not have an online component. However, the math dept has decided to try this method and I must take prob & stats if I want to get my degree, thus Cengage it shall be.",

Just look at the college admissions scandal or the opiate epidemic where a few people in the university abused their power for large sums of money and lots of doctors received kickbacks to prescribe more opiates. I'm not saying the university is signing off on the kickbacks. All it takes is one department head cutting a deal with a book company. I feel like the only reason the doctors got caught for those kickbacks was because a lot of people died from their actions. The only reason the college scandal broke was because a parent was offered the chance to buy admission for their kid and they got mad and reported it. Kickbacks happen all the time because of capitalism.",

Are they even a tiny fraction of the explanation for the expansion and transformation of for-profit education technology companies?   Not even a tiny bit -- we are talking about global forces of neoliberalism, the flexiblization of the professoriate, the rise of silicon valley \"disruption\" models, and monopolistic dominance of previously existing textbook companies that had more resources to expand into this opening and keep competitors out.  Billions of dollars worth of power compared to what?  A few thousand a corrupt academic might make?  I get it, as a student you feel completely powerless and at the whim of forces beyond your control.  And you are.  But the question is, do you want the immediate gratification of blaming a few corrupt individuals or do you want an analysis of how the whole system works so we can work together to change it?",

The reason we invented public college systems is because if a college has to charge what it actually takes to educate someone only the richest people can afford it.  That's why state and federal governments stepped in.  But over time those funds have dwindled, and students now demand more than just an intellectual education -- they want cool dorms and on campus facilities and money for events and clubs, etc.  None of that is unreasonable, but it does add to cost.  Alumni want something for their money too, they want successful sports teams and Nobel prize winners, etc.  College administration used to be made up of faculty who moved into those positions.  As such they didn't mind not being paid the equivalent of what a private CEO or whatever would make.  But then in the 80's we started pushing higher education to model itself on business.  So we had to hire marketing people and so forth.  The industry has become more competitive so we compete for students -- that means more campus social life spending and programs to make parents happy.  Now we have to have whole tech departments to run servers and provide wireless for students, etc, etc, etc.  At my school we spend about $1.50 for every dollar we get in tuition money from on campus students.  We have to make the rest up in donations and grants and online education.  And my school has an extremely limited on campus social life.\n\nColleges and Universities are not inherently greedy or generous or anything else.  They are institutions full of people.  Given that so many of us make less than people with comparable educations in other industries, I am not at all sure you can make the argument that we are any more greedy than architects or garbage collectors or middle managers.",
