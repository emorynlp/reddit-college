  "text": " Senior in high school, looking to start college next fall. Interested in computer science, but the maths aspect is admittedly intimidating to me. Math was never my preferred subject.\nI'm wondering if any of you felt the same way before entering college and I really just wish I could know if I can handle it. Appreciate it!",

Now I\u2019ve conquered calculus, linear algebra, am a business analysis major at a top engineering school, and am interning at a prestigious company in quantitative(basically statistical) consulting. My next step is a data science masters.\n\nThings change. Just work to improve and never make excuses. Confront your weaknesses and press on to be a better you.",

      "text": "There was a similar post earlier this week, but my advice is the same. If CS is like engineering, your pre-reqs are important to have a very basic conceptual understanding of. Once you're in you major you won't be asked to do any complicated problems most likely. So struggling or not enjoying your math classes so much is not a reason to switch majors. In fact, the kinds of people who enjoy math for maths sake are often better fit for academia, because the assumptions and simplifications that engineering or CS might use might bug them.",

              "text": "I guess I misspoke, the concepts do go deeper and more in depth, but they don't just rely on the basics. So I meant to convey that after a year of organic chemistry, I never used chirality or E1 vs E2 elimination mechanisms, and likewise, I had to really understand what derivatives and integrals are and how they work, I rarely had to take or derive a complex multivariate derivative. \n\nSo yes we got very into the weeds about Thermo and Heat transfer and reaction engineering. But you can get C's and Ds in math or chemistry, and still turn out to be a fantastic chemical engineer. I imagine the same is true of math and CS majors.",

      "text": "For math itself you just have to get lots of help, from professors, TA\u2019s, YouTube videos, and the math tutoring center (assuming that the uni you\u2019re heading to has one). You\u2019ll see when you get to uni that grades don\u2019t really matter as much as in high school. This means that all you have to do is pass the class with at least a C or a D (depending on what the uni requires), as employers really only care about the degree and experience from your major. \n\nFrom there, the actual major of comp sci doesn\u2019t require that much math. It\u2019s hard in its own way because sooner or later you\u2019ll get stumped on some sort of coding problem and don\u2019t know how to approach it. Once you see that it\u2019s apart of the process, you have to learn to embrace it and get help, often through the tutoring center that the uni has or getting help through the TAs/professor. The sooner you do this when you get into comp sci the better, preferably in the intro to comp sci class. Do this, and you\u2019ll be doing good in no time",
