      "text": "I liked going to a nicer store and getting a cake or pre-made side.\n\nStudent potlucks are overpopulated with Walmart items. I can absolutely tell by taste when baked goods are from Walmart. Your friends will really notice something that has better flavor and texture. If you want to save money and know someone with a card, I think the Costco baked goods are a step up from Walmart.\n\nPanera is also good. For $16 you can get a bakers dozen bagel assortment. You can order party size sides and salads from them too.",

      "text": "Probably easiest to get sides.\n\nSpicy meatballs in a slow cooker, maple glazed roast butternut squash and (canned) beet, walnut and goat cheese salad are all popular ones for my family. Also well as pecan pie, but in little muffin tin sized tarts.\n\nIf you want to do the beet salad, because easiest;\n\n* Get a large bowl and bag of spring mix.\n* Open a can of beets, be careful they stain a bit.\n* Pour into bowl to heat, mix at least once so all are warm. \n* Toss on top of salad. \n* Lightly drizzle with dressing, either make a olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette or just toss Italian dressing on top. \n* Cut up an orange, squeeze juice on top as well. \n* Add handful of walnuts and chopped goat cheese, mix well. Enjoy creamy warm salad.\n\nIt's a little expensive for the cheese, but otherwise a fairly cheap easy thing to make there.",
