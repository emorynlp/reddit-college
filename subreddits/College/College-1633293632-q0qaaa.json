  "text": "Is anybody else incredibly miserable in college? It\u2019s my second year, and I go to Tufts University. While I have been here, I think I have hated every millisecond of every day that I am in Boston. First off, I\u2019m from Miami and even though I\u2019m American, I\u2019ve never had such a culture shock in my life. The people are incredibly boring or strange, and the people that are cool are extremely few and far between, are still boring, and want to join these stupid frats or sororities. I only go out with my friends from Miami in the city clubbing, and then when I get back to tufts I am incredibly unhappy. I was told that college is supposed to be the best time of your life, but all I am trying to do is get through the next three years. I just wanted to see if anybody else hates college and that I\u2019m not the only one\u2026",
