Honestly I wish I never went to college and picked a different route. My group of friends that aren\u2019t in fraternities all feel the same way. Maybe I should have joined a frat so I could have something to take my mind off of it. All of my passion for life has been diminished and every day is just another cycle that I can\u2019t get out of. The only hope I have is that one day something major happens to me and my perspective changes.",

Don't forget that you applied to that college to have fun learning and actually gaining something. We didn't sign up and paid for suffering and endless pain. I am a college student myself and I manage my time to finish assignment and learn all materials in on to three days. Other days I couldn't care less about them.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a senior in college. I had this mindset freshman year and it started fading away my second semester of sophomore year. College can feel like an intense competition. You want to excel so badly that it seems wrong to devote your time to anything else. The problem with this mentality is that dedicating all your time to studying is unhealthy and probably isn\u2019t the best way to get ahead. As I\u2019ve progressed through university I\u2019ve come to realize that the relationships you develop from socializing, whether it be in a recreational or professional setting are more valuable than anything. Additionally, maintaining good mental health by balancing your time often leads to higher productivity in the long run. You may be able to keep this up for another another or even two or three, but your career lasts a lifetime. Do you want to spend your lifetime feeling guilty for not working? I think adopting a long term mindset can justify breaks from the books and make achieving balance easier.",
