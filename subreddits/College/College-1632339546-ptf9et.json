  "text": "Hello all!\n\nI am currently in my first year at college and I am having a hard time deciding on my major. \n\nI am stuck between Diagnostic Sonography (Associates degree) and Nuclear medicine Technology (Bachelors degree)\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any input from their personal experiences or knowledge. I am interested in both of these subjects equally, I just don\u2019t know which to decide on. \n\nThank you!",
