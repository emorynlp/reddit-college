  "text": "Hello, I am a senior in high school and have applied to only two colleges, Utoledo and Edinboro of Pennsylvania. My main concern with college is the dorm rooms. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life, and school and family can be a huge stressor, hence why I want to go away to college. I loved Edinboros 4 person single suites. I like the idea of having a room to myself where I can go in the case of a panic attack, but also want some roommates so I'm not alone if my anxiety got too bad. I'm also looking for a quieter college. I'm located in Ohio and I'm, of course,, fine with going out of state.\nWhen presenting this to my guidance counselors they haven't been much help so I hope to find that here.",

          "text": "Yea, I assumed most colleges would be, especially since I've been diagnosed for so long. I think the thing with Edinboro is the fact that you have a single room all to yourself but you still have dorm mates and you share a common area, so I'm more so looking for dorms like that.",
