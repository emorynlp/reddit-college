  "text": "Ok so \u201cwe\u2019ve\u201d read a selection of books in my English class, and our final assignment (in lieu of final - so worth a large margin of our grade) is to write an researched essay about one book of our choice.  The problem is, I\u2019ve been rawdogging the assignments in this class so far and haven\u2019t actually read any of the books (just skimmed parts and read analyses online).  So I have a couple days to read one of the books thoroughly, construct an argument, and write a proper essay.  I\u2019ve started reading the book I chose, but I\u2019ve got so much work ahead of me.  The main part I\u2019m stressing is formulating my thesis.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

That\u2019s why I\u2019m really lost (and why I put it off for so long lol), and I\u2019ve never written a college-level literary essay before.  Some are fiction, although the one I\u2019ve chosen is creative nonfiction",

      "text": "While I agree that you DEFINITELY should not be waiting this long or getting on reddit.....I know stuff happens and it's been a tough year....so....\n\nI would Google \"book name\" \"thesis ideas\"\n\nIt might give you something to look for as you read through the book.  Basically starting with a thesis, instead of formulating a thesis afterwards and going through the book a second time to support it.  It will speed up the process, but you'll be writing based on someone else's idea....so not the greatest thing \ud83d\ude15 \n\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI saw your other comment.  Here's a link about how to form/write your own thesis:\n\nhttps://guides.lib.uoguelph.ca/BookReview",

      "text": "I would probably check Sparknotes or other note sites about the book and look for summaries of each chapter. After that, I think you outline your essay and then try to assign chapters to the parts of the outline based on their summary. Then skim the chapters that don't seem as important and read the important ones thoroughly while looking for good citation material. You probably don't have time to finish the book and write a good paper unless the book is really short, so if you can find good stuff early on in the book you might not need to cite as much from the latter parts.",
