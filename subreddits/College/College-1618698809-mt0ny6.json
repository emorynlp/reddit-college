I swear to God when I say I can read a 30 page chapter and thoroughly explain you everything from it compared to taking notes and having to refer back. For those who don\u2019t know what it is, you simply speak back what you learned. I do it per page. I suggest trying it! There\u2019s more to just speaking back what you read but that is the gist of it. You pretty much have a conversation with yourself.\n\nSorry for the confusion regarding it. Just look up \u201cactive recall.\u201d",

The harder it takes for you to recall and ultimately succeeding in recovering that information, that information is now easier the next time you\u2019re trying to remember than before you did the recall process. Repeat this procedure and it gets easier each time you recall. If you do this enough, eventually that piece of information will be in your \u2018permanent\u2019 side of your memory, so adjust accordingly the amount of repetition depending on your needs :)",

While I always handled the first cut at the material in the traditional note-taking way, I generally maintain my currency over time and explore the depths to which I understand a concept by verbally posing problems to myself and talking my way through the best solution I can.\n\nI don't do this with anything in front of me, so I think it is similar to what you're talking about just at a delayed time and with a little added bonus of having to come up with questions that prod my understanding. I actually find that this has become a comfortable enough exploration, sharpening, and confidence building process that I fall into almost naturally, whenever I have quiet time, be that in the shower or just pacing around allowing my thoughts to run their course. Now that I think about it, I am nearly always standing when I process thoughts in this manner. Get weird with it, personalize it, and love it!",

There\u2019s a lot of different ways you can apply it, but active recall is just putting \u201ctesting yourself\u201d in complex terms. Any way you can test yourself is better than skimming over notes and readings trying to convince yourself that you\u2019re studying. Idk if this would apply to anatomy, but either covering up each part of the heart and trying to correctly determine it, or asking yourself questions for what the function is of each part of the heart without looking at the answer to solve it.",

Each time I would see the question side and on my blank notebook beside me, write down everything I remember about that topic, not just the specific answer. Then I'd flip the card over, check my answer and find any other cards containing info matching what I just wrote in the notebook and used red ink to correct the answer. \nThe purpose of making Quizlet instead of doing it straight from notes is to reorganize the information my way because my mind categorizes information in order to understand and lecture notes are just too all over the place. After I make the Quizlet, I never refer back to the lecture notes again and all active recall comes from here.",
