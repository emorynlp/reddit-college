      "text": "I can relate to the pbj sandwich dilemma \ud83d\ude02. I dont eat these anymore but Tina burritos are literally $0.40 each, i dont eat them anymore since they have alot of sodium like cup of noodles. Idk how they taste in the microwave but i would let them sit out a bit after taking them out the freezer and then put them in the microwave for a decent amount of time but not too hot so that it cooks similar to if it was in the oven.\n\nMaybe protein powder and then just mix it with milk. It aint much but it can make your tummy full for a while.\n\nThats rough man, i honestly cant think of anything else. Maybe some eggo waffles too lol.",
