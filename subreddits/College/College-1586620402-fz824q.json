I am in an ACTING CONSERVATORY/COLLEGE (I get some credits for it too yeah) I only kept the mic on thinking I would get called on and I heard him talking the whole time I was like half asleep. I\u2019m surprised the professor didn\u2019t mute me. Anyways during our 5 minute break (everyone turned the cams off, audio on). I woke up and this one girl went off on me about how I\u2019m rude, I need to leave the chat ect. I apologized and said I won\u2019t do it again my bad. And she continued to go on later once few people joined back. After this matter is it still her business to go off and keep talking about it?\n\nUPDATE : \nShe just tried throwing shots at me with another one of my \u201cfriends\u201d in the comment section. I came off mute and said \u201cit\u2019s not ur fucking business, look btw sir I\u2019m sorry for falling asleep it was uncalled for. I already just apologized to y\u2019all earlier so quit (I was even going to email him!) Student 2 : well then don\u2019t fall asleep in class \u201c Professor : it\u2019s okay guys please let\u2019s do this privately next time, thank god this isn\u2019t recorded\u201d Btw Thanks for advice everyone\n\nUPDATE : \u201cI appreciate your email.
