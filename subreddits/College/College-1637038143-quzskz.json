  "text": "Hey so I\u2019m a senior in high school but I am dual enrolled full time at my state school. I also have a side business thing that I do and right now I have enough time to do. However, I want to know if I will in the the future as well. \n\nRight now my classes are just calculus, microeconomics, and writing, (and a chemistry class that only requires half an hour per week day or something like that). I know that my workload will increase through the years especially if I major in like data science but right now I also have other things such as sports and other responsibilities and once I go to college, those will go away so I will have that time added as well. All I will do is my side business and school work.\n\nFor more context I don\u2019t care about the college experience, social life, or any of that I just want to know if I will have enough time for these two things and some exercise so I want to hear some of how much time you spend outside of class, studying, exams, etc. Perhaps you play a sport, run a club, do a club, or hang out with your friends a lot. Please share how many hours you are not doing school work.\n\nI really just want 4-6 hours a day to spend on this thing I don\u2019t want to give up.",

      "text": "It depends on your major, course difficulty, and how quickly you can complete work really. I'm a geography major taking 18 credits this semester, and have had loads of free time - granted, that is because I wait until the last possible minute to finish things, but it's worked out so far; I've got almost all As. I probably spend an hour or so on guitar playing, a couple hours on youtube and reddit, a few hours binge watching shows most days... side business would probably be more productive lol, but anyway, it is definitely possible to have enough time to work on this. I'm guessing you'll be better at scheduling your time than me as well.",

However, because I\u2019m only taking 12 credit hours, I actually get most of my work done at around 5:00, and only study late into the night if I have a test coming up. I wake up at around 6:30, and take breaks (not frequently, but enough to not feel completely drained by the end of the day).",

      "text": "In engineering, the free time you have is unironically close to 0. However, the best way to tell how much free time you will have in college is acknowledge that you realistically only have 60 hours per week that is not spent on things like sleep, eating, showering, and so on. Academics will depend on your coursework, but each credit you take will result in 3 hours of work per week. A full time student will take at least 12 credits, so that is 36 hours per week of work related to academics. That computes around 24 hours per week of free time. However, keep in mind that the average student will take way more than 12 credits and that spending 3 hours per week per credit is the bare minimum to pass a class, so realistically you will have around 10 hours per week of free time assuming you aren't in a heavily demanding STEM major.",

          "text": "I'm going to have to firmly disagree with the 3 hours outside of class per week rule. That's crazy. I'm in mechanical engineering and none of my courses have ever required that much work. For example, my materials course is a 3 credit hour course. There is absolutely no way I could deal with 9 hours of studying for it a week. I could probably memorize every single slide and note she ever puts on during the lecture. 9 hours is crazy! \n\nI know that's a general rule of thumb but it's just not accurate. Hell, even my Statics class doesn't require anything near that much. It's online and I really only do the homework assignments during regular weeks. The professor will pump out a list of practice problems to do before the exam and those usually only take 4-6 hours total. \n\nFor what it's worth, if somebody would spend 3 hours per credit hour a week studying for that course, I don't see how they couldn't get all As. I've got all As and a B at this point and I still have a decent amount of free time. \n\nI think the 3 hours per credit hour per week is ridiculous. I'm not sure where it came from but that's a drastically large overestimation. I would imagine that for the HARDEST classes that it would still be plenty of studying for them. For most classes though, there's no way I can even find stuff to do for that long each week.",

They weren't long but they were hard, and they were pretty much impossible to do without working with classmates and talking to the TAs. The slides and lectures helped, but the exams and homework almost always applied those concepts in a non-obvious way, so you'd have to go into the textbook.",
