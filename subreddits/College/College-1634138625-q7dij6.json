  "text": "Im currently in junior college getting my gpa up, hoping to go to university next fall(2022). Ill be a 21 year old sophomore as opposed to a senior like the people I graduated high school with back in 2019. On this path ill graduate in 2025 at 24 years old. I know that people of all ages go to college but I was wondering of I could still get the traditional college experience and participate in extracurriculars(maybe join a frat) without sticking out as the grown ass man",

      "text": "When I was a freshman a friend of mine was a 20-21 year old freshman also because life circumstances caused him to put going to college on hold. Nothing was weird about it, and he could buy me booze lol\n\nI withdrew from school and am back as a 26 year old junior. Because of my age difference I try to mention how old I am when I first meet people, (\u201cI\u2019m a junior! But I\u2019m old and 26 haha\u201d) just to make sure everyone is aware and I don\u2019t come off as creepy. I think 21 is a much smaller age gap and I doubt anyone will think twice",
