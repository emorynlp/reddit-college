  "text": "It was this early social media site that had unique pages for different colleges and universities. People could anonymously post whatever they wanted, and it basically became a platform for spreading rumors and talking about people from the community. It was pretty horrible--like a real-world, crowd-sourced Gossip Girl--but it only existed from 2007 to 2009. Similar concept to apps like Yik Yak and Jodel. I'm a reporter working on a story that looks back at this. Curious if anyone had any direct or indirect experiences with Juicy Campus.",
