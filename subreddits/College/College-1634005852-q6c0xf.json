  "title:": "Should I study philosophy, psychology, or physics?",
  "text": "Philosophy is probably my biggest interest in life, I love the critical thinking, the uncertainty, and the complete shattering of my own perception every time I read about it. \n\nI also love science and math, just not to the same degree. I want to gain as much knowledge about the universe and our human condition as possible and ideally this would be my job.\n\nIf I majored in any of these degrees I could easily see myself going for a PhD so that wouldn\u2019t be an issue but where I am planning on going to school the physics and psychology program ranks are far above the philosophy rank.\n\nThe obvious answer would be study philosophy but I heard that it is a lot of history (I love history but I wanna focus on the ideas and not the people as much) I also wasn\u2019t a huge fan of rhetorical analysis in school (I\u2019m not sure if you have to do this in philosophy and if so maybe I\u2019ll like it because it\u2019ll be about something I\u2019m interested in). \n\nAnother option is psychology, which is another field I\u2019m really interested by and loved in high school. From what I have done this also seems to be very tied into philosophy and has some more actual world applications career wise. Epistemology, consciousness, and the self are some of my favorite aspects of philosophy too.\n\nLastly there is physics. I do enjoy science quite a bit and I heard theoretical physics is also very philosophical. Not to mention I could research space and it\u2019s a very highly respected degree.\n\nI want to note that I will be primarily getting the degree out of my own desire to expand my knowledge and interest in the topic. Job prospects aren\u2019t nearly as important to me. (Mainly because if I major in philosophy or psychology I will double major in computer science so I\u2019ll be able to get a job)\n\nWhat do you all think I should do?",

      "text": "As a physics graduate, I can only speak on studying physics. It\u2019s really going to depend on two factors. 1.) how motivated/tenacious are you? And 2.) what is your math background like/are you good at math? The first point is crucial because there will be many many times while you\u2019re studying physics that you start to question and doubt why you\u2019re even studying this stuff in the first place. A lot of that stems from that fact of how rigorous the major is, you gotta have the tenacity and motivation to survive. The second point is central to the major itself. You can\u2019t do physics without math, no matter what anyone else tells you. If you\u2019re not good at math, it\u2019s going to be a very rough time. Granted that\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t get good at math, it\u2019s just highly advised you get good before you start a degree in physics. I strongly recommend that you\u2019re already proficient in algebra and trig, those two subjects are essential to understanding and doing calculus, which is the language of physics. I\u2019m biased of course and would say choose physics, but ultimately the choice is yours. Do whatever you enjoy!",

          "text": "I\u2019d say I\u2019m very determined and the knowledge that it\u2019s one of the hardest degrees will also stop me from quitting as easily. And I think I\u2019ll be alright with the math because I\u2019ve been in advanced math classes since 7th grade and I started really enjoying math my junior year, especially calculus.\n\nI have 2 questions though. \n1. Is theoretical physics actually pretty tied to philosophy?\n2. Can you go into engineering with a bachelors in physics or would you need a masters because it\u2019s not an actual engineering degree?",

Yes. In fact, most people who don\u2019t go to grad school are normally employed in industry as an engineer.",
