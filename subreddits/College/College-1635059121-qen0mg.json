  "text": "I am a senior in college, and love to get high as shit with my friends. These are some of my closest friends, and we hang out practically every day. We were up late after watching the Kraken hockey game, and were playing hide and seek in the pitch black of their apartment (plus their cats run around with us which makes it even scarier and more fun lol). After about an hour and a half of this, their friend from highschool (let\u2019s call him Mark), who I had only met once before, proceeded to announce he was getting his shotgun out of his car because he didn\u2019t feel comfortable leaving it in there. We sheepishly said fine, thinking he was going to simply bring it up and put it somewhere secure. Mark then brings it up to the apartment, drunk as shit, in the dark, and tries to show off his gun to my friends, who are also high and drunk. After a bunch of us stated we were uncomfortable with what was going on, and Mark continuously calling us \u201cpussies\u201d and \u201cfa***ts*, I then just packed up my stuff and left bawling my eyes out. I was crossed as shit, and have had gun safety drilled into my head since I was a kid, and this was escalating and scaring me.\n\nCraziness aside, the lesson is, ESPECIALLY in college: If you are uncomfortable in any scenario, even a little bit, get the FUCK outta there, because people will literally shame you for not \u201cdoing the cool thing\u201d\u2026",
