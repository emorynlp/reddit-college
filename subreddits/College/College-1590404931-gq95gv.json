Try to understand what their mission statement is, what sort of employees they are looking for, what the company values are. The more you can show that you know the company in a genuine way (you've done your research etc.) the better.  \n**2) Practice interviewing with someone else (ideally someone with some experience).** Look up interview questions (What are your strengths, weaknesses, what makes you qualified, what's an example of you finding a creative solution to a difficult problem, etc.), think about them and try to come up with some thoughtful answers. If your interview partner doesn't feel like it's a good answer, then an interviewer most certainly won't.  \n**3) Don't worry about being perfect, but try not to come across as unprepared.** You might get blindsided with a difficult question, but the trick is maintaining composure and coming up with a thoughtful answer. Don't be afraid to stop and think for a second if you need to. It's better to hesitate and show you're using your brain than to blurt out a bad answer. Most interviewers aren't looking for perfection, they're trying to assess your personal skills, knowledge, and fit.  \n**4) Don't be afraid to ask for clarification** if you're not sure what they mean by something they ask. I used this task to stall for a second when I needed more time to come up with an answer. It's better to be clear/precise than misinterpret.  \n**5) You'll be probably be nervous, but if it doesn't go well, it's not the end of the world.** Most people aren't good at interviews and get nervous. A good interview isn't a slam dunk and a mediocre one isn't going to kill you. Just be genuine but still as professional and polite as you can (no slang, swearing, inappropriate stuff).  \n**6) Know your audience/read the room** \\- if they're relaxed or having fun, they probably don't expect you to be uptight. If they seem like they're super serious, then keep it concise, cheerful, polite and professional.\n\nOh and what some other people have said: **Dress well (shine your shoes, press your shirt, overdress) and be early.**", "author": "Nomisugirundayo", "created": 1590456931, "upvotes": 1}, "frtloi6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gq95gv/what_are_some_tips_when_interviewing_for_your/frtloi6/", "text": "I know interviews are stressful and it can feel hard to be your authentic self in them.

Maybe one or 2 minutes early. No more than 5 minutes early. (Showing up too early can be seen just as bad as showing up late to some people)\n\nDress business casual or professional depending on the job you\u2019re applying for. If it is for a retail or restaurant job, business casual is fine. If it\u2019s for an office, or something more structured go business professional. (Collared shirt, slacks or skirt, realistic shoes like neutral colored heels or flats, or dress shoes, blazers are always good too)\n\nBring a printed copy of your resume and have knowledge of everything written on it. A lot of people lie on their resumes and then when questioned they flounder. Don\u2019t be that guy. \n\nDon\u2019t lie. If they ask your availability, don\u2019t say you\u2019re free on (insert day) if you\u2019re not. It will be hard explaining why you can\u2019t show up for work on that day when they schedule you because you said it was open. \n\nRESEARCH THE COMPANY!!\nI cannot emphasize this enough. Research the company you are applying for so you understand what it is, what they stand for, and what they do. This also gives you the ability to ask questions about the company. A good set of questions to ask would be:\n\n\u201cHow do you handle global situations?\u201d (Such as coronavirus)\n\n\u201cWhat does a normal day working here look like?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have benefits or offer sick leave\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you offer tuition assistance\u201d (if you\u2019re still in school or they want you to get a specific certification or something)\n\nAnd most of all, don\u2019t be anxious. Everyone gets nervous but employers like when people show they are confident in themselves and can stand on their own two feet. First impressions are important and that goes from how you dress to the general air around you. \n\nGood luck!", "author": "smolleypolly", "created": 1590450154, "upvotes": 1}, "frtg9yv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gq95gv/what_are_some_tips_when_interviewing_for_your/frtg9yv/", "text": "When u they ask in a minimum wage joby, where do you see yourself in 10 years, say \"in a better earning position\" and not \"not here\" or something similar, because they could think that you want make carrier in their company", "author": "zinez0ckt", "created": 1590449725, "upvotes": 1}, "frtf4wx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gq95gv/what_are_some_tips_when_interviewing_for_your/frtf4wx/", "text": "Also understand, this is a normal professional conversation.
