  "text": "So this is for a research project that we hopefully plan to present. I'm newer to the project than he is so I don't know what he's done before I got there, but according to group chats he hasn't been doing much. I don't want him to think I'm taking over the project or anything, but this needs to be done by 11 AM tomorrow. There's only a little bit left, and I've done the rest. Also I don't want to affect his ability to be able to present especially when I started after him, but again, he hasn't done anything and there's only a little left now.\n\nNote: We're part of my professor's research group and working on that, so nothing's graded. It's more like we get out of it what we put in, if that makes sense. ",

Email professor about the situation, maybe or maybe not including screengrabs of texts sent to partner\n\n2. Split the project into two copies, one that you send to your partner to work on, one that you keep to work on yourself\n\n3. Email partner the unfinished project, give him one last chance to do it. Also inform him or her that you already told the professor about the situation so if they don't do it it's fine on your end because:\n\n4. Use one of the copies to work on your own version of the project. If they don't deliver by the project day AND you don't get to proofread it, use yours. The professor already knew the situation anyway\n\nAlso, do this in a timely manner. Don't do this at the last minute, 2-4 days before should be your limit. The professor would be less inclined to grade you based on your own work.",

Someone did the math stages (2 of them) and a few more did the final version (putting everything into one document) but that was it. That, and they only started working on it within the last 16 odd hours or so for the most part before the due date (semester long project too, not a small thing or last minute one either.)\n\nLuckily, I had kept the professor appraised of what was got on throughout the semester and let him know who was or wasn't doing work or contributing at all. I even offered to show him the edit logs and who had logged into the shared drive. All I know is that he docked their project and final grades some, but no one ever got mad at me, so I guess things went well in the end.",

One of the 4 people in the group didn't respond to repeated attempts to contact him, so the rest of us did all the work.

              "text": "It's a pretty good mindset for this situation. It doesn't work as well for classes because your team members don't necessarily care about the project, and so it's a lot more common for someone to go completely MIA. It's a lot less common outside of school because most members in a work or research group are bringing specific skills and if they don't contribute their bit, there is no project. You can't pick up their slack, and so you *have* to be able to manage people.\n\nSince OP is doing research, and this is actually *not* a college issue **at all**, they do need to manage this on their own and not go whinge to their boss. And it has to be managed a lot earlier too. OP should have known weeks ago that they weren't on schedule, and should have addressed it then. This is OP's project, it's not some thing that's just been assigned, so they have to take responsibility for its management and for keeping colleagues on track. Going to their boss at the 11th hour to effectively bitch and moan only makes them look bad for not being organised and not taking any initiative in leading their team, so it's very risky. I think normally people would just take it on the chin, do the work themselves while still giving credit to the other people, and learn from their mistake.",

After 2wk of trying to motivate him, I told him I will only work on the PPT and refuse to write a word of the paper. If you get a 0 on the paper, it\u2019s your fault. The ultimatum worked; he wrote the paper and we got a decent grade. Sometimes we have to give the other person a kick in the rear. It\u2019s your right to not let someone else drag your grade down.
