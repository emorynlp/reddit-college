  "title:": "My microbiology professor asked if it was okay to not wear a mask and I was too scared to speak up after my whole class immediately agreed and said it was okay.",
  "text": "So I'm not really sure what to do in this situation and would like some perspective.  \n  \nOn my first day of class this past week I had my Microbiology professor say some things I consider to be really unprofessional.  \n  \nFirst, as he begins his introduction he pauses to ask me and another student (we are seated in the front row) if it was okay if he didn't have his mask on while he was in the front of the class (which is JUST barely 6 feet away). He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it.  \n  \nThen he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago.  \n  \nHe also mentioned he got COVID-19 last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-19 at that point last year in the US.  \n  \nHe then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity.  \n  \nOf course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety. But I do find all the things he said to be unprofessional. I know professors are human and can have opinions but I'm really put off by him asking if we would be ok with him taking his mask off.  \n  \nI'm looking for any advice on what to do in this situation or if anyone has been in a similar predicament. I'm weary of approaching I guess cause of my grades since he has control of them. Not sayin he would do anything but bias' are a real thing.  \n  \nEDIT: I'm in FL",

In your discussion, outline the following:\n\n- Explain that the nature in which the question was discussed (with great bias) did not allow for time to think about it nor did it allow for anonymity in voting\n\n- If your state requires masks then it doesn\u2019t matter if everyone says yes or not - it\u2019s still going against the mandate. \n\n- lastly, and perhaps most likely to get them to move on this, mention that the professor\u2019s views on this contradict the CDC and WHO recommendations, and given that any student in the classroom could potentially contract the virus and have a potential for long term damage (emerging data supports this, even for the college aged population), it\u2019s a liability to the school if they are not enforcing precautions",

For those of you who aren't physics majors, while you cover E&M concepts in physics II, this is typically a junior level class.\n\nInevitably, when people complained, he said that this was a paper meant to have people look for ligament information and not just take everything they see on the news as literal. Information literacy is important, but this is a 300 level physics course. I can't think of any physics majors who are openly anti-maskers or conspiracy theorists, but professors don't need to feed into that. Also, it's disrespectful to call something a hoax when students have lost family members, had it themselves, etc. \n\nThis professor has been dinged before for being openly anti-vaxx, a staunch creationist against the big bang theory, and other weird stuff. I know that COVID isn't' exactly a physics topic, but for someone who has a PhD in physics, this professor is not super STEM-literate or aware of the world.",

      "text": "I've worked in universities for almost two decades, closely with every group -- faculty, students, senior admins, lawyers, HR... I'm 90% sure your professor did not clear this with the administration or the administration agreed to something safer that he didn't actually do. \n\nHaving known professors with a \"this rule doesn't apply to me\" attitude, my gut says it's something akin to this: he was in a department meeting recently where the head was reviewing the school's safety mandates for in-person teaching; the head says \"now, this one part about when it's okay to remove a mask is ambiguous, so I'll follow up on that, so in the meantime obviously use your best judgement\"; and your prof is now describing that as \"cleared it with the administration\".\n\nSo don't bother contacting your professor. If you're comfortable DM'ing me your school name, I can walk you through the offices you should reach out to instead. (The unit names and responsibilities vary from school to school.)\n\nI should ask since it may help others: did your prof specifically say \"administration\"? As opposed to \"administators\" (or something else). \"Administration\" means the institution's senior offices, and it would make absolutely no sense if an individual professor went to them to clear permission for himself to not wear a mask. If he said \"administrators\", that means the people who do the day-to-day work of departments and absolutely would not be ones deciding on when it's okay to wear a mask. Lastly, if he had perhaps phrased it as, \"The administration cleared it for us to do this,\" there will be a stated policy somewhere. I'd that's what he said, I'm happy to help you find that policy.",

Go look at your school's covid rules if it has anything similar tell him and that if he acts up again, you'll report him.

It's typically only scary to stand up for your beliefs the first time you do it AND you might embolden others in the class who agree with you to speak up as well (this also holds true for questions. You might feel stupid for asking, but there are most likely others who want to know too).\n\nPlus! It's January, so add/drop is probably still an option if he makes you feel uncomfy for saying something, but check first, of course.\n\nI would also recommend downloading a record app on your phone and just hit record right before saying something  (provided that's allowed in your school/state) this could help make sure you have proof of your 1) perfectly reasonable and polite request that he wear a mask and 2) proof of any pushback, especially if there's harsh treatment involved in that pushback. And if there is, you can show this to the head of the department and say \"listen, I was polite, I was reasonable, and this is how he responded.\" \n\nAsk yourself \"Should this be my problem?Whose problem should it be?\" Make it their problem.\n\nNinja edit: I would also like to point out here that *one* of the reasons wealthier students tend to do better in University is because they're better at self-advocating. Learn this skill, it's SO rewarding.",

How old is he? What is even going on in that class/ that school? Why is there in-person lecture? If the class is not required you can switched out. If it is.

Social distancing makes it sound like you have to stand apart and ignore and not even acknowledge each other. They want to break us and re-mold us into something with no humanity.

Preventing the spread to others is known as source control.\n\nBased on this paragraph from the article, I\u2019m assuming the study examined individuals wearing masks and going about their daily lives, then checking to see if they contracted the disease.\n\nWearing masks has been shown to make the person wearing it transmit SARS-CoV-2 less, but only protect people wearing masks from getting COVID-19 to a certain degree. The Dutch study that the Reuters article discusses actually mentions this:\n\n> \u201cThe study does not confirm the expected halving of the risk of infection for people wearing face masks,\u201d it said. \u201cThe results could indicate a more moderate degree of protection of 15-20%, however, the study could not rule out that face masks do not provide any protection.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the study suggests that while it\u2019s possible that wearing a mask doesn\u2019t lower your chance of contracting COVID-19, it\u2019s more likely that it does and that we just overestimated how effective it is in this regard.\n\nBesides, what kind of \u201csocietal costs\u201d are there? It\u2019s just a piece of cotton over your face. It doesn\u2019t infringe upon liberties, if we go by Abraham Lincoln\u2019s take on liberties:\n\n> My right to swing my fist ends where your nose begins.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t find the date on the quote to see if it predates the following idea, John Stuart Mills published *On Liberty* in 1859 (around the time of Lincoln\u2019s presidency) where he wrote about that idea, calling it the Harm Principle. Mills argues:\n\n> The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\n\nIn essence, your liberties don\u2019t encompass things that adversely affect others. Not wearing a mask could potentially cause you to unknowingly spread COVID-19 to someone else, meaning that it\u2019s not a liberty to not wear a mask, but instead, a disservice to others around you.",
