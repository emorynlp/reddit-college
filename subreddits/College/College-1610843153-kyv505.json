He said he already cleared it with the Administration and as long as we were okay with it they would allow it.  \n  \nThen he goes into a spiel about how masks are pointless because they don't work; virus' are too small to be blocked by masks. When I questioned him on why would they mandate it if it didn't work he went into it about how Fauci is an idiot who was out of touch with reality and hasn't worked as a clinician since his residency many years ago.  \n  \nHe also mentioned he got COVID-19 last January though I find that odd because I don't even think they were testing for COVID-19 at that point last year in the US.  \n  \nHe then ends it with saying the only way to get over this mess that is COVID is herd immunity.  \n  \nOf course it's my fault for not speaking up right away, I just found it hard to when the whole class agreed immediately. I have a bit of social anxiety. But I do find all the things he said to be unprofessional. I know professors are human and can have opinions but I'm really put off by him asking if we would be ok with him taking his mask off.  \n  \nI'm looking for any advice on what to do in this situation or if anyone has been in a similar predicament. I'm weary of approaching I guess cause of my grades since he has control of them. Not sayin he would do anything but bias' are a real thing.  \n  \nEDIT: I'm in FL", "author": "lazyspectator", "created": 1610843153, "retrieved": 1632947325, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1101, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"gjjrx5u": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kyv505/my_microbiology_professor_asked_if_it_was_okay_to/gjjrx5u/", "text": "Locked.
