  "text": "Hello,\n\nI\u2019m going to try to make this as short and sweet as possible but basically I\u2019m taking this programming class and we have something called \u201cPLA\u2019S\u201d who are current students who help grade most of the assignments while we have a main professor who lectures (so similar to the role of a TA, except these are current students and they aren\u2019t getting paid... it\u2019s kinda like volunteering basically... it\u2019s kind weird, I know)\n\nNow the main issue I\u2019m having is my PLA started off the semester grading assignments within 2-3 days and all of the sudden in October that stopped and they took like 2-3 weeks to grade one assignment and then ironically one time where a bunch of weeks went by where I submitted multiple assignments and they graded the most recent one I submitted but left a bunch behind. In all it\u2019s honestly weird and not helpful that the semester is soon to be ending and I\u2019m unsure about my status in this class and I don\u2019t want to come off as rude/rushy since they are the ones that will determine my grade for this course. My question to you (reddit people)... what should I do about this? How should I talk to my PLA about this?",
