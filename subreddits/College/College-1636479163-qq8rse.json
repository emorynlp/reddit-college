  "text": "\nI have a question about the I-20 form. I have been given an athletic scholarship by a D1 University for Soccer. I have a US passport because I was born in Kentucky. I have received my acceptance letter and I have signed the athletic scholarship contract. In the country I grew up we have to serve in the army, however, I\u2019m trying to leave because I will join the uni in January. They asked for the I-20. As a US Citizen, will I receive an I-20 or should I provide the army with a copy of my US Passport suggesting that US Citizens do not receive an I-20 form",

      "text": "Providing them with a passport alone won't satisfy any requirements because regardless of how the I-20 works, the passport doesn't prove you are a student either way.\n\nYou should ask them if an alternate form of verification, along with the passport if needed, is acceptable. If you have email/paper correspondance I would go ahead and attach every enrollment confirmation and registration your university gave you. Back and forth can take some time and chances are at least one thing will work out of the five things you send them. One cheat code with the government is sending them multiple things so they don't ask for another four weeks later when the first isn't acceptable.",
