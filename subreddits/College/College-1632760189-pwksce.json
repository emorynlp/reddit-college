  "text": "Pre-covid, calculus allowed calculators, as long as they didn\u2019t have WiFi connection or notes downloaded onto them for exams. This was the policy for a least the last decade or so and it seemed to work out fairly for most people.\n\nHowever, Covid forced school online for 3 semesters and when things were reverted back this one, calculators were banned. Some of the questions are arithmetic heavy and due to being a high stress test taker, my grades have slipped from a B average on exams to a D+/C- on them due to stupid mistakes. Does anyone else have this situation?",

If it's a huge issue you can try to get an accommodation through disability services (if you have a disability: anxiety?) that may allow you to use a basic calculator for the arithmetic stuff, but it wouldn't retroactively apply to the exams you've already taken, and if you don't have a documented disability it probably won't get approved, but if it's causing that much of an issue it's worth a shot",
