For me, I chose programming because I could become a Front-End Developer and UI designer, that way I'll get to do both at once.",

              "text": "There's a few points to that then:\n\n1.As far as the major is concerned,  it boils down to your specific curriculum and how much freedom your college gives you in choosing courses. I had to do Advanced Calculus, Statistics and Numerical Methods mandatorily.\n\n2. As for the actual work, programming is basically applying mathematical reasoning, but it does feel quite different from the 'regular' math you might be used to, to me programming is very intuitive as opposed to pure math.\n\n3. The amount of math needed will vary greatly based on what field of work you choose, for example anything with Data Science, Machine learning etc. will require lots of math, whereas if you choose to go for Front-End stuff, that be concerned more with the logistics of incoming data, how to present it, how to use libraries and tools to build an interface and so on\n\nSo if you can tolerate some math, go for it.\nBut if you absolutely despise it, you might have a hard time.",
