Should this person turn themselves in an effort to prevent matters from escalating?", "text": "Someone that wasn't myself took an exam today and made an ***abominable*** decision to cheat on it. This person used an unapproved online calculator to help find solutions for a medium-portion of the questions.  The person is new to Zoom and hasn't had much experience with it yet. Not that this should influence their behavior, but this student wasn't consciously aware that the instructor might have the ability to monitor the students's screens until mid-test, after the decision to cheat had already been made. After looking at zoom online resources, I saw some notes that said \"for a participant to share their desktop activities with an instructor, they must manually enable the sharing-feature themselves,\" or something similar. The whole meeting was recorded by the instructor, but the person can't remember/forgot to check if their screen-sharing was on. Oof. Not sure if this changes anything, but today's exam, unlike our regular lectures, was password protected. Could the instructor have requested screen-sharing to be enabled from the beginning of today's class, for example, like in a pop-up/pop-out menu, and the student didn't notice?\n\nThis person is worried that they possibly have already been discovered because they saw the instructor shaking their head around the time they did it, although that could be caused by more than one thing.\n\nThe student I'm referring to is filled with shame, guilt, regret for not studying more, and anxiety about getting caught/from being 'caught' already. This student is thinking about coming forward to the instructor with the truth, especially if it would prevent matters from getting worse. Although the student would face a punishment, the student would (probably) be allowed to stay in the class. What should this person do? If the host goes back to look at the recording(s) will the instructor/could the instructor see what this student has done?", "author": "UrbanSupremacy", "created": 1632875704, "retrieved": 1632945425, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "comments": {"heq9sdn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxjv9q/someone_not_me_cheated_on_a_zoom_test_could_the/heq9sdn/", "text": "I use zoom and teachers can't monitor your screen unless you pressed the screen share button.

As for the latter of your first paragraph, it would be unethical and a complete invasion of privacy for your screen to be shared without you accepting it. I\u2019ve never heard of zoom having this feature\u2026 I have had to screen share for a project and remember having to click multiple things to get there. I remember having to click the little arrow then I had to choose what I wanted to share - say for example I had my project opened on my desktop and an email opened. I would choose between these two, along with a \u201cWhiteboard\u201d option. I also know at the top of my screen there was a red box that said \u201cstop screensharing\u201d or something. This was a couple months ago tho, so maybe this changed. \n\nAs for the coming forward\u2026 Well, I guess it just depends on how the student feels. There\u2019s a risk for not coming forward in case the professor knows but the student can also be throwing themselves under the bus for no reason. If the professor does find out, I\u2019m sure he will reach out to the student. Some professors are more \u201clenient\u201d with first-time offenses. Either way, if the professor goes over the recording, they\u2019re going to see one of two things: 1. The persons screen share was off or 2. The student was cheating. It\u2019s likely the professor will reach out to the student if they find anything out. It\u2019s hard to give advice in this situation because I don\u2019t condone cheating, but sometimes we make mistakes without thinking of the consequences.\n\nEdit: grammar mistake", "author": "alwaystrivenprosper", "created": 1632878421, "upvotes": 1}, "heo26n6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxjv9q/someone_not_me_cheated_on_a_zoom_test_could_the/heo26n6/", "text": "That student should relax and not jump to conclusions.
