I could major in Data Science, but it\u2019s not that much different (at least with DS, i could get in the major and get the degree, but i don\u2019t think I want to live assignment to assignment anymore). I might\u2019ve had an easier time had i started coding before college, but it\u2019s definitely too late for that. Has anyone come to the realization that they\u2019re just not cut out for something and changed majors?  It just sucks knowing that I would like to major in one of the two but I simply don\u2019t have the thinking for it.", "author": "strawberriesfordays", "created": 1632260828, "retrieved": 1632800938, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdt2obg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pssyx2/majoring_in_something_youre_not_good_at/hdt2obg/", "text": "It can take a while to get good at programming. I was in a similar situation, where I switched to CS from an unrelated major and had to catch up and start completely from scratch. I would say that it personally took me a few years to get pretty decent at programming, and it was really my internship that taught me a lot and got me into the \"coding\" mindset, if that makes sense. So it's definitely not too late, you might want to consider doing a gap year/semester and getting an internship or something to really build up your programming skills if you feel you aren't quite at that level yet.\n\nAnd Data science is also a pretty intense major, more stats/linear algebra/calc than computer science.", "author": "postmaloneismediocre", "created": 1632284276, "upvotes": 2}, "hdszo8k": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pssyx2/majoring_in_something_youre_not_good_at/hdszo8k/", "text": "Which part of Computer Science do you find difficult?\n\nIf it\u2019s the programming side, I honestly suggest giving it a few classes, as they build upon themselves and you naturally get better.\n\nIf it\u2019s the logical side, then it might be harder to transition to.\n\nI will note Data Science is a different beast, but it\u2019s not any easier than CS.", "author": "Nickjet45", "created": 1632282485, "upvotes": 2}, "hdso2or": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pssyx2/majoring_in_something_youre_not_good_at/hdso2or/", "text": "Data science is just as hard as CS", "author": "evasiveshag", "created": 1632276417, "upvotes": 3}, "hdrxy8l": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pssyx2/majoring_in_something_youre_not_good_at/hdrxy8l/", "text": "I've done it three times.
