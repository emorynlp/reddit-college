Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they \"just so happen\" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.\n\nIf you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too. \n\nDon't be an asshole. Animals are not a toy. If you adopt one, either keep it or hand it off to another responsible owner, but for the love of all things, don't just toss it on the street.", "author": null, "created": 1579536574, "retrieved": 1632802035, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1295, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ff6cwid": {"link": "/r/college/comments/erf74t/dont_get_an_animal_you_cant_keep/ff6cwid/", "text": "I don't really understand all of this pet craze.

Take a look at you dogs carbon footprint, lol, which is a part of yours as you bought an animal just to have.  I understand dogs for protection, and that when you live with your dog it becomes a part of your family, as you have a responsibilty, but strays should just be put down. We eat cows, putting dogs down is not a big deal. Maybe we could even sell some to China (I'm not being racists, I mean it truly, and anyone who says they don't eat dog should do some research).", "author": "8998a", "created": 1579624453, "upvotes": 1}, "ff5ch6p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/erf74t/dont_get_an_animal_you_cant_keep/ff5ch6p/", "text": "This is why I have a fishy.

Not sure if it's the same in your area. So if you have a stable home and are looking for a feline friend, please consider adopting a black cat.\n\nThird of all, I am a reptile owner and always encourage my friends/college students/etc to never shy away from getting a pet (given that they are responsible and can afford it) but to look for a different option. Hamsters, birds, rats, and lizards can be awesome pets, apartment friendly (in many cases) and these tinier animals can be just as amazing as \"cats\" and \"dogs.\" \n\nI adopted a leopard gecko for this very reason. I wanted a pet. But I also wanted to be able to take my pet to an apartment with me rather than getting a dog/cat and never knowing if I would be able to take care of it.\n\nNow it's 2 years later, and I have 3 leopard geckos. We cuddle, feeding time is always interesting, and I swear to god they are just like cats.\n\nSo college students of reddit: Do not shy away from a pet, but maybe look for a pet that is apartment/dorm friendly. :)\n\nAnd if you can, donate litters, towels, washclothes, etc to your local humane society. These places are always given so many treats and toys, it is awesome, but people never remember the fundamentals and those are greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: Tank pets are underrated and can be a great choice for a college student.", "author": "SouthernCriticism", "created": 1579585035, "upvotes": 1}, "ff56jix": {"link": "/r/college/comments/erf74t/dont_get_an_animal_you_cant_keep/ff56jix/", "text": "That\u2019s so depressing..
