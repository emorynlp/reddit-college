  "text": "Former humane society volunteer/college student in college town.\n\nNo one dares to admit it, but college students are awful about abandoning animals. Many students graduate and move to new places that don't take animals so they \"just so happen\" to lose their animals and leave their cats and dogs behind as strays, especially cats.\n\nIf you live in your college town during the summer, you may notice that many stray cats pop up immediately after graduation or when leases tend to end. It's also seen somewhat in the shelters, too. \n\nDon't be an asshole. Animals are not a toy. If you adopt one, either keep it or hand it off to another responsible owner, but for the love of all things, don't just toss it on the street.",

On the other hand, the hoses and cattle dogs were extremely useful, but thought of more as tools.  The same people who own dogs talk about being environmentally friendly. Take a look at you dogs carbon footprint, lol, which is a part of yours as you bought an animal just to have.  I understand dogs for protection, and that when you live with your dog it becomes a part of your family, as you have a responsibilty, but strays should just be put down. We eat cows, putting dogs down is not a big deal. Maybe we could even sell some to China (I'm not being racists, I mean it truly, and anyone who says they don't eat dog should do some research).",

They keep our chickens safe from hawks/cats and were good watchdogs when some sketchy people would park in our driveway. But they're also just fun friends. Before my grandpa passed, a lot of his friends were dead, but our Labrador was always there for him and he loved that thing like no other. I'll always be thankful for that dog and it's service to him...\n\nAs far as environmentally, I agree, they have a huge footprint, especially if you buy commercial dog food (we don't).\n\nSelling them to China isn't an issue because they eat dogs, but because they are literally tortured to death because it's supposed to \"make them taste better\". Not tortured like punched/kicked, but literally skinned alive. Ricky Gervais has done some great activism on this front.",

I think it's worth it for some, but on the other hand I see pet ownership becoming a standard in this country and dogs being treated as environmentally benificial, while we chastise beef producers and consumers.  Though this is not the place for me to voice this concern, dog ownership's impact on municipal watersheds (30% of bacterial from poop), carbon footprint, lost productivity, from people whose profession revolves around dog services (though this might be mitigated by there emotional benefits to owners) and the degredation of American k9 breeding stock through the reproduction of dogs with poor mental and physical traits is worrying. Further, it is not healthy for young people to supplement human interaction with a dog, though they make great companions for the old.",

      "text": "Fellow ex-humane society volunteer as well. \n\nFirst of all, thank you for doing this, it is absolutely awesome and I'm sure you've made many sad animals very happy!\n\nSecond of all, my \"boss\" told me that the cats that are least likely to be adopted are black cats. Not sure if it's the same in your area. So if you have a stable home and are looking for a feline friend, please consider adopting a black cat.\n\nThird of all, I am a reptile owner and always encourage my friends/college students/etc to never shy away from getting a pet (given that they are responsible and can afford it) but to look for a different option. Hamsters, birds, rats, and lizards can be awesome pets, apartment friendly (in many cases) and these tinier animals can be just as amazing as \"cats\" and \"dogs.\" \n\nI adopted a leopard gecko for this very reason. I wanted a pet. But I also wanted to be able to take my pet to an apartment with me rather than getting a dog/cat and never knowing if I would be able to take care of it.\n\nNow it's 2 years later, and I have 3 leopard geckos. We cuddle, feeding time is always interesting, and I swear to god they are just like cats.\n\nSo college students of reddit: Do not shy away from a pet, but maybe look for a pet that is apartment/dorm friendly. :)\n\nAnd if you can, donate litters, towels, washclothes, etc to your local humane society. These places are always given so many treats and toys, it is awesome, but people never remember the fundamentals and those are greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: Tank pets are underrated and can be a great choice for a college student.",

Now that I'm going to school, one of my pets started getting really ill. He ended up having unstable blood sugar (insulinoma) and can have seizures. He has to take 3 medicines, twice a day and fed some extra protein with one of his meds. This is costing me UPWARD of $200 a month with the monthly vet visit. I was already financially struggling. All of that being said, if you make the choice to get the pet, you should take the commitment seriously. These animals depend on us and they don't deserve neglect/ abandonment due to our impulsive decisions. Since my little buddy got sick, it's been hard making sure I'm home in time to give him his meds and making any plans outside of going to college.",

Even before the school built a dog park, a lot of us would meet up and have all of our pups play somewhere safe. She also made it easier for me to make friends, everyone wants to stop and say hi to your pup when you walk her around campus. Even taking a full 18 credit semester, I managed to walk her an average of 7 miles a day and most days she had a doggy play date. \n\nSo many people I know also have dogs, nursing majors, college athletes, full time students who also work full time jobs. Dogs make young adults have something to be responsible for other than themselves and it\u2019s honestly the best thing I ever did. You should know what you\u2019re getting yourself into before getting a dog, but college kids are more than capable of maintaining a happy, healthy dog. Sure there are some exceptions, as there are with any other topic but it\u2019s unfair to generalize college kids like that.",

      "text": "\"Interesting\" note, but in case it's relevant to anybody if you live in Ontario in an apartment or most other rented spaces, your landlord cannot evict or discontinue your lease because own a pet. They can choose not to rent to you in the first place, they can choose to not let you start a new lease (i.e. at a new location that they own), and they ***can*** evict you if your pet is causing damage to the unit or is affecting other tenants (e.g. barking at late hours), but otherwise you have the right to enjoyment of the space you are living in. \n\nWhat I'm saying is that if you're moving into a place with a \"no pets\" policy in Ontario then I'd use this information to your advantage by not disclosing that you have a pet until you move in.\n\n**Note:** the above does not apply to dorms owned by a university or to condos; these operate under totally different rules.",

          "text": "This is great info. Just to add a little more info pet deposits are illegal in Ontario as well. The only legal deposits are last months rent and a key deposit (which can only be enough to cover replacement keys and fobs). If you\u2019re worried about disclosing that you have a pet you can pay the deposit and then when you move in let them know you just found out it\u2019s illegal and would like it returned; if they refuse you can file at the ltb to get it back. Generally I don\u2019t condone lying but given the current rental market in most cities this may be necessary. So essentially: you don\u2019t need to get rid of a pet because you are moving.",
