  "text": "I'm on the fence about it, I just want someone's opinion who's done it or considered it. I know it would be rough but I'm here right might as well...but I'm really nervous about it though. It would only make my applications stronger. If I don't do it I still would receive a minor in chemistry. Advice?",

      "text": "i like it so far. bio is nice because it makes a lot of sense (a bunch of this little stuff makes blank, a bunch of blank makes this, a bunch of this makes these; it\u2019s a really natural succession so it\u2019s easy to memorize and make sense of.) it helps if you\u2019ve taken some classes\n\nchemistry is very difficult because a lot of it is just memorizing formulas and what\u2019s going on. there\u2019s no acronym you can use for chem so u just have to constantly study. \n\nmy work load isn\u2019t very heavy although this is just my first semester of my freshman year and im sure it varies. my opinion is to go for it and if ur not liking how it\u2019s working then drop the major and switch to a minor",
