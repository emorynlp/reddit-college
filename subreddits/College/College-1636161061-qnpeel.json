  "text": "I am in my 2nd year of dentistry major. I got a 3.67 gpa on my first year which isn't very great so i decided to change the way i study.\n\n Now,I usually study anything on 2 settings. The first is during the week which isn't very effective and usualy is just skimming or reading(i spend alot of time in transportation moving from my home to the college, aprox 1.5hrs daily on each trip) and the second setting is during the weekend.\n\nThe proplem is i waste alot of time on weekends   on social media and don't sleep or study either.so when it's almost the end of the weekend i tend to finish all of my studying very fast just to check off these lectures off my list.\n\nHow do i lose such a habit?\n\nAlso, i can't sleep more than 2 continous hrs a day. I will usually wake up in the middle of the night for no reason for about 30mins and then go back to sleep for another 2hrs. The cycle keeps going unfortunately.",

              "text": "Even if you do get distracted I'd still try to get some low level work done on your commute. That's also not a consistent sleep schedule. You should falling asleep and waking up at the same time every day regardless of what time you need to be up. And your wake up time should be at the end of your 90 minute sleep cycle. Use the [sleepyti.me](https://sleepyti.me) site. Do this consistently and it should give you a little more energy in the day.",
