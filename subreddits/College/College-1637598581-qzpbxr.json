  "text": "A few of the things that happened are:\n\n* My car broke down 7 times this month.  \n* Family drama.\n* Physical health issues.\n* Ran out of my ADHD prescription.\n* Delayed flights on a tight schedule.\n* SH relapse.\n* ED relapse. \n* Friends drama.  \n\nLiterally, my life fell apart and I couldn't do anything bc my brain refused to function. My routine got so messed up I didn't even know what day it was and my average sleep time was 5h. \n\nThis is the e-mail I intend to send along with all the resubmissions and late submissions attached.  \n\nHello, \n\nI\u2019m going to be 100% honest and I understand if this is not possible.  \nI would like to see if I could resubmit some assignments and if the assignments that I submitted late could be graded. I had a very bad month for my mental health, and I couldn\u2019t give priority to schoolwork. I had a lot of personal stuff happen and I was out of it this month. \n\nI understand I wasn\u2019t the most professional and I could\u2019ve done this before, but I needed to piece myself back together for me to be able to do a good job. If this is not possible, I completely understand and I look forward to retaking the course and I promise I\u2019ll do better. \n\nThank you, \n\nName.",
