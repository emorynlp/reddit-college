Siemens logo,  or beg/ borrow from university,  and simply have a play with it. \nLight some LEDs, add buttons etc... see if engages you. \n\nOur for electronics,  get some hobby packs from amazon,  and again,  have a play for a few days,  see how you feel about it. \n\nI don't know the culture in Italy,  but in the UK a bachelor degree would be enough to get an entry level position.\nCould you find a part time job doing some electronic/ electronics assembly? you would be around the industry,  and would give you the chance to meet and talk to other engineers who had been on the same path as you. \n\nDoes the university have any open days?  Again it would give you the chance to meet and talk to engineers and the lecturers who teach these subjects.\n\nEdit: there's also several /r's which are all friendly,  never be afraid to ask. \nAlso,  my day job involves both electronics and automation (more electronics) and I'm happy to help.", "author": "Sik989", "created": 1632161641, "upvotes": 1}}}
