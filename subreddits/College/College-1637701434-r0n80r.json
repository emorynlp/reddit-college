  "text": "I want to email one of my professors a very polite message asking if there is any chance he would offer me an extra credit assignment. I\u2019ve had a really shitty semester, my fianc\u00e9 was in a pretty bad car crash the day I had 2 midterms in other classes, a close family member passed away, I had to get surgery, and a bunch of other things that have had me so distracted. I wasn\u2019t able to make up the midterms that I missed, I also missed a few assignments in this class so my gpa is going to be garbage. I feel weird about asking the prof for an advantage and asking him to do extra work grading an assignment he might give me, but I\u2019m most likely going to fail the class even if I get a great mark on my final. Is it worth it to even ask and would I come off as entitled?",

      "text": "Unfortunately it really wouldn't go over well. Despite your crazy situation, it's not fair to other students for you to get credit for the class in different ways than they did. Also, if it's a pre-req for anything you would really just be hurting your future self. I would recommend that you withdraw from the class, or take whatever grade you get. Once the semester is over, try to find the academic office on campus where you might be able to petition to have it struck from your record. You won't get your money back, but you might be able to save your GPA/record I'd you're really concerned about it for grad school or scholarships or something.\n\nShameless Plug: I've recently started a YouTube channel, and this was actually a topic I made a video about (I've actually tried to do this twice I'm embarrassed to say).
