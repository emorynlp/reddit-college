And yes, I'm still in community college. But luckily I'm almost done with my degree and I want to transfer to a big University. I always wanted to go to a big university right out of high school, but my parents told me CC is better at first because it's so much cheaper. And they were right, but unfortunately because of circumstances out of my control, it's taken this long and I'm still not done!!! My point is, do you think it's worth be going in person to a big university and experiencing the on campus activities, clubs, make friends, etc. Or am I too old for that? Btw I'll be about 30/31 by the time I go to University.", "author": "Ph03n1x_5", "created": 1632273515, "retrieved": 1632946626, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hdstosf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pswsk8/am_i_too_old_to_enjoy_college_life/hdstosf/", "text": "You're not too old for it, and anyone who says otherwise should be told to take a long walk off a short pier.", "author": "SouthernRhubarb", "created": 1632279234, "upvotes": 5}, "hdsro17": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pswsk8/am_i_too_old_to_enjoy_college_life/hdsro17/", "text": "Don't worry, there are two people in my classes who are 28. \n\nWe don't mind it.", "author": "Tomani02", "created": 1632278188, "upvotes": 3}, "hdsqtz6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pswsk8/am_i_too_old_to_enjoy_college_life/hdsqtz6/", "text": "YOU WILL BE AWESOME.
