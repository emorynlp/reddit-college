  "text": "So to start I'll let you in on some basics you should know. I'm 24 male who's deciding on going to college. In December of 2021I will be beggining my 2 years of Game Developing course at Easter College in Moncton, New Brunswick. I am working part time and can deffenetly seperate work and school. I have no vehicle and since it's remote learning, this is a big benifit. I also am able to save all money I make and not need to pay for rent, food, electricity and water. I know... That sounds like a free ride. Let's just say I am getting the help I need and am very fortunate. My college tuition will be 32K$ as well. Yeah... Holy fuck. \n\nSo listing the benifits such as free rent, food and remote learning from home with no license, have you guys found that you guys received the best education possible? I assume that I will do well allthough my freinds and family have mixed opinions and concerns of this way for me to be getting through college. The Rona may be the best thing that happened for my college experience or the worst. I'm a social guy and I'm sure I'll meet up with some guys who are doing what I'm doing in class. I'm an extrovert naturally though lately I've been reclining into being more introverted. How have you guys managed to meet and discuss common interests with your class mates? How about the option to receive personal help from your professor? \n\nPlease offer me any input you can at all. All ideas and information tossed around is accepted!",

      "text": "I\u2019m going to be honest. Game development is one of the few IT jobs that always require a bachelors in computer science. Even software engineering roles sometimes don\u2019t need a bachelors. The math, physics, and algorithms from a CS degree is very important for game development. Even if you\u2019re a genius, it would be hard to get an interview without a bachelors in CS",
