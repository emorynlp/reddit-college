  "title:": "Need help choosing a concentration as a Computer Science Major",
  "text": "So I recently met with my adivsor and he strongly suggested that I go into the game design and developement concentration. I am currently a junior with a general concetration in computer science. While I do love video games and have some experience in game developement, I'm very wary on how jobs will view this concentration. The concentration is also relatively new at my school which makes me a little heistant to join it. On the other hand my school offers a cybersecurity concentration which seems like the safer option job wise. Does anyone have any advice on what I should choose?",
