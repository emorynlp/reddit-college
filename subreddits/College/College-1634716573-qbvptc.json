  "text": "Hello all, I'm new, but I have an issue with concentration and focus. I've tried turning off my phone and putting distractions away, but even so I seem to get lost in what I'm doing quite often. It's so hard to actually focus and it takes me probably an hour or two longer than what I assume my peers are doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to have an adderall script despite not being formally diagnosed for ADHD. I asked my doctor if I could try it and see if it would help me and I got started on 20mg a day. I never abused the prescription, nor did I ever sell it because I was genuinely trying to turn my life around (I forgot to mention that I became addicted to drugs around the time of the pandemic as a junior in high school and it ruined my academic career). The problem is, my dad doesn't want me to take the medications and wants me to power through even if its hard or I can't get results.\n\n  \nThe reason being is that since I may have to travel around the globe (in case of internship or future company) I can't bring my prescription (or at least have a reliable source/way to obtain it) especially in Asia where it's illegal and considered a narcotic. Furthermore, he explains that those who use those medications (stimulants) won't be hired or looked upon favorably because those people won't work if they don't have their medicine so they aren't as stable or reliable.  \n\n\nCompared to studying on adderall vs. not on it is a big difference. I feel much more energized, focused, and creative on it. I'm going into a STEM field, but what should I do? Bite the bullet and suffer? My other option is to obtain my prescription without my parents' knowledge, or should I just get an actual ADHD adult test?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to reiterate that the medication has been nothing but a boon for me (as I am clean and do not abuse it) and I've had \"symptoms\" of ADHD as a child, but never got formally tested. Weirdly enough, I developed a game addiction as a child and could play and focus on games like COD for 8+ hours straight, but still struggle with school.",

      "text": "I recommend getting the ADHD test regardless. With a proper diagnosis you may be eligible for disability accommodations in college. My friend has ADHD and so she her due dates her extended, giving her a little more time to do her work. \n\nBut if you do feel it helps you, then you may want to go ahead and take it despite your parents wishes. However, it\u2019s it a solution and you may want to consider seeking support to learn to better manage your symptoms so you don\u2019t become reliant on medication as quick fix for your issues.",

          "text": "Thank You! I agree, Adderall tolerance builds up quickly and my doc refuses to increase the dosage (probably because no formal diagnosis). \n\nWhats odd is my other doctor let me try Ritalin and when I told her it made me sleepy, she later found out I about my history and became reluctant to prescribe stimulant meds (I dont want to wait a long period and they may not be as effective).",
