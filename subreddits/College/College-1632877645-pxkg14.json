I emailed my professor right away, asking for it to be reset. His syllabus says he responds to emails within 24 hours. I waited 24 hours, emailed Blackboard support and CC'd him. Tech support said they'd contact him. It has now been 5 days, I sent a follow up email, they still haven't gotten a response from him,and he hasn't answered their phone calls.. Should I go to the department chair, my advisor?  or what are my next steps? It dropped my grade by a full letter and I spent hours studying for this test.", "author": "Aggravating-Impact-1", "created": 1632877645, "retrieved": 1632945377, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"heo3arc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxkg14/professor_not_responding_to_emails/heo3arc/", "text": "Do you have any other way of contacting your professor, such as phone or in person at office hours?
