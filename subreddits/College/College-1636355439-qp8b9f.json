  "text": "I'm in the university's library to study as usual, I usually come at 8am and leave at 8pm and I've been doing that for a month. \nI take notes with my laptop because my handwriting is unredable and it's faster. \n\nThis one girl just came up to me and told me to change my seat because I'm annoying her with my typing noise and she can't focus. I don't use a mechanical keyboard, it's a normal laptop that does make some noise while typing but I always thought of it as a white noise in the library, you know because people study here. \nI actually came before her and it takes me time to move everything. \n\nMy question is should I move away from her? Or is it her problem that she's annoyed?",
