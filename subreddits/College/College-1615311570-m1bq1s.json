Nothing screams I dont care if you learn or not than going to class to have slides read verbatim and no one participating.",

          "text": "Normally I hate it when professors do this, but I\u2019d kill for my math prof to baby us a bit. He apparently thinks we\u2019re all mathematical geniuses capable of keeping up with his rapid-fire lectures and it\u2019s stressful af. He\u2019s onto the next topic the second he finishes rushing through a problem and my head spins trying to keep up.",

              "text": "Honestly, if you just ask him to wait a second at the end of a problem he'll probably do it.  You can always just say you \"need a moment to finish writing\" if you want, or just tell him a little more time would really help you process.  Professors know pacing is important but without student feedback it's hard to know when folks are getting lost.",

He agreed, but then went on to say he had to keep to a schedule because there was so much material to cover and proceeded to lecture us about needing to have a good grasp of the material prior to class starting. And then a few minutes later he was rushing again, and I think everyone (myself included) is just too intimidated to speak up again. \n\nThank gosh for YouTube.",
