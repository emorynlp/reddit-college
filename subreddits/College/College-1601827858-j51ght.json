  "title:": "Anyone else been struggling a LOT this semester so far due to the pandemic?",
  "text": "I was hoping moving to school from my mom\u2019s house 30 miles away would be a positive change in my life, but so far due to the pandemic and all of my classes (besides one CS lab with 5 students) being held remotely, I am feeling lonelier than I have felt in a very long time. I am living on campus as a sophomore in the residence hall, but my suitemate has turned out to be quite rude and has not spoken to me since Labor Day. Everyone just keeps to themselves locked up in their room. Clubs are nonexistent right now (the only meetings they are having are via Zoom). There are absolutely no opportunities to meet new people or have any sort of social interaction. I am struggling a lot. Normally I am a 4.0 GPA student, but I have 2 Cs currently just because of things not going well. I just wanted to see if anyone else is having issues like this this semester, and what you\u2019ve done to meet new people or feel less lonely.\n\nNote: I had to re-edit this because my original submission got deleted by the bot. But due to the pandemic, the suggestions offered in that thread do not work.",

I use to be so active and be able to get plenty of steps, but not my whole day is just me sitting on my desk and working until it\u2019s time to go to bed. I\u2019ve gained a lot of weight, my self esteem is taking a nose dive, and I just feel disgusted with myself. I simply have no time to exercise and it\u2019s just junk food all over. On another note, this 8-12 hour every day studying is just terrible. I can\u2019t have time to relax, I stay up until 4 am studying everyday. I absolutely hate it. I don\u2019t have time to relax, no time to do my hobbies, it\u2019s just work work work all the time. Last semester online was much better where it was still easier to get good grades and they have us students a lot of breathing space. This semester, they are just drowning us in work.",

      "text": "In terms of social life I had a pretty shitty freshman year in 2019, I made one sort of friend but we haven\u2019t kept in touch since March when the pandemic hit. I ended up realizing I disliked the school for multiple reasons, did fine academically but disliked pretty much everything else about it. I felt like it was a mix of being in New York City where I clearly realized I wasn\u2019t strong enough to handle on my own, the school having a commuter heavy student body where no one would even stop to give you the time of day, and then just being homesick. I had a long distance relationship that I felt like became an escape from things which led me to relying on it too unhealthily which probably pushed him away more than I realized. So before the pandemic hit and before I transferred to a new college where I\u2019m now a sophomore, I felt like I didn\u2019t even have a decent go of it before this year. I kept the idea of transferring in my mind last winter as something to keep me going. Now, I live with a couple friends in a nice place and like the college, but I still feel both isolated and self isolated from the world. This is a first world problem but I hate that the timing of the pandemic had to coincide with me trying to start fresh because it\u2019s now felt like my entire college experience so far is out to get me. Last year at school I was basically living like there was a pandemic. Online school feels so bleak and frustrating and is sort of taking my sense of seriousness around schoolwork away. At times I feel like my social skills have just absolutely tanked. I keep thinking that me not making connections with people is my fault but then I have to remind myself that we\u2019re in a nasty pandemic. I just wish it would end, it will one day soon but I just am so impatient for it.",

Hopefully things will get better as time goes on. I don't have any advice because I don't know if there's any to give (from me, at least), but at least I can say you're not alone.",

      "text": "Yes, largely due to pandemic but also for far more reasons:\n\n1. Between me and my BF there is only 1 desk for college classes and our work. The desk is rightfully his so I let him use it during the week. Meanwhile, I've  been sitting outside under a pavillion, using cardboard boxes as a table inside when it rains (East Hawaii Island so all the fucking time).\n\n2. My uni staunchly refuses to set up a COVID-19 hotline to report people flouting the restrictions. Since I've returned to in-person work as a math tutor I am becoming more convinced that it is because the school employees do not want to wear masks and social distance, rather than go through the process of deciding whether or not a reported infraction from a student was justified. I swear to God if I have to see my supervisor without a mask and hugging whoever the fuck she knows walking through those doors again I'm going to lose my shit and just spam the regular whistleblower hotline until they have to do something about her. And she will be applying for tenure next year, but I don't give a fuck anymore as much as she's a great boss the restrictions are there for a fucking reason.\n\n3. I'm running clubs to the best of my ability with zero support from administrators, faculty and oversight committees. I've come up with all the activities on my own, tested them, implemented them and done what I can to entertain people until we can meet in person. But with no support I am spending way too much time focused on club activities.\n\n4. The 3 mental health counselors the uni has for nearly 4,000 students have become completely unavailable because they don't know how to set up and use Zoom, Google Hangouts, Discord, Skype or literally any other online service. I am stressed out, I have begged student organization oversight for funding to multiple clubs multiple times after crawling through the ridiculous amount of red tape EACH TIME I GO TO ASK, and they are just now considering the idea that clubs still need funds in order to do shit online and will be opening online applications for that in 2 more weeks. I am angry that half the on-campus employees don't give a flying fuck about the restrictions they put in place. I am stretched so thin mentally Mrs. Incredible would be jealous. And there are other student leaders who feel the exact same way.\n\n5. Teaching has absolutely been pushed 100% onto the student. I've been surveying the student population since school started about their struggles because I'm taking a public relations class this semester and need to analyze the impacts of the pandemic on our university's image. This is the single issue that has been brought up by literally every. Single. Student. Who took the survey. Professors do not know what is going on. They hate 3rd party testing services and refuse to use them but they do not know how to conduct exams online themselves. And we're already encroaching on midterms, it has been almost 7 months since we were first sent home. The obvious and clear consensus is that professors needed to have figured this shit out while they were on summer, which sucks for them since most of them aren't actually working in the summer.\n\n6. The administration is mostly at fault for the reason our professors don't know how to assess us. Up until 12 days before the year started, they were pushing the narrative that we would be able to safely and fully open up to in-person classes this semester, hence paying full tuition, and fees for facilities that will now remain closed through May 2021. Non-refundable. Meanwhile, on March 13th, the last day of in-person instruction, all administrators across UH approved a plan to increase their own pay by 14% starting this year.\n\n7. All the transition to online has started endless feedback loops in regard to the ever-changing flow of information. I'm supposed to graduate this semester and I applied to graduate and paid the graduation fees right as we were sent home in March. Applications were sent off for processing on the 11th of September and no one has heard anything since. And we were all told only once that due to the pandemic if something goes wrong with our applications they will just can them. No getting to fix the mistake, however minor, no corrections will be done on their end if they make an error, we simply won't get approval to graduate, end of story. I am terrified that it will go wrong and that I won't get to graduate in December. I will raise hell if this happens because I refuse to pay through the nose for another meaningless class for the fucking paper that barely qualifies me for a job here in the US that is slightly better than flipping burgers.\n\n8. My grandparents are dying. I'm from California. I was supposed to go home during the summer but my parents decided it would be safer for me to stay here. But I've put off this trip as much as I can. I have to go home. I leave on the 17th. Which means I'll be doing all of this while saying goodbye to my grandparents and navigating daylight savings (Hawaii does not practice daylight savings).\n\n9. No financial support at all. I did not receive government stimulus in March because I am a dependent of my parents. I got a one-time support of $750 from my uni during the summer from their CARES funds. That money is gone. My bank account is near zero. I have to limit what I eat toward the end of each pay period so that I can make it to the next paycheck in order to both pay rent and buy food, and while I get paid every 2 weeks, rent is only due monthly. If I can't start a job the day I graduate, I'm screwed. And no one wants to hire a college grad with very little experience, here or in California. And I haven't even thought ahead to when my loans go into repayment in June 2021, assuming I graduate this semester. Much of this paycheck to paycheck thing is because all student employees where I work got their hours cut. It used to be you're not allowed to go over 20 per week but now good luck if you can score more than 7 each week. I'm currently working 10 and that is still not enough.\n\n10. My health insurance is dog shit. If I want to go get a therapist for all my stress, anxiety and anger, I'll be paying through the nose for that, too. So I do the sensible thing and just don't. No one in my family has the credit left to pull out another loan on my behalf.\n\nI'm angry. I'm stressed. I'm mad. There are no safety nets where I'm at. Administrators don't care, at least not enough to take the initiative. Me and other student leaders have been pushing the agenda onto them since March, when in a functional environment it should be the other way around",

              "text": ">Mind your own business and stop snitching.<\n\nNo. I will fucking not because I have to work in the same space as her and she actively poses a risk and threat to my health. It's idiots like her that don't think we need masks and distancing that are the reason we're still at this point in the pandemic. Besides, there's a fucking protocol that happens when someone files a complaint with the whistleblower hotline. And frankly I wouldn't snitch on her if she would just keep her fucking mask on and stay away from other people while at work.\n\n>if she is a great boss it's not worth costing her job and her life over.<\n\nI agree with that. But it is university protocol to decide if it is worth risking her job and life over, not mine. Not my choice, not my problem. It is my duty to keep myself safe from something that will literally kill my family knowing full well I have no choice but to travel in less than 2 weeks. And part of my duty in keeping myself safe is identifying threats to my health such as my boss. My problem is that she isn't being safe and is posing a health threat to me whenever I go to work. And I'm tired of having to see the restrictions put into place for our own safety get flouted by the very people who are supposed to enforce them. So I'm gonna fucking do something about it.\n\n>I'm sure you make physical contact with your bf and other people<\n\nI live with him. Have been since long before this pandemic. Leave his ass the fuck out of this you moldy toaster strudel. As for other people the only other people we see on a semi-regular basis is his parents. And as much as it makes his anti-masking mom mad I have refused to see them since they decided they needed to start going out and being social again. I go to the store alone and the gas station alone. I carry sanitizer with me. I use it. I use clorox wipes on my car's interior after I get home everyday, I strip down and shower when I'm done. Because there is no circumstance under which I can afford to get this virus.\n\n>Seriously get over yourself<\n\nYou are a total piece of shit if you have the audacity to say that to someone who is truly having the shittiest year of their life thus far and simply took an appropriate opportunity to talk about the shit in their life and open up about how I don'thave any resources or social safety nets to turn to. I hope you rot in fucking hell",

If she is a good boss and an effective leader then you should think twice before doing this\n\nYeah it does have a place here. And I've thought twice about doing this. Three times. Four times. Every single day I go to work, I think about whether or not it is time to go over her head. I genuinely like her. The risk she is posing every day by not being the enforcer of restrictions she is supposed to be is becoming too great. Someone needs to hold her accountable and since I've already asked and she's already disrespecting my request to wear a mask and stay away and not be touchy with people she knows while I am working it is time to take this over her head. She is actively putting my health and the health of the people I love at risk and I do not accept this when I know I can make her do somethingthat keeps us both safe. I would like to keep myself and the people around me safe and that means following the restrictions my uni has put in place. It is her fault for choosing to flout them and she must face those consequences. Sticking up for myself is absolutely an American value. In fact it is the act the Revolution started from: sticking up and speaking out.\n\n On the other hand, allowing my superiors to limit my ability to keep myself safe and speak out when I feel as though my health and life are being put in danger by these actions is exactly what Nazi Germany, China and Donald Trump endorse and I refuse to be part of that. I will speak up for me. I will mind my business when my boss decides to conduct herself in a manner that does not endanger my health and livelihood.\n\n>your explanations and reasonings for this are quite selfish and you need to realize it's not about you\n\nThis is not about me at all. I am meaningless in the grand scheme of the Earth and the universe. What this is about is keeping the people I love, the campus community and the greater township safe and alive. I don't think that's selfish at all. Her actions are what's selfish. Her actions are the reason why we have to learn online and away from campus. It's why so much of what's going on is a trainwreck. It's the people like my boss who believe in the ideology of rules for thee but not for me that are the reason why things are so bad right now.\n\n>I'm probably talking to a Freshman or Sophomore who lives in a bubble of academia and has never spent a day in the real world or suffered its consequences\n\nSenior actually. Final semester. I graduate in December, which will actually be a semester early. If you have ever attended a university you too are familiar with the level of bullshit administrators love to spew. This is why I am deciding to speak up the next time I see her flouting our restrictions. It's beyond time for them to be held accountable.\n\nAnd as for the whole never spent a day in the real world: I fucking live it. I see the issues. Police brutality in response to BLM. I voted for Bernie in the primaries right before he dropped out of the race. So I took his lead, stfu and am now supporting Biden instead of whining that he should have been treated better and that he shouldn't have dropped out. We'll be able to focus on those issues once we save our democracy. I do taxes. Prior to COVID-19 I would go play board games with friends and do movie nights and go do Jujitsu. Obviously I can't but instead I've found other ways. I go hang out online. I'm currently searching for jobs online, applying and trying to get something locked down for post graduation in spite of the fact I need to go tend to dying grandparents in California. It sucks. I've received the automated messages from Indeed saying that employers won't be moving forward with my application. I've had potential employers never respond to my application. But I ain't gonna quit looking because I gotta pay my dues. I just look elsewhere. I do what I have to to make ends meet. You bet your ass it is shredding my sanity and mental health but I am making it work. I am making it work for a better future for me. And if that means blowing that whistle on the people who won't do their job, then so be it. Because I hope if I was doing the same thing they'd do that to me, no matter how sour I would get about it. Power should never be the only thing that shields the powerful from the consequences of stupid actions",

Every class being remote was a mistake because I can't concentrate and I can't even ask questions during class because of my anxiety. I wish I had held off the semester, but I want to just get this over with. It's making me depressed, and for some reason I feel like I can't just jump into my work like I want to.\n\nLoneliness doesn't really affect me because I'm always alone, but what I have been doing is going out to study in public places (whatever's open, usually it's McDonald's for me, or parks with benches) and usually when other college students notice that I'm doing schoolwork they come over to me to make small talk. It's nice. It 's not the cool deep connections you make in clubs, but it's something.\n\nI want to speak to a counselor, but I don't have the privacy or the time to do so. Maybe that can help you as well though.\nMy school is providing virtual sessions to students if they have the time, maybe check out if your school does the same?\nIf your anxiety isn't as bad as mine, maybe if you talk out your feelings with someone professional they'll be able to help you with your feelings and maybe give you suggestions.\n\nHang in there though, this semester and the next will be a wild ride for a lot of people. :)",

I got a 3.9 last year but this year college have been hitting really hard I already have bombed two big exams which i worked so hard for but i was so anxious that I forgot everything minutes before exam. And i have never felt this loneliness before but one good thing about this loneliness Is that i am turning it into something like i have started a diet and go to gym and really seeing some physical changes so for loneliness i would suggest to listen to music, go workout of whatever kind. If there is a rooftop near by get some redbulls and airbuds and just go sit their at night and call someone you like. Also don\u2019t let school bother you much. Every human knows this isn\u2019t a normal semester at all and even kids with 4.0 are struggling. Just take it step by step nothing is more important than your mental and physical health. We all are struggling and colleges should take this into consideration but professors are stacking up the to do list with assignments. Its hard but hopefully it would payoff and remember it\u2019s temporary and everything would be much better in upcoming years of college.",

Terrible things can happen, family and friends can pass, one can lose their job, their house and their livelihood at the flick of a switch. Corona is proof that the world can suck. As I said to someone else, if the world sucks, suck the suck and game that shit.

In both of those fields, you need to develop a gameplan on the fly, you need to absorb stress, keep calm, and power through. So, I'm never like, outwardly uncontrollably shaking or crying, but every September I change slightly. This September/October though, I do notice it more so than before. \n\nLike, I feel like the same dude but, well, on Reddit I'm going from 8 upvotes on every comment or post to 3 downvotes and eventually having to delete my thing to save face, or on YouTube, I'd get replies to 3/7 comments a day, now it's like 2/21. In-person, I notice people are starting to take pity on me and looking me like I'm high as a kite. But, inside I feel like me. Though I've begun to mitigate this, for example, I keep a monthly therapist appointment for the 14th of every month, I have a prof who I'm not taking anymore but am friends with who I meet up with for Socially-distanced coffee every 3 weeks, for super stressful periods---even if I'm not working, I keep Tuesday and Thursday as \"days-off\" where I can eat whatever I feel like for dinner, I started jogging a week into the semester, I still jog every afternoon, usually in between massive reading assignments to clear my head.\n\nI also have just Work -> Reward days, those are days where you work an hour on, an hour off on school to push out a ton of assignments and the way you keep motivated is by having a reward at the end of the rainbow. So, for me, I spent ten years allergic to beef and after I got better with it, I spent 4 years Kosher. So, the reward on my most recent one was finally getting to taste a Triple Baconator from Wendy's, but the reward can be anything, with an asterisk, that being it has to be big enough to make grinding to the point of lunacy worthwhile.",

I have a ton of friends and classmates nearby, but because everyone is so busy \u2014 and probably overwhelmed with their own loneliness and lack of motivation \u2014 I haven't been able to see too many people outside of my roommate. \n\nBefore COVID, I considered myself pretty introverted. I didn't realize until very recently how much of my well-being depends on human contact, and I've been struggling a lot lately.",

It's so hard to get the motivation to do even the bare minimum sometimes. Here's a couple things that my counselor and I agreed on that may help you too:\n\n1. It's perfectly okay to put something off until the last minute if that's what you need to do to get it done. This is not a normal semester and you shouldn't hold yourself to normal semester standards.\n\n\n2. Try to reach out to your classmates. My classmates and I started a discord and it has been a lifesaver for my social need. Make it yourself if you need to and invite everyone in all your classes to it.\n\n\n3. DON'T FEEL BAD IF YOU TAKE A DAY OFF, even if you \"don't have time\" to take a day off. This is crucial. Piling bad feelings on top of bad feelings is just going to spiral you into depression. Please just let yourself relax if it means that you'll feel less stressed for even a moment.\n\n\n4. Find out about your school's tutoring center options. Mine has regular hours to meet for specific subjects and I'm planning on attending the math one this week. Having a regular time to do homework really helps you get it done.\n\n\n5. Don't be afraid to reach out to your teachers if you are struggling and you think they may be able to help. Just be honest. Although, keep in mind that it's a hard time for everyone, teachers included.\n\n\nI hope any of that helps. We are all struggling together, don't forget that.",

I come from a place of concern as someone who rear-ended someone else while I had my a/c blasting, the sun in my eyes, a cd on loud, and was adjusting my sun visor when the traffic light suddenly changed to green and I hit the gas not realizing the person ahead of me had not gone yet. Those in front of that person were already halfway through the intersection. My eyes saw the others moving and the light change, but since I had too many distractions at the time, I failed to notice the person in front failed to go!
