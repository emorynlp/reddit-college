There are absolutely no opportunities to meet new people or have any sort of social interaction. I am struggling a lot. Normally I am a 4.0 GPA student, but I have 2 Cs currently just because of things not going well.

I ended up realizing I disliked the school for multiple reasons, did fine academically but disliked pretty much everything else about it. I felt like it was a mix of being in New York City where I clearly realized I wasn\u2019t strong enough to handle on my own, the school having a commuter heavy student body where no one would even stop to give you the time of day, and then just being homesick. I had a long distance relationship that I felt like became an escape from things which led me to relying on it too unhealthily which probably pushed him away more than I realized. So before the pandemic hit and before I transferred to a new college where I\u2019m now a sophomore, I felt like I didn\u2019t even have a decent go of it before this year. I kept the idea of transferring in my mind last winter as something to keep me going. Now, I live with a couple friends in a nice place and like the college, but I still feel both isolated and self isolated from the world. This is a first world problem but I hate that the timing of the pandemic had to coincide with me trying to start fresh because it\u2019s now felt like my entire college experience so far is out to get me. Last year at school I was basically living like there was a pandemic. Online school feels so bleak and frustrating and is sort of taking my sense of seriousness around schoolwork away. At times I feel like my social skills have just absolutely tanked. I keep thinking that me not making connections with people is my fault but then I have to remind myself that we\u2019re in a nasty pandemic.

Between me and my BF there is only 1 desk for college classes and our work. The desk is rightfully his so I let him use it during the week. Meanwhile, I've  been sitting outside under a pavillion, using cardboard boxes as a table inside when it rains (East Hawaii Island so all the fucking time).\n\n2. My uni staunchly refuses to set up a COVID-19 hotline to report people flouting the restrictions. Since I've returned to in-person work as a math tutor I am becoming more convinced that it is because the school employees do not want to wear masks and social distance, rather than go through the process of deciding whether or not a reported infraction from a student was justified. I swear to God if I have to see my supervisor without a mask and hugging whoever the fuck she knows walking through those doors again I'm going to lose my shit and just spam the regular whistleblower hotline until they have to do something about her. And she will be applying for tenure next year, but I don't give a fuck anymore as much as she's a great boss the restrictions are there for a fucking reason.\n\n3. I'm running clubs to the best of my ability with zero support from administrators, faculty and oversight committees. I've come up with all the activities on my own, tested them, implemented them and done what I can to entertain people until we can meet in person. But with no support I am spending way too much time focused on club activities.\n\n4. The 3 mental health counselors the uni has for nearly 4,000 students have become completely unavailable because they don't know how to set up and use Zoom, Google Hangouts, Discord, Skype or literally any other online service. I am stressed out, I have begged student organization oversight for funding to multiple clubs multiple times after crawling through the ridiculous amount of red tape EACH TIME I GO TO ASK, and they are just now considering the idea that clubs still need funds in order to do shit online and will be opening online applications for that in 2 more weeks. I am angry that half the on-campus employees don't give a flying fuck about the restrictions they put in place. I am stretched so thin mentally Mrs. Incredible would be jealous. And there are other student leaders who feel the exact same way.\n\n5. Teaching has absolutely been pushed 100% onto the student. I've been surveying the student population since school started about their struggles because I'm taking a public relations class this semester and need to analyze the impacts of the pandemic on our university's image. This is the single issue that has been brought up by literally every. Single. Student. Who took the survey. Professors do not know what is going on. They hate 3rd party testing services and refuse to use them but they do not know how to conduct exams online themselves. And we're already encroaching on midterms, it has been almost 7 months since we were first sent home. The obvious and clear consensus is that professors needed to have figured this shit out while they were on summer, which sucks for them since most of them aren't actually working in the summer.\n\n6. The administration is mostly at fault for the reason our professors don't know how to assess us. Up until 12 days before the year started, they were pushing the narrative that we would be able to safely and fully open up to in-person classes this semester, hence paying full tuition, and fees for facilities that will now remain closed through May 2021. Non-refundable. Meanwhile, on March 13th, the last day of in-person instruction, all administrators across UH approved a plan to increase their own pay by 14% starting this year.\n\n7. All the transition to online has started endless feedback loops in regard to the ever-changing flow of information. I'm supposed to graduate this semester and I applied to graduate and paid the graduation fees right as we were sent home in March. Applications were sent off for processing on the 11th of September and no one has heard anything since. And we were all told only once that due to the pandemic if something goes wrong with our applications they will just can them. No getting to fix the mistake, however minor, no corrections will be done on their end if they make an error, we simply won't get approval to graduate, end of story. I am terrified that it will go wrong and that I won't get to graduate in December. I will raise hell if this happens because I refuse to pay through the nose for another meaningless class for the fucking paper that barely qualifies me for a job here in the US that is slightly better than flipping burgers.\n\n8. My grandparents are dying. I'm from California. I was supposed to go home during the summer but my parents decided it would be safer for me to stay here. But I've put off this trip as much as I can. I have to go home. I leave on the 17th. Which means I'll be doing all of this while saying goodbye to my grandparents and navigating daylight savings (Hawaii does not practice daylight savings).\n\n9. No financial support at all. I did not receive government stimulus in March because I am a dependent of my parents. I got a one-time support of $750 from my uni during the summer from their CARES funds. That money is gone. My bank account is near zero. I have to limit what I eat toward the end of each pay period so that I can make it to the next paycheck in order to both pay rent and buy food, and while I get paid every 2 weeks, rent is only due monthly. If I can't start a job the day I graduate, I'm screwed. And no one wants to hire a college grad with very little experience, here or in California. And I haven't even thought ahead to when my loans go into repayment in June 2021, assuming I graduate this semester. Much of this paycheck to paycheck thing is because all student employees where I work got their hours cut. It used to be you're not allowed to go over 20 per week but now good luck if you can score more than 7 each week. I'm currently working 10 and that is still not enough.\n\n10. My health insurance is dog shit. If I want to go get a therapist for all my stress, anxiety and anger, I'll be paying through the nose for that, too. So I do the sensible thing and just don't. No one in my family has the credit left to pull out another loan on my behalf.\n\nI'm angry. I'm stressed. I'm mad. There are no safety nets where I'm at. Administrators don't care, at least not enough to take the initiative.

Normally I have all 4.0s, but right now I'm barely passing calc 2. It's so hard to get the motivation to do even the bare minimum sometimes. Here's a couple things that my counselor and I agreed on that may help you too:\n\n1. It's perfectly okay to put something off until the last minute if that's what you need to do to get it done. This is not a normal semester and you shouldn't hold yourself to normal semester standards.\n\n\n2. Try to reach out to your classmates. My classmates and I started a discord and it has been a lifesaver for my social need. Make it yourself if you need to and invite everyone in all your classes to it.\n\n\n3. DON'T FEEL BAD IF YOU TAKE A DAY OFF, even if you \"don't have time\" to take a day off. This is crucial. Piling bad feelings on top of bad feelings is just going to spiral you into depression. Please just let yourself relax if it means that you'll feel less stressed for even a moment.\n\n\n4. Find out about your school's tutoring center options. Mine has regular hours to meet for specific subjects and I'm planning on attending the math one this week. Having a regular time to do homework really helps you get it done.\n\n\n5. Don't be afraid to reach out to your teachers if you are struggling and you think they may be able to help. Just be honest. Although, keep in mind that it's a hard time for everyone, teachers included.\n\n\nI hope any of that helps.
