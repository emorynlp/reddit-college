  "text": "I'm a Junior in undergrad right now in a creative liberal arts major. I have conflicting feelings about college. I'm a huge nerd, and I love learning, but I also feel like growing a robust network and working on side projects is going to really be what helps me when I get out of here. To be honest, the college experience has been pretty lonely. I've struggled to build the strong relationships a lot of people say college is all about (with maybe three exceptions). \n\nI've debated dropping out and going all-in on my half-baked creative career, but at this point, I feel like I should just finish and get my degree. \n\nI go to a school in a big city and I live a 40-minute train ride from our local international airport so in the spring and summer, I did online classes while traveling to a couple of U.S. cities. \n\nI'm back in in-person classes this quarter but I think I wanna do the next two years almost all online. What would I be missing out on if I did? Am I giving up on the college experience too early? I only had 6-months in person before we went to the Zoom era.",
