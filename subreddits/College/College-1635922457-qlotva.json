  "text": "I don't understand how it's possible for someone to know exactly what they want to do for a career right as their out of highschool. I have friends that have known what they wanted to do since elementary, such as being a doctor/nurse.\n\nI graduated hs last year and I haven't started college yet because I have no idea what I want to do. I start community college in January but I only know what my first semester is going to be, the rest idk. It's eating away at me, I don't want to do something I hate as a job for the rest of my life, that sounds so painful. I want to do something I enjoy, but the only thing I enjoy doing is making music and it's so incredibly difficult to have a stable career in that, especially with my output.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for advice from people who were in the same situation, I really appreciate any help.",

      "text": "You probably cant.  Which is fine.\n\nIt isnt even always the best idea for some people to go to college full time right out of HS.\n\nWhat you enjoy dong for fun and what you can make a job out of is very different.\n\n\nStarting at a cc is a good idea if you go want to go to college\n\nSome ideas.  \n\nReally take a look at all the people around your and your parents and your family - all of the people they interact with.  All of those are jobs.\n\nTHe ultrasound technician, the person who inspects your house, the people who make ez pass, the electrician .  Ask those people ,  when you can, what they like and dont like about their jobs.\n\nYou may be surprised.",

      "text": "Started my university only in the third year after graduation from school. It was really hard for me to decide what I want to do, but I was blessed with the opportunity to explore myself before going to university. So, I think if you are not sure then you should definitely try to understand yourself better and to look for something you really want to do (and try it!).",

      "text": "The good thing about college is that you get to experience lots of different subjects (especially in electives) so you have time to experiment and see if anything else interests you. I would say chill for your first year, try to get your gen eds out of the way and don't start worrying about your major until you are going into your sophomore year. Also I think it's good that you waited a semester. Don't be afraid to take your time. imo it's better to graduate \"later\" having really used your college time well, than to have sped through college only to realize you have a degree you hate and are stuck (with the reality of maybe having to do it all over again). I'll also say people do tend to change careers throughout their life and that's okay.",

This means you can't talk about global issues until ppl can relax that you're a respecter of women.
