  "title:": "clingy college classmate, HELP!!",
  "text": "Hello, I (21) am in my final year of college! Its a stressful enough year and lots of work to be done! A new classmate has joined us this year. I noticed they liked anime (because of a hoodie they were wearing) and so I complimented them! From that point on, it was all downhill. They sit next to me in every class, which is fine, but they keep talking to me none stop. I even got told to be quiet by my lecturer bc they wouldn't stop talking to me. I go for a cigarette with my friends, and they follow me outside even though they don't smoke themselves. They talk my ear off during class, to the point where I had to go home early because I know I wouldn't get any work done. They only talk about themselves, never let me get a word in or even ask about me as a person. They're constantly talking about themselves and even go as far as to talk over other people, which is beyond annoying to me. I am just trying to get through my last year of college, but I have this added stress of worrying that they wont leave me alone when I go into class. My friends have noticed it too, and I'm not quick to anger but it's really affecting me. They're trying to force a friendship that isn't going to happen, I am consistently nice to them and listen to them when they speak but I don't get that behaviour back, it's all about them, always. I have tried to show my exhaustion by giving one word, vague responses, but they won't get the hint. I'm tired. I just want to do my college work. \nIf I were to move seats, they'd probably follow me too. \n\nI don't know what to do to put a stop to the situation. I don't want to be friends with them, I know that much, but im afraid of saying anything that might upset them. I feel like they're trying to force a friendship onto me that can't happen, I don't have the energy for it, especially since we just aren't compatible. How do I very kindly tell them to leave me alone? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "It sounds like this person could be autistic, as they are showing the inability to pick up on social cues and norms that is characteristic of autism. If this is the case, trying to drop \"hints\" isn't going to work, and it is unlikely that there is any ill intent on their end. It's likely that from their perspective, you've been welcoming them as a friend with open arms.\n\nIn general, as an adult, setting boundaries is important, regardless of whether or not there is ill intent on the side of the other party. It is important to just be able to say \"I'm sorry, but I'm busy now and need some silence\" and to expect others to respect that. You need to accept that sometimes setting boundaries hurts other people's feelings. This is okay. But again, it's also highly possible that this individual is simply unaware of your needs, and is more than willing to respect your wishes if you simply have the courage to voice them in a clearer manner than you have been. \n\nBe firm on your boundaries, and be respectful of the fact that this individual might not be great at \"picking up hints\" and might need very clear verbal communication from you. Accept that breaking it to this person that you'd like a break from the talking might feel uncomfortable on one or both of your parts. Again, this discomfort is a part of being an adult who maintains healthy boundaries and can say \"enough is enough\" (in a respectful way) when they need to.",

          "text": "As someone on the spectrum (Asperger's), I used to act and think a lot like this. I had to read a literal book about unwritten social rules before I could pick up hints at all, and I still struggle sometimes with interpreting them. OP, this person won't understand what you're trying to tell him unless you do so directly, with no room for misinterpretation. By neurotypical standards what you need to tell him might seem rude, but he likely doesn't know that body language or tone means anything in a conversation, leaving words as the only option.\n\nAnd although he will be very disappointed, down the road he will probably be glad that you told him directly. I had a TON of trust issues after high school because everyone would act like my friend but not go any further than conversation. Once I made real friends in college it took a while to internalize the idea that they actually thought I was a cool guy and enjoyed my company. I wish the people in high school had just told me that a friendship wasn't going to work out even though it would have hurt in the moment.",

          "text": "This is the right answer. By allowing this one sided \"friendship\" to continue for any extended amount of time, you are reinforcing it in their head. They won't ever challenge the idea themselves because why would they? It is only beneficial to them and they maybe don't have the capacity to see it from anyone else's viewpoint. \n\nIt might seem cruel to tell them that no friendship exists but it is the only way to get it to stop. You aren't responsible for their mental health, but you are for yours. If you want it to end, then you have to be direct and tell them exactly how their actions affect you. I think it is important to be kind to everyone but you shouldn't sacrifice your own well being to do that. \n\nYou could maybe ask a school counselor to mediate the conversation or be the one to say the right words if you aren't sure what to say. \n\nAnyway, these situations are tough and sometimes tricky to get through but with compassionate direct communication, you can do it. Good luck!",

We all know that friend who can be like that, and lets be honest with ourselves, sometimes ***we may be that friend too at certain points in our lives.***\n\nMy advise to you would be to just be straight up with them or to find an ally in that class who you can sit with. I honestly have straight up said to ppl \"Sit next to me so bozo won't\" (lol bozo is a funny word)\n\nBest of luck to you, and congratulations on *almost* graduating! *Home Stretch!*",

      "text": "Years ago, I had a girl who would talk to me non stop before classes started. I would have ear phones in and pretend I couldn't hear her for a good 10 minutes before I would give up and take my ear phones out. I would give the short \"mhm\" \"yeah\" \"cool\" responses and she never took the hint.\n\nOne days she's talking at me like normal. Then she says \"Oh I have Autism\" and goes into the story of her getting diagnosed as a child, and her mother being angry with God for giving her a child with Autism.\n\nAll the while I'm dying on the inside because I was being a bit of an asshole to someone who has autism.",

An individual who i know through a friend, is on the major end of the autism/ Aspergers spectrum and he kept sending me messages on Facebook chat on topics I wasn\u2019t at all interested in (gaming, music videos, etc\u2026). I went along with it for a while because I understood that he had social challenges. Said individual then started trying to call me via Facebook video/ audio chat.\n\nI am an introvert and at a point, I couldn\u2019t keep the friendship (if you even want to call it that) with the individual because i felt like it was forced on me and it was too taxing on my energy. I unfriended the individual on Facebook and blocked him on chat because i had to protect my energy.\n\nI understand that people on the autism/ Aspergers spectrum can\u2019t help it, but i just don\u2019t know how to deal with those types of people and i need to protect my energy and mental well-being.",
