  "title:": "Frustrated by lack of communication between roommate and I.",
  "text": "I still think we generally get along, but sometimes I wish we communicated better...\n\nMy roommate sometimes likes to go to bed later and do fun things at night, which is fine, but I prefer not going to bed at 12 am every night so I got to bed earlier and let them know that they don't have to go to bed when I do.... They come in and wake me up (accidentally) but I usually fall back asleep.  \n\nOne time I was at the library doing work and they asked if they could have room to themselves. I said ok, I'm not there anyways. Sure, I occasionally study in my room (I've been going to library a lot more though), but I don't think I'm in there that much and this made me feel bad (even though they didn't say anything mean lol). \n\nI feel that they'd rather have the room to themselves when they're working so I either go to common space on dorm floor or library. \n\nLast week, I come back at 11:30pm from the library, ready to go to bed. But they're sitting down with another person and they sort of stopped talking when I came in and looked at me weirdly. So I awkwardly excused myself and headed to the common space with some more work. I felt like they should've told me they had someone in room and needed to talk privately or whatever. \n\nOn Wednesday I got back from the library at 2;20 pm and they were sound asleep. I was sort of like sorry and just grabbed my stuff. \n\nI'm sort of just irritated occasionally and could use some advice. I feel like I could use some time alone in room too but they think I'm in there a lot when I'm really not... Thanks!\n\nThey sometimes say they're leaving but don't tell me where they're going which is also fine.",

      "text": "I had a similar issue when I was a freshman.  Guy was hooking up with a new girl every night and would come back with girls super late and try to get me and my other roommate to let him have the room.  Once he came in at 4am with a girl, woke me up, after I went to use the bathroom, I came back to the door locked.  \n\nObviously it\u2019s reasonable for your roommate to want the room to themselves now and then, and as you said you don\u2019t expect them to go to bed early.  But you certainly have a right to tell him that his behavior is making it difficult to room with them.\n\nAll you really have to do is discuss this with them politely.  Explain that they\u2019re welcome to ask you in advance if they can have privacy, but the regular disruptive behavior needs to be cut back.  They will probably understand, and if not, you should get your RA involved.",
