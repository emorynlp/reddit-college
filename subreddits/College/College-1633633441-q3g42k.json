To me it\u2019s kind of like having work friends, we can get along well and like each other, but I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to spend time with them outside of work.",

People also feel insecure when moving into new spaces and carry with them the K-12 mentality about friends/companions (Time spent+ Proximal distance = friendly relationships).\n\nIt's honestly good to just be roommates with your initial roommates",

I had a super close relationship with my brother back home and wanted my relationship with my roommate to be on the same scale, at least. B) I knew it would be harder for me to make friends any other way, so I should take advantage of the forced interaction by making it more pleasant and relaxed. Ultimately though, I\u2019m most comfortable with my friends and family and I wanted to be comfortable in my own living space, so befriending my roommate would make that a little easier.",
