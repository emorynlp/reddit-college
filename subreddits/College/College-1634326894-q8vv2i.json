  "text": "Test after test, i keep getting bad grades. I don't know whats wrong with me and i'm frustrated. Im trying to become a doctor but ever since the pandemic hit, my grades went down hill. Now i'm sad all of the time and I feel like i don't have a chance of getting into Optometry school with a low gpa. I just took a calculus test and got another \"D\". Ive been practicing and studying for this test and I receive the same grade i keep getting in all of my classes. 60%, sometimes 63%, and if im lucky a 67%. I just want to get \"A's\" like I use to always get before the pandemic happened. Why do i keep failing every single test I take in all of my classes. I study and feel confident when im about to take the test but it keeps ending a failing grade. I dont have test anxiety. I don't know what to do anymore. Im trying and I really really really want to become an eye doctor. I think about it everyday and possibility of me never reaching my goal makes me feel sick and sad. Does anyone have any study tip? Have this happend to everyone before.",

      "text": "You're asking the \"why\" but you're not telling us the \"what\" and \"how\". What is preventing you from getting that A? What are you doing? What are your methods? How are you doing mentally ever since the pandemic? What is your situation at home? Sometimes, a change of environment may also change how you do in school. Are you going outside to exercise to freshen up and not be stuck in a room all day? Are you doing an all-nighters studying session? (Seriously, don't do this). Are you breaking up your days to study bit by bit but also to take care of yourself? How is your diet? Are you hungry while studying? Do you let your failures stick with you every time you get a low grade?",
