  "title:": "Is this a breach of grading ethics by the professor, and should I report it?",
  "text": "To give some context, the professor uses Proctorio and WebAssign for exams, but she has you submit your written work on paper. There is also a textbox to write your reasonings on WebAssign as work. The grade that you get on written work is the actual grade for the test. Your WebAssign score, you get immediately.\n\nFor the first exam, there were 18 questions, and I got a 100% but submitted written work only for seven problems. All problems had written explanations in the textbox, many of which were only one sentence. The grade on the written work was also 100%, and she even wrote a comment saying \"excellent\" and later verbally congratulated me on my first exam. She annotated my paper saying \"no work\" but did not take off any points. So, I assumed that way of submitting work was more than sufficient.\n\nI did the same exact thing for Exam 2. There were 15 questions, and I got 14.5/15, so about 97% on WebAssign. I submitted written work for six questions and had written explanations for all problems except the one I got wrong, and many of these explanations were only one sentence. I did Exam 2 exactly the same way I did Exam 1. She did not grade the written work for many weeks, but I was not worried because of my experience with Exam 1.\n\nAssuming grading standards would remain the same and predictable, I relaxed on Exam 3 and failed it because I knew one exam would be dropped and even if I got a 100% on it, my average would not be changing and decided to just focus on other classes for that period. She graded Exam 2 almost an hour after I finished Exam 3. She took off my score two letter grades\u2013from 96% to 75% and effectively made it impossible for me to get an A in the course because I would be at a 88% if I got a 100% in the final. The only difference that I can think of between Exam 1 and 2 is that she was upset at me during the Exam 2 period because I was not participating in zoom class and this one particular day she called me a few times and I did not respond. I messaged her regarding the grade and she basically just tossed the grading policy at me and said that my work was not sufficient; I had mentioned the inconsistent grading standard and how she graded Exam 1 but she did not even respond or mention it in her reply. She also conveniently took off her syllabus\u2013 without any warning or notice \u2013 the part that had something along the lines of \"If the work is not sufficient, students will meet with the professor to explain how they got their answer\".\n\nIt would have been one thing if she had said something like \"Since this is the first exam, I will not be punishing anyone regarding their work, but in future exams, this would be completely unacceptable as work and would result in a minimum of a 20% grade deduction...\" then that would be a completely different story. But she did not do that. She actually did the opposite and complimented my work and performance for Exam 1, which can only lead one to the conclusion that way of submitting work is not only sufficient but \"excellent\", to be quoting her. \n\nI don't know if it is relevant, but she is a part-time community college professor. She has 10 years of teaching experience at various colleges, but I am not sure how much time she has been at this one. Please advise if I can get something done by complaining. If she doesn't want to grade Exam 2 according to the standard used for Exam 1, she should at least allow me to retake Exam 2, now that I know what the mystery standard is supposed to be.",

      "text": "Based on what you describe, there is no point in complaining. You have no evidence the professor did anything improper during her grading procedure. The fact that your first exam was perfect and the second exam results were far below your expectations does not matter. The conversation you need to have with your professor is around how to improve (i.e. what exactly was insufficient on your exam) and seek clarification of grading procedures (if you have questions).\n\n>I relaxed on Exam 3 and failed it because I knew one exam would be dropped\n\nNever do this ...",

Is taking off no points for partial work in one Exam and telling that they did an \"excellent\" job, and then for the second Exam randomly cutting two letter grades because of partial work, with no explanation as to why this was not done in Exam 1 part of ethical grading? I would have no problem with getting a C in the first Exam because of my work because at least I would have known what to expect.",

You\u2019re probably not alone. If it\u2019s a problem for many students maybe y\u2019all could go to the head of the department together (maybe AFTER y\u2019all email the prof with the grading concerns tho).",

This right here is where you describe the moment where you stopped taking responsibility for your own success, and left it in the hands of others.\n\nYou probably can't do anything to change the situation that you're in, but you can reflect on how it came to be, and determine whether or not you'll let it happen again.",
