I have cheated in every class in college. My mind was too preoccupied with wanting to finish school in 4 years, so I piled on classes every semester. I didnt study. I learned nothing. I would go into class with a game plan to cheat on exams. \n\nI majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me. \n\nI am typing this with embarrassment. I beg you to not cheat in college. I faked my way through everything. In 2 months I am starting a new job with a big company and I am so nervous. I don't have the knowledge to to the job, just the degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheating gets you no where in life. In the end, I only cheated myself.

But if you cheated on every class, then doing that for every single class (or at least relating to accounting) is very unlikely and pretty impressive. And it's also unlikely that you had someone in every class you took that was competent and allowed you to cheat off of them, without getting caught your entire undergrad career.
