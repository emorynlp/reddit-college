  "text": "Please read everything.\n\nMy biggest regret in life is cheating. I have cheated in every class in college. My mind was too preoccupied with wanting to finish school in 4 years, so I piled on classes every semester. I didnt study. I learned nothing. I would go into class with a game plan to cheat on exams. \n\nI majored in accounting, from my Accounting I class to the upper level bachelors classes, I cheated. I regret that so much. I have such little accounting knowledge. At work, my boss started asking me elementary accounting questions and I couldn't answer him. I was so embarrassed and I knew then that he regretted hiring me. \n\nI am typing this with embarrassment. I beg you to not cheat in college. I faked my way through everything. In 2 months I am starting a new job with a big company and I am so nervous. I don't have the knowledge to to the job, just the degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCheating gets you no where in life. In the end, I only cheated myself. ",

Not only did you get yourself in the situation, but you never stopped to think \"All this debt I'm accumulating, the years and years it's going to take to pay it off, I should at the very least TRY.\" I get that when we are 18 its most definitely \"I just want to get this shit done and start life\" but fuck man, when you were nearing the end at like 21 or 22 the thought should've been there. I'm sure just about no one feels bad for you, as they shouldn't, but good luck with the rest.\n\nEither stick around, lay low, and don't bring attention to yourself until you start learning your craft, or look for a new job.",

But if you cheated on every class, then doing that for every single class (or at least relating to accounting) is very unlikely and pretty impressive. And it's also unlikely that you had someone in every class you took that was competent and allowed you to cheat off of them, without getting caught your entire undergrad career. So the typical way to cheat would be in the scenario where you know at least 50-60% of the material for a test, but need that little boost that cheating gives to get you a B or A grade.\n\nDid you just know 0 percent of the knowledge? Or were you just looking at the material for the sole sake of cheating and somehow managed to cheat extremely well without any accomplices or test answers?",

You don\u2019t even need to read the questions on HW or quizzes or exams, just copy and paste and quickly select the answer without reading any part of it. Boom 100s on those.  I used common knowledge when making PPs on topics like supply and demand and just googled phrases and paragraphs and rephrased them into my own topics by using intricate wording and great visuals. Always got high grades.\n\nIn algebra and calculus I asked the professor if we could use our phones for calculating and he allowed it so I installed Mathway and the app shows you the work as well as the answer so I just copied that. Never learned advanced algebra or calculus like theorems and what not.\n\nFor other classes I found the exams online on Chegg and memorized answers beforehand (didn\u2019t take much work as I remember things easily for specific events like exams). Another successful grading class. \n\nI\u2019ve never cheated off of somebody because I can\u2019t rely on anybody else to know their shit so if I did it it was always me. I never got below a B in any class and finished with a gpa of around 3.57 which probably could\u2019ve done better if I tried. \n\nSome of it rubbed off on me but I nowhere near got the advanced learning I should\u2019ve gotten however I can say I now host a bachelors degree in it. I\u2019m doing my own thing and have a successful job and don\u2019t regret anything I did thus far. I\u2019ve cheated on a ton but I\u2019ve utilized real world skills and barely touched the school stuff but boy did the degree with my name on it help A TON.\n\n",
