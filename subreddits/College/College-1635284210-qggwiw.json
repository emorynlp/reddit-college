  "text": "I'm a freshman in college who is already so burnt out. I have so many classes and professors that expect so much of me and I don't know how I can stay on top of it all. And I don't mean to sound like a whinny freshman who just hasn't gotten used to college yet, I genuinely feel overwhelmed and like I am never going to catch up on anything. \n\nI met with my academic advisor today to plan out next semesters classes, and it literally gave me anxiety looking at all my courses I have to take. I don't know if I'll be able to do it.\n\nI guess I'm asking for advice, or even anyone else who can relate.",

      "text": "In my experience, the first year of college is the most tiring of them all. \nYou should list all the things (bigger and smaller ones) that gives you energy (e.g. going for a walk, listening to music) and things that absorb your energy (e.g. classes, to do's). \n\nYou should really balance them out. According to research it's better to have more things that gives you energy than to reduce the things that absorb it. \n\nBeware: the things that give you energy do NOT need to be useful. Otherwise they will absorb it again. \n\nIs short: prioritize down time. Make sure to relax enough.",

      "text": "It might seem like too much at first, but you have to come up with the strategy and plan out the bits which stresses you the most to resolve. Do it one by one and use your time wisely. Remember to take a good care of yourself, this might be an additional factor that might get you to see things more clearly. When i have a lot of things to do i firstly do what is urgent and important, then i move to things that are urgent but not as important, then i work up to things that are important and not urgent. Basic tactic that worked through the years. Try not to stress, but plan what you actually need to do.. Hope that helps somewhat.",

      "text": "Therapy if you can afford it. Get referred off campus by on campus mental health services if possible, or find a telehealth provider in your state. As for work:\n\n**You can't finish and do everything**\n\nLearn to skim, and accept when it's bedtime and school time is done. Prioritize assignments (what is most likely to come up in class, on the test, on an assignment etc). Start assignments early (for example, if you have a final paper due like 12/16 or something, pick the topic NOW and start gathering pdfs of articles over the next week), so you can do little pieces each week. SLEEP. Your brain doens't work if it's tired.",

I might\u2019ve broken down a little earlier today because I have an exam in less than a week and I\u2019m so unprepared ;-; literally everything is piling up no matter what I do. And maybe this is dramatic, but I feel like as soon as I feel somewhat situated, something ends up going wrong..\n\nAlso, a lot of people are like enjoy this year because it only gets harder\u2026 which does not give me much hope. Not sure if this\u2019ll help, but sometimes after crying or just panicking, I start laughing for no reason. It just feels so good to laugh the stress off. It\u2019s still there, but I feel a bit lighter after :) \n(so maybe look at something funny?)",
