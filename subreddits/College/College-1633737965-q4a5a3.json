  "title:": "How to deal with being your professor\u2019s favorite student?",
  "text": "There\u2019s maybe 15 people in my class, so the favoritism is obvious. I do participate more and probably pay attention more, but I also refrain from saying the answer a lot of the time because I don\u2019t want to be that person. But every single class, he compliments my intelligence and/or creativity while lecturing at least once. Most of the time he also compliments my clothing at the beginning of class. While lecturing, he also looks at me most of the time, probably to gauge how interested I am, but I can feel him forcing himself to look at other students. If he gave similar compliments to other students I would be okay with it, but I feel like it can be discouraging to my classmates. It\u2019s nice to be complimented, but sometimes I feel like it\u2019s borderline flirting and it\u2019s also just embarrassing. I\u2019m an older, non-traditional student who already feels odd about going to school with people in a completely different mindset than me, but I don\u2019t see myself having the courage to ask him to stop. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this?",

      "text": "The complementing the clothing is very unusual \u2026 I am one of those people who really dresses up wherever they go and my professors don\u2019t really acknowledge it because it would be awkward ( and I know I look good lol all my classmates have commented on it). Are you sure he is not flirting with you? I feel like professors do their best not to show favouritism, even in a small class. If it\u2019s this obvious it could be something more\u2026 especially if you feel embarrassed. The instincts never lie. I assume you are a female and he is a male, so I would say this sounds like flirting to me. I would honestly talk to a classmate who I can trust to make sure it\u2019s not just in my head and he is obviously flirting. Once it is confirmed If you are scared to confront him directly ( which is totally understandable) I would just try to be very brief and cold to get the message across. No small talk, nothing more than what you absolutely have to do in class, extremely professional.",

And 3) they know the system in your school.\n\nYou dont have to ask him to stop,  You can report it to other people who will intervene. (If you choose to do this).\n\n\nI HIGHLY recommend going this route, however reluctanct you are (although I understand and am not judging ) becasue the long term consequences to YOU for trying to ignore it and just move past is are really underestimated and can be a big deal.  \n\nAnd of course, these people are repeat offenders most of the time.",
