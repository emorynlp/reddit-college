  "text": "Hi ya'll,\nSo I'm graduating this December after 5 years and I couldn't be more excited about finally getting my Bachelor's degree! For me, I really struggled the last year or so with the idea I was a failure for not graduating in 4 years. I just want everyone who's in the same boat as I was that IT'S OKAY. Your emotions are valid, but I want you to know that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Maybe you took the minimum course load to work, maybe you had to learn how to study after not doing great in high-school, maybe you took a semester off for mental health. You are not behind on anything, you are absolutely on track. I hope thus posts helps y'all if you need it. Don't be discouraged, stay positive.\n\u2764",

It\u2019s a shame my folks weren\u2019t around to see it, but all my siblings were there and raising the roof for me as I limped across the stage.\n\nI\u2019m proud of the accomplishment, no matter how long it took, and damned proud of the honors I earned.\n\nGood luck to you.  Enjoy the time you\u2019ve given yourself.  Use it wisely.  No telling what you might accomplish in these extra months!",

I have set quite an ambitious double-degree goal before myself, am toying with a minor, and work two part time jobs to add up to full-time hours. My max credit load I can do (and still get good grades) is 12-credits, which is also the amount I need for full financial aid. I'm trying to get done in 5 before my financial aid runs out, but we'll just have to see. \ud83d\udc4d",

If I went straight to university or straight to being a full time student I would\u2019ve wasted more time and probably more money. \n\nDoing things at your own pace is so helpful.",
