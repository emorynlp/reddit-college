  "text": "I\u2019m having this issue where I take a shower and I come outside the bathroom into my room and I smell mildew. At first I thought it was my hair because I do put my hair in a wet bun and not let it dry properly but I throughly washed my hair with all types of treatments and when I went home for break, it didn\u2019t smell. Now I\u2019ve come back to school and taken a shower and that same smell is back. It\u2019s really gross and it\u2019s driving me insane. What do I do?",
