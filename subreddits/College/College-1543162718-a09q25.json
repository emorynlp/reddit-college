I used to never care if people cheated, but a classmate made a comment that sent me over the edge. I should mention I am nervous as hell this time of year because I need to maintain my GPA to stay eligible for classes. So I take my grades super seriously lately. \n\nBut there are a few people who blatantly cheat on everything and never learned a single thing all semester except how to say 'no comprendo' to every single question (I'm talking about a Spanish class) and then laugh about it with their group. Those guys also all have A's. \n\nOne guy mentioned to me that he bets I have a high grade if he can get a 90% for the class. I was instantly furious because my average is less than a 80 even though I bend over backwards for that class and need the B to stay in school. \n\nIs it normal for people to get discouraged like that? You freak out over this class yet someone else barely remembers they're in it and they are the one with the better grade. I'm really not sure how to feel or if I should bring it up with the professor.

The entire premise of \"snitches get stitches\" is horse shit.\n\nI would record them talking about their cheating and their methods and then go and report them.\n\nWhy?\n\nExample:  I remember working for a forensics firm early in my career.  I am a military veteran and I have a high work ethic and know from my training that if I did not operate to the best of my abilities that people could die.  I bring that with me to every job.\n\nI had to work with a guy, we'll call him 'Ruben' who would kiss ass and brown nose his way through the work day.  He was substandard in his work, but boy did he love going to the gym.  He was really great at time management:\n\nWhen to take his supplements, when to eat, when to hit the gym, and what to do at the gym for that day's training.\n\n'Ruben' was promoted to my level. Partly because the upper management loved his pillow talk (they had no boots on the ground) but mostly because he was ineffective at assisting clients, maintaining chain of custody on evidence, not causing spoliation of said evidence, and was just a shit head socially.\n\nAt first, since he was made my problem I would monitor him and then try to mentor him.  As I said, he had great time management skills - only great when they benefited him directly.  I tried to harness those skills to turn him into a bad ass forensic analyst.\n\n3 months in and I was able to prove through reporting and his time sheet that he was doing next to no work. I kept the coaching going and tried to encourage him, however I now babysat him.  Hourly.  He had racked up some hefty charges for the company for mishandling data and not doing the basic things like notifying customers of data was received.  (Note: at this point I think he was stuffing one of the upper management ladies.  I was undeterred as she had made a move on me while working with the RCMP a year prior [she was in my hotel room while I was out to dinner. I took a picture of her when my buddy and I got back. She said she wanted a cigarette, I told her to get out of my room.])\n\nAfter 6 months he was doing only what I assigned him and he was deeply hating me.  He reported up the chain and to HR that I was making work a hostile environment for him.  We had a meeting with myself, HR, and Ruben which also included my manager and the lady from upper mgmt that he was screwing.  I was told to back off.  I was also told that there would be an investigation and that the meeting would reconvene after that was complete.\n\nAs soon as we were back to our area, 'Ruben' turned to me and said \"Yeah, that's right. You don't get to tell me shit anymore. Have fun doing all the work, bitch.\"\n\nI set my phone to record (it was already in my lap) and spun my chair and said \"What did you just say?\"  and the dumbass repeated himself adding \"I have better things to do than the daily bullshit anyway. I can do what I want, just ask (upper mgmt he was screwing). So MERRR!\"\n\nHe always made that stupid sound effect to try and sound funny.  I just said \"Okay, Ruben.\"  Spun around, saved the recording and sent it to my work email and personal email and then saved that off to a hard drive.\n\nTwo weeks later the head of HR came all the way from NY to weigh in. I had brought all of my reporting (my work vs his work - the amount he had already cost the business, the audio, as well as the time entry records for both of us).\n\nI was interviewed alone a final time, and nothing felt better than ratting that sonofabitch out to the head of HR.  I showed her everything, wrote the timeline on the whiteboard for her, and explained in great detail how he was nothing but a slow burn on the business and was having a work affair to boot.\n\nPlaying the audio was icing on the cake.  HR's eyes were so wide I almost laughed out loud.  Almost.\n\nSince this was HR I don't know what else she had, however she did say that there was a specific complain about me (by guess who) of which I shared the RCMP pictures and story and my friend (who no longer worked there) was very willing to talk to her about it.  I was thanked and that was all I heard about it formally.\n\nIn a week, both of them were let go. The faces on them when they were escorted off the property by security were amazing.  And they totally blamed me. \n\nEspecially because of the nasty-grams they both sent me.  Awesome to read.\n\nSo please, if you know someone who is cheating - please rat them out.  You are not here to do someone else's work for them and earn them a grade, or a paycheck, or anything. You are here for you.  If they are cheating the system they are indeed cheating you as well.\n\nThink about it this way - these are the people who are going to be helping to run the country or taking care of their elders when the time comes. Do you want some lazy assholes around forcing YOU to have all the responsibility? \n\nOr do you want people that are going to do their fair share?\n\nRat out cheaters folks.

And you have every right to be furious.  A lot of the other comments here are playing the \"it'll bite them in the ass\" or \"you're in college to learn and grades don't matter\".  And in some respects that's true.  A person putting in the work will get more out of the experience.    But college isn't just a learning experience in today's society.  A college degree is the cost of entry into almost any full time job, whether you learned anything or not.  And when you get out of college, your prospective employers will absolutely look at your GPA and request your transcripts.  They will then judge your resume against the very people whom you're so frustrated with.  And before they even call you and talk to you to find out if you know anything, they will put your resume on the bottom of the pile.\n\nThey aren't doing that because they believe that GPA is the be all end all, but because when you're filtering thousands of applicants, you have to filter down somewhere.  And companies rightly-or-wrongly assume that an accredited University will have an honor code and enforce it to filter out cheats.   And so they may hire someone who doesn't know as much as you, but got the same degree, and had a better GPA, which companies are more or less forced to use as a surrogate for capability.   If you're lucky, they'll look at your course by course grades in your transcripts and realize you performed well in those classes, but if your classmates are cheating in general classes, they're probably cheating in major classes too, so they'll still look better on paper.   If you're unlucky, they'll hire them before even interviewing you.  They'll then get the on-the-job training that they need to do the job, and by the time the employer realizes the person is incompetent, they're either trained enough that they find something they can do anyways, or fire them and learn that your University graduates people that don't know anything.\n\nThe academic honor code is what ensures that your degree has value.  If cheating is rampant and obvious, you need to report it.  To your professors.  To your department chair.  To the ethics office.  Anonymously if possible, but with persistence if not.  If you allow the grades that you're judged against to be knowingly diluted with cheating and allow them to unlevel the playing field, you're hurting yourself as surely as they're hurting the integrity of your institution.  It may be hard to report people, particularly if they're friends, but academia is the ultimate situation in which you are judged against your peers, and like it or not, that judgement is predominantly based on grades.  So you really have to decide if their friendship is worth letting them get away with cheating that system.", "author": "GTStD", "created": 1543170382, "upvotes": 29}, "eag3ygc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a09q25/does_anyone_else_get_discouraged_when_people_who/eag3ygc/", "text": "My parents and I met with a professor on a college tour last year and guess what he brought up - cheating - and what a pervasive problem it is (he was in a STEM department).
