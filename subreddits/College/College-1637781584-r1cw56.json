I'm unsure what your specific situation is, but you may find this information on this website helpful: [https://naehcy.org/higher-education/](https://naehcy.org/higher-education/) They are experts navigating higher education issues for unaccompanied homeless youth.\n\nThey have an FAQ page that specifically concerns FAFSA here: [https://naehcy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fafsa-tips-uhy2017-18.Dec2017.pdf](https://naehcy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fafsa-tips-uhy2017-18.Dec2017.pdf)\n\nBest of luck in school. :)",
