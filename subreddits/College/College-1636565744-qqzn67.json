  "text": "Obviously, the level of difficulty should jump when you get to junior year. However, my community college is no joke. We do not get curves, if the class average is an F then too bad. \n\nI'm curious, for everyone who transferred. Which did you think was more challenging in general?\n\nAlso, if you miss class at my cc or miss assignments, you get royally fucked. Usually no make up work and you'll get docked points for missing class unless you have a legit documented reason.\n\nIf you went to/go to university exclusively, feel free to comment! But make a note that you only did/do uni!",

          "text": "Thanks for your reply, I'm majoring in accounting and the uni I'll transfer to has the big name accounting firms come to the campus and actively recruit. \n\nIn my first CC accounting class, my professor almost lost his mind and convinced 2/3rd of the class to drop it because they failed the first exam, and not just failed, but got like 2/15 right.\n\nI pulled off an A- in there and was the only one who could answer him when he asked the class a question. (Would've gotten an A but I bombed the second quiz, from there on out I did fantastic)\n\nIn my current class, my professor accidentally showed the scores of the class. I'm ranked #1 by far. I actually help classmates on the side who want a decent grade, are willing to work for it, but can't pick it up on their own. (only on HW, which our professor explicitly stated we are allowed to do) \n\nNot transferring to a prestigious school, but it doesn't matter as much for accounting as long as the firms come and recruit.\n\nI just don't want to go from everything making sense to \"wtf did I get myself into\" lol\n\nThank you for your reply.",

Usually (and this depends on major) the workload does increase and there just is an overall higher expectation that you know what you are doing.\n\nThe difficult part however is playing catch up if you need letters of recommendation and research experience.",

      "text": "College was easier for me with the smaller class sizes and the professors were there to actually teach instead of university where professors are paid to research \n\nGoing to university took a little bit to adjust to because of the 100+ people lectures. Also the disconnect with prof and TA. Where the prof usually only does lectures. And in my opinion, the labs with TA's really solidifies learning in the courses. \n\nThe material is the same tho, and honestly the hardest part is the difference of price of the courses between college and university.",

In fact, it grows. So by the time you go to big kid college, your ability to handle the material will have grown, and you shouldn\u2019t have an issue handling the university courses. \n\nAs a product of a CC, who then went on to be top 5% of my major, I\u2019d say there are sparse reasons not to attend a CC first.\n\nEdit: autocorrect doesn\u2019t like your/you\u2019re.",

      "text": "Depends heavily on the state. In MD all higher level state-run institutions have to meet the same pedagogical and general curriculum/coursework requirements for the most part. I did well in CC and found Uni to be easier because I was working in my field even before college and my Uni classes were 2/3 major-related. In fact, my professors at CC were more strict than at Uni but that's because they wanted to well-prepare us for transfer.\n\nYour mileage may vary, my CC was what you'd expect out of one but my Uni is a \"working professional\" school meaning most of us worked full-time, already in our respective careers, and very few were young, bright eyed freshmen out of high school. I graduated Uni in 2019 and even pre-COVID we had many options for hybrid, self-study-professor-led, and virtual classes; I never met my math teacher for Calc 3 or Algorithms as an example. CC degree was Computer Information Systems and Uni degree was Information Security & Assurance and honestly the degree was just to get the degree to get past HR resume scanners, in IT it's all about certs anyways unless you go gov.",
