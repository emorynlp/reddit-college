      "text": "I think the biggest thing is finding motivation. I'm a pre-medical student, but I really struggled with science at first. When I was a dual-enrollment high schooler, I got really awful grades in science and had basically given up. At that point I was telling myself that I was going to be an engineer, hate my job, and one day die marginally wealthy (by working class standards). I was a little more than aimless. I took a year to get a pharmacy technician certificate because I became interested in medicine, but didn't really believe I was smart enough for med school, so I figured I'd be an underdog sort of applicant for pharmacy school. Welp, turns out pharmacy isn't really my jam, but working as a pharmacy tech made me realize how's much I wanted to be a doctor. Despite my pretty rough grades, I came back into science with a goal in mind--to get into med school so I can have a kickass job. Half motivated by desire and half motivated by fear, I've maintained a 4.0 for two years taking nearly all STEM courses at a full load, and winning academic accolades along the way. I was also homeless for a good portion of that time, so I'm not really a privileged kid talking out my ass here. \n\nLong story short, figure out why you're doing this. Like, why are you in college? Do you want to learn about what you're studying? Is what you're studying now a prerequisite for something you really want to study? What makes you happy, and what are you willing to do to get it? College is really hard, especially if you want to do well, there needs to be something to keep you going. Missing as much school as you have, you should be asking questions about how your motivation for your field plays a role in your academic performance.\n\nP.S.: If any of this comes off as insensitive, I apologize, I sometimes face difficulties explaining what I'm thinking and use too direct of language. Know that there is no malintent on my end and I'm genuinely sympathetic to your situation, I've been there. School is hard and it's easy to get snowballed, but it can/will get better with some course-correction.",

Doctors take time to catch up to this level of wealth. Also, engineering makes more millionaires and billionaires than other careers. Our major is also harder than a lot of other premed undergraduate majors. \n\nI guess you can dislike the profession, though. All we do is fix the worlds problems and sometimes fix them at scale. ( if it isn\u2019t for some stress in some positions, our job statistician would be great)\n\n(In all reality, though, I have big respects for you. 4.0 in stem while being homeless part of the time and going mes school is hella impressive. All the best for your future)",

Engineering is very challenging, I'm in neuroscience now, but I still have contact with quite a few engineering majors--I do not envy the rigors of their degree. Nothing but respect for them/all engineers, but it's not for me.\n\nAnd thank you for the kind words!",

Idk how many folks would agree with me here, but from my personal experience of complete lack of motivation for school, dropping out is what gave me that boost I needed to go back. Most people are told to head straight to college without experiencing the real world. Drop out, get a job that has shit pay, and soon you'll be more motivated than ever to actually show up to class. Or maybe you'll find something that truly interests you and can make a career out of it. Just take some time to discover who you are and what you want out of life first.",

This triggers intrinsic motivation which feels borderline effortless ( basically aligning studying and conscientious fulfillment of your school work with your major whys ). Try this exercise - write 50-100 reasons why doing well in school would be a benefit to what you really care about ( you might have to write out or explore what you really care about ). Second thing - use meta cognition tools to help with both the deep work of studying as well as letting go and replacing negative and disempowering beliefs and feelings associated with academic performance. Research Hale Dwoskin ( Sedona Method - meta cognition tool for letting go and replacing mental feelings and beliefs ) and John Demartini PhD ( value based alignment and high performance).

A common symptom of many is feeling lethargic or unmotivated which a lot of people confuse with lazy. Or if you struggle with self-doubt, this might be a form of self-sabotage? I suggest first starting with making sure you are getting enough sleep and getting enough veggies in so you can have brain fuel but if you have anxiety and stuff it can be hard to rest so don\u2019t beat yourself up. But definitely make sure you are getting some brain fuel. Also, like others said, meet up with your professors. Not all will be understanding and willing to help, but others will. \n\nIf there are any academic success centers on your campus, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to pay a visit to them to work on goal-setting and motivation.",

      "text": "Clean you room so it\u2019s organized and you know what everything is and where everything is. Then organize your time and calendar and look at all your stuff no matter how painful it is. When I failing, I would hate to look at grades or even open my emails. Organize so you have a schedule of everything you can to and everything you need to do. Each hour of your day should be blocked out. \n\nThese first steps are just to give clarity on your life and organization. They also get you to start moving which is motivating or at least starts to turn the wheels, giving you momentum. Once these things are done, you can be proud of doing something no matter how little proud.\n\nOnce you start to feel clarity and build your self esteem, you shouldn\u2019t feel as lazy and you shouldn\u2019t skip class. Eat an apple or eat healthy or exercise, or get some damn sleep if you need to. Do something so you feel this clarity, but be careful to not just procrastinate your workload. I did that once and failed a class. \n\nNow the hard part is getting started. Start to attend your classes. Ideally you\u2019ll do this step earlier l, but if you haven\u2019t, do it now. Make a streak of unmissed lectures or something. Use a habit tracking or streak building app or build one if you need to (your a computer science student). You have to now do some of the damn assignments. I\u2019d probably do the easy ones, since the my are least daunting and you can start and finish them relatively quickly. This will build confidence and continue that spinning wheel of momentum. You also won\u2019t burn out or anything from an easy assignment. \n\nMake sure you are keeping track of your time and set reminders on your phone if you need to. Schedule your lunch breaks, study hours, hw breaks, and class times.\n\nIt\u2019s important to not burn out to quickly or do to much at once. Be disciplined to gradually increase workload and be consistent. CONSISTENCY IS KEY. \n\nReally just do this and if you fail try again but be more disciplined and more consistent. And if you fail, try again. Just keep persistent. You\u2019ll eventually find your groove again and get your Bs again or even As. Actively doing productive things with your time and continuing in the correct direction will pull you out of the rut of laziness. \n\nAnd remember that I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet but I could still help you.\n\ntl;dr: the answer is to just do it. You\u2019re capable of it but I\u2019ve been through this so I know how hard it is to get started. So the answer above basically says DISCIPLINE. So if you want step by step instructions, be disciplined and read the whole thing above.  \n\nAlso, if anyone was wondering, I have do watch Jordan Peterson",

If OP\u2019s University is a decent size, chances are it has some solutions to help reorient. \n\nTo list a few examples:\nAre you suffering with your mental health? Many Universities have on campus therapy options at a reduced rate. Quality will very, but mine was less than $20 a visit, and my therapist was phenomenal and really helped me work through some things. \n\nAre you struggling to adjust? See therapy above, but also maybe consider little things you aren\u2019t doing (a planner or digital calendar, routines to support your academic discipline, missing home life), and the solutions that you can make to alleviate these issues. Consider if you\u2019re academic, medical, or personal background qualifies you for case manager, accommodations, special advising, etc should you qualify and need it. \n\nIs motivation an issue? Consider finding a study group or a tutor. Most colleges offer free or reduced tutoring programs or school sanctioned study groups. \n\nDo you struggle to understand the material? Consider going to office hours, asking questions after class/email, see above regarding study groups and tutors, utilizing supplemental material within the textbook, finding YouTube videos that summarize topics. \n\nGoing to class is absolutely important to fixing this, but going to class is likely not the problem but rather a symptom of a deeper issue impacting performance. \n\nTo OP: Don\u2019t panic! It\u2019s good that you realize the hole you\u2019re in because you\u2019re still in a position to turn it around. I had a couple of semesters with a similar situation, and I really pushed myself to finish above a 3.0 for the semester. It\u2019s absolutely possible, but you can\u2019t take the time to think about if you\u2019re going to be committed. You have to start now. \n\nTL;DR - take the opportunity to figure out why you\u2019re not putting in effort and assess solutions. It\u2019s not to late to recover, but you have to be proactive in making changes now.",

Even if only one of them can meet with you and tell you that this is your current grade in the class, here are the key things you need to do, here are some resources you can use, it will save you a lot of time in planning out what needs to be done across all your courses. \n\nGood luck!",
