I'm a pre-medical student, but I really struggled with science at first. When I was a dual-enrollment high schooler, I got really awful grades in science and had basically given up. At that point I was telling myself that I was going to be an engineer, hate my job, and one day die marginally wealthy (by working class standards). I was a little more than aimless. I took a year to get a pharmacy technician certificate because I became interested in medicine, but didn't really believe I was smart enough for med school, so I figured I'd be an underdog sort of applicant for pharmacy school. Welp, turns out pharmacy isn't really my jam, but working as a pharmacy tech made me realize how's much I wanted to be a doctor. Despite my pretty rough grades, I came back into science with a goal in mind--to get into med school so I can have a kickass job. Half motivated by desire and half motivated by fear, I've maintained a 4.0 for two years taking nearly all STEM courses at a full load, and winning academic accolades along the way. I was also homeless for a good portion of that time, so I'm not really a privileged kid talking out my ass here. \n\nLong story short, figure out why you're doing this. Like, why are you in college? Do you want to learn about what you're studying? Is what you're studying now a prerequisite for something you really want to study? What makes you happy, and what are you willing to do to get it? College is really hard, especially if you want to do well, there needs to be something to keep you going. Missing as much school as you have, you should be asking questions about how your motivation for your field plays a role in your academic performance.\n\nP.S.: If any of this comes off as insensitive, I apologize, I sometimes face difficulties explaining what I'm thinking and use too direct of language. Know that there is no malintent on my end and I'm genuinely sympathetic to your situation, I've been there. School is hard and it's easy to get snowballed, but it can/will get better with some course-correction.", "author": "ItsReallyVega", "created": 1632228705, "upvotes": 1}, "hdp3g2w": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prvizj/guys_im_basically_failing_every_class_right_now/hdp3g2w/", "text": "If you ain't ready for school then drop out.

I\u2019m wondering if there are any mental or physical health issues going on? A common symptom of many is feeling lethargic or unmotivated which a lot of people confuse with lazy. Or if you struggle with self-doubt, this might be a form of self-sabotage? I suggest first starting with making sure you are getting enough sleep and getting enough veggies in so you can have brain fuel but if you have anxiety and stuff it can be hard to rest so don\u2019t beat yourself up. But definitely make sure you are getting some brain fuel. Also, like others said, meet up with your professors. Not all will be understanding and willing to help, but others will. \n\nIf there are any academic success centers on your campus, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to pay a visit to them to work on goal-setting and motivation.", "author": "strawberrysweetpea", "created": 1632182404, "upvotes": 10}, "hdnlcmr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prvizj/guys_im_basically_failing_every_class_right_now/hdnlcmr/", "text": "I live in the logical conclusion of being in your situation and not doing anything about it.

Then organize your time and calendar and look at all your stuff no matter how painful it is. When I failing, I would hate to look at grades or even open my emails. Organize so you have a schedule of everything you can to and everything you need to do. Each hour of your day should be blocked out. \n\nThese first steps are just to give clarity on your life and organization. They also get you to start moving which is motivating or at least starts to turn the wheels, giving you momentum. Once these things are done, you can be proud of doing something no matter how little proud.\n\nOnce you start to feel clarity and build your self esteem, you shouldn\u2019t feel as lazy and you shouldn\u2019t skip class. Eat an apple or eat healthy or exercise, or get some damn sleep if you need to. Do something so you feel this clarity, but be careful to not just procrastinate your workload. I did that once and failed a class. \n\nNow the hard part is getting started. Start to attend your classes. Ideally you\u2019ll do this step earlier l, but if you haven\u2019t, do it now. Make a streak of unmissed lectures or something. Use a habit tracking or streak building app or build one if you need to (your a computer science student). You have to now do some of the damn assignments. I\u2019d probably do the easy ones, since the my are least daunting and you can start and finish them relatively quickly. This will build confidence and continue that spinning wheel of momentum. You also won\u2019t burn out or anything from an easy assignment. \n\nMake sure you are keeping track of your time and set reminders on your phone if you need to. Schedule your lunch breaks, study hours, hw breaks, and class times.\n\nIt\u2019s important to not burn out to quickly or do to much at once. Be disciplined to gradually increase workload and be consistent. CONSISTENCY IS KEY. \n\nReally just do this and if you fail try again but be more disciplined and more consistent. And if you fail, try again. Just keep persistent. You\u2019ll eventually find your groove again and get your Bs again or even As. Actively doing productive things with your time and continuing in the correct direction will pull you out of the rut of laziness. \n\nAnd remember that I\u2019m just a random guy on the internet but I could still help you.\n\ntl;dr: the answer is to just do it. You\u2019re capable of it but I\u2019ve been through this so I know how hard it is to get started. So the answer above basically says DISCIPLINE.
