Backstory: I live with and share a room with two older siblings (27 & 30M) and one day out of the blue while I was using a pc we both shared, came and attacked me without warning due to anger issues. It was his (30m) a long time ago, he gave it to another brother of mine who gave it to me, so apparently it\u2019s still his. Declared I can\u2019t use it anymore because he wants to be mean, or just jealous of me in general. I have my own laptop but it\u2019s so damaged that it\u2019s just in video game terms -90% INT if you use it haha. I can go to the library, I just feel super depressed, I want to move out so I don\u2019t get attacked out of the blue and not worried that someone is going to reclaim a computer I have been using for 6 months, but cannot allocate the funds. Buying my own laptop would save me some time, but my money is extremely limited. I realize it\u2019s a part of adult life and bad things happen, so I would like advice on what I should do?", "author": "AspiraRules20", "created": 1632577813, "retrieved": 1632800305, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"he8tewh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv74il/extreme_depression/he8tewh/", "text": "I'd recommend contacting your schools student well being department (if it has one) to let them know about these issues. If these issues affect your grades negatively in future, they'll know there's  a legitimate reason why and can help you out. Maybe try getting a part-time job to cover the cost of the laptop and see if there are student loans that can help you move out into dorms?? Also, it might be wise to let the police know about the previous incident (especially if he seriously hurt you), since he might do it again.", "author": "Salamander3008", "created": 1632591429, "upvotes": 3}, "he8rsbt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv74il/extreme_depression/he8rsbt/", "text": "If you're going to buy one, buy a refurbished one.
