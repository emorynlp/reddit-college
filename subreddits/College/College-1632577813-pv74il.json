  "text": "My home environment is causing me extreme depression in that I literally can\u2019t work anywhere without feeling threatened. Backstory: I live with and share a room with two older siblings (27 & 30M) and one day out of the blue while I was using a pc we both shared, came and attacked me without warning due to anger issues. It was his (30m) a long time ago, he gave it to another brother of mine who gave it to me, so apparently it\u2019s still his. Declared I can\u2019t use it anymore because he wants to be mean, or just jealous of me in general. I have my own laptop but it\u2019s so damaged that it\u2019s just in video game terms -90% INT if you use it haha. I can go to the library, I just feel super depressed, I want to move out so I don\u2019t get attacked out of the blue and not worried that someone is going to reclaim a computer I have been using for 6 months, but cannot allocate the funds. Buying my own laptop would save me some time, but my money is extremely limited. I realize it\u2019s a part of adult life and bad things happen, so I would like advice on what I should do?",

      "text": "I'd recommend contacting your schools student well being department (if it has one) to let them know about these issues. If these issues affect your grades negatively in future, they'll know there's  a legitimate reason why and can help you out. Maybe try getting a part-time job to cover the cost of the laptop and see if there are student loans that can help you move out into dorms?? Also, it might be wise to let the police know about the previous incident (especially if he seriously hurt you), since he might do it again.",

          "text": "Yeah that sounds like a great option. We do have one, I haven\u2019t reached out to them but I\u2019ll give it a shot. It is affecting my grades, I used to have a convenient set up and got work done in a timely manner and I feel like I\u2019m struggling to get the simplest assignments done. I have to commute so I\u2019ll probably try and get a part time in my college since it\u2019s most likely better than one I can get like at a gas station or something. I realize I have to help myself because no one else will! Thanks for the insight.",
