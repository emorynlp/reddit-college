  "text": "i\u2019m 3rd year biology major + hoping to minor in history, and i\u2019ve had so many 1st and 2nd year bio requirements that i\u2019m behind on the history ones.\n\ni\u2019m in 3 third year bio courses (2 with a lab, 1 with a weekly seminar instead), 1 first year history course, and 3 third year history classes\n \ni\u2019ve outlined the dates and such in my planner/excel and it seems to be manageable for me (slightly less tests/assignments then last year actually, when i had 5 classes all w lab) so i\u2019m not planning on dropping anything. moreso just looking for advice from people who have successfully done something similar! thanks :)",

I kept a planner of everything and made sure to keep track of all of my classes every day. Make sure you find the time to rest and make it a priority so that you don\u2019t get overwhelmed and burn out quickly. You got this!",

You being in a good place mentally will always be more important than a grade. It\u2019s much better to feed into the laziness every once in a while than to burn out completely. Good luck I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do great!",
