  "text": "This happened in a language class where we were supposed to write about the differences in the use of public transport between the United States and the country where the target language is spoken. Half the assignment was discussing which modes of transportation are more or less common and where they're most often used. Totally fine. \n\nThe second half of the assignment was reading the country's national transit company's website and watching their COVID-specific informational/rule videos and reading a commuter blog FAQ about the new restrictions. \n\nNone of the information is anything radically different than the guidance we're getting from credible medical professionals in the United States, so there's no real \"cultural difference\"  learning goal involved in researching the other country's protocols. Besides, it's not like any of us can leave the country right now anyways, so whatever small bit of country-specific information we are getting about their situation is unlikely to be useful by the time we are allowed to travel there: these restrictions will have been significantly lifted or changed by then. \n\nAs a language instructor myself, I get that they're trying to make the assignment relevant and give us the vocabulary for our new situation, but I don't think professors understand that regardless of how lax or seriously they think their students are taking the pandemic, we're all sick (no pun intended) and tired of hearing and thinking about it constantly. I take my classes to bury my head away from the outside world, to hunker down alone in my apartment and immerse myself in the subjects I love, not to have to engage with faux-cheery soulless mask-wearing cartoons riding a train over and over again to get the gist of the material or to have to try to redefine everything I hate about moving about in the world right now into another language.\n\nIt's anxiety-inducing and shatters the last few shards of normalcy I've been able to hang onto. \n\nUnless you're teaching a Public Health Policy or Infectious Diseases course, please just stop.",

It did eventually grow on me (the environmental issues) but it wouldve been nice to be able to talk about those things because they're such a big issue at the moment.",

Sometimes having a wealth of knowledge pummeled into your brain CAN make a difference on how you think of things. You guys as students can come up with just as good theories as any scientist. Children are literally little scientists from the time they are toddlers, so those ideas always flow. Sometimes stepping back and realizing that just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you can think abstractly. So, don't ever think a question is a stupid question. You never know, it could be as simple as figuring out something that prevents the virus from hooking into the cells.  I know d-mannose does it for UTI strains of bacteria... Now I'm not biologist or virologist, but its a simple idea. You got this!",

Given the difficult and all-consuming nature of the \"real-world\" right now, every moment I can go without thinking about the pandemic is a hard-fought win. \n\nThere's already more than enough to cover in a world language class without adding this in an attempt to make the class more relevant. It's one thing to be studying engineering and your calculus class has engineering-focused problem sets that are real-world applicable, it's quite another to be bombarded out of nowhere with relatively tangential in-depth pandemic protocol in a world language class. \n\nCovering COVID in microbio or other science/health focused classes makes complete sense though, and I'm certainly not advocating missing out on the opportunity to teach students material in a new way incorporating COVID if it's going to benefit them long-term in their specific studies or future careers.",
