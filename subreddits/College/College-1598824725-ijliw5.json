Half the assignment was discussing which modes of transportation are more or less common and where they're most often used. Totally fine. \n\nThe second half of the assignment was reading the country's national transit company's website and watching their COVID-specific informational/rule videos and reading a commuter blog FAQ about the new restrictions. \n\nNone of the information is anything radically different than the guidance we're getting from credible medical professionals in the United States, so there's no real \"cultural difference\"  learning goal involved in researching the other country's protocols. Besides, it's not like any of us can leave the country right now anyways, so whatever small bit of country-specific information we are getting about their situation is unlikely to be useful by the time we are allowed to travel there: these restrictions will have been significantly lifted or changed by then. \n\nAs a language instructor myself, I get that they're trying to make the assignment relevant and give us the vocabulary for our new situation, but I don't think professors understand that regardless of how lax or seriously they think their students are taking the pandemic, we're all sick (no pun intended) and tired of hearing and thinking about it constantly. I take my classes to bury my head away from the outside world, to hunker down alone in my apartment and immerse myself in the subjects I love, not to have to engage with faux-cheery soulless mask-wearing cartoons riding a train over and over again to get the gist of the material or to have to try to redefine everything I hate about moving about in the world right now into another language.\n\nIt's anxiety-inducing and shatters the last few shards of normalcy I've been able to hang onto. \n\nUnless you're teaching a Public Health Policy or Infectious Diseases course, please just stop.", "author": "TheRoomWithNoNumbers", "created": 1598824725, "retrieved": 1632946791, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2225, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"g3jogat": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ijliw5/professors_please_for_the_love_of_everything_holy/g3jogat/", "text": "Whole-heartedly agree!
