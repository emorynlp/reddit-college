  "text": "I\u2019m currently a sophomore in college and I\u2019m taking courses related to the biological science major. However, after taking a few labs this semester I soon realized that I actually hate lab and I\u2019m not sure if I want to continue with my major. I\u2019ve thought about becoming a PA or optometrist, mainly because they sound like decent careers and the pay is pretty good for both. Honestly, my relatives recommended me to do either of those careers or just anything in the medical field (besides a doctor because I really don\u2019t want to get into med school). So I just decided to go with it since I had nothing else in mind, but I actually have no idea what I want to do.\n\nI just feel stuck and I\u2019m not really doing anything to figure out what I want to do because I\u2019m just so busy with school work. I haven\u2019t done any clinical work or volunteering in the past so I basically have no experience in the medical field. I\u2019ve never shadowed a PA or optometrist so I only have this general idea of what their work is like. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what my interests are because I think I have a false idea of what I like. This is mainly because my family has always suggested me to do something related to medicine so I haven\u2019t done anything to explore other options.  \n\nI\u2019ve taken a bunch of online career assessments in the past and they didn\u2019t help that much honestly. I\u2019m thinking about doing more research on the things that I might like but I haven\u2019t had any hands on experience in the workforce. So I\u2019m not even sure about the things that might interest me. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what I should do now and I\u2019m wondering if anyone could give me any advice. \n\n*Note: I also need to declare my major by the end of my sophomore year so I definitely need to make a decision as soon as possible.",
