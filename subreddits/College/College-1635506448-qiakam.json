  "text": "Someone I know (50m) is taking an introduction to photography class while doing remote classes for his first semester at community college.  Tonight he mentions that he\u2019s thinking of submitting nude self portraits for an assignment.  I told him that I think it\u2019s a bad idea for a few reasons. It\u2019s unnecessary and doesn\u2019t meet the assignment description and I don\u2019t think he can fairly appraise whether or not his classmates (who he has not met in person) are ok with seeing his penis. My opinion is that the consequences of submitting unsolicited nudes for a class assignment could be negative, while there is no bad side to not submitting nudes. I\u2019m not trying to stifle his artistic expression, but I think this  idea is in poor judgement. Am I being unreasonable?",

If he is in a class he has to do the assignments for class in the full knowledge you are in a class.",

I think the bigger question is does the student have conceptual reasons to create images of the nude body, and if so, does it need to be the student's own body?  If the intention has strong reasons for both of those decisions, then I'm not sure why they would be problematic.  I saw lots of representations of nude bodies from fellow peers when I was a student, and it wasn't weird unless somebody made it weird.  Most art programs require nude figure drawing, so I am unsure of how this is different, except that the nude is the student rather than a model.  One of the campus jobs students could be hired for was modeling for figure drawing, so I had to draw nude peers in class. It wasn't weird. I actually think discussing the definitions and cultural contexts for nudity, nakedness, and pornography are interesting conversations for upper-level undergrad classes, but maybe a little nuanced for an intro-level class.  If I was the student I would definitely ask the professor about submitting these images, and does the professor not talk to his students about their work ahead of critiques?\n\nEdit: For example, if this student submitted photos like Laura Aguilar to a landscape assignment, I would be excited to see such powerful work.  I show artists like Laura Aguilar to my own intro level courses.",

It would be one thing if he was some graduate student but he's literally in an intro course, highly doubt they're gonna go into that realm at all.",

      "text": "It's not unusual in art courses to use nude models for drawing classes but that's typically like that's typically like an in person class and that's usually a much higher level course than intro to drawing and most students have to sign a waiver or something saying they understand that they will be Studying human anatomy and trying to draw people people in the buff. I'm thinking for a virtual class if he submits a nude painting or whatever if it doesn't fit the assignment he would probably get kicked out of the course... Art classes are meant to encourage creativity but at the same time you have to be respectful of other people and yes you need to learn to draw human beings accurately things accurately but if you're not doing the actual assignment and just doing it to be provocative in an intro level cotrue level course you will probably get kicked out of the program the professor probably wouldn't be too happy about it. Once you get to higher level art classes and you start exploring how you can push the boundaries of art once you've learned the fundamentals are in the fundamentals then I think that might fall into a different category mind you what hes doing is probably highly inappropriate given the context you've given. So it probably a very bad idea for him to do that. Mind you I am not an art major I just have a couple friends who are studying art I'm an engineering major. So the context of my art education is like a history 3 course I had to take on art history and an intro to drawing class I took in high school because I wanted to be able to draw schematics relatively easily.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more helpful but I think there are a few comments from like graduate students that are studying or in a few professors they might be able to answer the question more effectively",

It was completely unnecessary, but I\u2019d imagine if we did that he would\u2019ve been uncomfortable too. \n\nAnyway, IMO it\u2019s a very very very bad idea. If he\u2019s seriously thinking about doing it, he should ask the professor so they can shut that down real quick.",

As an assignment, everyone in the class had to write a short story.  One student penned a very graphic story in which he raped and murdered a woman.  Not only was that a questionable decision, but the victim in his story was a real coed who was in the same class.  Needless to say, there was outrage and legal actions.  If memory serves correctly, he was expelled and banned from campus.   \n\nYour friend is about to do something similar.",
