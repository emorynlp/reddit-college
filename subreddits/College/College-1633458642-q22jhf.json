So a student whose capacity you don't know anything about is being punished because students in the past didn't succeed.\n\nIt's better if you're honest. If you don't want to correct 6 weeks worth of back log assignments, that's completely understandable. It's not reasonable that you single handedly pass judgement about a students ability to succeed in your class because others have failed in the past. A word of warning to the student should be sufficient (eg. \"the odds are statistically against you and if you fail it will hurt your GPA significantly\") but they should be able to make the choice themselves. Unless of course there is a legitimate reason (such as you not wanting a mountain of back log work).",

How many students have you taught in those years?\n\nLook, sticking an edit on here because you seem like you're defending OP and I'm not calling them a bad person or a delinquent student. I'm not suggesting punishing a student when I say I wouldn't let them into a course. It's about not giving them enough rope to hang themselves. I'll even concede I've known maybe two students who could have done it - that's two students in twelve years of teaching 300-500 students a year. I'm not willing to let people crash and burn on the off chance that they're the one in a thousand outlier. OP is in a jam, I can tell that, but they need to look for alternatives.\n\nI mean, from my own POV, if I actually went to my chair and said 'Can I let this student in six weeks into term?' he'd probably tell me I was delirious and to go home. It's just too much time. I'd do two weeks, maybe even three if the student was really convincing, but not six.",
