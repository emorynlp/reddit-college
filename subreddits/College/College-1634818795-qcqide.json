If you're thinking of moving/staying in a different country after you graduate, then you should just go to whatever country you think you'd like to move to. \n\nIf not, then I'd think that really any reputable school in the world should be fine and that you shouldn't worry too much about the \"style\" of curriculum.",

Probably should do some research on the states to see if you would rather go to school in the west coast, Rockies, south west, south, Midwest, NE, or East coast. After deliberating what kind of region you'd prefer I could give you some better advice",
