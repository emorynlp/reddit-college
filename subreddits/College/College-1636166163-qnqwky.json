  "text": "I'm a college student in the US. I'm really introverted and my only friends are my roommate and his friends, who are all international students. Their the only people I hangout with at college. I've been asked by multiple of them all on different occasions if I'm actually from here. I think it's kinda funny but I can never get them to explain what they mean.",

From your post I am guessing the answer is no, but if you are spending most of your time around other international students and separating yourself from the local population, I can see why they might think you are international.",

          "text": "I guess that makes sense, though they usually ask me that after we've known each other for a week or more, and I usually tell them where I'm from. It's more like a are you REALLY from here. Idk I don't get it, it dosent bother me I'm just curious.",
