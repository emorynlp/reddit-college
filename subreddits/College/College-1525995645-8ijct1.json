  "text": "**Academic**\n\n* Don't freak out if you don't immediately love your major when starting out. I majored in criminal justice and for the first two semesters I was really unsure of my choice. But I decided to stick it out, and I'm very glad I did. \n\n* However, if you REALLY don't like what you're studying, don't be afraid of change! Do some research, decide what's important to you, and TALK TO YOUR ADVISOR. \n\n* Seriously, talk to your advisor. They're there to help you. If you're worried about a class, or need a change, a good advisor will have your back.\n\n* Obviously you want to get good grades; that's a big part of college. BUT: Don't think it's the end of the world if you get a B-, or a C, or even a D in some cases. Take a breath. Calm down. You're not going to flunk out of college because of one bad grade. We've all had classes we struggle with (that was math and science for me). The important thing is that you try your best and don't let it take over your life.\n\n* If you are having trouble with a class, like you're just not getting the material and keep struggling, talk with the professor! Most of them are more than happy to help you out. Also look for tutoring programs. I used one to help pass statistics and it saved my grade.\n\n* While signing up for classes, if you know one of them is going to be more of a challenge, try to give yourself some breathing room. For instance, when I took statistics, I made sure all my other credits were criminal justice related because A) I knew that material well and B) they were more enjoyable. Spread out the misery, so to speak.\n\n* Don't skip class unless you actually HAVE to, not because you WANT to. I shudder thinking back on how many times I skipped and what it probably did to my grade. Some classes, especially first/second year ones, also count attendance towards your points.\n\n* I know the saying \"sleep is for the weak\" is popular, but don't take that to heart. Sleep is important. Putting off a project/studying for a test until the day before and pulling an all-nighter isn't going to turn out well.\n\n* However, if you DO have to pull an all-nighter, try to get at least some sleep. Some people can run on three or four hours, others need more. Listen to your body.\n\n**Dorm life**\n\nI lived in a dorm for the first two years of college before getting an apartment. Here's some tips:\n\n* Yes, ramen is cheap at first glance, but it's utter shit in terms of nutrition. It's also not as inexpensive as some people believe. A 10lb bag of rice, in the long run, will be much cheaper (and healthier!). Learn to use spices, even just basic ones. Here are some other cheap, relatively healthy foods and ideas:\n\n1) Eggs\n\n2) Fruits like bananas, oranges, etc\n\n3) Potatoes\n\n4) Frozen veggies\n\n5) For breakfast: Oatmeal, healthy cereal, etc\n\n6) Replace soda with tea, or even seltzer water if it's the fizz you miss. I've got a love affair with Safeway-brand orange seltzer now. Avoid energy drinks at all costs. They're 99% sugar and can wreck your body.\n\n7) Seriously, learn how to season. A little bit of spice goes a long way. Cayenne, paprika, thyme, and garlic powder are some of my go-tos.\n\n* Exercise. Even if it's just fifteen minutes a day walking, or a short jog, or doing a few reps of weights in your room. You feel 10x better and your body will thank you.\n\n* It's easier to keep your room clean by maintaining a regular chore schedule than trying to clean everything up at once. \n\n* FFS, wear shower shoes/sandals. Communal showers are gross. Chances are some nasty-ass dude probably jerked it in there that morning. \n\n* If you've got roommates, be respectful. My first roomie and I were total opposites in terms of hobbies and habits, but we got along just fine because we respected each other, did necessary chores, kept the room clean, and was aware of each others' sleeping/studying schedules. Basically, don't be a dick.\n\n* Try to be nice your RA's. I know some of them can be assholes (speaking from experience, I was one for a while) but they're just trying to do their jobs most of the time. Go to them if you've got an issue.\n\n* Don't totally rely on meal plans if that's a thing at your college. Mine, if used as the college intended, would only get you one meal a day. Learn to cook basic stuff and you'll save a ton of money in the long run.\n\n* Keep your goddamn music down, or wear headphones. Seriously.\n\n* It can be challenging, or even downright scary to try and meet new friends, but at least give it a shot. I'm extremely introverted and it took a while to start meeting people, but it was worth it. Don't just hole up in your room all day.\n\n**Work/school/social life**\n\n* Working while going to school can be a blessing and a curse. The income is great, but if you're taking 18 credits at the same time it sucks. If you can, try to find a job with flexible scheduling. University/college jobs are usually really good about this.\n\n* While it is possible to work full-time and go to school as well, it can SUCK at times. I did that this past year working midnight shift. There were a lot of days I was running off three hours of sleep. I also sacrificed any semblance of a social life. \n\n* The same guidelines above apply to internships. If you're having to bend over backwards and sacrifice your soul to make it work, you should ask yourself if it's worth it. \n\n* Sleep more than you study, study more than you party, and party as much as you can. It's a bit cliche, but it's true.\n\n* You need to have a day or two off now and again to decompress. I've met people who dedicated themselves solely to schoolwork pretty much 24/7 and it wrecked them by the end of the semester. Conversely, think of college like a job. Do the work and don't slack off. It's all about balance.\n\n* On the topic of parties: Be safe! Never leave your drink unattended. Have a sober driver, take an uber, walk, but under NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU GET BEHIND THE WHEEL WHILE INTOXICATED. The same applies to any other illicit substances. Intoxicated/impaired drivers are the scum of the earth. Try to have a sober friend with you if you're going somewhere unfamiliar, or with people you don't know well.\n\n* Have fun! College is supposed to be enjoyable. Don't torture yourself just because you think it's 100% about getting good grades.\n\n* Mental illness is a big issue in college. Don't ever hesitate to get help if you need it, even if you don't think it's a \"big deal\". You wouldn't just tough out a broken leg or bacterial meningitis; don't treat your brain the same way.",

          "text": "No worries! I didn't have a minor, but I'll help how I can.\n\nI'd say a good 80% of criminal justice majors I met wanted to work in law enforcement in one capacity or another. Mostly police officers, sheriffs deputies, border patrol, FBI, etc. A bachelor's degree looks good to departments if that's the sort of job you're looking for. Others wanted to get into the research field (this is where a master's would come in handy). \n\nIt really just depends on what you want as a career. And you're not limited to strictly law enforcement with a CJ degree. It shows potential employers that you can put in the work necessary to accomplish a long-term goal and keep at it. Also, criminal justice gives you a decent background in basic elements of the law, public administration, etc. \n\nWhat minor you choose (if you decide to have one) will depend on what you want to do for a career. It might also help to talk to potential employers and ask them what would help. IE: If you want to work as a criminal profiler, a minor in psychology would be beneficial. \n\nAnd congrats on going to college! It's a lot of work but definitely worth it. ",

I'd like to add a little to this as well, mostly concerning those that are trying to kill themselves over getting that perfect 4.0 GPA. Having good grades can be great, but make sure it doesn't negatively affect your whole college experience. College is a great opportunity to meet new friends, try different hobbies, and kind of just explore who you are as a person. There won't be a whole ton of time to do that in the future once you're working. ",

Don't force yourself to do something because other people say it's part of the experience or whatever, and don't feel bad if you don't do those things. There's no guarantee you're going to have an amazing experience (survivor bias). Aren't keen on having a roommate and/or sharing a bathroom with a whole floor of people? If you have other options, don't live in a dorm. Crowds and icebreaker games make you uncomfortable? You aren't missing out if you don't go, go do something you actually like instead, and you might meet friends that way. Of course, this doesn't apply to self-care, as you should try counseling/therapy even if it gives you anxiety to do so, and you should try to expand your horizons when possible. But don't feel like there's only one way to enjoy life that's applicable to everyone.",

I'm no expert, but according to all the experts sleep is when you both recover from the day and organize the information you have learned so you can recall it easier later. That is, sleep is part of the learning process! So, get your sleep! If you find yourself not having time to sleep that is an indication that you are doing something else wrong \\(scheduling your life, managing your time\\). ",

          "text": "Maybe it\u2019s just a coincidence, but the four advisors I\u2019ve had over my first year have all been good, and one of them was absolutely awesome. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s because I just got lucky or how I approached them, but here\u2019s what I did:\n\nMy school has this thing called a \u201cfour year plan\u201d (this may be way more common than I think, sorry) that\u2019s basically your plan for what courses to take over the semesters you have. In general, when I\u2019ve been presented with a dilemma, I\u2019ve already determined what my feasible options are and what each option means to the best of my knowledge. Since we have access to our course catalog and an outline of our degree audit at my school, when discussing what classes to take when and what major/minor/whatever to do, I already had most of what I knew about laid out. When I went to see my advisors, then, I would always be prepared with what I **could** do, and then I discuss what I **should** do with the people who have experiences helping people with those kinds of decisions.\n\nBy doing this, I leave the impression that I\u2019m organized, efficient, and respectful of their time (this last one is important because of how often I make an effort to actually see my advisors, if for no other reason than to give them updates on my semester or to ask about a general question). Now they like to see me, because they know that I\u2019m putting myself at the head of my own goals\u2014not them. And why should they be in charge of organizing my goals anyway? **They are my advisors\u2014not my secretaries.**\n\n Consider the opposite case, where you were supposed to meet with your advisor sometime before you register before classes, but you don\u2019t even acknowledge their existence until the day before registration. Having done no research prior, you\u2019re asking your advisor how everything works (which is usually easy to get a general sense of just by reading your course catalog), and you have no idea what you need or want to take next semester. This is bad, and your advisor is not going to like you for this. You are expecting them to solve all of your problems in their busiest period, and they cannot help you as much as you want them to because 50 other students are trying this exact same thing. Of course you\u2019re not going to hit it off when you\u2019re both in panic mode before the meeting and as a result of the meeting!\n\nMost people are probably somewhere in the middle here, but I think that too many people are on the bad side, leading to suboptimal relationships. Out of the four advisors I\u2019ve had this year, I know there\u2019s at least one that, if we didn\u2019t hit it off from the initial meeting (when I had everything together ahead of time), we wouldn\u2019t be getting along incredibly well. But coming prepared helped that relationship, and from what I\u2019ve heard, having a mentor in college is one of the most important aspects of your college experience. Still, some of my friends in the Honors Program have not even made a four-year plan. It\u2019s extra work, and sometimes a ton of it, but coming to those meetings prepared makes you look more like a competent adult who is (at least somewhat) in control of their life and less like a helpless kid who is still expecting people to hold their hand like it was in high school. If more people put in effort to give their advisors that good first impression, perhaps fewer people would complain about their advisors.",

At my school, everyone would have a metric ton of extra meal swipes at the end of the semester. Instead, look at the terms of your meal plan and do the math yourself.",

Obviously you want to do well, and a high GPA is good, but don't let that consume your whole identity. If you're going to stress out even more re-taking the class, it's time you reevaluate why you're going to college and how much it matters in the long run. ",

I really did try with that class, and was partially fucked over by my lab TA taking 15 points off the final project for me being sick when he said he wouldn't. But I think most of it was just having a horrible semester. I don't know what happened, but I could not get it together this Spring. ",

While GPA matters, if you can manage to grab things like research experience, TA experience, internships and tests like the SAT and GRE. Work toward strong LOR and perfect that SOP and your GPA should be one of the latest thing considered for grad school. \n\nOne bad semester do not destroy your chances at life, ",
