  "text": "I have never in my life done this good at school, but my goodness. I took 4 finals today and got an \u2018A\u2019 on every single one of them, potentially getting \u2018A\u2019s for the whole semester! This like the top of the world for me right now, but I can only imagine what it is like to graduate!!",

My first semester I found it hard to be motivated for what seemed to just be more school after high school, but this semester I realized that it\u2019s actually different than that. It is specialized school. Sure you have your typical reading and science classes everyone has to take, but it is especially for you because of what you are choosing to get your degree in.  So knowing that it was actually what I was going to do in the future and something I wanted to study really helped.\n\nAnother bi reason is because my dad called me out for never having straight \u2018A\u2019s like my sisters. That is no longer :)",
