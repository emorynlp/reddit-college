  "text": "It\u2019s like mood swings. I got here 3 months ago and I\u2019ve never been happy here. In fact miserable. \nIt\u2019s a maritime college (small school) so it\u2019s pretty boring. I heard from friends that seem to be having the time of their lives.\nI consider transferring but I don\u2019t know if I could bring myself to do it. My college of choice would be decided based on who I know that goes there, which I know you\u2019re not supposed to do. I can\u2019t help it, it would even be subconscious if I tried, I\u2019m sure.\nThat isn\u2019t even a problem if I can\u2019t find another major\u2026 I\u2019ve spent hours scrolling through many colleges websites looking at undergrad programs and nothing interests me.\nMy friend said he\u2019s doing computer science, so he can do contract work and not have to work that often. The ONLY reason I came to a maritime school was to work as little as possible. If you don\u2019t know a lot of the jobs are rotational\u2026 2weeks on/off. 6 months vacation sounds pretty nice right?\nBut why bother with all this school when I can just go straight to working on tugs. But what if I don\u2019t like it? Then I\u2019m fucked, no college degree, nothing.\nThe only thing that I\u2019m passionate about is music and art. But I would never major in that.\nThe only major that truly interests me is psychology/philosophy. I think about how the mind works all the time. I love dreams and psychedelic experiences. \nYet\u2026 if I did psychology, where would I do it? Also, what the fuck would I do afterwards? I can\u2019t name one psychology/philosophy job besides \u201cpsychologist\u201d which sounds boring and \u201cphilosophy teacher.\u201d\nFuck.\nEdit: I also took psychology in high school and it was one of my least favorite classes. Can\u2019t remember one thing I learned and fucked around the entire year. But I\u2019m really into how the mind works, it interests me just thinking about my current situation and why I\u2019m thinking the way I am.",
