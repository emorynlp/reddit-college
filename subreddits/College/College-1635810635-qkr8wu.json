And listening to your body can also help, I think. Knowing when you are tired and need to go to bed, knowing when you are hungry and need to eat, realizing if you\u2019ve been sitting down for too long and need to get up and move around.",

Also when I see people succeeding in something I desire to, it makes me wanna push harder cause that could be me. For example, if i want to go to my dream uni, i watch videos based on that (essays, stats etc..). I just suddenly feel a boost of motivation\n\nI feel like being unorganized contributes to being burned out, everything seems all over the place especially from my experience and u suddenly lack motivation. Use a promodoro timer, clean ur desk, create a list and get stuff done. Drink water and sleep well. Cant stress that enough. ( sorry bout the grammar,but those were some things that tend to work for me) if its ur mental health, take care of urself and don\u2019t take too much stress. Listening to calm music helps as well.\n\nHope it helps :))",
