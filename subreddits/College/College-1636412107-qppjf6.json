  "text": "My nephew is going to college next year.   We don't know where yet.\n\nIs there anything you guys didn't think about that it turns out you actually need or would find helpful? \n\nYes, I know the big answer is probably \"money\" - but I'd like to give him something else since I usually give him money for his birthday, graduation, etc.\n\nCould be dorm stuff, software, clothes, books, a subscription to something, something stress-reducing, something fun.... anything?",

      "text": "Have him pay attention to all the cooking supplis he uses in a month (or the supplies used by whoever cooks for him). Then buy those things. Thrift shops are great for plates, glassware, etc. \n\nGarbage bin for his room and bags is a must.\n\nDepending on climate, a standing fan, space heater, or both.\n\nMini fridge if you want to splurge. I share a house with 4 other people and the fridge is a disaster, super overfilled. \n\nLittle things - batteries, tape, scissors, tool box, light bulbs",

      "text": "some common dorm decor stuff is LED lights (i like the brand govee) or twinkle lights. Most guys I know also have some flavor of flag hung up in their rooms. (you could get him his school flag, SAFTB, his favorite sports team, whatever really) \n\nFor subscriptions, streaming services or food gift cards are always good- maybe even an uber or lyft card if he isn\u2019t bringing a car or drinks. \n\nClothes: if going to a cold or rainy state, rain jacket, thick socks, nice sweatshirt/hoodie, good gloves \n\nDestress: weighted blanket if he has anxiety \n\nTarget gift cards were one of the main things I got from my grad party, they were nice to have. There\u2019s always going to be something he forgets to bring or if there\u2019s something he wants to save for like an ipad. \n\nSide Bar: \nNot sure if you would want to give as a gift but have him bring basic medical stuff to keep in his dorm, bandaids, tylenol/ibeuprofen, liquid iv, dayquil, things like that. No one on my floor had it and everyone gets sicker than a dog freshmen year.",

Duct and painters tape. Dollar store stuff. \n\nBoot tray for Winter. \n\nContainers that fit in the shelf / closet / so on and didn't look ugly or fall apart. \n\nWouldn't hurt to offer to order something after he arrives, a small gift of whatever he's like oh wait. \n\nMy Mom made my baby sister a first aid kit when she moved out, all the basic meds, thermometer, heating pad. This is probably a great one, meds are expensive an no one wants to walk to get painkillers or anti nausea meds while sick. Have a nice container they can throw on a shelf.",
