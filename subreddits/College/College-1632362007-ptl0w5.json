      "text": "Gonna be real with you. In the US any college that's not private you'll be very hard pressed to get most forms of financial aid. State/public institutions end up having to reserve most of their aid to their respective states, so those are the UCs, GT, UIUC, etc. \n\nThough I guess if you're international then that applies to all schools in the US. Financial aid is very hard to come by if you're international. If you're not, fill out the FAFSA and apply to the best school in your state or any \"prestigious\" out of state private school since they're more likely to hand out need based aid.",
