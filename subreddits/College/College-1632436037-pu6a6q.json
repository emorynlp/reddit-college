  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a freshman in college and am applying to jobs in the area. I have a decent amount of work and volunteer experience, but I have a question. Is it weird to put that I was class president and graduated in top 10% of my class in high school? I wanted to show that I have leadership experience and I'm not an idiot but I also don't know if it's appropriate or relevant considering I've been out for two years now.\n\nThanks!",
