  "text": "I just came in here for some advice or maybe even encouragement\nI am currently in my second year of college and am taking Cal 1. I took PreCal the semester before and passed with a C. This semester I am having so much difficulty trying to understand what the concept is and how to do the problems. I was getting it until derivatives and Optimization. \nSo far I passed the first exam with a C and am trying to study the next one that is this Tuesday. \nI feel completely discouraged because I have never been so lost in class in my life. I feel like giving up, maybe even changing my major even though I enjoy the chemistry part of it. \nAnyways, does anyone have any advice or encouragement on what I can do to help myself understand these concepts better? \nIve been thinking about private tutoring\u2026\nAnyways Thanks.",
