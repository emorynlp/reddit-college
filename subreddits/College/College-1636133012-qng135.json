  "text": "we take several classes at one time with varying levels of difficulty. and having to attend all these classes on time and never being able to skip one without being threatened with a bad grade. there\u2019s also papers, projects, exams, presentations etc. we may also have a job, internship, sports, or family responsibilities as well. how about commuting? how about our mental health that we struggle with everyday? how about our personal relationships? how about when we get sick?\n\nwe are expected juggle so much all at once and some professors just don\u2019t understand. weren\u2019t they students once? \n\ni\u2019m tired of feeling bad for skipping part of assignments or asking for extensions. i\u2019m tired of feeling like a lazy procrastinator. i just can\u2019t do everything! and i can\u2019t put out my best A quality work at all times. i just can\u2019t and it\u2019s not because i don\u2019t want to it\u2019s because i\u2019m literally just a human being and i\u2019m burned out. \n\ni\u2019m mentally overwhelmed and i\u2019m sick of feeling like a failure.",
