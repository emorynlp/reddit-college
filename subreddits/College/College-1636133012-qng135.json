  "text": "we take several classes at one time with varying levels of difficulty. and having to attend all these classes on time and never being able to skip one without being threatened with a bad grade. there\u2019s also papers, projects, exams, presentations etc. we may also have a job, internship, sports, or family responsibilities as well. how about commuting? how about our mental health that we struggle with everyday? how about our personal relationships? how about when we get sick?\n\nwe are expected juggle so much all at once and some professors just don\u2019t understand. weren\u2019t they students once? \n\ni\u2019m tired of feeling bad for skipping part of assignments or asking for extensions. i\u2019m tired of feeling like a lazy procrastinator. i just can\u2019t do everything! and i can\u2019t put out my best A quality work at all times. i just can\u2019t and it\u2019s not because i don\u2019t want to it\u2019s because i\u2019m literally just a human being and i\u2019m burned out. \n\ni\u2019m mentally overwhelmed and i\u2019m sick of feeling like a failure.",

A nurse can\u2019t delay meds because they\u2019re overwhelmed and busy it could be life threatening to delay someone\u2019s medication. \n\nMental health is important and you need to focus on yourself but you also need to have good time management to keep deadlines on time. If you have good time management and you\u2019re still struggling you need to lessen your workload, such as taking less classes next semester or give something else up",

OP, you are NOT alone here. it's tough. i just started college and i feel so bad because its so overwhelming and it feels like everyone else has their stuff together. there's a lot of things to juggle, and procrastination is our #1 enemy. it's not wrong to want to just relax and be with friends, and do what we are passionate about. u have the right to rant and vent. a big thing is time management and disciplining ourselves so that we can learn from these hard experiences and push ourselves to keep going (trust me, im working on it). it sucks, it's tough, but sometimes we gotta remind ourselves of what we're working towards, and how we can make these negative experiences positive by using it as a way for us to both grow and look back on. it won't be easy for things to get better. but things can and will. you are not a failure for struggling or feeling overwhelmed. be kind to yourself, remember that you made it this far, and its okay. do what u can everyday. try do a lil more each time. you will hear criticism from others, and you will face the harsh truth that this is what we're going to have to deal with because of what we will be expected to do in the workforce. but it will be okay. as cheesy as it sounds, it will be, like it was for the millions of others who also struggled in college but got thru it.",

Is that time spent consistently or in short bursts? Are you using efficient study methods and staying focused?\n\n\nMy guess is you could make improvements somewhere that would make your classes much more manageable. If you're an electrical engineering major taking 24 credit hours a semester, you're just always going to be behind and it'll be less about time management and more about prioritizing high-yeild material. Assuming you have a more reasonable workload, its very likely that you are not studying consistently enough, getting distracted too often, or using inefficient study methods.",
