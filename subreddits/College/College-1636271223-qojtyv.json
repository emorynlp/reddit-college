  "title:": "Nightmares about failing college - 9 years after graduating",
  "text": "For a couple years now, I've had a recurring dream (nightmare?) that I was in my last quarter of college and am in jeopardy of failing one of my last classes and thus not obtaining my degree. I've been graduated now for 9 years with a BS in Accounting and have had 3 successful professional jobs since. What could be the reason for these dreams? Can anyone else relate?",

He told me he had this dream intermittently (much less frequently as time went on) for about 10 or 15 years after he graduated, but that it did eventually stop, and that he thought it was a sign that he was stressed about something else when he did have it.",

      "text": "Complete armchair psychology here, but maybe it's just some of your past anxieties resurfacing? Students spend a huge amount of time and effort worrying about these sorts of things, and maybe some of those feelings and anxieties remain bottled up even after you've moved on with your life. Maybe something that happened to you recently subconsciously triggered those anxieties and it presented itself in the form of a nightmare?",
