      "text": "Education programs (that your teachers were likely in) typically require more content area classes than prospective teachers expect. Many teachers to be start an education degree program expecting to take a lot of classes on how to teach, and those are usually on the easier side but a lot of papers, instead they come to find out they actually have to take college level chemistry or calculus 3, etc. in order to teach their desired subject area. \n\nTeachers to be expect to just retake high school level classes, as that\u2019s what they want to teach. Instead, they are (rightfully) required to take higher level classes as you need to be proficient in the entire subject area, and you must know more beyond what you\u2019re teaching in order to be a successful teacher. This tends to surprise and challenge a lot of teachers. Most teachers weren\u2019t A+ students in high school. They tend to work a bit harder than average and get Bs. Most people become teachers not because school was easy for them, but because it was a good challenge or too challenging and they want to provide better education than they got.\n\nIn short, your teachers are likely talking about their own experience, not the general college experience.  \n\nAlso, grade inflation has become more and more prevalent in the last 10+ years, so in some senses, college grading may be a tad easier now than it was when your teacher went to college.",
