  "text": "I\u2019m taking Calc 2, Physics 1, and a computer science class now. I am also in the military and may need to take time off for college if I get activated. Will be gone for around a year at most. So how long do credits last for? Do I have to retake any classes if I am gone from school that long? And I have to take Linear Algebra after Calc 2. Let\u2019s say I finish Calc 2 this semester and I don\u2019t take Linear Algebra next semester right away instead I wait a few semesters. If Calc 2 credit still counts I should be good to take Linear Algebra?",

Upon activation you get many perks that can hold your position. \n\nIn the civilian world, they last 8 years. \n\nI am military, too. Took time off college to go through basic and AIT and am in reserves. I also am in my 6th year as I decided to take a year off, come back part time, and am here full time now. \n\nI KNOW the 8 year, but military may offer the added perk of deployment forgiveness like they do with jobs.",
