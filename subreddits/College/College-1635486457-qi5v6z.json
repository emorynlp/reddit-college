  "title:": "High School Senior w/ choosing major struggles",
  "text": "I'm sure everyone here had these sorts of thoughts and talked with a counselor or parents but I'm the idiot who went to reddit!! Awesome.  \n\n\nJust as it says on the tin. I'm a high school senior with a shitty GPA. I had a complete mental shutdown during COVID, but that's not the point. I'm also Filipino, which means I have pressure to do nursing. I get it's a secure job that provides a lot of good money and flexibility in career. With one degree I could do ten different jobs, not to mention the fact that I'll always have a job since people will never stop getting sick. There's also the fact that when I leave the hospital/clinic, I don't have to be a nurse at home. But I kind of hate the idea of working in a hospital and am not very passionate about science or healthcare. Good benefits, sure, but something that will always stick with me when I asked for advice from my counselor is \"If you don't love nursing now, you won't love it in the future\" and... yeah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, teaching is my passion. That feeling when you're explaining something to someone and they finally get it is the most satisfying thing in the world to me. I'm not the best student on paper, but some people tell me I explain concepts better than our teachers have. I love history too, even if it wasn't my best subject in these past years. It's so white-washed though and I think as a POC it'd be really valuable to teach other POC that it's not all about white folk beating slaves :) But teaching is not that great benefit wise. Money security, getting a job, the treatment, the fact that teaching will probably never evolve, that teaching follows you home with grading and lesson plans.... I could keep going. Not to mention all of this talk of a history degree not being very useful beyond teaching....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's always being a nursing teacher or something as the middle ground I guess. My mom told me I'd love nursing the second I entered in but I'm honestly kind of hesitant? Not sure why, I think it's just because I've never felt passionate about it. I take a nursing elective class in school and... It's fine? I like my teacher and the material is sometimes fun but I'm just not engaged the same way I am when I'm sitting in Econ. Reddit, please help me out :) I'm stressed and pressed and I know I can always change but yeah. Thank you if you read all of this, you're so awesome and I hope you have a good day <3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Nursing vs History as a major, nursing vs teaching as a career choice. Discuss.",

Teaching is pretty bad pay wise unless you teach at a college level, but that requires a masters minimum. If you think you\u2019ll enjoy it, it could be worse",
