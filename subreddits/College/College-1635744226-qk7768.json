  "text": "University student doing a double degree in Business and Economics. Currently, doing an internship that is full time which ends in December. School is currently all online right now which helps GREATLY in juggling a full-time internship. But now, in December I will be working another full time job(have to because of bills, rent etc etc ya know) but only this time most of my classes are in person. I don\u2019t know yet if my new employer is going to be flexible with my student schedule to accommodate for tests, exams, etc and I\u2019m scared to ask fearing they\u2019ll drop me. HELP!!! Any advice?",
