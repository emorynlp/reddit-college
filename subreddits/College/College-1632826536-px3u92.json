However one of my dream schools I want to transfer to has mentioned on their website that they are working with PTK on scholarships for transfer students, exactly what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m in my first year ( got invited based on my summer grades) and I know I won\u2019t be able to be very active this year due to covid and settling in. Should I join now, or wait until I can be an active part of the organisation? Anyone who joined and transferred, did it help with your transfer?

They sent out letters asking you to join once you had the required number of credits. I ended up getting an academic transfer scholarship because of it that covers half my tuition.
