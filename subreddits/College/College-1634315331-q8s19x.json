Without mortgages for example most people would not be able to afford a home until their 60s. If you ever buy a car you will probably end up with at least $10-15k of debt.\n\n You are investing in your education, and the risk that comes with taking on debt is something you will have to consider. Just remember that people take on student loans, graduate, and pay them off all the time. That is the norm. The horror stories are scary but *that doesn't have to be you.*",

Also, it's not as easy as just \"not slacking off\". I'm a hardworking student, and my grades have always been consistent. My 2nd year (the height of COVID) was the worst for me academically which is why my GPA tanked.",

Loans are not the worst option, especially if you qualify for subsidized loans from the government. If you take out a loan now, you can get a job while you're in school and then start chipping away and paying the loans off now. \n\nAlternatively, you can try and transfer to a less expensive college or a community college, but you may still have to take out loans, so review their financial aid package carefully. There are also sometimes scholarships at individual schools that are made for transfer students. \n\nI would look for something low time commitment because you really need to dedicate time to your schoolwork. If you can find a job where a lot of the time you are sitting at a desk, you can bring study materials with you and study when it isn't busy.",
