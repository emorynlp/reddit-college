Just remember that people take on student loans, graduate, and pay them off all the time. That is the norm. The horror stories are scary but *that doesn't have to be you.*",

Talk to people in whatever careers you might be interested in and then start over and pick a major that you won\u2019t screw up in.\n\nSry for the bluntness but you\u2019re biting the hand that wanted to feed you and to me that makes you sound entitled.",

Loans are not the worst option, especially if you qualify for subsidized loans from the government. If you take out a loan now, you can get a job while you're in school and then start chipping away and paying the loans off now. \n\nAlternatively, you can try and transfer to a less expensive college or a community college, but you may still have to take out loans, so review their financial aid package carefully. There are also sometimes scholarships at individual schools that are made for transfer students. \n\nI would look for something low time commitment because you really need to dedicate time to your schoolwork. If you can find a job where a lot of the time you are sitting at a desk, you can bring study materials with you and study when it isn't busy.",

Usually those open in December but your financial aid office may have more specific advisement?\n\nAlso, is it possible for you to have your scholarship reinstated or appealed?\n\nLast question, have you looked into financial support for summer courses? My school basically covers 1.5 to 2 summer courses for Pell students.  I find this can be invaluable to raising GPA or meeting unit requirements for reinstatement especially if the cost is close to free.  I know this might be helpful today, but it avoiding issues tomorrow is good too.\n\nFinal suggestion, get your FAFSA done early.

I'm about $60k in debt now and I've got no idea how others are getting even half their tuition paid through scholarships, let alone getting full rides. I apply again and again to different scholarships and never get a single one. The only one I've gotten (the academic performance one), was one that I didn't even apply for.",
