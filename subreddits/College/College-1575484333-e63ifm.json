I don\u2019t really have any friends on campus, and the ones I do are more like acquaintances that I feel uncomfortable around/don\u2019t have much in common with. Most seemed to have already established a group of friends anyway. I feel pretty alone in college and I feel guilty when I do nothing but sit in my dorm/study a bit/watch YouTube all day. I wouldn\u2019t say I have social anxiety but I\u2019m naturally very anxious and get nervous when making friends. I had a group of friends in high school, I didn\u2019t party or anything really and I still don\u2019t so I just feel like I\u2019m missing out on something. Is there something wrong with me? Am I ugly? Lol. Just wondering if anyone relates. I\u2019m feeling pretty lonely today.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a sophomore! Also, this doesn\u2019t apply to just finals week (just using it as an example). I go home almost every weekend bc I do nothing haha\n\nTo those who rushed... is recruitment terrible?? I would be rushing alone and my school is kind of small so I don\u2019t know if I would be comfortable doing that. I tend to ball up when I don\u2019t have someone as a clutch in social situations so lol\n\nAlso... maybe I should\u2019ve reworded this. It\u2019s more of an everyday thing. When I\u2019m not in classes, I don\u2019t have friends to spend time with. Luckily I have a SO, but they\u2019re preoccupied with other things (working/school/video games) and I don\u2019t feel comfortable pressuring them to spend time with me 24/7. But yeah, while I feel a little less lonely having them- I have nobody outside of them. I talk to my friends back home but that\u2019s about it, nobody here on campus.", "author": null, "created": 1575484333, "retrieved": 1632802630, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 754, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fafp092": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e63ifm/is_it_normal_to_do_nothing_on_the_weekends/fafp092/", "text": "Sorry that this is late (in Reddit terms).\n\nI am a junior and I felt this way freshman year and sophomore year too, to an extent. Part of it was that I just hadn\u2019t met anyone that I really vibed with.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to just not pass up on opportunities to meet new people. It doesn\u2019t have to be at a party or drinking or smoking or whatever (I don\u2019t like those things either). It can be a club, working out, eating together, going to an event, studying, anything. I met a lot of people by just tagging along with friends places and getting to know the people they knew (or met).\n\nI know it can be tempting to go home when you don\u2019t have anything to do, but ultimately that will just make it harder to \u201cput down roots\u201d and really get to know people.\n\nOf course, I give this advice under the assumption that you don\u2019t feel very content doing things as you are now (which seems to be the case?).\n\nAlso, know that not everyone else out there is having a great time, partying every night, drinking, smoking all the time, etc. It\u2019s normal to have boring days and nights.

I managed to befriend my roommates, which one of them happens to be my cousin, but it seems futile at this point. She pretty much equated befriending the roommates to being less of a friend to her own family member who she grew up with. It was a rude awakening to my start of college. \n\nI feel that making acquaintances with the person you sit next to class is the best bet. I usually go for the shyer people because they're more approachable, and from there, I invite them to have study sessions or go eat with me. It is not to say that suddenly your weekend will be filled with wondrous activities, but at it's a small step to having relationships on campus. \n\nNote: I am an introvert at heart, so I don't mind being alone, but I do understand the desire for some kind of relationship a person you can see consistently without coming off as overbearing. I think the greatest benefit this experience is giving you is the sense of true loneliness so that you can be defined in yourself without having to rely on others for fulfillment LOL.

None of my school friends joined the college i was in. I was commuting from home to college and there were these guys in my class who had formed a group in like 2-3 days. They would talk and eat together and the guys and girls would flirt with each other and i would sit alone and eat my lunch and it's not like they excluded me, in fact they would insist that i sit with them but after 1 or 2 times with them, i realised i won't fit, like the things they used to talk about, i couldn't relate and couldn't contribute much to the conversation and after some time i would feel like that even if i am sitting with them they're mostly talking with each other and i was there like smiling and faking laughs to things i had not much idea about and they wouldn't care anyway. So i started drifting apart and eating alone again. Weekends were spent on internet or studying alone. Going home was kind of relieving as there were some senior guys from my school that i used to go home with and they were super chill and fun.\n   Then after the first sem, i started playing pubg with some of my classmates and we played a lot, talked absolute non sense and kind of formed a group,we were 4 guys and we started sitting together in class and 2 girls also joined us later as they sit beside us( I longed for some female interaction) and it's a nice little group, we eat together during lunch and sometimes we bunk classes and go out to KFC and McD or some other place to hangout (we don't sacrifice important classes though as all of us are grade conscious) everything's going fine now... \nSo yeah try to find guys who 'suck the least' (from your perspective) and try to have fun and don't try too hard. if they make you too much unrelaxed then you know better.", "author": "trexyuzi", "created": 1575559023, "upvotes": 2}, "f9q0l8r": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e63ifm/is_it_normal_to_do_nothing_on_the_weekends/f9q0l8r/", "text": "Many people go through this in their lives, not just college students away from home.
