  "text": "Well... it\u2019s currently finals week (not the weekend yet), and I don\u2019t have any finals today or tomorrow. I don\u2019t really have any friends on campus, and the ones I do are more like acquaintances that I feel uncomfortable around/don\u2019t have much in common with. Most seemed to have already established a group of friends anyway. I feel pretty alone in college and I feel guilty when I do nothing but sit in my dorm/study a bit/watch YouTube all day. I wouldn\u2019t say I have social anxiety but I\u2019m naturally very anxious and get nervous when making friends. I had a group of friends in high school, I didn\u2019t party or anything really and I still don\u2019t so I just feel like I\u2019m missing out on something. Is there something wrong with me? Am I ugly? Lol. Just wondering if anyone relates. I\u2019m feeling pretty lonely today.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m a sophomore! Also, this doesn\u2019t apply to just finals week (just using it as an example). I go home almost every weekend bc I do nothing haha\n\nTo those who rushed... is recruitment terrible?? I would be rushing alone and my school is kind of small so I don\u2019t know if I would be comfortable doing that. I tend to ball up when I don\u2019t have someone as a clutch in social situations so lol\n\nAlso... maybe I should\u2019ve reworded this. It\u2019s more of an everyday thing. When I\u2019m not in classes, I don\u2019t have friends to spend time with. Luckily I have a SO, but they\u2019re preoccupied with other things (working/school/video games) and I don\u2019t feel comfortable pressuring them to spend time with me 24/7. But yeah, while I feel a little less lonely having them- I have nobody outside of them. I talk to my friends back home but that\u2019s about it, nobody here on campus.",

      "text": "Sorry that this is late (in Reddit terms).\n\nI am a junior and I felt this way freshman year and sophomore year too, to an extent. Part of it was that I just hadn\u2019t met anyone that I really vibed with.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to just not pass up on opportunities to meet new people. It doesn\u2019t have to be at a party or drinking or smoking or whatever (I don\u2019t like those things either). It can be a club, working out, eating together, going to an event, studying, anything. I met a lot of people by just tagging along with friends places and getting to know the people they knew (or met).\n\nI know it can be tempting to go home when you don\u2019t have anything to do, but ultimately that will just make it harder to \u201cput down roots\u201d and really get to know people.\n\nOf course, I give this advice under the assumption that you don\u2019t feel very content doing things as you are now (which seems to be the case?).\n\nAlso, know that not everyone else out there is having a great time, partying every night, drinking, smoking all the time, etc. It\u2019s normal to have boring days and nights. But I get that it\u2019s no fun when all your days seem like that!\n\nI\u2019d also be happy to chat",

      "text": "I am a freshmen approaching finals week as well, and holy crap, talk about college being lonely. I managed to befriend my roommates, which one of them happens to be my cousin, but it seems futile at this point. She pretty much equated befriending the roommates to being less of a friend to her own family member who she grew up with. It was a rude awakening to my start of college. \n\nI feel that making acquaintances with the person you sit next to class is the best bet. I usually go for the shyer people because they're more approachable, and from there, I invite them to have study sessions or go eat with me. It is not to say that suddenly your weekend will be filled with wondrous activities, but at it's a small step to having relationships on campus. \n\nNote: I am an introvert at heart, so I don't mind being alone, but I do understand the desire for some kind of relationship a person you can see consistently without coming off as overbearing. I think the greatest benefit this experience is giving you is the sense of true loneliness so that you can be defined in yourself without having to rely on others for fulfillment LOL. I SOUND LIKE CONFUCIOUS BYE",

      "text": "I felt like this on my first year in college. None of my school friends joined the college i was in. I was commuting from home to college and there were these guys in my class who had formed a group in like 2-3 days. They would talk and eat together and the guys and girls would flirt with each other and i would sit alone and eat my lunch and it's not like they excluded me, in fact they would insist that i sit with them but after 1 or 2 times with them, i realised i won't fit, like the things they used to talk about, i couldn't relate and couldn't contribute much to the conversation and after some time i would feel like that even if i am sitting with them they're mostly talking with each other and i was there like smiling and faking laughs to things i had not much idea about and they wouldn't care anyway. So i started drifting apart and eating alone again. Weekends were spent on internet or studying alone. Going home was kind of relieving as there were some senior guys from my school that i used to go home with and they were super chill and fun.\n   Then after the first sem, i started playing pubg with some of my classmates and we played a lot, talked absolute non sense and kind of formed a group,we were 4 guys and we started sitting together in class and 2 girls also joined us later as they sit beside us( I longed for some female interaction) and it's a nice little group, we eat together during lunch and sometimes we bunk classes and go out to KFC and McD or some other place to hangout (we don't sacrifice important classes though as all of us are grade conscious) everything's going fine now... \nSo yeah try to find guys who 'suck the least' (from your perspective) and try to have fun and don't try too hard. if they make you too much unrelaxed then you know better.",

I was also going to mention exploring the community and finding new interests. \n\nI've been feeling like this for awhile. My solution was to enroll in college. In January I start classes.

And until then no one will know you aren\u2019t going out so it doesn\u2019t matter. Spend time with yourself, be your own best friend, and just learn to enjoy your own company.

So whenever I'm home alone for a weekend and want to do something but don't want to make friends, I try to think of things I've always wanted to try, or things that I romanticize doing in my head but never have the time for, that are best done alone (like going to a park to run, curling up under a blanket with a warm drink, Christmas lights and a good book, having a phat dance party, drinking a beer under the stars, etc.). I try to shift my mindset to get excited about time alone instead of depressed by it.",

Once that starts you can look into spring semester club activities, getting a part time weekend job, or finding on pr off-campus activities where you can socialize and meet new people. Indulge in a hobby. Be yourself and stop focusing so much on your social life or needing to constantly be around friends. This is part of adulthood and the transition between high school and college socialization. People aren\u2019t just going to suddenly be in your life and become your bff because you take the same class and see each other every other day. Social dynamics change. Go out there and talk to people and make friends, especially if you\u2019re a little introverted, they wont always come to you.",

Just because it never happened to you and you were never pressured to drink you shouldn't say that we are the ones who are doing something wrong. I don't judge people for drinking it's simply that I don't want to drink and a lot of people made me feel weird about it in the past. Like they don't invite me somewhere just because I don't drink a lot or even if they do they are just pouring a lot of alcohol in my glass even if I said a million times that I don't want to drink. So you are the one who is judging me and saying that I all made up the stories because it hadn't happened to you so it can't be true. People are different and you haven't experienced this kind of stuff so good for you.",

If you feel like giant bonding activities aren\u2019t really your thing, or being inducted into the phattest friend group of all time seems overwhelming, just go to a few club meetings here and there, look for an on campus job too! This is a really great way to meet people that might have similar interests. FWIW I worked with the IT department and the athletic department as a photographer. Met some cool people that way. \n\nI also know how it feels to have few friends, I transferred as a freshman and started sophomore year with no one at my school. Well a girlfriend, but she turned out to be a scumbag and cheated on me after 1.5 months at the same school xD and proceeded to shit talk me to everyone she knows. For no reason. \n\nSo hey, it can always get worse!\n\nSome of us are just okay being alone. At this age that\u2019s not the norm and a lot of people are chasing \u201cthe college experience\u201d which doesn\u2019t really exist and is different for everyone.",

Dude and I have plans to go to a couple of clubs next time I'm in his city. My little found out through the grapevine and he drove the hour from school to my place and we had a few beers. I love those guys to death and I can't imagine my life without them.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, is that if you find the right guys, it's worth it.",
