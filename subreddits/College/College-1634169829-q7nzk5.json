Making time for yourself to BREATHE. You are doing great. Anything beyond that is bonus and you should reward yourself for doing it!\n\nYou did your homework early? Reward. You got a B on the last exam? REWARD! You failed your last exam but now understand how to do the problems? Reward!\n\nFocus on rewarding yourself. People like you don't do it nearly enough!",
