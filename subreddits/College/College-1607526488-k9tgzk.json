  "text": "I'm teaching online like pretty much every other professor right now. I could've done something synchronous, but I opted against it because it seems like a pain. I'm just starting to get a trickle of anonymous course evaluations in. And I expected things like 'Oh I dig these extra review videos you made. Those were cool.' And instead I'm getting stuff like 'Oh sweet Jesus, you send us weekly updates on what's going on in the class, and you actually respond to emails. You are the salt of the earth.'\n\nSo now I'm wondering what the hell most of my colleagues are doing. But I also imagine it could be one of those things where one or two instructors who just suck at this really amp up the stress and uncertainty overall, even though it's not that many classes.\n\nOn *average*, what is the level of communication you've been getting in your online classes this semester?",

He than jumped ahead in the syllabus so the homework and lecture were off. By how long... 2 weeks so we would be on chapter 4 in class but chapter 2 for homework.\n- Professors openly admit they hate canvas. So were completely unfamiliar with it. And asking us to be patient with them while they struggled.",

Usually I learn stuff in review sessions from questions asked that I may have forgotten about or not even thought of.",

No room to fall behind.   \n At worse (ironically) they 'helped' by giving us no assignments, no (pre-finals week) due dates, weeks and weeks o time. Optional homework, bonus 5 points for being on time but no other penalties, no quizzes, even heavier finals. The result was a horrible temptation:   \n\"If nothings due now, I'll just do it after the other classes, \\*thier\\* work is graded tommorow so I clearly need to do that more. Eh, I have the weekend, You know what? I can catch up on the notes this weekend, and study for my other classes exam that's clearly alot more serious, no biggie\"... and repeat, repeat...repeat... and you just withdraw from that class instead of facing the music.   \n I'd rather have a ton of \\*graded\\* assessments, than no one holding me accountable. At least for me I do need that little pressure of constant -5 points or whatever for falling behind.",

Recorded lectures, quizzes instead of big tests, projects and heavy use of D2l(online platform), answered emails, gave extensions, did 5min mindfulness at start of classes. Two TAs all three of them with flexible office hours. So awesome.\n\n2. Only communicated via PDFs emailed to most of the class, most of the time. Had to be convinced to record zoom lectures. Class 1-2 only exist for those who turned up to them. HW assignments where buried in middle of lecture and where partially handwritten. No information on which assignments due when. No TA just a grader. Due date question? Time to scroll through the last 1-2 lecture videos to find the 30 seconds where the teacher mentions when a thing is due. \n\nTo all those professors who made even some change to their teaching style these past quarters, thank you!",

Some of my professors don\u2019t communicate at all.\n\nSome professors are terrible.     \nI (26F) graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2018. I was continuously enrolled for 6 years (August 2012-May 2018).     \nIn the fall of 2013, I took all my classes face-to-face. One of my professors called my dad once to talk about me. I don\u2019t know how my professor got my dad\u2019s number. My professor refused to respond to my emails about his class, but he was fine with talking to my dad. It was bizarre, partially because of FERPA, and partially because the professors in r/professors hate it when their students\u2019 parents contact to them. I reported my professor to his supervisor, but I don\u2019t know if he was ever disciplined. I do know that my professor didn\u2019t get fired.     \nIn the fall of 2017, I took a face-to-face education class. Once, my professor posted an assignment on Blackboard at 8 AM, and the assignment was due at 11:59 PM that same day. This assignment wasn\u2019t in the syllabus. There was 0 notification of this new assignment, over email, on Blackboard, in class, or in any other way. I didn\u2019t complete the assignment because I didn\u2019t know about it. My professor was angry with me for not completing the assignment.",

My fully online math class especially sucked, no interaction with peers or teacher. No lectures, and basically you do it all and even the grades have no comments. Thats another thing this year. So many teachers are just giving grades without comments and I have had several say you need to set up a zoom meeting to get comments, otherwise here's your grade have a good day.",

      "text": "No, most professors/ teachers who weren\u2019t doing online before the pandemic, are doing very poorly. I\u2019m a high school student, and I know these are all professors, so please don\u2019t come at me, but the lack of responsibility on their side is overwhelming. I had two of the same teachers this year as I did last year\u2014 both were very good teachers last year, I feel like I learned a lot. But this year, both of those teachers are doing very poorly, in my opinion. I take all college level course and I\u2019ve never failed a test or assignment, let alone a whole course, but I spent $950 on a SUPA Chemistry course, and for the first quarter of the year, her camera wasn\u2019t working, so I could never see the board, and I didn\u2019t have any of the materials the hybrid (some days in person, some days in school) students had. When I told her about this she got VERY hostile and told me it was the internet making the camera blurry (obviously not true or all teachers would have this problem). She pretty much told me there was nothing she could do and I needed to figure something out. The problem wasn\u2019t fixed until literally a week or two before the unit exam (only after parents emailed our guidance counselors), which of course I did very poorly on. She told me I could redo all of my homework and quizzes until I got a 100 to boost my grade, which I did, every single one, but getting a 62 on the test got me a failing grade. I want to hug teachers that are doing well right now and taking students advice/ suggestions.",

My comp professor is amazing at posting video lectures, and she uses her husband\u2019s lecture videos too. They both teach the same thing, and from the looks of it have a small child at home. They have it down. My film professor is great, too. Quick to reply to questions and gives amazing feedback. Then there is speech. I hate the fact I am required to take this class. She gives no feedback on speeches and just marks off for who knows what. She is unorganized and will go a month without grading anything. She just posts links and bizarrely organized PowerPoints that make no sense. It is a nightmare, but I should at least pass. I am over her class completely.",

My Tuesday night class did share the powerpoints though.\n\nMy Wednesday night... There's not much I can say about her that's good. Her expectations weren't clear, she assigned way too much reading to do in a 48 hour period and then expected you to read everything and watch over an hour's worth of videos. Then have a detailed discussion in a zoom meeting when she's trying to \"teach\" the material. She never provided time for discussion except when she asked a question (which by the way, apparently answering them doesn't count as participating). She pushed our meetings to 6 instead of keeping them at our scheduled time of 5 for no reason whatsoever other than she claimed she had another class at that time. Which isn't possible by the way bc our in person started at 5 on Wednesdays and went until 9:30. She didn't teach at all and her zoom meetings always resulted in a 30 minute conversation and rants because no one knew what to do or what she was wanting because everything she said was different than the syllabus and rubrics. Anyways, I could go on and on...",

For reference this is a community college that decided in the spring that fall would be online and tried to take steps preemptively to accommodate this. \n\n Physics two was wonderful. Prompt email (eventimes where I fully anticipated a delay) Prof is clearly working her butt off trying to make lessons, modify labs and do an hour and a half at least for office hours 3 times a week. If she can't help you over email she'll frequently ask to meet over teams outside of office hours. Like this lady left me with a totally platonic teacher crush. \n\nC++ however. Oh lord. First of all he only ever told us to read the book and take the online textbook provided tests and the quizzes he gave weekly were from the same bank. We also had 6 labs which were super poorly written. (We had to make a setter for a const. Why??) \nIf you emailed him he might respond? Sometimes. Frequently with completely useless responses. Ex: I asked should I use this loop this way for this lab? He responded yes loops will be helpful. For the 6th lab with no warning we were thrown into groups (of five!) To write the last lab (which was not modified at all to support group work). These are students I've never interacted with before because we only had 1 discussion board at the beginning of the semester. Hes never held office hours. I cannot stress how much I hated this prof. \nIn the end I'll probably get As in both classes but one I'll never use again likely but will remember all my life, the other I might actually use but wont remember any of it because without an opportunity to really practice my chances of retaining the information is really low.",

I was mostly teaching myself still, but I had some form of feedback and interaction with the ok class.\n\nThe other professor could not be bothered with questions. As in, I would ask her to clarify something from the reading while citing what pages I was referring to, and her answer would be to do the reading. Hello? Did you not read that I already did the reading? Can we just meet over Zoom at some point then to discuss this one-on-one? Radio silence.  Each class was worth roughly $1500 to take, and I can certainly say neither was worth $1500.\n\nCombine stuff like that with other professors who either weren't good teachers to begin with or are technologically illiterate, and you get the impression you're receiving through the grapevine.

Every assignment we missed in this class lowered our grade by one full letter. I never completed it and later dropped the course \n- one prof who required us to buy some online software that measured how much we were reading, plus required TWO devices recording us during exams (plus the whole invasive testing software) so I dropped that one pretty quickly as well. \n- one prof who had the entire quarter laid out on the Home Screen of canvas. She also wasn\u2019t great as responding to emails and didn\u2019t update the syllabus when changes were made in class. That was especially problematic because if I missed class I could be screwed. This prof was a humanities prof though and ended up giving everyone an A (or at least that\u2019s what she said... have to wait and see now) \n- one prof moved his class online and somehow it was no different than when I had attempted it before in person... he\u2019s a great prof and reached out to me around the drop deadline because I was failing the course. Ended up dropping but I mostly blame the class that gave me the 40 hour assignment \n- my last prof was phenomenal, he prerecorded his lectures on Panopto (great platform) and stayed within the limits of the class time (which has been somewhat rare). He also extended almost every major deadline as there was a lot of election/pandemic stuff going on all the time and he noticed less students turning stuff in than usual. He also replaced our exams with an extra project after he released a class-wide survey on our preferences. I still might have failed this class due to my own issues but this prof got a glowing review and will be receiving a positive email from me after grades are released (as I don\u2019t want him thinking I\u2019m just trying to boost my grade).\n\nI\u2019d say from the good professors, I usually heard from them once a week or so about something. None of my profs sent us weekly summaries or anything like that though, that sounds awesome. The bad profs either didn\u2019t communicate enough or communicated way too much (I got notifications for one prof who created an assignment for every single class day we were supposed to have).",

One professor refused to grant me the extended time, claiming that, because it was an online final exam, it would give me an unfair advantage over my peers. I tried to reason with her and show her confirmation emails from my school\u2019s accessibility services to no avail. Consequently, I wasn\u2019t able to finish my exam on time, and I received a mediocre grade on it. Luckily my work from the rest of the semester balanced it out and I passed, but still\u2014it was the difference of a letter grade, and I\u2019m confident I\u2019d have rightly earned it had I been given the full exam window.\n\nAnother professor claimed throughout the entire semester that we wouldn\u2019t have a final exam, and our final grade would simply be wherever we sat at rolling into finals week. A week before finals week, he switched gears and gave us a final project with so many various components and preliminary work that it seemed impossible to finish it. We voiced our concerns and frustrations and be brushed them off. Luckily he was able to offer us an extension by speaking with the folks at the Registrar\u2019s Office, but was very passive aggressive about it\u2014as if we had been slacking and putting off the work.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping next semester is better.",

The zoom meetings were also hijacked by certain students derailing the lessons and him attempting to humor them for a short time only for the class time to run out. Our syllabus wasn't even adjusted for fall semester and he ended up pulling some of our due dates earlier than they were 'scheduled' meaning 0's for some. Overall I saw a dwindle in those attending the class and responding on our discussion forums from around 32 to 6-10 as of the week before finals. It's a hell of a drop in attendance and participation. Judging from your post, bless you for being one of the great professors during this time.",

Getting her to respond to emails was such a pain too.\n\nWith that being said, one of my professors did an amazing job. He used Echo 360 to virtually teach the class and we answered clicker questions through that. We also had the option to come in person if we wanted to as long as it didn't exceed the max number of students. About 10 people were always there so in think that made it easier on him. \n\nI personally don't care for prerecord lectures because I would like to ask the question in person at that time. Emails don't always give me the answer I need and then the going back and forth is annoying.",

I had to drop a class at the beginning of the semester (a discussion-based class with most students in-person) because the instructor did not care that I could only hear her speak over zoom (huge lecture hall, one mic). I had another instructor request an additional mic for her class as well, and the school told her they didn't have the funding to purchase an additional microphone (lol). \n\nOverall the communication has been very strained for me, but I feel like it's because they:  \n\\-don't know how/aren't comfortable with canvas/zoom/outlook/etc.  \n\\-aren't being supported by administration (seems like the school did not care to hear their concerns when they were planning for fall, and they did not permit instructors to teach strictly online if their courses were originally supposed to be in-person unless they had substantial health risk, even if they had vulnerable members of their household)  \n\\-honestly just probably have their own stuff going and are just overwhelmed in general\n\nI feel like my school's lack of planning for this semester basically screwed over the instructors and they had to scramble last minute and never quite adapted. I've heard more teachers express their fatigue/frustration/confusion than ever over the last couple months. I'm at the point where I almost feel as bad for the teachers as I do for all the students who are struggling.   \nIt sucks because I'm paying so much to attend a small college, and most of my professors from this semester probably wouldn't even recognize me if I ran into them. The aspect of personalized learning has gone completely out the window.",

He posts up assignments and quizzes randomly without warning and puts them in a weird tab so that they're difficult to find. He doesn't post stuff when he says he's going to. It's finals week, and he's only graded three of our assignments, and he doesn't use a grading rubric, so the grades he has handed back seem to be decided arbitrarily. He said he \"forgot\" to assign us one of our exams and a paper, so he decided to give us a paper to write, an exam, and the final all during finals week. My other professors haven't been much better. \n\nI had to drop one class completely because the audio quality of the lectures were so bad and all of the assignments were based on the lectures instead of the book, so I was getting bad grades and it was taking me 3 hours to get through 30-minute lectures. I need this class to graduate, and it turns out that this professor in this format is my only option. My academic advisor wouldn't let me take it as independent study or petition the dean to let me have an exception to not take the course, so I'm graduating next semester instead of this semester like I originally \n\nMy school switched to online-only classes this semester and then took away my scholarship because online-only students aren't eligible for scholarships. \n\nLuckily, I have one professor who has been really understanding and cut us a lot of slack. She has everything organized into weekly modules and structured her classes so that we ended up writing our final paper in chunks throughout the semester, so all we had to do was put those chunks together in one paper and send it in. She decides not to give us final exams--instead, she gave us final papers in her classes. She's not perfect, and I do have issues with her classes (I'm a psych major, and she likes to treat the class like a big therapy session, so we spend a lot of class time listening to people asking her advice on their personal problems instead of actually learning--and she's a covid denier), but I have overall appreciated her efforts to make this semester easier for us.\n\nI'm struggling, I'm so tired, and I can't wait for this school year of hell to end.",

I started doing it because I had to change the schedule in our syllabus so often that it no longer made sense to point students in that direction. I think some of my colleagues did have a set syllabus that never changed, so they expected students to keep track by following that schedule. I think some students who weren't used to looking at a syllabus became lost. I also think that some instructors are legitimately bad at communication, and that was exacerbated during a time when communication was crucial. There was also a lot of crap coming from upper admin that they expected instructors to pass on to students... without telling us that we were supposed to be communicating this information with students. I erred on the side of overcommunicating (which pissed upper admin folks off when they tried to backtrack and gaslight us that they had definitely never said that thing and I was the one who was wrong... but that's a different problem).\n\nTL;DR: Communication was a clusterfuck this semester for a variety of reasons. The people who were bad at communicating looked even worse during the pandemic.",

They were always receptive to questions, via email or any other medium. My evaluation for them was glowing.\n\nMy least favorite professor had this bizarre system where the lectures were pre-recorded, but he played them for us at the scheduled class time. Whenever someone asked a question, he would get angry for having to pause the lecture. The lectures were *shit*, too, just the book but even more disjointed and confusing. He didn't respond to questions via email, so the only way to ask him anything was to attend these worthless lectures and have him get angry at you. He got answers wrong on the final and won't correct your grade unless you email him about it, even though **he's the one that fucked up**. Someone from the class went to the dean about it. I savored tearing into him in my evaluation.\n\nI think you're doing the right thing, although the \"right thing\" will depend a bit on the actual course topic.

Our professor wanted all of our presentations ASAP within the first week of the class, and failed people who didn\u2019t hand theirs in.

I had a prof I really like as a person, and she was wonderful as a speaker in our required seminar, but she was *so rough* in her asynch course. I have assignments due in the first half of September that still aren't graded, and exams were slow to grade too so you had *no idea* how you did or what to improve. We didn't have any recorded lectures, so all book learning, which was hit and miss. In general, it was hard to get feedback or ask questions. \n\nI had similar issues with my thesis advisor; he's great when he *does* give feedback, but I'd have to either remind him to answer me (which I hate doing) or wait several weeks.\n\n\nIn general, I think synchronous courses had way less of these issues, maybe because class meetings gave us the chance to touch base more actively.",

Nothing. Nothing for weeks. The book (while a free pdf, nice) had no chapter numbers, no table of contents, and every chapter started a new sequence of numbers...and when she required us to read, she gave us chapter numbers instead of pdf page numbers.\n\nI could go on, but suffice to say, I was absolutely lost in this class and I had no direction from the professor at all, despite how many times I tried to get in touch with her. Am I angry? Yes. Will I ever do a class with her again? Unlikely. I should be thankful I managed to finish out the class with a B, but I feel like I learned basically nothing.\n\nAfter years of getting some generally great professors, I was appalled at the lack of communication. It was horrible and I hope I never have to have another professor like that again. Normally I give some lenience to professors still learning how to teach online, but there was such a strong disconnect that I\u2019m not sure I can forgive it. It would take a very solid reason to explain how I was left to fend for myself. Real life doesn\u2019t work like this, you should always have someone to turn to in case you need help/advice.",

With that being said - online courses are hard and normally make me sad. \n\nThe best ones I have taken are when the professor is also engaged. For example:\n\n* I had weekly discussion posts in one class. Our professor would comment on people's responses and give feedback within the day or would let us know he is running behind. He would also spitball with us to help our critical thinking.\n* In another - my professor did little \"lecturette videos\" which helped break up the monotony of constantly reading. Online classes are a shit ton of reading - I know what I signed up for - but this was truly a gift. It brought everything in the reading together to a comprehensive/real world level. AND on top of that, he would always respond to student emails within 24-48 hours. If it was any longer, he would send out a mass message to the class.\n\nThe worst professors have just assigned SO much reading, rarely any interactive discussion posts - and never respond to emails or phone calls in a timely fashion or give any warning. \n\nGoing online really is a self-study and you have to be disciplined. However, I also think that when the professor shows that they care - even a little bit - by making it more interactive and involved, it helps student morale immensely. I wish that faculty at my school realized this, because I have STRUGGLED through some courses that had low interaction levels.",

Before hand we all were on a level playing field in a way but now everyone is in different positions that can't be easily accounted for. Plus each school has handled their response differently and that's another concern as some of us are still \"in school currently\" and others not.

Personally, I find one update at the beginning of the week enough unless there is a change in the work, but answering emails in a timely manner (like 1-3 days after receiving it) is the most helpful for me. Also, the prof that I love, had all of us do a mental health zoom since it is a freshman writing class, and he sat with me for like 2 hours just talking about what I am doing outside of class and how I am.",

My professor friends I'm in closest contact with are doing the same things, so I wouldn't consider my teaching as going above and beyond.  Then I log on here and see horror story after horror story.\n\nI assume part of the issue is survivorship bias (if that's the right term), because we don't hear as much from the students who have good classes.  In some cases I'm sure there's also a dose of hyperbole in the stories.  But due to the sheer volume of posts I see about bad classes, I have to conclude that a decent number of professors aren't doing well at online teaching.  It's very frustrating to see, and I know it's even worse for the students in those classes.",

I'm now in my second year and we've had in-person classes this whole semester.\n\nI've now had in-person classes with 14 different professors. Some of those, regardless of age, just put forth more effort into their instruction and committment. A few others can straight go suck donkey balls and in my evaluation for each, I very specifically requested a refund of my tutition. The bulk, however, were just about average in my opinion. They were available when I needed them, and they presented the material such that I didn't feel neglected.\n\nI recently met another adult student in the engineering program and he too shares similar thoughts and frustrations as me. One of those is that there has to be a balance between demonstration and instruction. Some of our professors demonstrate non-stop, but then we lacked some of the comprehensive knowledge that is needed. Other professors were great at delivering the theory, but lacked putting it into examples to demonstrate how to solve problems.\n\nI've had two other professors thus far who were exceptionally smart in their field, but I felt that because they were so smart, and because they had been teaching their topics for 20+ years, they begin to assume that freshman are supposed to catch onto the material fast. With that, I felt that they would speed over the very base material because it was boring to them. Yet, for me as a freshman and sophmore, that base material is the foundation and it's imperative that I learn it so that I can be successful in the upcoming onslaught of material being delivered at rocket speed.\n\nOne of those said professors admitted in class that he was arrogant. I mean, I get it, he's blooming smart in his field. However, I began to develop this thought: You're not allowed to be arrogant until you can figure out how to dumb down the material such that freshman/sophmores can grasp the base material soundly (and quickly). Using the same lingo as you use in graduate courses isn't what I need. Expecting me to pop off derivatives and integrals as fast as professors who've done it daily for the past 20+ years isn't going to happen. I'm so tired of hearing that in classes, \"We should all be fast at this by now shouldn't we?...\" No homie! I'm trying, I mean, damn, I'm trying, but no, I'm not at your level after two semesters.\n\nAnyhow, sorry. I got distracted with my frustration, lol. Hopefully some of this will be beneficial for you to hear and mull over. If not, well, give somebody 2 extra points from me please.",

That's 10+ years of difficult schooling, usually large amounts of debt, and often the prospect of just an average salary for all that trouble.  I agree that online school has highlighted the professors who can't teach well, and I think that psycho-analysis sounds intriguing, but I don't think that's a major explanation for what's happening.",

Depending on my course schedule, I leave at various times to head to school, and may or may not return back to work. If I don't return, but have breaks in between classes, then I log in to work remotely while in the cafeteria or library.\n\nA good schedule allows me to get home by 6:00pm, but sometimes my class schedule is late on certain days so I might push upwards of 8:00pm before I get home. Once I walk in, I spend a little time with my family and eat some dinner. Then i head into my office and start doing homework and study for upcoming exams. My bedtimes range from 10:00-12:00. The 12's really hurt though, so I'm doing all I can to keep those at bay.\n\nSome days will be lighter than others, and I can spend the evening watching TV with my family, or jump on some gaming with virtual friends, but those are in the low percentile. Most of my weekends involve yardwork, an errand or two, maybe a Sunday dinner and movie, and then nothing else other than school work. Rinse and repeat for the new week.\n\nI wouldn't say that I'm managing it moreso than just surviving somehow. Like you, others ask how I'm doing it, and I'm just thinking to myself, I have no idea. That may not offer you solace at first, but if you think about it, what I'm describing is that I'm doing it. This should mean that you can do it also.
