Masturbating in the (communal) dorm bathroom is \u201cseriously disgusting?\u201d", "text": "Yesterday everyone in my dorm building (around 500 people both guys girls and diverse genders) had to be in a zoom meeting with the person that is right above the RA\u2019s in authority. I think like RAC or REC or something like that. This meeting was about rules (building rules, school rules, safety rules, etc).   \n\nThe RAC are allowed to add rules in addition to the ones made by the school, our RAC has some added reasonable rules, no basketball bouncing, soccer balls have to be carried and not transported by kicking, baseball bats have to be in a backpack or carried by the thick side etc. Then came \u201cno masturbating in the bathroom toilets, showers or  sinks\u201d. Then she said \u201cseriously you guys it\u2019s disgusting, think about all the people that will use the same facilities where you did your things it\u2019s just disrespectful\u201d \u201cjust do it in your room or find someone to have sex with there is plenty of condoms at the health center just about a 30 second walk from the building\u201d  \n\nYes the last two things are true I went to get some several weeks ago just in case I find a gf or fwb, and they have pretty much all the types you can imagine but still it seems like not allowing masturbating in the bathroom is too much  \n\nAlso we are supposed to report if we suspect someone is masturbating otherwise we could be subject to the same discipline as them  \n\nThe good thing is that the \u201creport\u201d first had to be done with the RA and when the REC said that she had the biggest \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d face so she might not do anything about it if someone reports   \n\nI mean I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with doing it on the toilet that\u2019s where I have been doing it for the past month. And if there is please tell me where I should do it instead (not the room I have 3 roommates so I would rather save my \u201croommate kick outs for private time\u201d in case I get a gf) basically we are have the right to ask everyone to step out 4 times a semester as long as it is not causing them extreme hardship and not during finals week but it can be more times or during finals week by mutual agreement\n\nI understand the shower prohibition more because it can be clogged by semen and the sink one for obvious reasons but not the toilet one, and for girls not even the shower one", "author": "throwaway67083", "created": 1632795173, "retrieved": 1632800142, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hejxg2h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwwaeb/whaaaaat_masturbating_in_the_communal_dorm/hejxg2h/", "text": "\"Or the sinks\"????
