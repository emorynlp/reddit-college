  "title:": "Should I do part time college to save money?",
  "text": "Ok, so I have an option where I can do full time college meaning like all 8 classes. It's kind of pricey and I don't have that type of money upfront (I do not want to go into student loans btw) and another option is I can just do two classes during every six months. That's much cheaper compared to doing 8 classes in one full year. \n\nI like the saving money part where I just do two classes every six months, save a lot upfront but it'll take longer time to finish all of them but I don't mind that. \n\nI also work full time as well, btw.",
