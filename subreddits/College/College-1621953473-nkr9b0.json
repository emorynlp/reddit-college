I\u2019m returning to school as an older student who went to school in LA for film, had a blast, my professors either were relevant working represented professionals or amazing, caring transplants. I\u2019m going back to school now for allied health and I was certainly in the pits last year. \n\nI notice the more \u201crealistic\u201d the major the worst the college experience. STEM students, med students, nursing students, some law students even are incredibly depressed. The English majors, theater majors, creative writing, history majors, film majors etc had great, life enriching experiences in college but they may not be employable! I worked 5-6 years in the industry because of proximity. I would never reccomend an artistic major of any kind in an area with no industry. I\u2019m really happy I did the \u201cBS\u201d major in my youth, and now doing the hard one when I don\u2019t care about \u201cstudent life\u201d. It\u2019s all strictly to feed me and pay bills. Not feed my soul. School is the most soul sucking aspect of my life right now. So I would NOT tell anyone to go to school full time for hard science majors, especially if you work. There\u2019s no joy or meaning in what is in the science curriculum so you MUST have that in your personal life. This is the same with the workforce. As much fun I had playing and working in Entertainment, there were certain aspects such as finances and politics that can majorly put a damper on your passions. Art and business are two different vibrations especially when you are working positions where you are in control of neither. Then it feels like just another corporate job. Infact most camera men told me their job was just another corporate job lol. So learn how to balance your life and where your personal work hour limits are at. Some people can graduate in 4 years with a BA, some need 6-8 years.
