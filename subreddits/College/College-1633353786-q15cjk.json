  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nIs anyone else feeling very very overwhelmed? I am in my fall semester of my second year of community college and it seems like every week I have at least one exam and a bunch of work. Im taking less classes than I was last year but somehow it feels like a mountain I can barely climb. I have a lot of anxiety, so that likely isn't helping, and I feel kinda alone in the sense that I don't talk to my old friends from high school much and my boyfriend isn't in college so he doesnt completely understand how much pressure I feel. Im in the USA for reference but I would love to hear from anyone because right now I feel like I am struggling alone.",

Just this morning I reached out to my student services to ask for extra help because I'm falling behind. You should definitely do the same if you feel like you cannot keep up with the workload.",

It isn't that I don't keep up necessarily (although the non graded readings for my one class are stacking up on me), I manage to get things done and have Saturdays to myself pretty much, it is just really stressful right now in a way it wasnt last year.",
