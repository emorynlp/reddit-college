  "text": "I'm just starting college and we were given a math/calculus test with a time limit of roughly an hour. It had more than 10 problem solving items, but in reviewing or discussion it would roughly take a good 20 mins to answer each one.\n\nIn the end I didn't make the passing score (by a long shot), but I would like to ask for your opinions if the time limit wasn't reasonable or was I just slow?",

What did I do first? What rule did I apply here? I bought a notebook to write in.\n\nThe key part of my studying was breaking every step down to its fundamentals. I wrote out the formulas, the rules, every step I took needed an explanation for why I did that. Calculus is focused on algebraic manipulation, so knowing what you can and can\u2019t do by heart is important. \n\nFor context, I studied for a week, a few hours each day, trying new problems and going over old ones in an attempt to see if I had memorized my steps for that type of problem. The test had 6 questions, though I remember one was 5 different parts under one. Only 55 minutes, and I was able to answer every single one but one partial question (which I simply didn\u2019t know).\n\nEdit: Also keep a list of questions to ask your professor/tutor/classmate/whoever, make revisions on your new notes, check your answers with a calculator (I spent about 2 bucks for a week\u2019s worth so I could double check all my steps) for extra reassurance.",
