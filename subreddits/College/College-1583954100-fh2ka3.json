Would they be willing to let you stay with them, given the circumstances? That could be a very simple answer. Also, at least my college, is allowing students to stay if the circumstances are severe enough. In this case, I think if you explained to your housing department why you couldn't return home, they would be more than welcoming.\n\nNo one wants to send someone back where they are not safe, comfortable, or taken care of.
