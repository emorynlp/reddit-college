  "text": " Junior with a 1550 sat, 4.67 GPA, 3 seasons of a sport, volunteer tutoring for 2 different organizations, maybe a national merit semifinalist PSAT score, and active in a few other clubs\n\nby the looks of it though, I can only attend my state school which has a 70% acceptance rate because of the cost of other schools and how much cheaper the in state. It would basically like being forced to go to my safety.\n\nWhat are my options? Id estimate that I could cover about 25K a year, not poor enough to qualify for substantial financial aid, parents have to put other siblings through college too. Are there any schools that give full rides? Do I have any options out of this?",

      "text": "With those numbers, you should be able to apply to lower-ranked private schools willing to give you full merit scholarships.\n\nThat being said, you want to have a clear plan. You want to check the financials of any private school you pursue - if they're struggling financially, then that might mean they won't be around long enough for your degree to matter.\n\nIf you are going to a school with purely regional appeal (as most do), you're probably also going to want to leverage your big-fish-in-a-small-pond performance into a more prestigious post-graduate degree.",

      "text": "> I can only attend my state school which has a 70% acceptance rate because of the cost of other schools and how much cheaper the in state. It would basically like being forced to go to my safety.\n\nI take it you come from a wealthy school district? Because this is pretty damn normal for high achieving students from lower income backgrounds and you're acting like it's some sort of travesty lol. \n\nI mean, it'd be great if merit got people to the places they want to go, and in many cases it does, but I thought the past decade or so disillusioned people enough that most would just be happy that they could afford a state school over community college.\n\nThe lower the school rank, the more likely it is they'll give you money, with the exceptions of the *really* well funded high ranked ones that can afford to give money to everyone. So my advice is to find out which high-ranked schools offer the best financial aid packages across the board and apply to them and then find out which of the lower-ranked schools have the best programs for your specific major-- many schools have low overall rankings but are really great schools to go to for a bunch of random really specific majors, so you may be able to take advantage of that.",

      "text": "You're more likely to get a substantial merit scholarship from a college where you are in the top 10 or 15% of applicants, meaning other schools you might also consider a safety school. You should certainly apply to at least a handful of colleges so you can compare financial aid packages, but it's probably unrealistic to expect substantial merit aid if you are applying to very selective universities.",
