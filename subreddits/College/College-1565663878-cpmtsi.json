{"sid": "cpmtsi", "link": "/r/college/comments/cpmtsi/dear_incoming_freshmen/", "title:": "Dear Incoming Freshmen,", "text": "As the summer is winding down and you are getting ready to leave home and go off to your college of choice (if you haven\u2019t already), this post is for you. \n\nLeaving for college is both a liberating and terrifying experience. You leave everything that you\u2019ve ever known to go to this place to peruse a better life for yourself. While there is much honor in doing this, there is no doubt that you feel scared to leave the comfort of your parents home and the life that you have become accustomed to. You will be leaving your parents and your home (for those of you not commuting), your friends, your pets, your room, etc. You go to this new place with no idea what to expect and not knowing many people. Many college students have gone through this. \n\nAs a sophomore, I will admit that I do not know everything that there is to no know about going away to college. However, I can say that I can offer pieces of advice. \n\nGoing away to college is a big deal. It is a major transitional period in your life. Your parents know this, your professors know this. That being said, in your freshman year, professors and school officials do tend to be more lenient toward freshman because they are adjusting to the new lifestyle of living away from home and on their own. \n\nOnce you move in to your new dorm, the reality of the situation will not begin to set in until your parents leave (If they helped you move in. I know that some kids drive themselves). Once they leave, take some time to unpack and organize your things. Then maybe take a walk around campus, either by yourself or with a roommate, to familiarize yourself with your surroundings and the layout of the campus. \n\nDon\u2019t try to join too many clubs or organizations because if you do what I did, you try to sign up for as many things as possible. Please take into consideration that you are acclimating to this new lifestyle and don\u2019t try to overwhelm yourself with unnecessary activities. You also need to make time to do everything, such as study and do your laundry. More power to those that can handle it all though.\n\nRemember to be respectful of your roommate. You will share a room and maybe a bathroom with this person for the whole year. It is better to be at a good understanding of each other\u2019s boundaries then to deal with the fallout from not doing so later. Also remember to set up those boundaries earlier. Your RAs will most likely encourage this. An RA told me something that I will never forget and its that you will not always be best friends with your roommate, sometimes you are just simply that; roommates. \n\nKeep your classes and classwork organized. You will save so much time not having to dig through piles of paper to find one assignment. Personally, I use separate binders for each class but that\u2019s just me. \n\nFigure out a good sleep schedule that works for you and stick to it. Don\u2019t wake up at staggered times and go to bed at staggered times. There were countless times that I would have an 12pm class as my first one that day and sleep until 11:30 and then not want to go to bed until 1 or 2 the following night before I had an 8am the next day. Sleep is more important than you think.\n\nAlways print things out in advance. You don\u2019t want printer problems to screw you over 15 minutes before you have to turn it in. Print it out ASAP to save yourself some stress. \n\nNever feel pressured into partying. If you want to go to a party, then by all means go. If it is not your thing, then don\u2019t go. Just make sure that it will not be an inconvenience to your schoolwork. It is okay to say no to going to a party. I know many, many people that made partying their first priority and they dropped out by the start of the second semester. It\u2019s important to have a good balance between fun and work. \n\nGo to class!! Just go. You don\u2019t want to miss one and be out of the loop and have no idea what\u2019s going on. If you have to miss one because you are sick or there are family issues going on, email your teacher or ask classmates to catch you up, maybe even bring you a copy of class work. You have unlimited resources to keep you caught up. \n\nIn regard to the above paragraph, you are allotted a certain amount of classes that you can miss before you fail. Do not abuse these because I guarantee you that there will come a day where you really wish that you had a freebie to use but you used them all in the first two months. Just keep a couple in the reserves and use them wisely. \n\nAnd last but not least, do what YOU want to do. Do what makes YOU happy and what you feel is best for yourself. Don\u2019t do things you don\u2019t want to do because your friends are doing them. Don\u2019t do something that you don\u2019t want to do because your parents are forcing you to. Do what makes YOU happy. And while you may feel pressured from all sides to do things that don\u2019t make you happy, in the end is that really a way to live your life? Constantly bending over backwards for something you don\u2019t like? Be yourself. Do what you love. Be happy. College only lasts for so long so enjoy the time that you have there. \n\nSincerely, \nYour neighborhood sophomore \n\nCU\u2019 22\n\nEdit: grammar & spellling", "author": "eliseswl", "created": 1565663878, "retrieved": 1632947253, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1275, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"exfjciz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cpmtsi/dear_incoming_freshmen/exfjciz/", "text": "Also if you simply don\u2019t feel like joining clubs or extracurricular activities there is nothing wrong with you.

It's not the best feeling in the world, but so many students, including myself, struggle with this. Don't trust what I see on social media, not everyone is as happy as they make it seem. If you catch yourself being jealous, I would recommend just taking a few days off social media. I took 2 months because seeing other people hang out with their friends and go to parties genuinely made me feel bad about myself. I realized the feeling was stupid because I got upset over some meaningless pictures. If you ever feel this way, seek help. Possibly talk to a close friend or go see a therapist. After 2 years of struggling, I'm so excited to be coming back next week to see a therapist for the first time. Also, try to not go into college with a relationship unless you feel happy that you've done what you wanted or \"explored\" or maybe don't want to explore. I know many students who were sophomores or juniors when they got engaged to their high school sweethearts. One of my cousins met someone in high school and they dated for 8 years. They broke it off for a little while just to see what else is out there and now they're back together and happily married. But I would still personally recommend not coming in with an SO. For me, this ruined my chances of forming close friendships with other freshmen I met. I was so focused on maintaining my long distance relationship, that it ruined me completely. But if you know they're your person, then do what makes you happy. Also, college IS NOT high school. If you're hanging out with a group and you see them doing something you're uncomfortable, or hear them say something rude or negative, you don't have to stay with them. You don't want toxic people around you. College is not meant to be dramatic or full of social groups. It's really where people come together to talk about what they love doing and share it with those they care about. If you don't like the behavior of a person or group, then leave. Also, as OP said, DON'T pile yourself more work from joining a lot of organizations. For something like Dance Marathon or Relay for Life, those are some of the largest organizations on campus and they require A LOT of effort like fundraising and advertising. If you're not into that sort of thing, then I wouldn't recommend it. But if you are willing to put effort in and want to meet a lot of people, those are great places to go. Join organizations that interest you, many times you aren't even able to be a part of too many because of conflicting schedules and all of that. So choose what you like most, maybe something you were similarly involved in, in high school. Anyway, do your best, college is expensive so put in your best effort. You want a career in the future, be ahead of the game and find out requirements beforehand, chances are most people don't even know them or pay attention until they need too.

If you come in with a mentality expecting a structured guide you by hand environment, you will be very frustrated very fast. Also if you abuse that flexibility due to too much lazyness and procrastination it probably won't end happy either. \n\n\nAs for socializing, again, you are not in high school, don't act like a stereotypical high school jock to people. Don't bring high school drama to college. Instead, be chill. Alnost everyone likes chill people in college. If there are people who are acting bad to you in college, avoid and/or ignore them.

Remember that sometimes, a class really really honestly will get the best of you.  Learn to cook.

If your group of friends is always dropping $50-$75 a night at a bar, and you can't afford to do that, and they can't/don't/won't understand you need cheaper fun, it's okay to ditch them and find a more understanding group to hang out with.
