  "text": "I failed my first two tests miserably(48% and 45%)in one of the most difficult classes I\u2019ve ever taken. I took my third and got an 82%. We have three more. I honestly don\u2019t know whether I can pull a higher grade than the 82% as I was sure I had aced it. I don\u2019t have any other assignments to raise my grade. I\u2019m a senior this year and I\u2019m actually supposed to graduate this semester. I don\u2019t know what to do if I can\u2019t pass this class. It\u2019s literally the only one left that I\u2019m struggling with(except my senior project).",

People usually average a 60% in that class. And seeing as how I\u2019ve done before\u2026I\u2019m just so unsure. This guy is very specific when it comes to the answers he wants.",
