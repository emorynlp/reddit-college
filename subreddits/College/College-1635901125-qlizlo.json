  "text": "Hey guys! i need some advice-\n\nmy parents have managed to ruin every relationship ive ever had by picking the person apart and getting into my head and convincing me they were bad people- once they were correct- the other four times the relationship went up in flames over nothing but my parents exerting control over me.\n\nthe most recent relationship they ruined was with my ex, pete. peter and i have worked very hard to heal from the trauma of my parents being horrible to him and myself, and we are now the healthiest and happiest we have ever been because my parents don't know and aren't meddling. I would understand if they had just cause for disliking him, but they simply dont. \n\nNow with the holidays and long breaks approaching, im worried about how i will be able to see him and his family while im home on break. our hometowns are less than half an hour from eachother, but my parents sold my car because i moved to the city for school. \n\nhow would you suggest i continue seeing him without alerting my parents to the situation? did i make the right call as to not tell them about us being together again?",
