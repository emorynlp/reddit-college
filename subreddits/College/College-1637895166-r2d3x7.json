  "text": "Hello,\n\nFor most of my life I've been struggling with depression, but was only officially diagnosed with clinical depression a couple years ago. It comes and goes, but I sometimes find it hard to go to classes because of it. When I do, it's difficult for me to concentrate. On top of that, I also have social anxiety disorder and I find it hard to ask questions/voice my opinions in front of other students. I was thinking of getting an accommodation from my college's accommodation office to not attend classes and not be penalized for it if I found myself to be too depressed. If I were to do this, I understand that I would have to keep up with my assignments and and content from missed lectures\u2014something I feel that I can manage\n\nMy question is: would getting an accommodation for this be possible or do you suggest that I contact my college's accommodation office and ask them instead? Also, is this something that any college student has done?\n\nI would appreciate any response.",

As someone else pointed out, accommodations have to be reasonable. How would you get the course content without attending class *and* without placing an undue burden on the instructor?",

From past experience, most of my instructors would usually have students read from the textbooks/assigned material and serve only to illuminate the material and answer any questions. This is what happens in all my classes this semester. To answer your questions, I would read from the textbook/assigned material to catch up and talk to my instructors to see whether absences would place a burden on them.",

              "text": "That sounds OK, but I see this differently. If an accommodation form were to say \"this student does not need to attend class and cannot be penalized for not attending class,\" I would understand that as, \"the disability office has already determined that this is a reasonable accommodation for any qualifying student in any class on campus.\" Instructors don't get to pick and choose which accommodations they accede to. And it's just difficult for me to imagine the disability office coming to that conclusion because so many faculty would not consider that accommodation reasonable. But this is just my sense of the situation, maybe this is already happening at my or other institutions and I've never encountered it.",

      "text": "it\u2019s kind of tricky, but most likely not. First for accommodations you do need your physician to fill out paperwork and they recommend accommodations for you to the school. \n\nIf you are missing a lot of days, 1-3 a week, they may recommend you switching to an online format if available. The most common accommodation for depression is allowing assignment extensions without penalty. Attendance can be a difficult subject so I would reach out to your disability services and also make sure it won\u2019t affect any financial aid if you have any federally.",

I now can miss class due to my disability (like if I'm having a really hard day mental illness wise and can't get to class) and get a 2 day extension on assignments if needed. My advise is to ask, I didn't know I could get so much help and I'm glad I sought it out. It's been a life saver!",
