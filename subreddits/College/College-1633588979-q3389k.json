It's getting so bad that I'm actually thinking about not going even though I really want to. I don't think I'd fit in with everyone.",

              "text": "University of Kentucky is pretty welcoming for LGBTQ+ students. Take a look at these articles.  Of note they provide roommate matching for LGBTQ+ students. I think you will have a good experience there. You could also reach out to the Diversity/LGBTQ+ office and discuss your concerns and get more information. Perhaps they can connect you with a few students who can share their experiences on campus and answer questions you have.  \n\n[UKentucky ranked highly ](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2019/06/28/unviersity-of-louisville-university-of-kentucky-are-states-most-lgbtq-friendly-college-campuses/1599102001/)\n\n[ campus pride index](https://www.campusprideindex.org/campuses/details/290?campus=university-of-kentucky)",
