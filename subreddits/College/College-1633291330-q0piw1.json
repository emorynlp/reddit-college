  "text": "i'm a freshman, i had my first chemistry test on friday and got it back today and i got a c-. i studied so hard for this test and am so disappointed in myself. please someone calm me down lol i'm literally rethinking my entire life over this test. i'm just so overwhelmed. it was worth 18% of my grade which means i lost 6% of my grade because of it. i have 2 more tests this semester which means maybe i can make up for the lost percentage. is it normal to struggle this much in the first month of college?",
