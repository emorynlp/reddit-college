They send a transcript right now, then some schools want one after first semester, and at the end of the school year you'll have to submit a final transcript that your high school should also do automatically to prove that you didn't have some sort of significant decline after being admitted into college.\n\nWhen I submitted my first transcript I was missing an english credit and a science credit when it came to my school's graduation requirements. Colleges understand that you will have less things now than at the end of the school year.",
