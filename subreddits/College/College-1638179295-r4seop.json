Two very different things. \n\nIf its the latter, than there\u2019s a very large number of excellent youtube videos on every topic you could imagine. I\u2019d recommend watching those instead. It\u2019ll save you time and money, and you\u2019d probably retain it better",

      "text": "1. Ask your peers for help or notes from the classes you missed.\n2. You can ask the professor what book he is using.\n3. I am sure European schools are similar to the USA where you have a campus bookstore. The textbooks for all courses are available there, so just look for the book associated with the course you are enrolled in.",
