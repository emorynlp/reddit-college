  "text": "It comes down to grown adults paying an institution for a service. The service being to be taught on the subjects you need to further your career. However they don\u2019t teach you, they explain in little detail how to solve certain problems, then when it comes to the exam, you are not tested on the information you learned. You are tricked and given questions that are much more difficult then what you were taught. I understand it\u2019s more so testing problem solving, however I find it to be ridiculous when I am \u201cPAYING\u201d to be taught this information, or the processes for solving these equations. I\u2019m not paying to be taught only a sliver of the information needed to get 100% on my exam. Idk seems messed up I\u2019m paying tens and thousands of dollars to be tricked instead of taught.",

But the sad fact is many schools look to cut every corner they can, including curriculum development, and end up becoming test taking farms. It's shameful.",

Back when you actually had to read textbooks and actually research stuff and work with the professor the degree had value. Now college is just a cash cow being milked by telling people you need it to succeed in the real world, and the real world will only hire you if you have a degree. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that will hopefully change in the next couple generations as things like Coursera grow in popularity.",
