  "text": "Last week, I was told I got the internship position. They said they'd get back to me with the exact start date, which would be \"the end of this month or the beginning of next month\". This is my first internship that I got that I didn't involve the school internship portal so I'm unfamiliar with the norms., so I'd appreciate it if you could share your stories about when you got accepted for an internship position.\n\n Should I expect to get an email stating they don't need me anymore, or should I hold on to the promise? While it would be great to get the money, I'm not doing it for the money and would be alright financially and academically if I didn't get this internship.",
