  "text": "So I\u2019m a sophomore, but this is my first semester on campus as freshman year was all online. The past 2 semesters my gpa was alright, I\u2019m a CS major so it was pretty good by those standards. However coming onto campus I\u2019ve found my study habits and general class habits were terrible, and for the first 3 to 4 weeks I didn\u2019t go to class or do anything (I was way too overconfident, and in the past I didn\u2019t have so many chores and general things to do) Now I\u2019ve been behind and consequently have done terrible in most of my classes. I\u2019ve learned my lesson and am working to catch up, but it\u2019s not easy and am still stuck behind. Is this kind of thing normal, and will I be fine?",

      "text": "My brother was kinda like you but augered in second semester at school ( we both like reading Yeager \ud83d\udee9\ufe0f). He transferred because his GPA was below 1 and he couldn't recover. He took a community college class & some from the online earned Admissions program at ASU and got his cumulative GPA over a 2.0, then transferred all that over. His passed classes transfer over without grades, and he's graduating one semester late magna cum laude!\n\nLesson learned: if you can't recover your gpa, there are options.",

              "text": "You'll be fine. My oldest brother majored in chemistry and still went through competitive hiring with CS firms based on his big high school projects he'd worked on. He said a gpa gets a recruiter to look at your resume, unless you have an in. The important thing is what projects you've worked on and your ability. His in was that he didn't have a resume when he talked to the recruiters so he had them salivating with his projects and promising they didn't care about his chemistry work.",

                  "text": "Thank you, just feels shit to have such shitty grades lol, I know it\u2019s completely my fault but I never really had to work that hard or have discipline with school before college, and also last year I didn\u2019t have to take care of myself (this probably sounds so pretentious and entitled but it\u2019s true) now that I do I wasn\u2019t ready for it and ready for the responsibility, as well dealing with the fact that I cant just coast by and do nothing anymore. I didn\u2019t show up to my classes or do anything for them and am paying the price for it, and it feels like shit lol. I\u2019m not used to getting some of the lowest grades in the class (like bottom 15 on an exam) and it\u2019s kind of a shock, but also a wake up call/reality check to me. (Ik this is basically a rant but thanks for listening lol) Thanks for the answers they mean a lot!",

          "text": "No, nothing changed my study habits, it was the fact that online I stayed home, so I didn\u2019t really have responsibilities, and so my poor time management and shitty study habits were able to be covered up as I had a large amount of time, so I didn\u2019t need to be effective with the use of my time, also I had an easier freshman course load, now I\u2019m taking some fairly difficult classes. Another thing is just acclimating to living on my own, I\u2019ve never lived without my parents before haha. My study habits have always been bad it\u2019s just throughout school I was always able to maintain these habits and still do well",
