  "text": "Not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this on - but I\u2019ll give it a try.\n\nBackground: I\u2019m a current 2nd year uni student taking a degree in the health sciences stream. Additionally, I work average 30h-36h on a weekly basis - I am a frontline worker in the healthcare field. I\u2019ve been taking 3 to 4 courses every semester such to try to balance school, work and personal life yet I do not feel content when it comes to my GPA (I do not mean to sound like a typical 4.0 gunner - I would be over the moon with a 3.5). If this is of any particular relevance, I am also a premed.\n\nQuestion: University students who work 30+ hours and have a near perfect GPA - how do you do it? Is there any particular skills or steps you find essential in your day-to-day that helps with organization, time-management skills, and school-work-life balance?\n\nThank you in advance :)",

I spend about 30 hours a week outside of my classes studying and homework. Many students don\u2019t actually read the material, and I can tell you first hand, reading your books and chapters, will really help you understand the material better. Think of it this way, the more times you see it, the more you\u2019ll remember. I spend probably 10-15 hours a week reading my chapters. 10-15 studying and homework. I take 15 credits a semester. I am also in my final semester in supply chain management, so the workload has definitely be a struggle. I don\u2019t know if you have a significant other, but if you do, that makes life a lot harder because you also gotta balance time with her/him. Best recommendation, stay single, be on your grind and focus. You probably won\u2019t have much of a life outside of school. But if your gpa is really important to you, it\u2019s worth it.",

              "text": "If your single, commit 2-3 hours per day studying your material. Do you find yourself getting distracted? Idk how heavy your assignments are, but if you work 30 hours a week and take 3 classes and 7-10 assignments, it sounds to me like you spend more time than normal on those assignments. Once again I am making an assumption as I don\u2019t know how the assignments are. What I do is I have all my classes (5) during two days of the week. I am at school from 9 am- 9pm two days a week. I try to also take one of my classes online if I know it\u2019s a class that will be relatively easy. That helps a lot with time management because you can work on it at your own time and pace. I also have a 5 hour gap between my lecture class and last class. I typically use that 5 hours to focus on assignments/reading. My lunch at work consist of working on homework if I can or reading. I typically work 8-5 and come home and work on school work 6-11 pm. I then try to hangout with my women Friday-Saturday-Sunday. It\u2019s hard being in a relationship while grinding. Not gonna lie. But I also chill with her usually around. 2-3pm so I use the morning/early afternoon to do more homework/reading/studying. I don\u2019t really have a life outside of school tbh. But I look at it different than most college aged students. I look at it as temporary pain for a lifetime of happiness. Grind your ass off 4 years and the rest of your life will be fruitful! Goodluck on your future endeavors!",

For an example, I\u2019m taking a 5000-level biology course; what I like to do is make Anki cards from the lecture PowerPoint before the class (I won\u2019t understand everything but that\u2019s okay!). I run through those Anki cards the night before the lecture on that material and then (during the lecture) I barely take any notes at all! I just listen very intently! The great thing about doing the notecards before the class is that your brain doesn\u2019t get hung up on the vocabulary and you get to focus on understanding the *why* aspect of the lecture. Then, I skim the chapter that night. Again, I\u2019ve now hit the material twice and my brain doesn\u2019t get hung up on the verbiage since I did the notecards, so this ends up being a very quick supplement to my study. I\u2019ll keep up with the Anki cards that are due and that\u2019s it! \n\nSome time management tips that work with how I study: \n1) I have the Anki app, so any cards I make on my laptop I can be flipping through on my phone if it\u2019s slow at the hospital or I\u2019m between classes. \n2) I\u2019m big on Pomodoro sessions. You\u2019ll wanna learn about these if you have yet to take the MCAT. They make studying for long periods actually bearable.",

              "text": "Okay, well, there\u2019s a couple different areas to tackle there. So, in terms of how you learn best, break it down to the simplest aspects first \u2014 do you learn best by listening, watching, reading, or writing? When I was taking Organic Chem, I would find that it was really hard for me to understand what the professor was teaching unless I wrote out/organized my own *structure* for the content. I need to see how things all fit together for it to make sense. If you find that listening to the professor\u2019s PowerPoint does nothing for you, then show up, and try your best to pay attention, jotting notes literally only when the professor says \u201cTHIS WILL BE ON THE TEST\u201d \u2014 but otherwise, just pay attention. The real work might come when you are able to draw up an organized study guide (I liked to pretend I\u2019d be giving the study guides to my peers) or perhaps details note cards. Maybe you work best just reading the text book. If so, don\u2019t worry about making a study guide, just write tons of notes in the margins of the pages to summarize each subsection in the books; I\u2019m not gonna lie, I jot notes in the margins like crazy when it\u2019s a required reading. \n\nIn short, follow your instincts and don\u2019t be afraid to try new things, but when you learn a piece of content and you find that it stuck really well, take note and try to apply the mechanism you used to other areas of your learning. \n\nFor distractions, check out the Pomodoro technique. I use an app called Forest for this, but you could just use the timer app on your phone. Basically, you want to do a deep focus session for 25 minutes, no messaging or goofing off. Then reward yourself with 5 minutes of texting or anything except productive work. Then, jump back in. \n\nThe key is to progressively increase the amount of time that you are able to stay deeply focused; you\u2019re literally training your brain to focus on one task for longer periods of time before drifting on to something distracting. This summer, in preparing for my MCAT, I worked up to 1.5 hours before needing a break, since that how long each testing session is (of 4 sessions).",

              "text": "Hmm so this one is pretty obvious but make sure you're not taking a lot of classes that are hard at the same time. Also, whether classes are hard or easy depends on you and not what other people think. I consider Early Film History to be difficult because I hate analyzing films and writing papers. I consider Calculus 3 to be super easy because I'm very good at Math. I usually make sure to take one difficult class with two or three easy ones. This semester I am taking Calculus 3 Honors [easy for me], C++ Programming [easy and fun] and Physics 1 [I hate Physics]. I know my Math and programming homework is going to go by really fast because I excel in these classes, that way I have more time to dedicate into actually understanding Physics. \n\n\n\nAnother tip is to decide what you want to work on every day. For example, today I may decide to work on Chapter 16 homework for math and my C++ Quiz. I know I need to finish these assignments before the end of the day, but I also know that once I finish these assignments I have the rest of the day \"free\" to do whatever I want to.\n\n\n\nAlso, make sure that you are not doing a lot of homework from the same class on the same day. For example, even though I have to do Chapter 16 and 17 for Math, I'm only going to do Chapter 16 today and then do an assignment from another class. If I do a lot of Math in one day I'll get burned out and start making mistakes.\n\n\n\n\nLastly, don't fall behind",

I\u2019d stray from bad habits like watching tv, using my phone before bed, or wasting time scrolling on social media. If you get a good routine going, you can be way more productive with the time you have. I would be able to lock in and get good work done anywhere, at any time, no matter how short the timeframe as long as I had my laptop because I kept my mind/body on a good schedule. Eating healthy and sleeping well also helps a ton with this. It seems hard from an outside pov, but I actually found it easier to focus and be productive when I needed to be(which translates into good grades) when I was extremely busy. I would go to class in the morning and then work in the afternoons, do homework in the gaps and on the weekends, and take PTO for midterms/finals. I would even pull out my iPad and laptop and chip away at psets on my 15-30 minute breaks at work. Shoot I would even do homework on the bus on the way to and from school. If I have an hour between classes, it\u2019s homework/study time. I think anyone who\u2019s decently capable at time management and self discipline can do it.

      "text": "I work 20 hours so not quite as extreme as your question, but I\u2019ve done high-commitment community service (one thing I did required getting a certification that involved two exams and lots of classroom time and independent study for example) on top of my work and 16-17 credit hours so I think I can still answer.\n\nFor me it largely comes down to really good long-term strategizing, and also a personality that thrives on accomplishment and action. I would always take a full course load but I would distribute my hard classes so that I had only 1 or 2 a semester and so that they usually weren\u2019t back-to-back.\n\nI also take calculated losses. If a class has drop exams or assignments I am not afraid to use them. I almost always take advantage of opportunities for bonus and I almost always show up to class. You don\u2019t need to study as much if you regularly attend class.\n\nBuilding breaks before and after harder classes in my schedule allowed me to more effectively study for them. Having my hard classes distributed meant I was less likely to get overwhelmed and didn\u2019t grow complacent from having an \u201ceasy semester\u201d, either.\n\nI had a 4.0 for most of my time in college but am in my senior year and now have a 3.9 GPA. Many would find this weird probably, but my GPA actually fell when I was doing very little.\n\nI could not handle last year with its zoom classes and being out of work and just stuck at home all day. I was a depressed zombie. I function better as someone doing 20 hours across two jobs and taking 16 credits of in-person classes than as someone doing zero hours of work and 16 credits of online classes. So again, personality definitely plays a role.\n\nThis only works if your school has an A+ system, but I also hoard A+s. I failed a class because it was labeled as a hybrid but was in reality it was really just an online class, and it\u2019s design did not mesh with my learning style. That failed class is why I now have a 3.9 GPA. If I hadn\u2019t done bonuses/studied for my \u201cA\u201d classes to make them A+s, that failed class would have hurt my GPA much more.\n\nIt was tempting in the short-term to not try for the A+ in classes I could get an A in without working too hard (like many of the general ed and lower division classes). However, I had been burned before and that helped me stick to my long-term, prepare-for-anything methods. A week into my sophomore year of high school I lost my dad suddenly to an aneurysm and subsequently obliterated my high school GPA. I didn\u2019t ruin my GPA my sophomore and Junior year of college during online classes since I had learned from my past and this time and had built a \u201cin case disaster strikes\u201d cushion. That cushion saved my butt from what could have been a hard fall.\n\nSo my last point is you have to really, really want to succeed. Doing this above all requires long-term thinking, so unless you desire this really strongly, short-term wants and impulses are going to win. You have to want to graduate with a full resume and a 4.0 in the present moment, when you\u2019re tired and it\u2019s been a long day, more than you want to lie in bed and binge YouTube and browse Reddit.",

Now this means that i have 3-5 hours of lectures every day and after that comes the tutorial sessions or practicals . So my study is my 9-5 job!! Sometimes when you failed a class you need to take a re exam and that one interfere with classes . Thats something im experiencing now so i spend week days on the normal class and weekends on the re exam! And with that my weekends are also gone. These fully depends on university and major but if it works for you try sticking to be a full time student because your grades are more important than a college-side job.",

I also work part time (jobs have varied but right now I\u2019m remote medical scribing and about to start waitressing over the break and for the spring semester) so like 20-30 hours/week. I have a 3.92 and am projecting to finish this semester next week with a 3.86 so my cumulative after this semester will be 3.89 - I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d consider that really high, but I give myself a lot of grace since I work so much. \n\nFirst thing - relationships are a distraction and waste of time, imo. I mean if you are with your high school sweetheart that you wanna marry or something, thats probably worth it. But in terms of seeking out those romantic relationships, I realized thats a huge waste of my time and emotional energy, and friendships are a better investment right now. \n\nSecond thing - When it comes to 18+ hours, its easier for me to follow the ebb and flow of the workload of each class. Sometimes there are 2-3 classes that line up in terms of exam dates. Another 2-3 classes also line up with each other, but don\u2019t line up with the first 2-3. So I take advantage of this by studying for the classes that have the test coming up sooner. Finish those 2-3 exams, and as soon as those exams are over, these 2-3 classes are on the back burner. Move on to the next 2-3 that line up. Do the same thing. Just focus on those 2-3, knock out those exams, and now those 2-3 are back burner; move on to the first set of 2-3 again. \n\nWhen I do this, I dont have to worry about the content for all 6 classes, I only keep up with whatever deadlines for EVERY class, but I don\u2019t have to study for every single class every day or even every week. \n\nFor reference, my major is speech pathology and audiology with a minor in biology and I\u2019m taking premed classes as well - this is why I take so many hours.",

Quick definitions:\n\nIntellectually gifted: how fast you learn material and apply knowledge. How naturally smart you are basically.\n\nWork Capacity: How much stress you can handle and how much energy you have per day that you can allocate to work/study/exercise, anything that is mentally or physically demanding.\n\nWork ethic: Your personal drive to do your best.\n\nI feel people who can balance a full time job and a high gpa in a hard major have basically maxed out all 3. \n\nIn my case, I have the work ethic, and the intellectual capabilities, but I lack the work capacity. I need 10 hours of sleep + 6 hours of complete rest just to feel normal. Anything less and I\u2019m a literal zombie but there\u2019s not much I can do about that.\n\nAt one point I\u2019ve worked close to 30 hours a week while getting dean\u2019s list on my pre med path + biomedical engineering and physics major. But I burned myself tf out that semester and was never able to replicate it. Since then, I\u2019ve barely worked during school and have mostly done side hustles to make a bit of money while studying full time.\n\nSome people have the work ethic and work capacity but arent gifted intellectually. These are the people you\u2019ll see working and studying non stop yet still getting mediocre grades. \n\nI think the most common one is work capacity and intellectual capacity but lack of work ethic. These are people that spend most of their time playing video games and are really good at it, but lack the motivation to do well in class even if they\u2019re more than capable.\n\nSome have all 3, some have one, and some have none.

          "text": "In regard to your point about \"intellectually gifted\", you just need to be average. Someone who is \"gifted\" is considered to be fortunate/lucky because they are either born with significantly above average intellect or they are not. And it's not common as well. Majority of the people are born with average intellect.\n\nAnyone with an average intellect is more than capable of achieving anything. And anyone with an average intellect can improve their intellect and make it grow by learning. We become smarter by learning new things as we increase neural connections. Intellect is not something that is fixed.\n\nAnd hence, it's not actually a big deal if you are not \"intellectually gifted\" but it certainly does give you an easier time if you are \"intellectually gifted\". For those who are not \"intellectually gifted\", they just have to work a bit harder and those people can achieve the same successes as those who are \"intellectually gifted\". That's the thing though, people who have average intellect have to work harder, which means more discipline is needed to get through difficult times.\n\nIt's just that those intellectually average people tend to lack discipline (not everyone) more than motivation. Those people have the drive to do things but simply lack discipline. And because of that, they think they are not intellectually good enough when the issue is actually their lack of discipline. But there are people who have average intellect and who have outstanding discipline; hence, they go out to achieve great things.\n\nSo, I think people in average with average intellect need to improve their discipline somehow. I personally don't know how to but I think this is the biggest issue because discipline is responsible for everything. Discipline helps you to stay focused, helps you to be organized and helps you better manage your time.\n\nIf you can master discipline, then a person with an average intellect can achieve incredible success. No need to be \"intellectually gifted\". Being \"intellectually gifted\" is something extra and a bonus but it's definitely not necessary for success.",

I\u2019m not sure if you have in person classes or not, but going to office hours even for the \u201cdumbest\u201d questions really helps with that. ALSO, THE BIGGEST ADVICE i Can give us that a lot of schools offer the opportunity to make classes that are not directly required for your major pass/fail, meaning that they will not go toward your GPA! (such as language classes, although it was required for the college I am in at my university, I was able to do this) you aren\u2019t able to do this with many of the harder classes that majors often require, but this may definitely help keep the load off while still allowing you to get the credit for those classes",
