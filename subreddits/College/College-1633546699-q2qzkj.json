      "text": "If the slides are complete and not a sort of 'skeleton' note, you should read them before the class. This will set you up with a very rough understanding of what's going to be covered. From there, you can spend less time writing every single word they say and more about focusing on the nuance of the material. \n\nI have a very note heavy class this semester. She provides skeleton notes in which we fill in. The first exam I scored about 10% above the class average. I'd still like to get a better grade. I've kind of gauged how she did her exam from the notes. \n\nThe class is really memorization based (Materials and Manufacturing). Now, there's no text book or anything. Now what I've been doing in class is instead of simply filling in her skeleton notes, I try and take each slide she goes over and write questions she might ask on the exam. Chances are, that's exactly what she is doing to make the exams. \n\nWithin 24 hours, I'll make them into flash cards and review them once. I use a free flash card program because I can type so much faster than write. So now instead of mindlessly reading the same notes she gives over and over, I focus more on concepts that are important and I'm working to memorize the facts. \n\nIn college, if a certain way of learning isn't working for you it's up to you to find which one would. Some classes demand certain faculties while others need a different set. It's how it goes. The first exam is always a pain, as you're figuring out how they test. After that, adjust accordingly and work hard.",

      "text": "I 100% agree with you!! In college, classes are very lecture-heavy, and if you take notes, it can be nearly impossible to get everything important down. \n\nFor my macroeconomics class, I usually just listen and not take notes because the teacher can go too fast already, and I\u2019m already struggling with the class, so if I take notes and listen, there would be no point because I\u2019d just miss a bunch of information all because the teacher is going too fast. Besides, the teacher\u2019s lectures are usually based heavily on the book, so you could just use the book for reference later.\n\nHowever, in a much easier class (in my opinion), such as communications, I do take notes. \n\nHope this helped :)!",
