  "text": "Hi all I'm looking for recommendations for academic planners! Hoping for something with daily task sections (assignments, quizzes, projects, etc), monthly overview sections, and maybe some extras (self care checklists, to do lists, etc)\n\nPreferably one that's spacious so I'm not trying to write with the font of a mouse & bonus points if it's customizable (color options and such)\n\nTIA! \u2661",
