There are specialized real estate licensing training classes. Those aren't offered at traditional universities. You can find a list of ones near you by looking up \"real estate school \\[where you live\\]\".

But if you\u2019re going to school I believe a business track will help. maybe your chosen Uni will have classes on property management, but accounting and those types of classes should help you learn how to keep track of things. Alternatively I\u2019ve heard of people working partnering with larger real estate firms, putting in the work as a grunt and then once they have an understanding of how things work build some clientele and branch out on their own.
