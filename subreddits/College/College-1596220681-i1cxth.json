Enrollment is way down, understandably. I am fully aware of the reasons why students are reluctant to go back to school. Believe me, no one is happy with this situation. Teachers hate it, admin is sleepless trying to figure out problems they didn't know existed. And of course, as always, students are the ones stuck in the middle. \n\nHere's one issue, though. Next year, let's say all is well and campuses open up. If everyone from fall 2020 waits to go back in fall 2021, there's not enough seats in the world to handle that capacity. Classes will fill immediately, and many students will be SOL. If you are already on a degree plan, take whatever classes you need to stay on it. Don't wait. Forfeiting your spot and having to re-enroll or worse, having to re-apply, is going to really set you back. At my school, our returning students (who lived through our emergency spring classes moved online) came back for fall quickly. They know it's not as bad as what people may think. \n\nIf you're a new college student, take online classes. It sucks, we're all aware it sucks. We're trying to offer both asynchronous and synchronous online classes to help meet student needs. If you find yourself not engaging with the course, reach out to the instructor. Teachers, well, we're often not aware there's an issue until someone brings it up. So bring it up. Remember that college teachers are subject matter experts, we're not pedagogy experts. \n\nDo what you need to do, take care of yourselves and don't put more pressure and anxiety on yourself. This is a temporary, albeit long, problem we're all working through. My hope for all of you is that you still attain your educational and career goals despite living in a global pandemic.

As someone who graduated in spring I have a pretty different take on it. Especially given a lot of schools' administrators really don't care about their students right now, they care about their bottom line above all. I've seen too many predatory housing contracts put out by schools (among other notices) to believe anything else.\n\nMost students rely on service jobs while in college and for many they also rely on them after they graduate until they get something better, and the service industry has been completely decimated by COVID. If you're a freshman this year (and honestly most sophomores with a ton of pre-reqs left) and you have to take out loans, go to a community college closer to home and then live at home while taking classes. Its not glamorous, but you're not getting the on-campus experience anyway so why pay for it. Especially, if you can, continue at your high school job, again it sucks but there's no reason to give it up since you will struggle to have any employment at this point.\n\nIf you're a senior, just finish. It sucks that this is how your last year will be spent (I know I defended my thesis the Friday before everything closed) but you're in a place with few options. Internships, fellowships, and other ways that you could spend the time have all but disappeared at this point and the ones that still exist have gotten super competitive. You will also be much better off with a degree than just being able to put \"some college\" on your employment applications, especially since you have to start paying back your loans 6 months after the end of the last semester you were in college.\n\nIf you're a sophomore or junior and you're in your major it really depends on what you are comfortable with. If you have loans and you can't afford to start paying them back right now, then you have to continue on with education no matter what. Even if you go part time, keep those loans in deferral status so you don't get hit with payments that you can't make. If you default on the loans, you won't be able to go back until you get the loans out of default. If you could start paying back your loans or you don't have any loans then do whatever you feel comfortable with. If you don't like online or hybrid classes, then take time off or take the fewest courses you need to stay enrolled and that won't mess up your degree plan too badly. The reality as I see it that schools are going to have to adjust the number of course sections in a year or two, or whenever COVID ends and enrollment goes back, or students just won't go back anyway.
