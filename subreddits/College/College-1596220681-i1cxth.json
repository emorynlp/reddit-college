  "text": "CC dept chair / faculty here. Enrollment is way down, understandably. I am fully aware of the reasons why students are reluctant to go back to school. Believe me, no one is happy with this situation. Teachers hate it, admin is sleepless trying to figure out problems they didn't know existed. And of course, as always, students are the ones stuck in the middle. \n\nHere's one issue, though. Next year, let's say all is well and campuses open up. If everyone from fall 2020 waits to go back in fall 2021, there's not enough seats in the world to handle that capacity. Classes will fill immediately, and many students will be SOL. If you are already on a degree plan, take whatever classes you need to stay on it. Don't wait. Forfeiting your spot and having to re-enroll or worse, having to re-apply, is going to really set you back. At my school, our returning students (who lived through our emergency spring classes moved online) came back for fall quickly. They know it's not as bad as what people may think. \n\nIf you're a new college student, take online classes. It sucks, we're all aware it sucks. We're trying to offer both asynchronous and synchronous online classes to help meet student needs. If you find yourself not engaging with the course, reach out to the instructor. Teachers, well, we're often not aware there's an issue until someone brings it up. So bring it up. Remember that college teachers are subject matter experts, we're not pedagogy experts. \n\nDo what you need to do, take care of yourselves and don't put more pressure and anxiety on yourself. This is a temporary, albeit long, problem we're all working through. My hope for all of you is that you still attain your educational and career goals despite living in a global pandemic. Colleges are trying to help. It's not perfect, but it's still there.",

Imagine going into so much debt it follows you for decades for some fuck to say \"guys just go into debt for your shit online classes or you won't get them next year\" is pretty fucking pathetic in my opinion, why would anyone pay to be told that?\n\nAlso I would like to add \"students coming back because they realize it's not that bad\" is utter bullshit, you can't just widely state \"the students know better.\" When they for sure fucking do not know better. I guess I'm just confused as to why it's the students responsibility to respond to the ineptitude of their administration. Why should we be the ones handling the aftermath of \"not having open classes in the spring semester\" as if it's somehow the responsibility of the people going into debt to also plan for the admins sake or the college's sake.\n\nIf OP could prove any of the statements they made maybe I'd be a little more convinced.",

      "text": "Alum from a 4-year uni here. You're post is interesting and something I haven't really considered...renewed interest in college if/when covid-19 situation is scaled back. For a student who wants to take a break, taking 1 or 2 classes to continue registration, is probably a good idea. Also keeps the degree plan the same.\n\n>Colleges are trying to help. It's not perfect, but it's still there.\n\nThis is the part you lose me on. From what I've seen from the university I went to, they are fumbling, big time. Their key strategy is asking every student to sign a pledge, it essentially says don't come to campus if you're sick. Easier said than done. When someone asked during a town hall how attendance & make-up would be handled, the provost responded with: it will be up to each student to coordinate with each professor. At least when I was in school, they were EXTREMELY rigid about certain aspects of the courses (such as no make-up tests, for any reason).\n\nHow can a student agree, in good conscience, to stay home if they are sick when the university won't support them in making up the associated course work?",

Its too late for me renege on my decision, as I have already notified my school and my scholarship foundation (I have a full tuition + housing scholarship). I was going to take this semester to do some self learning and work on things that could help me get future internships and such. I know there is a chance that spring semester will be roughly the same as this fall, but I'll deal with it if it comes to that.

Especially given a lot of schools' administrators really don't care about their students right now, they care about their bottom line above all. I've seen too many predatory housing contracts put out by schools (among other notices) to believe anything else.\n\nMost students rely on service jobs while in college and for many they also rely on them after they graduate until they get something better, and the service industry has been completely decimated by COVID. If you're a freshman this year (and honestly most sophomores with a ton of pre-reqs left) and you have to take out loans, go to a community college closer to home and then live at home while taking classes. Its not glamorous, but you're not getting the on-campus experience anyway so why pay for it. Especially, if you can, continue at your high school job, again it sucks but there's no reason to give it up since you will struggle to have any employment at this point.\n\nIf you're a senior, just finish. It sucks that this is how your last year will be spent (I know I defended my thesis the Friday before everything closed) but you're in a place with few options. Internships, fellowships, and other ways that you could spend the time have all but disappeared at this point and the ones that still exist have gotten super competitive. You will also be much better off with a degree than just being able to put \"some college\" on your employment applications, especially since you have to start paying back your loans 6 months after the end of the last semester you were in college.\n\nIf you're a sophomore or junior and you're in your major it really depends on what you are comfortable with. If you have loans and you can't afford to start paying them back right now, then you have to continue on with education no matter what. Even if you go part time, keep those loans in deferral status so you don't get hit with payments that you can't make. If you default on the loans, you won't be able to go back until you get the loans out of default. If you could start paying back your loans or you don't have any loans then do whatever you feel comfortable with. If you don't like online or hybrid classes, then take time off or take the fewest courses you need to stay enrolled and that won't mess up your degree plan too badly. The reality as I see it that schools are going to have to adjust the number of course sections in a year or two, or whenever COVID ends and enrollment goes back, or students just won't go back anyway. Most schools rely on adjuncts anyway so they can pretty quickly and easily add a section here and there no problem.",

I actually decided to transfer colleges and change my degree, because while I love dealing with cameras and the creative aspects of filmmaking, I don't feel like it is the degree for me because I don't want to work on film sets the rest of my life. I don't know what I want to do, but love technology, so when I transfer colleges, my new degree will be Applications and Database Management. Huge difference in majors, but might as well use the pandemic as an opportunity to try something new out, since I refuse to live on campus this fall anyways. If I stuck with my major at current college, I would be force to live on campus, which I don't believe is the right call for me. Film is not easily transferable to an online degree either, so it came down to changing majors at current school, or changing majors and switching schools, so I went with the latter.",

I got to live as an adult still, but go to more chill parties and live the whole city lifestyle instead of frat party lifestyle. The cost was less for tuition and WAY less for rent because of the area the school was in.  (It wasn't exactly a \"safe\" neighborhood, but it was amazingly affordable).",

Each appointment could be filled by one of the following: teaching freshman comp (I or II), TA-ing a large lecture class, or working in the writing center. They would also sometimes have special appointments as needed (working in other areas of the department or on projects that were needed). \n\nI got 100% tuition covered and a living stipend. The pay is generally shit, but if you wrap in the tuition and the experience you are getting, it was absolutely worth it. Also, as a GA, you tend to be more a part of the department, so I built really strong relationships with the faculty and other GAs. \n\nA couple notes about this: \n1) These tend to be available for more academic degrees. There aren't many GA positions floating around for MBA programs. The more freshman classes your department teaches (math, English, etc), the more positions are out there. In many sciences, there are also research and lab positions. \n \n2) GA positions are rarer for master's degrees than PhDs. If your degree has a PhD, chances are all the positions are going to them. I specifically chose my school in part because they didn't offer a PhD, and I wanted a GA position for my Master's. \n \n3) For many programs, and depending on what you want to do with the degree after, a lot of people would say you shouldn't get a graduate degree if you don't get a GA position - basically, make them pay for it. This isn't true of all situations (like a Master's in Social Work, MBA, or if you already have a good job), but is a good idea if you are looking at going into higher ed or a really competitive field. The logic behind this is that if you aren't competitive enough to get a GA position, you likely aren't going to get a job in the field. And you are learning so much in the GA position and getting so many experiences from it that graduates without that often can't compete against those that did have GA positions. So, it's worth it to shop around for grad school nationwide and find the school that will pay for you to go.",

Cancelled a week before his departure. \n\nSorry for the rant, this all just fucking sucks so much. I worked so hard in my major and was so damn excited for the Gulf Coast and Georgia. They're the thing people in my major look forward too. And all the time I spent to go on that amazing fully paid trip. And the past three months I could of been getting experience doing something I adore.\n\nShit makes me wanna cry.",

I kinda want to take a year off to focus on something on side, learn something else and try to get a full time good paid job, but she thinks its easy to finish uni. It's a fucking drag man, they fucked us so hard with the online courses and exams now, they made them 3 times harder than physical exams. I mean, I didnt fail that much in winter's semester but summer one is fucking hell. And im not the only one.",

Otherwise, college will always be there as a backup plan.\n\nIronically, I started grad school a year ago because I couldn't find the ideal job with my BS right away. And in the middle of this crisis is when I find a fantastic job that's easily convinced me to drop out of college.\n\nI agree that it'll likely be that much harder without any degree, but it's still worth a shot.",

If you make it ~1-3 years into earning a college degree and still have no prior education or preparation beyond what you did in high school, you're behind the curve. There's absolutely no reason to not have *any* marketable skills by that point. Fix that.\n\n>starts pay at $40k\n\nAlso a bit overly demanding. Maybe it might make sense for high CoL areas like the Bay Area or something like that (can't speak to the job market in those areas, either). Being able to get by on ~$25-$30k/yr *starting* is a lot more sensible, especially at such an entry level position where there are some solid early promotion opportunities.\n\n>what kind of full-time secure job\n\nRight off the top of my head, decent full-time careers that I've seen **first-hand** that take people on with unfinished college degrees:\n\nAdministrative workers, secretaries, and sales representatives - just gotta have the people skills and gusto to succeed\n\nProgrammers - just make sure you have a solid programming portfolio\n\nMost things IT - knock out some quick certifications if you need to and have the knack for it. I expect that IT is only even more in demand due to all the changes needing to be made to accommodate distance work.\n\nTechnicians/operators - I've most commonly seen it from engineering school dropouts that built up their hands-on experience on their own time",
