  "text": "So today we were taking a test in our lab in my college course. A few guys from the class and I were going to go hang out afterwards but while we were waiting in a designated waiting area that was set up we were all talking. The professor came up to us and told to \"not cuss\". Now this guy has also yelled at us for packing up .5 seconds before class is dismissed and has gotten pissed at us for asking him questions so idk if this means he is a bad professor or not. He always has to be a control freak and is weirdly rude",

      "text": "This seems like a mix. Packing up before class ends (even if it\u2019s only a few seconds) is usually considered rude, and if you asked questions that were answered already elsewhere (ie, syllabus, announcements, instructions), then it would make sense that he would be annoyed. As for telling you that you shouldn\u2019t \u201ccuss,\u201d that\u2019s not his business unless y\u2019all were being disruptively loud (it doesn\u2019t sound like you were).",

          "text": "Yeah we really weren't. It was 6 of us and he went out of his way to come up to us. He stood by us for a few minutes and said something like \"I'm not trying to be your mom but y'all need to keep swearing to a minimum\" just for absolutely no reason. Also I understand that packing up early can be a bit disruptive but he treats it like a \"bell doesn't dismiss you, I do\" type of thing which is why I have an issue with it.",
