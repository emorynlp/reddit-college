Most universities have declared their plans well in advance - none, that I am aware of, are \"opting out\" of Spring Break. They made a decision (most likely in summer 2020) to adjust their entire academic calendar. Some are adding random 1 or 2 day breaks throughout the semester, some are just plowing through, but very few (if any) are suddenly changing their plans - that would be expensive.\n\nTo answer your question - if you can't survive 15 weeks of working about 18 hours a week (that's what a typically full college course load is) and using the rest of your time to manage things like getting your homework done, eating meals, maybe having a job, and taking care of yourself, maybe you are simply taking life a little too seriously. College isn't hard. Busy? Maybe sometimes. But it isn't hard work. You don't need a break every 2 months. Sure, it would be nice, but you don't need it. If you want a hard reset, take the weekend to evaluate why the hell you're in college in the first place.
