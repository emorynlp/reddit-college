  "text": " When this semester started, I followed a pretty strict routine I set up for myself so that I could achieve everything I wanted to in a day and stay on top of my school work. Recently, I have felt my motivation start to decline but I still have eight weeks left in the semester. I am not trying as hard as I should and I am becoming a little lazier. I feel like this weekend I need a \"hard reset\" if that makes sense to ground myself a little to make sure I stay motivated and on task and so that I  don't crash and burn too early. Any and all suggestions are appreciated!",

      "text": "As strange as it may sound to some of the more secular students, I'd advise taking a page out of Genesis. God took a day off after Creation and rested, basking in the goodness of His work. This is where the Sabbath day comes from and it's not just something for spiritually-minded people. Humans, from this perspective, are literally not built to work non-stop and need to rest (and I know there are tons of research materials that will back me up on this). So, regardless of how you spend that day, take a day every week for yourself and do something to relax your body, mind, and spirit. If need be, work ahead during the week to provide yourself that time. And, for what it's worth, I'll be praying for all of us students. Hope you have/had a great day!",

Sometimes I look at my to do list and just break down completely. But I keep telling myself this is the homestretch and if I can just get through the next 6 weeks things will get better.",

Most universities have declared their plans well in advance - none, that I am aware of, are \"opting out\" of Spring Break. They made a decision (most likely in summer 2020) to adjust their entire academic calendar. Some are adding random 1 or 2 day breaks throughout the semester, some are just plowing through, but very few (if any) are suddenly changing their plans - that would be expensive.\n\nTo answer your question - if you can't survive 15 weeks of working about 18 hours a week (that's what a typically full college course load is) and using the rest of your time to manage things like getting your homework done, eating meals, maybe having a job, and taking care of yourself, maybe you are simply taking life a little too seriously. College isn't hard. Busy? Maybe sometimes. But it isn't hard work. You don't need a break every 2 months. Sure, it would be nice, but you don't need it. If you want a hard reset, take the weekend to evaluate why the hell you're in college in the first place. If that doesn't motivate you, then go try something else.",

I had a big midterm the Friday after that first one so I never got a break. The goal of them was to prevent people from traveling, but that hasn't really worked because people are just traveling during school now and doing their classes online. I'm getting through better than some because I opted to take last semester off from classes (except one through a community college), but I sure as hell have no intention of doing any classes this summer if I don't have to. I can't wait for this semester to be over with.",

For me just having someone to help take a little bit of my responsibilities (cooking, cleaning, etc.) off of my plate for a week is immensely helpful. I plan to get my schoolwork done from 8-5 while they are at work, then spend evenings with them or hometown friends.

And do not feel guilty about it. When you rest even for just half a day or one day you will be able to think more clearly when you get back to work. If you keep overworking yourself you could burn out and I think it's better if you miss some assignments or don't work too hard on some assignments than to go completely crazy. I think it's so stupid how we don't have a spring break this year..... I think spring break is needed!!!! I've been trying to not take school so seriously and it's helping. Good luck!! :)",

If I recall correctly, that's what the student body at my school did last semester because we didn't have a fall break. So the 5 days off that were supposed to go towards your spring break should be distributed throughout the semester. I know it's not the same as a week-long spring break, but it might help some people out. Bring this idea to your SGA (or some organization/person with \"power\") and hopefully, they could get the ball rolling",
