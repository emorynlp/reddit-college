  "title:": "Im jealous of everyone having the university experience",
  "text": "So, recently I had to take a gap year, and now im in my freshman year of college online. I'm jealous of everyone having the best of the college experience. All my friends are having the best time of their lives. Partying, free, exploring, I can't even watch college drama shows cause I can't relate at all. It makes me cry cause I never had that experience. I'm transferring to a university and I feel like I wasted my best years in covid and my mother will never support me cause she's pretty narcissistic. I remember asking my friend about her experience and she kinda rubbed it all in my face and I feel like im missing out. I'm lonely and feel like im wasting my best years cause of this pandemic. I feel like something is wrong with me cause I didn't go right after college and feel like im a judge cause im in a junior college. I honestly want to isolate myself. I don't think I want to continue the cause of it either. I have been repressing these emotions cause of how I demonized these emotions. I'm jealous of not getting the chance to be in a dorm im jealous my mom literally and purposely didn't put the funds in me going to college cause of her jealously of me continuing with life. \n\nI'm crying cause I made all the grades but it feels like I never continued my life afterward...I've been repressing these emotions for so long.",

      "text": "These aren't the best years of your life. College can be a hectic, confusing, stressful time for the majority of students (sometimes because they're so concerned about their \"college experience\"). College drama shows are so fake it's crazy. Most people are spending their time studying. And if they do party all the time, they are in class the next day complaining about how they partied too much and can't focus on their work. Everyone wants everyone else to think they are having the time of their lives because that's the expectation, but it's mainly just for show. You can have a good time in college but you can have an even better time after you graduate, make some money, and can afford to go to all the bars, clubs, and parties you want. Your mid to late twenties are way better in my opinion. At least that was my experience.",
