  "title:": "Is taking Biology+ Lab(another class), Chemistry +Lab(another class), Psychology, English, and Japanese (7 classes) in college too much?",
  "text": "I moved from another country to the US 3 years ago, and I thought there will be no difficulty taking these classes, but I found myself taking so much time working on my English assignment such as essays, and there are so many things to memorize for Biology. It's still doable, but I would rather focus on raising my GPA by taking fewer classes because I'm planning to transfer to another college for better education. So, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to drop either Biology or Psychology.\n\n(It's required to take biology and chemistry with each of its lab courses.)",

      "text": "I did one semester where I only did chemistry and biology, both with labs, and I still struggled to keep up. I can imagine it might be a little harder to do anything other than school with a course load like this. \n\nBut that\u2019s just me :)",
