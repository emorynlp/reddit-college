  "text": "I\u2019m a business major and I get a lot of shit from STEM majors about it. So many of them are arrogant and obnoxious.\n\nIf I even complain about one thing related to school like for example \u201cugh this exam is gonna be so hard\u201d, some random STEM major always has to be like \u201ctry being a STEM major where we ACTUALLY have hard classes\u201d or some variation of that.\n\nLike okay I get it, STEM classes are hard. No one is arguing that. I genuinely do have respect for STEM majors bc I understand it is very difficult and requires a lot of sacrifices.\n\nBut business is no walk in the park either. My classes are very challenging and time consuming and I work my ass off to get good grades. It\u2019s not like I sit on my ass all day twiddling my thumbs. I actually have to study, do homework, attend office hours, etc just like any normal college student does. I get very stressed out too. I\u2019m not saying I have it HARDER than a STEM major, just that I don\u2019t have it easy.\n\nAlso, I go to a pretty reputable business school and live in a major city with great job prospects. I think I\u2019m gonna be just fine after college so it\u2019s really annoying when STEM majors say \u201clol good luck finding a job with that degree.\u201d Like I know SEVERAL people with business degrees making good money, why do some people assume that anything other than a STEM degree means you\u2019ll be working at McDonald\u2019s?\n\nIt\u2019s just annoying to me this superiority complex that so many STEM majors have. You\u2019re not better than me for majoring in STEM, you just have different interests/strengths than me and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nIt\u2019s like I can\u2019t even feel proud of my accomplishments bc I\u2019m not a STEM major so everyone just assumes that my classes are easy and I don\u2019t have to work for my grades which isn\u2019t true at all. It\u2019s frustrating.",

      "text": "I think it depends on the type of stem and the type of non-stem, and much more than that difference. Accounting majors have it far simpler than perhaps a Pre-med student given the workload. Yet at the same time a Statistics major may not have it as difficult as a music major. It only doesn't depend on stem vs non stem but rather how well funded the programs are at a particular school or what the school focusses on academically, the way the class is structured and the individuals strengths. For example I'm gonna give two classes as an example. Discrete Mathematics and Intro to Japanese. I got a similar grade on both classes. Discrete Mathematics as a class was far easier as opposed to Japanese. Before you come at my throat saying that Japanese is a hard language, I happen to be multilingual who can speak, read and write English, Tamil, French and Hindi. The reason for it being difficult was due to the workload of class and the constant pressure by the teachers. In Discrete the pressure was less, and the professors were lot more forgiving on homework. I go to a fairly small liberal arts school. The reason why Chemistry and Physics are see as notoriously harder classes isn't because each subject is difficult but rather because those departments are poorly funded because many students don't take those classes unless required for those majors. When a department is poorly funded, it might become hard for students to get the help required for those classes, and thus it gets the reputation of being bad classes to take. Another fallacy that many college students fail to realize is that planning is incredibly important. You can take all your hard classes in one semester. You need to plan. I had a former friend who took Organic chemistry, intro to physics and Calc-2 all in one semester despite having completed the Ap requirements that would have had her placed out of those classes. So, if students plan well then they have the ability to have a much free schedule as opposed to those who don't",

Now that they have a slightly hire position on the social ladder they want to take out all their pent up rage on anyone they view as inferior, which to them means anyone who isn't a numbers person.\n\nThe other thing is that STEM fields are seen as more profitable in the long run (although this obviously isn't always the case), and if we've established these people don't have much of a social life, they are likely to place more value on money than people.\n\nI do not mean to say all STEM major's are like this; my major is more or less a hybrid of LA and STEM (Game Design) and I know plenty of awesome people from both sides of the field, as well as plenty of not so awesome people. At the end of the day, intelligence can take many forms; any skill that was acquired through study and practice is a symbol of intellect.",

Nope.\n\nWhen I see some ppl on here say that this is why the STEM majors are bitter, I can only say that this behaviour reflects more on them than anything else.

Meanwhile, there's a pre-med, nursing, or engineering student who is LIVID at the fact that the professor DARED to give them an F or a D because they didn't make eye contact and just read their note cards like a robot. All the sudden they are asking ME \"How is this so easy for you? This was supposed to be my bullshit class, but she's such a tough grader. How do you just get up in front of the class and just talk so easily??\"  She's not a \"tough grader,\" when you were given a rubric that clearly outlined the necessity to make eye contact and be expressive. It is baffling to think you can simply just not do crucial parts of the assignment and still revieve a passing grade...\n\nI used to go math tutoring when I was still getting my gen eds, because I knew that math didn't come easy to me. On the flip side there is a kid who finds math a breeze, but then has trouble when it comes to writing. Just cause I find writing comes easy to me, doesn't mean I'll shit on the kid who has to go to the writing lab and that he should shit on me for needing math tutoring. Neither of us are 'stupid', we just have different strengths and abilities that different subjects cater to better. \n\nCommunication majors and Business majors being regarded as 'jokes' in the college world: \ud83e\udd1d",

While in reality it should be \"why people from different majors put each other down?\" or even \"Why people put each other down?\". I've heard people from STEM schools make fun of business and economics majors, but I as well heard people from business make fun of people who study in art schools, but also don't think that people from non-STEM schools don't make fun of STEM students, have you ever heard something like \"are we gonna invite those nerds to the party\"? And I literarily had this sad to my face when I told that I study Cybernetics \"Oh, so you have to be a nerd, right?\". Though I let it slide as a joke, as it probably was a joke, but this wasn't something that I enjoyed much, since this wasn't a person from whom I could tolerate this. \n\nIt's not something that is unique only to STEM students, everybody does this. Of course it doesn't mean that it has to be this way, but it is what it is.\n\nOn the other hand, this doesn't have to be strictly negative, it can be like a friend poking a friend and nobody means this seriously. Like when somebody from STEM tells you \"good luck finding a job\" you can just reply \"well good luck finding a girlfriend\" and you can have a laugh together if you have a good sense of self irony. But of course you need to have a certain level of rapport, like for example in that situation above I couldn't replay \"Oh, and you must be unemployed\", which I think is a good come back in that situation, but I was on a tinder date after all :D",

And I got continually grilled and judged over my major (Psychology), despite being a Science major as well. \n\nHowever, a lot of the people that made fun of me either disappeared after the first year (due to dropping out of school), or switched into an Arts program.\n\nWhen I switched fields (Computer Science), I noticed the same behaviour. I took a Philosophy logic class, and there is a mandatory Computer Science version that I had to take. Because of this, I took the Philosophy version because I needed Philosophy credits for my program. I guess some people had the same idea because I ran into a few Comp. Sci students in the class as well. There was a particular guy who would boast about how easy the class was because they were in Computer Science, and since we had already covered this material, this class should be a piece of cake.\n\nI sat directly behind him in class, allowing me to see his assignment marks. I'm not gonna lie, I had so much satisfaction seeing that their marks were *terrible*. There were clearly various Art majors doing much better at grasping these mathematical concepts than he was.\n\nSome people also held superiority over the kids in a coding college program over a university degree. It boggled my mind, as I found that the former got hired more easily than the latter. I even know of people from the former category who got a higher pay than those with university degrees.\n\nSo, I don't know why people do it. Superiority complex, perhaps?

There are plenty of decent people in STEM, especially as you get older and people mature though.\n\nI'm now a senior and I did a couple semesters pursuing engineering but switched back to my Math major, and let me tell you it's not hard enough to develop a superiority complex based on it lol. Yeah it's difficult, but it's really just more challenging in different areas of thinking then social sciences and business etc.. I guess over always been interested in most subjects so I never really thought it made sense to compare STEM and other fields on some arbitrary spectrum of difficulty. In fact I think understanding concepts associated with social sciences on a deeper level would be challenging for most STEM majors, as it was for me which is why I became really interested in my lib eds. \n\nAnyways don't sweat it, you gotta remember these kids just came out of high school, which is not as different as you'd think it'd be from college.",

I love stem and I love my second major. A lot of it might just be because STEM majors wished they had more time to be a college student. I spent most of my days in a room studying by myself while my friends are hanging out. That\u2019s fine, and there are of course days where I wish I didn\u2019t have to study and I could hang out with them but, it\u2019s not necessarily because I\u2019m smarter than them or more hardworking or more successful. I chose this because I wanted it but other people who chose this path might not have made this choice as willingly. We envy your time and in some cases, it\u2019s just easier to cope by putting non-stem majors down. That\u2019s not right of course and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that but, I\u2019ve learned the best way to avoid this is by not complaining about workload. It essentially fosters an environment to compete about how hard your course load is. I get it, it\u2019s nice to be able to talk about it, but talk about it to someone who can empathize with your hardships will make it easier.",

      "text": "Want a different change of scenery over STEM students complaining? The Arts. The Arts are incredibly difficult in a manner than no STEM major could ever understand. At least in the field of hard science, everything has a reason, a proper method, and it\u2019s rather straightforward. 1+1 will almost always equal 2.\n\nBut the Arts? Nah. Music is almost entirely theory-based. My final for my last Music Theory class was to dissect and explain different parts of a very difficult piece, that modulated from key to key almost nonstop and explain why it does or doesn\u2019t work (and sometimes there was no modulation, there were only some accidentals to trick you), to identify themes on motifs hidden throughout the entire piece, to vaguely interpret the reason why the composer did one thing or another and then back it up from examples from other sections in the piece. Now add fake 7 chords that try to trip you up, and make you think you\u2019re in one key while you\u2019re really in another. The Arts is a field where 1+1 is more likely to equal 3 or 4, rather than 2. There\u2019s nothing straight-forward or simple about it, despite what so many other majors like to say.\n\nAnd now I feel the need to say that you\u2019re going to run into difficulties no matter what field you go into. A STEM major shouldn\u2019t ever put down others just because they don\u2019t deem another field \u201chard enough\u201d. We work just as hard as you, maybe even more. In order to graduate \u201con time\u201d, the average Art major has to have upwards of 18-20 credit hours a semester...that\u2019s maybe 9-12 classes (and no I\u2019m not exaggerating...I had a mandatory class that was worth no credits and met at very specific times).\n\nDon\u2019t ever be an asshole about majors.

At my school the vast majority of business majors come from already wealth backgrounds with loads of familial connections. Those who don't are in fraternities and have access to those wealthy professional networks. They all get great jobs coming out of colleges despite doing nothing but party for 4 years. Conversely STEM majors at my school typically come from less wealthy backgrounds and need the STEM degree for job security. I think STEM majors are jealous that they have to work their asses off, taking more credits and objectively harder classes, only to end up working under a project manager with a business degree who has no real understanding of the technical aspects of the projects. \n\nUltimately I think this all goes away at the PhD level. Because, I would argue undergraduate stem is objectively harder than undergraduate business or humanities, but a PhD in STEM is just as important as a PhD in liberal arts/humanities.",

When you're being told that over and over again you develop a god complex over the supposedly \"lessor\" majors. Especially in the US, this dichotomy has gotten to the point of being a fetish and a meme. \n\nAs someone who switched from STEM to applied art and humanities disciplines (so I know a good number of people from both of those types of fields), STEM is not a sure thing and supposedly \"lessor\" majors are also not assured destruction. The number of people I know who studied STEM in well known high-ranking programs who are now working $12.00/hr jobs unrelated to their major is significantly higher than you would expect. On the flip side, the number of people I know who majored in humanities or applied arts disciplines at not super well known schools who are now making a comfortable amount of money is also significantly higher than you would think.\n\n**Tl;dr:** its been systemically shoved down everyone's throats that you need to study STEM or you are lessor than the people studying STEM, which is a huge lie. Study what you like and what you are good at because then you can excel at what you are studying and therefor do better in the long run.",

Part of that reason is just that we have so many classes that we have to take, it's hard to meet other people outside if the major.  While some classes may be easier to pass than, let's say calc 2 (one of my husband's least favorite classes as a mechanical engineer...I met him because he randomly got out in the music dorm and was paired with one of my friends), our class load is insane.  At one point on Mondays I had a different class every hour from 8am to 7:20pm with a one hour lunch break at 4pm (barely lunch at that point).  I took 20 credits that semester so I could graduate in time (I couldn't afford to also take summer classes).  Although not every semester was this crazy, most of them were.  I was never able to take less than 18 credits to graduate on time.\n\nSo...at one point I got a job in said music dorm.  A lot of other majors did live there, and most of the music majors were really part of their own community, not the dorm community (we were almost never there lol).  All of the people I worked with had like 2-3 classes a day, and trying to pick up shifts was a nightmare because my schedule was very loaded.  However, I still got so many comments about \"oh I wish I could just do music and sick all day, I'd love that\", as they spend their entire afternoon watching friends.\n\nThis dynamic really sent me into a huge depression through college.",

And the fact is that they don't understand STEM majors. While yes they can have it hard too but they often don't know what their hard is compared to stem major. For example my friend did essays ahead to have some free time (which is amazing btw) and I was complaining that I too want to do that. And she was like \"just do it then\". But what she doesn't get is that I am taught the material a week or two before a certain homework is due. I can't do things ahead.",

Turns out that this nonsense doesn\u2019t stop once you graduate, nor is it confined to STEM. \n\nNatural Science colleagues talk smack about the Humanists for being useless and the Social Scientists for not being \u201creal\u201d scientists. Humanists diss Social Scientists for talking about the people who created the sacred texts and how these texts affect other people. And they\u2019re pissed that students are flocking to Social Science and out of the Classics. Humanists also have a serious inferiority complex related to Natural Science, and start shrieking about how numbers don\u2019t matter whenever someone shows up with a frequency table. Social Scientists hate each other, because we all think that our discipline is the only one that really matters. \n\nFor a group of people that care about learning and knowledge, many profs think that they\u2019re discipline is the best and the stuff other people work on is a waste of time. It\u2019s pathetic. \n\nTLDR: the scope of intellectual dismissiveness goes beyond STEM, and it permeates the entire academy. So many Narcissists.",

I guess it is because the first two years is a very different experience for stem and non-stem majors. I had a different one because I took senior level classes my first year of college since my degree didn\u2019t have a specific plan to follow, it was hell because I didn\u2019t know how to write a 20 page paper on the metaethics.

I never understood two things: one, the point of one-upping to prove your intellectual competence as though *how* you are during in the course doesn't matter as much as the merit of the major itself. And two: the entire \"everyone is smart in their own way\" BS.\n\nBut, think I've been starting to believe the latter. I went to HS with a bunch of strongly math-minded individuals who picked it up because it just... worked for them. This and that does this, whereas this is not possible as you don't have this in this topic. Yada yada.\n\nBut apart from maybe one, all of them were completely mediocre and simultaneously looked down on anything that was highly verbally-oriented. Think the same principals of logic but presented in a manner that involved whatever verbal nuances.\n\nSimilar to this post, a general pattern in the world will show you that most intelligent/gifted individuals seem to be more oriented spatially as opposed to verbally (with a very small % having an even bias) - which would also, in turn, explain the volume of people pursuing STEM that are not as seemingly intelligent when it comes to manifesting such outside of their respective field.\n\nI seriously don't understand the need to put down another major. Your brain is wired a certain way, as is mine, and if we tackle the fundamental principles through our predisposed wiring, then superiority arises when the math-minded can switch to following basic verbal-minded principles, whereas the converse is often lost in translation. Maybe it's a thing about higher level logic, and math-minds making the translation from verbal to math (without manifesting it conversely) requires some level of high intelligence that they think verbal-minds lack as a result of only *seeming* slightly superior in the verbal facet? Lots of questions. I dunno.",

      "text": "Overall, it's arbitrary to make comparisons between majors because it's apples to oranges. STEM majors are typically more about rote memorization simply by nature, for example, with math you need to know X, Y, and Z and be able to perform flawlessly (i.e., complete mastery is required) or you get the answer wrong, because it's black and white. Other majors may be time consuming or require a different skill set, like logical argumentation and synthesis of concepts/sources, such as in philosophy. Regardless, even if there were to be some objective universal measurement for which were \"harder\" (how you obtain this metric, I've no idea as it would very from one person to the next) it doesn't mean your struggles and experiences are any less valid. Additionally, even if these statements are true and a humanities degree is less rigorous than say computer science, why should anyone care? Should we select majors solely for their difficulty? It's a truly inane point to argue. I feel it's just a way to devalue others' choices and interests, sadly.",

      "text": "It's because non-STEM majors are pursuing their naiive interests instead of focusing on their career. Especially since a non-STEM major is a huge waste of time and money. (If you are in law or business or medical, we consider you worthy of respect since you value your career). Lawyers, business managers, medical practitioners, STEM careers, are the holy grail money makers of society. If the rest of you are going to study something similar in value to a \"studies\" major we treat you like the children you are. If you don't take college seriously, we won't respect you because you don't deserve it. We are here to make money. That's the purpose of college. If you are not going in with that mindset, then what the fuck are you doing here except wasting space?\n\nThe sentiment above is how we see you (non- serious majors), because we are in a capitalist society in philosophy, in practice, and as an economic system. We embrace exploitism, and since you don't stick to those values like we do, we reserve our right to withold respect for you. We see you as weak and as a useless eaters. We don't have empathy like soft skill majors do because we don't have time to make nice; we're here to get shit done. We create everything that is practical in society.  We are the gods of creation. Without us, the world would cease to function. Therefore yes, this is why we have god complex.  We see you and we think, \"You're in my way, child.\"\n\nThe STEM major who put you down, he's a moron for putting you down.  Business majors are vital to selling the shit we engineer. Not every engineer is culturally aware as the rest.  Some of us are assholes for ignorance. Some of us are assholes for Honor. Some of us are assholes because we crave prestige and superiority. Some just want to get their degree and don't care. \n\nI on the other hand, I treat money makers with respect, and I like to enjoy my time with people who don't want to have a money-maker career.  Non-career majors are fun to be around, but I don't see them as reliable people unless I know them to be different already.  There's something bold about non-career majors. (Non-[traditional] career majors) They will remain true to what they care for despite the world; that or they're privileged fucks.\n\nEDIT: btw we chose STEM because we hate writing and reading.  The bio and chem majors have it harder. Medical scientists are crazy for delving into that since no sensical engineer would touch that shit. Science is complicated.  Machines and numbers are easier.  But us STEM majors cannot comprehend abstract concepts like themes or psychology or body language or keep pace with legalese or understand customer bias. Social science is too complicated for most of us. Can't write essays to save our lives, so we bury our heads in the sands of numbers.",

I'm not trying to make an excuse or provide an oversimplified answer as to why this is, but I agree the superiority complex is definitely real.\n\nI promise you that anyone who puts you down for your major probably feels insecure and is jealous of smarter people in their own major. I don't give a shit if you get straight As without studying and consistently are the top student in the class, there will always be someone smarter.\n\nThose people need to learn to develop their character and try to respect other's feelings and even if they don't understand the exact situation they're going through or think they need to one up your struggles. Wisdom is wisdom, and is not relegated to science.\n\nA lot of people on reddit love to say \"oh just get over it, don't listen to them, they're just assholes\" as if pretending that their words aren't hurtful will make the problem go away. I say, be hurt, get your emotions out, cry, and confide in those who love you and don't say hateful things. Then you can work as hard as you can and in your own conduct will set an example to those who are putting you down.",

It made for immediate competition and some of the most irritating conversations I've ever had- \"oh youre doing public health? Yeah I'm pre med, plus I'm minoring in chemistry. Oh pre med? Well I'm biochem, im SO passionate about research. Oh you want to do vet med? Shouldn't you be in with the farm people?\" and on and on and on. Suddenly everyone felt like they had to prove that they were the smartest. As mentioned previously, social skills didn't always come with the academic skills. Luckily I found that most of that wore off after the first year or two.\n\n Frankly it's dumb to put down people based on their course of study, especially when they're so different. Its apples and oranges. My degree was in ecology and evolution, im currently in veterinary school, and I dont know shit about finance. I'm gonna need to find someone with a business degree to help me run a clinic eventually, and I'd love to meet an engineer or chemist or researcher that doesnt work for a company that's run by someone with a business degree.",

      "text": "As someone who pursued two different STEM paths and finally decided to study humanities I can give a perspective. \n\nI used to even make fun of my business major friends. \n\nI don't think everyone in STEM is like this but I was absolutely miserable in STEM, and I was good at it, which made me resent people who did things that seemed \"easier\" or were really just what they wanted to do. \n\nA lot of kids get pushed into STEM for whatever reasons these days and then there is a really toxic competitive environment that shows up.  A lot of professors make it worse too, like by not acknowledging your mental health or the fact you may have to work in college.  It becomes a competition. \"Well, Bob over here worked 40 hours this week and got an A on his exam so why didn't you?\" \n\nThis gets coupled with a huge lack of perspective.  You're not really encouraged to hang out with humanities students from my experience and you definitely aren't encouraged to take more than just basic level humanities courses.  I mean all my STEM advisers treated humanity courses as a joke and would purposely try and put me in the easiest ones.  A lot of people then take this perspective and apply it to all humanities courses thinking they are unnecessary or too easy, which couldn't be further from the truth.  \n\nSTEM and humanities are equally as hard in my opinion, just in different ways.  In humanities you don't have to memorize a lot but you have to start understanding and thinking critically about problems.  Other STEM degrees are like that, and some are more memory focused as well.  The culture around STEM degrees makes it appear more difficult though and promotes isolation so that people can keep thinking they are superior.",

I could mostly bs my way through most of my English, philosophy, and, etc papers. This is not true for math and science. You have to really know the material and the material itself can be very difficult. Also, most STEM fields provide a much higher base salary than non-stem fields, and in the US I think people mostly tie their own self worth and their estimation of other people's worth to salary. It's fucked up, and we shouldn't do that to be clear, but there's definitely a subconscious bias to be found there. They're also the majors most likely to allow you to contribute to the advancement of technology in some capacity. There are more reasons, but these are the main ones that come to mind.",

Like you're saying offensive things in a nice way...? My reply to your claim that STEM majors are more difficult than non-STEM majors is that no one can make a valid comparison for that because we only have a surface level view of any major program that we're not a part of. The topics you're learning may be more difficult, but there are some majors that might look wistfully at your life as a STEM major because they have even less free time than you. Programs even vary widely across universities. Being a psych major can genuinely be a blow off at one school and the hardest of another. No one can make a comparison.",

Many STEM majors are competitive, and those people new to college (esp. at \"higher ranked\" schools that attract turbo-nerds) might no longer find themselves to be the biggest academic minnows of their little high school ponds. Upon scoring closer to the class medium than previously comfortable, they cling to what vestiges of their \"smart\" identities they can, rather than coming to terms with their newfound mediocrity. Desperately reaching out for a new punching bag they find the \"STEM > Humanities\" meme and breathe a sigh of relief realizing that, despite their struggles, they're at least not the lowest of the low. And if they\u2019d only stooped to such easy majors themselves, surely they\u2019d dominate like the intellectual juggernauts they really are.\n\nThere's also plenty of intra-STEM dick swinging, too, as others have mentioned. Back in college I'd majored in biology and geology, which were broadly regarded as the softest of the STEM disciplines lol.\n\nPart of it might also be driven by general unfamiliarity with what sort of work other fields even contain. In grad school I \"majored\" in anthropology and taught lots of workshops on computational stats, which were fairly widely attended by students from cs, physics, bioinformatics, etc. programs. I'm pretty terrible at math & programming, tbh, but generally knew and used on a daily basis lots more of it than attendees of those workshops who ostensibly came from more \u201cquantitative\u201d fields (a biased sample, to be sure, but still). I think many people don't seem to recognize the breadth of methods popular in other disciplines lol.",

A lot of people, even on this thread, are confidently claiming that STEM majors are working harder than people in non-STEM majors but no one has an idea of what people in other majors actually do and are making those claims based on stereotypes portrayed in movies or one person's experience. I wouldn't feel comfortable making that statement as every class I've taken outside my field has challenged me in some way or the other. Even if a major at a particular school is easy, it could be a different story at another school.",

Due to the competitive nature of most STEM fields (beginning with undergrad acceptance, then grad school, post docs, jobs, etc.), there\u2019s a lot of inherent competition between grad students, that extends to non-STEM majors. (And that\u2019s not really fair or welcome.) \n\nAlso, sometimes, STEM majors really lose themselves in the process and derive a lot of their self worth from academic success. So they tend to over-share and brag about science/classes/difficulty because.... well, it\u2019s consumed their lives. It doesn\u2019t help that most STEM fields self-select for people that do this, developing a super toxic culture that kind of permeates everywhere.",

          "text": "My now-ex and I graduated in high school in 2020 and go to the same local university. She\u2019s a Psychology major and I\u2019m a Mechanical Engineering major. An AB at our school requires an average of 15 credit hours while engineering (and basically all STEM majors for a BS) require a 16.5 average. \n\nShe is an absolutely brilliant girl but she was the only person in my circle outside of the engineering department. Hearing her struggle every day so much those first couple months of college taking only one class that wasn\u2019t a general requirement that I also have to meet (it was an upper level Psych course because we both did the AP credit in high school), while I\u2019m over here in two introductory engineering classes, Calc I, and Chemistry on top of literally being in two of the same classes as she was was tough to be supportive. The girl has always had this amazing work ethic and she\u2019s absolutely brilliant, but the two classes she had the biggest complaints about were the ones we shared and they were some of my easiest. \n\nOn top of that, she lived on campus and went out often multiple times a week with her friends while I\u2019m managing a job on top of classes and trying to maintain some social life. It\u2019s tough to not only be supportive, but refrain from having a measuring contest when I felt that I was objectively working harder. Love and miss her more than anything but that\u2019s the only real example I have.",

              "text": "I think this example is really apt. It\u2019s really hard not to compare when one person is taking 1/10th of your workload and complaining about it. I have a foot in engineering and in the humanities, so I\u2019ll speak to this.\n\nPart of maturing is being able to exercise restraint. Not everyone is able to be put under intense pressure, and even if some people are just genuinely lazy, it doesn\u2019t really affect you.\n\nAlot of the younger students don\u2019t fully understand why they\u2019re being subjected to hellish amounts of work while their peers are allowed to skate by, and imo learning to deal with that difference in workload is part of the education. \n\nThe people who are undergoing this lash out at first, before realizing that there are healthier ways to cope, which can get the people in their programs a bad rap. This is all natural and part of the process- you can generally see the higher workload become normalized over time and the people taking these workloads become more intellectually assured, emotionally capable, and learn to handle various types of pressure in a more effective way. It\u2019s a lot like hazing rituals, and it may not be the most effective or good way to teach, but it\u2019s the one that has worked for generations.\n\nAs an anecdote, when confronted with questions about mental health, the director of my chemE program responded \u201cit was this way when I was an undergrad,\u201d and imo that has really just meant that as upperclassmen we have a responsibility in teaching the younger engineering students, physics students, chemistry students, etc. how to handle the higher workload in a responsible and healthy way. \nComparatively, when someone complained to the undergraduate head in the psychology department at my school, they lowered the bar for some classes- making the curves more generous and decreasing the required work. These are two different approaches to pedagogy, one is trial by fire- one isn\u2019t really a trial at all. They both lead to different results, have different pros and different cons- it\u2019s important we recognize these differences so we can understand why these groups act the way they do.  \n\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t undergoing the same academic pressures/are in the humanities: *firstly,* I want to apologize for how my underclassmen are acting. *Secondly,* I want you to understand the reasons they are acting this way, their workloads are intense: in most cases they will be doing almost double the work to receive the same grades you do. This is no excuse for some people\u2019s poor treatment of you, but just know that they\u2019re learning to cope with more academic pressure than you can imagine, and it will take them time to learn how to do that in a healthy way. If you feel up to it, help guide them to better coping mechanisms, but that is not your responsibility- if you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t. You owe them nothing, and they owe you nothing- but this might give you some insight into why they act the way they do.",

People always ignore the social sciences but there's a pretty big difference between methodology in those fields and in true humanities fields like history and english etc. Anyways, I'm sorry you're struggling with this. Personally I believe the real difference between STEM and humanities and social sciences is in time and the way you need to learn. STEM requires more concrete knowledge and objective evidence, whereas humanities forces you to have an opinion and defend it with facts, and social sciences blends the two. Therefore the type of stuff STEM students have to do takes more time. It's not harder necessarily, it just takes longer. Humanities students don't have labs (more free time), and a talented humanities person CAN write a decent paper in 10 hours. On the other hand, a STEM major can't make up weeks of whatever it is yall do in labs in 10 hours. In your case you had more credit hours and I'm sure you were working harder than your ex, and that has to feel shitty. But it's not a universally applicable example.",

          "text": "Yeah, I think it\u2019s the bitterness that comes from the difference in workloads. When one group can literally not try in their classes and the other group needs to give it their all, despite the  second group being \u201chigher achievers\u201d of course bitterness will arise. Still, there\u2019s no excuse for taking that bitterness out on other people.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say \u201ceveryone in the liberal arts doesn\u2019t try\u201d people at the top do, but it\u2019s not necessarily a requirement to get your degree in a lot of places, and I\u2019m saying this as someone in both an engineering and liberal arts program. \n\nThis is the primary reason for the perceived aloofness, it\u2019s a natural reaction to the circumstances many of these people are placed in. Like I said before though, it\u2019s unacceptable to take it out on others, and I like to think that learning to deal with these emotions is part of stem education.",

                  "text": "I personally try to enjoy my work more. Sure, we\u2019re being put through hell while others aren\u2019t- but look how fucking cool some of this is\u2014 you\u2019re literally learning stuff people a 1000 years ago would see as black magic. You\u2019re not going to get the same skills if you spent all your time drinking and avoiding your classes. \n\nAnother thing is working with friends, we get to work through difficult problems together and \u201cnormalize\u201d what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re in this together, and that means we\u2019re not alone.\n\nLastly, using skills we have! Drawing, writing, coding a fun app, modeling some random water, designing something as a meme- all of these help. Sure, we can\u2019t goof off every day like our peers in psychology, but we can use the skills we have do enjoy ourselves. You are developing these skills to a greater extent than the people skating by, even if they claim otherwise. So use those skills, try to make something amazing, try to model something in your head! For example, I used skills I used in heat transport, reactor design, well as synthesis to demonstrate the optimal time, temperature, and pressure to age human urine into making choloramine gas with bleach. For context, the prompt my friends and I made was was- \u201cyou are a Russian spy in a banquet hall with no tools, how do you kill your target.\u201d So yeah, it\u2019s kinda random, but I had fun overengineering my idea, and if I ever need to kill a VIP at a banquet hall, now I know how long to let my piss age in the urinal before doing the deed. \ud83d\ude0e \n\n\n\nThe bitterness is natural, but the people who are slacking right now won\u2019t find the same enjoyment or success you will. Part of the problem with their lack of understanding is that they haven\u2019t ever really been pushed to their limits, and that\u2019s fine- it\u2019s their choice, but it also means they won\u2019t be able to legitimately achieve what you can. There are people in every major working hard, that\u2019s true- but there are more people developing skills and grinding in certain programs, and those who haven\u2019t pushed themselves don\u2019t really understand the difference in workloads, so be soft on them. \n\nThere\u2019s no point in taking out your anger on people who have no real metric to distinguish how different your workload is- just keep moving forward. \n\nTry to sit back and enjoy the process, you\u2019re becoming a harder, more intelligent, more gritty person because of it. That\u2019s an advantage the people who skirt by in easier coursework and don\u2019t apply themselves will never have. \n\nEveryone falters and has bad days- when I had an ungodly amount of work one week and my roommates in psych were complaining about their high-school-level stats course, I made snide comments. When a person I knew put no effort into their upper level sociology/business class and complained about B+\u2019s/A-\u2018s, I told them that if I did that in my chemE classes I would be failing- that\u2019s not untrue, but it\u2019s not right to compare. These are not my proudest moments, but learning to exercise restraint and understanding for people who don\u2019t have the ability to understand what being pushed is, is part of the experience. Nobody will blame you for your bad days, just don\u2019t make every day a bad day.",

Not all art majors have so much free time.\n\nFor example, I have a sibling taking their music degree, and they're expected to take the same amount of classes as the average Engineering student (6-7 per semester at my school). On top of that, they have to practice on their own time and take private lessons for the instrument that they majored in. And additionally, some classes are expected to have extracurricular requirements, such as participating in a band, which also requires practice. On top of that, my sister works 3 jobs.\n\nAnd I also took a semester taking Design and Arts courses. It's not simple, and projects take a lot of time. It easily ate up my time to try to get an A in those classes.",

How do you know you\u2019re good at it, and is that skill clear to others?  \nWhere do you want to be and what are the steps to get there? Be honest with yourself and don\u2019t sugarcoat it. \n\nYou need to answer these questions yourself, and honestly- without putting on a face or any fanfare. If you lie to yourself about it you might end up in a worse position than you started in.\n\n\nI know in STEM you\u2019re pushed to your academic limit and you learn how to make things work, and in the humanities- if you have a passion/skill for what you\u2019re doing you can make it work too. But business? If you don\u2019t have a solid plan from the outset you\u2019ll graduate into one of the most inflated degrees on the market and end up working retail, which is fine- but I don\u2019t know if being a shift manager or paper pusher is your dream job.\n\nI have a friend who went to school for film because it\u2019s her passion, she planned ahead and has made it work, she\u2019s now working at WB. While her peers, who didn\u2019t answer the questions I posed honestly, partied every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday she honed her skills at animation. While her business-major friends went on summer vacations she networked and submitted competition pieces. Work, luck and grit is what paid off for her- because she had a *plan.*\n\nI have another friend who got a management degree, he said it was \u201chis passion\u201d but he really just wanted a general degree and some free time. He\u2019s working as a shift supervisor right now at Best Buy. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it provides a stable living with a mediocre salary, but it is not what he wanted to do. \n\nMy friend in film answered their questions honestly, and even with a stereotypically \u201cfluff\u201d degree, managed to succeed. My friend in business was not honest with himself, his degree did him no favors, and because he did not plan ahead he\u2019s not doing what he wanted. It\u2019s that simple.",

Our major isn't the all-superior of college degrees, and I hate when people from my same field of study bash other's fields of study. I have certain strengths when it comes to my degree, and so do you. Plus last time I checked, I'm in college to learn more, not waste time hating on other people's degrees.",

A CS major would create the software that business uses. Keep in mind this is very simplified and both studies have many different applications of their knowledge.",

Although I never made fun of someone's degree choice, there were a few times where I definitely felt resentment.  \n  \nThere were things I wanted to do in college besides 100% CE stuff. It was a universe of information, with so much to learn. In order to dip into anything outside of my degree, I had to get permission to take more than the recommended credit hours for that quarter, because every single quarter for 5 years was jammed solid either on core classes, or in the field doing a co-op. Even our electives were engineering focused. These other permitted extra-curriculars were the few times that I'd go out into the wild and talk to a non-STEM major. Once or twice, during normal conversation, we'd talk about why we took the class and the other person would say something like \"Oh, I just had to take something to get my minimum hours this quarter\" or \"Yeah, I'm just doing all easy classes to take a break\" and it would snap something inside me. Sometimes I'm afraid that my lip would actually curl, and the inaudible \"...that must be nice\" would've been heard.  \n  \nTo summarize: If I ever unintentionally insulted someone because of their non-STEM major, it was out of frustration, and mental and physical exhaustion. I didn't think I was better, I was just so damn burnt out.",

When I was in CS, pretty much everyone would tear each other down and size people up based on how much coding experience they have. Basically it would go like \u201cI know Java and Python!\u201d with another person 1-upping them like \u201cI know Java, Python, C#, and Ruby, and I have had 3 internships!\u201d to \u201cI learned to code when I was 8 and I\u2019ve made 5 bots and a bunch of apps! Oh and I know 10 languages!\u201d. People would basically roast you if you are inexperienced. It\u2019s *this* bad especially with the whole \u201cCS jobs make a ton of money\u201d mindset. Pretty much lots of CS majors I knew didn\u2019t really have a personality outside of this.\n\nI switched to an art major last year and I haven\u2019t looked back. I\u2019m a lot happier now doing something I actually love (I\u2019m not even good at math and logic anyway). The whole \u201cSTEM or nothing\u201d mentality (ESPECIALLY with CS) is extremely toxic and it really took a toll on me, so meeting art majors was a breath of fresh air. Art majors are a lot friendlier and don\u2019t judge you based on experience or what you\u2019re planning to do with your degree.",

The two coolest things I took were the philosophy of happiness and a course on animal ethics that was fascinating.\n\nFor that matter, philosophy is far more relevant than most people realize. Most people seem to think of philosophy as purely metaphysics, but epistemology informs all the sciences, ethics is the root of law and government, and logic is the basis of much of modern computer science.\n\nPhilosophy is awesome because some things are simply beyond the realm of science. Things as necessary as \"what is right and wrong?\", or as esoteric as \"why is there somthing instead of nothing?\" are all exclusively the purview of philosophy.",

There are trades, entrepreneurs, or etc. \n\nTo be able to send your child to a college without resorting to debt is without a doubt a luxury. Taking out loans would classify as taking debt.

Hearing all the time that studying STEM subjects is important in the 21st century makes those students believe that what they're learning is more important than other subjects, especially liberal arts. And also the reputation of business/finance, where students don't have to study as much as STEM majors are often required to.\n\nAlso, because STEM is perceived as more of a meritocracy than subjects like business. Whether that's actually true or not is debatable, but STEM majors, especially minorities, may feel like if they don't go to the right school or have the right connections, that they won't have as prosperous a career in business as someone who does.\n\nIn addition, STEM majors are not exactly known for having \"soft\" skills, so they tend to overvalue their \"hard\" skills.\n\nEdit: I would also add that STEM majors think of their future careers as more noble or even just more intellectual. Like a physician could say that they cure patients of illnesses, or a scientist could say that they make scientific discoveries that advance human knowledge, or a software engineer can develop software that makes people's lives better/easier.

STEM students are statistically more likely to be higher achievers in their previous education, and have significantly higher workloads than most of their peers in college. Despite this, due to STEM generally having less grade inflation, they see less of the results of their sizable amount of labor reflected on their GPA. Meanwhile someone in psychology who had a 3.0 in HS will be breezing through easy-A classes. The disconnect between effort-and-reward when compared to their counterparts, as well as what society is telling them causes lots of people to use their ego as a defense. It\u2019s a totally human response to watching people who are doing less work get \u201crewarded\u201d more. Somewhat ironically though, their lack of grade deflation is why so many of their degrees are respected more. :/\n\n\nAlso, I think your comment about soft skills is misplaced. Most engineering programs specifically stress technical communication skills and teamwork, ABET, the accreditation board in the US makes it clear that it is a focus. \n\nOther than that, it\u2019s a combination of not seeing work \u201cpay off\u201d as much and societal expectations- although, I would argue that egotistical people exist in all degrees.

Many people who do put down people in other majors (it doesn't have to be just STEM majors either) often don't have the same inside look into what the other person is even doing in their major. One of my friends, a Government major, had to write 8-10 page papers every week or other week with a 20-25 page thesis due at the end of the semester. I've only written one of those my entire college career and I can assure you it made me want to bang my head against the wall and took just as much time (if not more) as I would spend on my CS classes.\n\nOf course I think STEM majors are more difficult in terms of the topics you're learning, but I'm not sure a blanket statement that it's harder than other majors is quite accurate here. When I look at what makes a major hard, I'd also consider the time you have to invest in it, not just learning but also assignments and studying.",

You're talking about these classes that you took, but you studied journalism. So you would have taken the most basic computer sciences a university has. Same with math, science, etc. On average, stem coursework is more complicated and takes more time than non stem. On average, engineering, hard sciences, etc require more studying and result in lower GPAs than the humanities. You're free to research the stats.

This is coming from someone who\u2019s taken upper division classes in both programs.\n\nHowever, that says *nothing* about the worth of the degree- and putting anyone down for choosing an easier degree is never okay. The degree doesn\u2019t make the person, the person makes the degree. Plenty of people bust their asses going above and beyond in their programs and I respect that. \n\n\nOP acknowledged these differences in their post, the issue isn\u2019t the differences- it\u2019s how people act.\n\nSomewhere else in this thread I gave my explanation for why people act like that, if you want to look.

                      "text": "But that's your experience in psychology which, while valid, doesn't make for a blanket statement that psych majors have it easier than engineering majors. Like I said above, I don't disagree the topics STEM majors are learning are conceptually difficult. But the time invested should also be considered when you're talking about rigor. I came into college with a fair bit of AP credit which allowed me the opportunity to take classes in many other major programs, including STEM, and my view is that there are many people who confidently claim their major is more difficult than others when they only have a surface level, often stereotypical, idea of what students in those other majors are actually doing. I've read a lot of your comments on this post and I don't know if it's just me or you may be doing this unconsciously, but it does come across as you thinking non-STEM majors have a ton of free time to slack off and aren't being as challenged (even saying business calc is dumbed down - true, but sounds quite rude considering the post) which isn't necessarily true. \n\nThe music majors at my school, for example, not only had to take the same amount of classes as other people, but also had to cut out *hours* a day to practice and rehearse. One of my dorm neighbors would leave at 7:30 for her first class and come from rehearsals or practice at 9-10 almost everyday just to finally be able to study for her theory classes. We weren't close because she didn't have time to socialize with people outside the music program. Even my engineering friends said they were glad they weren't her. Sure, there are some majors that are easy and even the students in the program say so themselves, but I have no clue how those majors are at other schools. Highly-ranked programs at schools are often even more rigorous because administrators put a lot of time and energy into making sure students are being challenged so they can uphold the reputation of the school and program when they go out to work. The point is, every program is different at every school. It's impossible to make a blanket statement like that based on one person's experience.",

                          "text": "First off, my school is in the top 10 for psychology programs in the US, and I transferred in here from another large school, so even though my experience is only n=2 I\u2019m fairly confident it\u2019s representative of psychology as a whole. Not to mention national statistics on grade inflation in our major. In most cases, if you\u2019re in psychology and just doing the baseline requirements to get a 3.5, you will have plenty of free time available, many students use that to do research, get clinical experience for med-school, join clubs, and work on pet projects, but many also choose not to. There is a colossal difference in the workloads I\u2019ve experienced first-hand. Also, administrators are a really big problem in academia to begin with, they do less to help than you would think. Instead of boosting the rigor they\u2019ll take the path of least resistance and boost the specific metric they need. \n\n\nSecondly, yes, everyone\u2019s program is different- but I\u2019m making broad generalizations that apply in the majority of cases. I have immense respect for people putting time into the performing arts, and especially for those planning and executing those plans in order to use their degree after college. I am also not saying that any of these degrees are less valuable intellectually, because they\u2019re not. \n\nLastly, I\u2019m sorry if my tone was rude- however, many programs like psychology and business *do* have dumbed down classes, looking back at psych stats compared with my science-stats, it was a joke. Looking at the people\u2019s curriculum from business calc, which I\u2019ve tutored, it\u2019s a joke. Why are these programs held to lower standards for prerequisite knowledge than their counterparts? Would you rather I blunt my language and say, \u201cthey are taught necessary concepts at a significantly lower level?\u201d How does that help? This is a big problem in a lot of academic programs right now that needs to be addressed.",

The barrier to entry for STEM is higher because while any fluent speaker can read and talk about poetry in their language, you need background knowledge in math concepts to even approach higher level math. But the same is true for analyzing poetry on a higher level. STEM majors just often believe that because they already know the basics (reading, writing) that they could attain a high level very quickly and easily, and that this makes stem better/harder since to do high level stem you need background knowledge but to do history or english at all you just need to be able to read. However, this isn't true. To do history and english *well* on a higher level you ALSO need to have background knowledge, and a greater comfort with abstractions and subjectivity than I think a lot of STEM majors have.",

But it's a codependent relationship; none can survive without the other groups.",

In a neoliberal system, anything that isn't deemed \"useful\" or on demand is cast aside as fat in our economic system. Hard sciences are much more profitable to the upper class which lends itself to people feeling more superior to other disciplines. This superiority complex leads to culture wide circle jerks of stem smugness.",
