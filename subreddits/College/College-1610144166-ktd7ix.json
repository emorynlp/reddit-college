Accounting majors have it far simpler than perhaps a Pre-med student given the workload. Yet at the same time a Statistics major may not have it as difficult as a music major. It only doesn't depend on stem vs non stem but rather how well funded the programs are at a particular school or what the school focusses on academically, the way the class is structured and the individuals strengths. For example I'm gonna give two classes as an example. Discrete Mathematics and Intro to Japanese. I got a similar grade on both classes. Discrete Mathematics as a class was far easier as opposed to Japanese. Before you come at my throat saying that Japanese is a hard language, I happen to be multilingual who can speak, read and write English, Tamil, French and Hindi. The reason for it being difficult was due to the workload of class and the constant pressure by the teachers. In Discrete the pressure was less, and the professors were lot more forgiving on homework. I go to a fairly small liberal arts school. The reason why Chemistry and Physics are see as notoriously harder classes isn't because each subject is difficult but rather because those departments are poorly funded because many students don't take those classes unless required for those majors. When a department is poorly funded, it might become hard for students to get the help required for those classes, and thus it gets the reputation of being bad classes to take. Another fallacy that many college students fail to realize is that planning is incredibly important. You can take all your hard classes in one semester. You need to plan. I had a former friend who took Organic chemistry, intro to physics and Calc-2 all in one semester despite having completed the Ap requirements that would have had her placed out of those classes. So, if students plan well then they have the ability to have a much free schedule as opposed to those who don't", "author": "MotorGur7605", "created": 1622855932, "upvotes": 2}, "gyk3lw5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ktd7ix/why_do_so_many_stem_majors_put_down_nonstem_majors/gyk3lw5/", "text": "Cause most non-stem major required jobs are not luxuries or least would not cause the collapse of the US economy in their absence.

Music is almost entirely theory-based. My final for my last Music Theory class was to dissect and explain different parts of a very difficult piece, that modulated from key to key almost nonstop and explain why it does or doesn\u2019t work (and sometimes there was no modulation, there were only some accidentals to trick you), to identify themes on motifs hidden throughout the entire piece, to vaguely interpret the reason why the composer did one thing or another and then back it up from examples from other sections in the piece. Now add fake 7 chords that try to trip you up, and make you think you\u2019re in one key while you\u2019re really in another. The Arts is a field where 1+1 is more likely to equal 3 or 4, rather than 2. There\u2019s nothing straight-forward or simple about it, despite what so many other majors like to say.\n\nAnd now I feel the need to say that you\u2019re going to run into difficulties no matter what field you go into.

Your brain is wired a certain way, as is mine, and if we tackle the fundamental principles through our predisposed wiring, then superiority arises when the math-minded can switch to following basic verbal-minded principles, whereas the converse is often lost in translation. Maybe it's a thing about higher level logic, and math-minds making the translation from verbal to math (without manifesting it conversely) requires some level of high intelligence that they think verbal-minds lack as a result of only *seeming* slightly superior in the verbal facet?

Upon scoring closer to the class medium than previously comfortable, they cling to what vestiges of their \"smart\" identities they can, rather than coming to terms with their newfound mediocrity.

In grad school I \"majored\" in anthropology and taught lots of workshops on computational stats, which were fairly widely attended by students from cs, physics, bioinformatics, etc. programs.
