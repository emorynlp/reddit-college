  "text": "One of my favorite past times this semester as a student has been lurking in [r/Professors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/) and reading all the crazy stories from professors. Seeing them talk about dumb students, about entitled students, about students who attempt to poorly cheat and/or plagiarize...\n\nIt makes me thankful that, despite how much of a mess I am, I'm at least not as bad as some of those students. Seeing the stories makes me feel better about myself and more competent as a student. Plus, it's honestly just entertaining seeing the dumb shenanigans students do and seeing how other professors react to them. Of course, a benefit to lurking in that subreddit is also being able to understand professor perspectives. I learned how to better compose emails and certain things that I should and should not do as a student. Do other students here lurk in that subreddit for similar reasons? Lol.\n\n(Also, students - do not post or comment in r/Professors, they don't mind students lurking in the subreddit but they do not want student activity in the subreddit beyond that. This is also enforced by mods. My objective with this post is to share my lurking experience in the subreddit, not to encourage students to comment/post within it.)",

I will never forget a story I read on there about a nightmare student with a somehow even worse administration.\n\nIt's a story about a professor (I believe he was male) who decided to teach a few classes at a different college part-time. On an assignment, one girl blatantly plagiarizes an entire essay and turns it in. Professor, who was advised by the college to be extremely lenient on students, gives her a B or a C and left some comments about having to do her own work instead of plagiarizing. Again, unbelievably lenient and practically unheard of when most professors would give a zero, fail the student on the entire course, or even suspend/expel the student and leave them with an ugly stain on their academic record that would follow them forever.\n\nA couple of days later, the professor receives an email from the student. Rage-induced, foul language, cursing out the professor for giving her a B on the essay. Really nasty and immature stuff. Totally uncalled for. The email was also CC'd to a higher-up department, and the professor, amused, doesn't even bother responding because the student is completely screwed up in the head and the administration will obviously back up the professor. The thing is... they don't lol\n\n.Administration contacts the professor, advising him to be more compassionate and reevaluate the essay and give the student a higher grade. Professor, shocked and dumbfounded, shortly resigns from the awful institution (as he should).",

On the one hand it's interesting to see the other perspective, and it makes me feel for professors, with how much work they have and just how many terrible students they have to deal with. And the awful administration at most schools. I really never realized that.\n\nBut on the other hand seeing post after post shitting on students is sad. I sense a real lack of empathy from many of them. When I was a student I thought that mistakes I made, or bad assignments i turned in wouldn't receive a second thought from professors. But then to think something I did could end up being laughed at in the 'teachers lounge' kind of makes me sad. And also the fact that it never seems to even cross their minds for a second that they could be in the wrong. In college I definitely had some professors that were not professional. It's possible, if not common. So I hate to see that arrogance on r/professors that it could practically never be the professor that is doing a poor job. The narrative  is that it's always a student that is entitled.",

But there's too much contempt.\n\nedit: oh and I almost forgot the inevitable posts about how the admin sucks and college is going down the tubes anyway, so why bother with standards anymore kind of talk.
