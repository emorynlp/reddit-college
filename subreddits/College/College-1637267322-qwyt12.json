  "text": "That\u2019s all. I\u2019m tired. College feels like the endless maze of work that eventually surmounts to what feels like something that is not worth it. I\u2019m working my ass off in my classes, and for what? A letter grade. \n\nIf you\u2019re also tired, I feel your pain. Know that there\u2019s others like myself that sympathize with you. My brain feels as if it\u2019s been stuck in a frying pan.",
