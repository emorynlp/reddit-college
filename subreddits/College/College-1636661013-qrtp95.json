What\u2019s more important is that you do good personal projects and develop skills. That\u2019ll go a lot further than the name of your school.",

              "text": "So I\u2019m in mechanical engineering, so I can\u2019t give the best advice for cs but I\u2019ll try.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely to land an internship at a larger company after your first year unless you have exceptional skills, but it can done. I\u2019d try and look at smaller and mid sized companies locally to see if they have an opening. They are usually more open to taking people who aren\u2019t as close to graduation. \n\nAs for projects there\u2019s plenty of stuff out there. I\u2019d just browse online forums till you find something you like that matches your skill level, then give it a shot. I personally do robotics projects but the larger projects sometimes get a bit expensive. The great part about cs is any project is essentialy free to do as long as your computer is sufficient.\n\nIf you can get a professor to allow you to be research assistant that\u2019s be great too! Ask around and see what they available. My advice would be make sure you get paid for it. If it\u2019s a couple hours a week during the school year then working for free isn\u2019t too big of a deal, but if it\u2019s happening all summer then you need to make sure they treat you like a proper employee. Most schools will, but thought I\u2019d mention it just in case. Best of luck!",
