  "text": "I\u2019ve been doing online school since Fall 2020, and I didn\u2019t have much of a hard time last semester, but this semester is just so draining. I\u2019m at home living with my parents by the way, so school is barely apart of my life.\n\nI can\u2019t stand these busy work assignments. Upper level classes full with bs that I don\u2019t really need to do. It feels like some of the professors are just running out of ideas for online assignments. I can\u2019t really blame them when these hands on classes aren\u2019t really meant for online learning. \n\nI\u2019m losing interest in school and it\u2019s getting bad, I\u2019ve never cared this little about college. I care more about other things in my life where I\u2019m actually participating in person. I\u2019m really just counting down the days until may when this semester is finally over. I don\u2019t know any of my online classmates in real life, I don\u2019t know my professors in real life, and it makes me care much less. \n\nI\u2019m going to college in person next semester, so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019ll give me more motivation. I\u2019m worried some of the classes that are listed as \u201cin person\u201d will really be mostly online. \n\nI know some of you will say join clubs, but I don\u2019t want more zoom stuff. I am involved in real life activities that I rather do than online clubs.",

If I'm not behind in one class it's because I'm behind in another. Since I pretty much stay in a state of exhaustion, I'm not retaining anything. They have us a \"mental health day\" this Friday because both students and faculty are not ina good place mentally, but we need more of a mental health week. I'd happily extend my time here if we got a break for just a little bit...",

It is the only one in which the professor has been understanding. She lost a sibling her first semester of college and gets it. I still had As in my other classes but they were making it hard for me to process my grief. I'd drop my biology class too, but it is pretty easy and the professor is great. I've already been accepted as a transfer to a four year school and am just ready to focus on my mental health and grief so I am good to go next fall. Plus I don't have to worry about dropping my 3.82 GPA due to grief.",

      "text": "I'm taking 4 classes right now, but truth be told this semester has really sucked. The semester's reading has been boring and a long slog. My grades have had a considerable dip, and they decided to shove the most boring/useless class at 8 AM, so everyday I get to class I feel sad and depressed.\n\nMy crutch/coping mechanism, which has always been sugar and food, has been amplified 10x this semester. I just eat and drink sugar whenever I can because I don't really care. I don't want to blame everything on external factors, but it's the fact that we're still in this stupid f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* pandemic (and before I hear it, I've worked with the public throughout and still want this to be over) which ruined my one form of escapism, going to concerts and playing music live.\n\nSo instead of being able to enjoy my life by going to shows and making new friends, I've been relegated to staying in my on campus apartment doing classwork, going to the most boring classes of my college life, working graveyards a few days a week, and just genuinely hating everything. It would feel a lot different if they lessened national/international restrictions, but I'm really sick of hearing about the fact that we have the vaccine now and we're still not being updated on when we can get it. Not only that, we still have to wear masks even after being vaccinated. Like, the logic behind the handling of this pandemic has upended employment lives, regular life, and all sorts of things in general.\n\nI doubt anybody is going to read my long rant (because nobody ever reads my s\\*\\*\\*), but I really want this pandemic to be over. I just want to get on with my normal life. I want to go to shows again. I want to enjoy the company of others. No, I'm not an excessive extrovert and quite like keeping to myself. But I also quite like music and its communal qualities, how it allows people to sync together in rhythmic unison. Watching music streams on Twitch and on YouTube just doesn't feel the same.",

      "text": "I feel this all too well. At first when things went online I was excited but now the excitement is long gone. \n\nFor me, it's similar to your reasons. Some of my Senior level courses are assigning more busy work than normal because professors want to make sure we're learning the material at the same pace they teach it. Basically, they fear that students aren't paying attention in zoom lectures so the give us an assignment every lecture. It's a little overkill. Other courses were poorly structured before they were taught online and they are still being taught online with that poor structure. Also the monatony of it all is a thing too. On days when I have 8 AM courses, I hop out of bed around 7:45 and  throw a hoodie on, then I make my protein oatmeal and sit at my desk and join my zoom class. I will probsbly be in front of my computer until at least 2 pm doing zoom and HW and many days I'm there until it's time to go workout or cook dinner. \n\nTo me, the saddest part of this whole thing is that traditional universities which used to be in person but are now online are teaching courses at a lower quality than universities whoich were originally online before covid was a thing. Very few courses at my university are organized to the level or taught with the simplicity of a fully online university. \n\nPersonally, I hope this is a wake up call to traditional universities that they are falling behind in some aspects.",

However, some of my classes do seem quite too easy? It's kind of scary and a waste of time but I'm not complaining tbh. I'm a Chemistry major so I'm not too worried about classes like humanities, English (it's not too bad but I never cared for it even in high school), history, or any other filler class being too easy for me. I hope to go to class in person, but I just moved to an entirely different state with my husband away from where I was going to CC so I'm not really sure what to do at this point about in person classes and not paying out of state tuition prices.",

To be honest, they were great online. My students turned the camera on, showed me their pets and one even put up a cute little picture when their camera wasn't on. I've been hyping them up all semester because I'm honestly so proud of them. I could tell online classes were burning my students out, so the switch to in person was so nice. \n\nI know it's hard. You are all rock stars. I hope you are taking care of yourselves mentally. But I'm proud of you regardless!!!",

We had zero cases and they didn't loosen the restrictions. If I had known that they wouldn't loosen the restrictions I would've just stayed home, but now I can't do remote classes because I have 1 fully in person class. Some of my friends have been going out, but I can't afford the $250 fine for it (you even get a fine if you literally walk across the hall to see someone, yet we can eat in the dining hall with anyone from our building). My professors also won't give us a break and we have hardly any break days. We have 3 total days off for 3.5 months of school, and they refused to give us any more until tons of us wrote long strongly worded emails (then they gave us 1 extra day off). I have an absurd amount of work to do this week and combined with declining mental health from being isolated, I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown and I can't take this anymore. I'm straight up considering withdrawing from this semester or even dropping out.",

Im just burnt out, I feel busier than ever with work, and my personal life. I commute to campus and one way its almost an hour drive, so both ways, 4 days a week, id normally be In the car for 8 hours and I didnt feel nearly as busy as I do now. Im lucky if I get one day off in a week now. Like... off off. No work, no school. But on those days my family usually wants to do something and I just want to play video games all day.",

      "text": "I don't enjoy it at all because of the reasons you mentioned, and also because most of the students in my program are so stuck-up. It's very competitive so obviously the only thing they care about are their grades, and they'll do almost anything to keep them above 90. Like once I was going over the answers for a lab with another student. There was this particularly hard question and she didn't really know the answer to it, so I volunteered to share my work with her. The moment I sent her the pics, she left me on read stopped responding to me. I also helped this other student with calculus homework and he didn't even thank me. Just left me on read. Again.\n\nIt's also hard to socialize with them, since most people will just talk to the ones they already know (often students who attended the same high school as them). I tried making some small talk but it seriously looks like everyone is actively avoiding me. I expected to have a fresh start in my 1st year of college but because of everything that happened, I have very low hopes for the upcoming semesters.\n\nSorry, I had to get this off my chest, although I completely understand what you mean. Online classes have drained most of my passion and will to learn (and it seems I'm not alone). I've never felt this unmotivated in a long time and I live far from campus, but I'm positive things will get better once we return to in-person classes.",

Tell them about your situation as a freshman and the problems that you\u2019re having with learning/grades. I\u2019m sure that they would understand and want to help you. From my experience, reaching out to your teacher is probably the best way to show them that you are not lazy and that you want to succeed.

You almost feel like you're just taking an obligatory online course by yourself, barely getting to know your friends, and you feel distant no matter how many activities there are. At least in person you'll get to joke about lessons during class, have some social time during breaks, and you'll get more familiar with the other students.\n\nJoining clubs and joining groups during online lessons can help you with your relationships outside in the campus. So if you join some kind of a club you enjoy, you can get excited for the future when you'll be able to join activities outside, especially the introduction and learning the rules part is already done during the online part.",

Additionally, I made sure that 2 of the 3 classes I was taking were ones I -wanted- to take out of interest. This helped me to feel more engaged in the course material, because it was something I wanted to learn. Maybe taking a smaller course load, or choosing at least one class that you're interested in, will help with motivation? \n\nOnline learning absolutely is not the same as in-person learning, I agree with you there. I can't wait to get back to campus so we can learn face-to-face. Unfortunately for us here, it's looking like courses will still be mostly online in the fall. But I'm crossing my fingers that winter semester will be in person.",
