  "text": "So I\u2019m pulling a C (75) in an Intro to PR course right now that is online asynchronous, or basically a \u201cno class meetings, here\u2019s the work, get it done\u201d class. I\u2019m taking four four-credit courses right now (16 credits) and one zero-credit course that\u2019s needed for my degree, so technically 5 classes but 16 credits.\n\nNow, 3/5 of those classes are online asynchronous, including the PR course that I\u2019m struggling in. The difference is that with the other 2 asynchronous classes, the teachers always reach out and email their students weekly, announce their office hours, give multiple extra-credit opportunities, etcetera. The way the assignments are set up is clear-cut and explained thoroughly to where I always am able to understand what I\u2019m being asked to do, and if not then my questions get cleared up through an email to the professor(s). Therefore, aside from that one PR class, my lowest grade currently otherwise is a 97. \n\nNow, with the PR course, I\u2019m not at all familiar with the subject or the material, but every assignment the professor gives makes it seem as though the professor almost *expects* us to know exactly what to do every time (she has 20+ years of professional experience in the PR field, after all). I\u2019ve tried to read the chapters but again, it\u2019s like the book expects you to already be familiar with its topics. I can read a chapter multiple times from the readings and *still* not understand what I\u2019m being asked to do for the assignments; I just go off of what the book shows me, but I don\u2019t really retain any of the information afterwards. \n\nI\u2019ve already met on Zoom with this teacher. She\u2019s very nice and has been very accommodating in situations where I\u2019ve needed assistance (such as not getting access to the book on-time, and giving me extra time to do assignments and not even counting them late). She means well, I\u2019m sure, but I don\u2019t think an online asynchronous format works well with the class or the way she teaches it. Plus, she teaches at a different university and has a 1-star rating with that university, and is apparently notorious for being nitpicky with grading and takes *forever* to grade assignments, so you never really know what your grade is (ex. I\u2019ve handed in 5 assignments for her class this semester, and only gotten a grade on the *first one* that I handed in *2 months ago*). I don\u2019t want to disappoint her, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right fit with her teaching format. \n\nThe fact that I can\u2019t wrap my head around the material and how it\u2019s being delivered is starting to burn me out with this class, and I\u2019m considering withdrawing and retaking it in a future semester in a face-to-face format, as the class is a major component of my degree. There\u2019s a teacher I have another online class with (and an A in) that will be teaching Intro to PR on-campus next semester, so if I could get in a class with her with a different teaching method, I think it would really benefit me. \n\nThe 60% completion of the term is marked as being November 7th, the day my PR midterm is due. The deadline at my college to withdraw from full-term courses with a W on your transcript is the 15th, so I\u2019m thinking of half-assedly completing the midterm, handing it in, then going to campus on the 8th or 9th and seeing if I can withdraw and retake the course face-to-face at a later date. \n\nWithdrawing will put me at 12 credits (from 16 attempted) which is still full-time status, so I have no idea if any aid would be affected. If I were to stick it out and try to pass the class, I would need a C *minimum*, so anything lower and I\u2019d have to retake it anyway, plus with a major kick in the groin to my GPA. \n\nMy questions are: \n1. Should I even do the PR midterm? \n2. Should I try to withdraw and retake the course later, or should I try to pass it and risk failing? \n\nI\u2019m already 2 assignments behind in PR, too. My major worry with withdrawing from that one class is that I\u2019d owe the school money from the financial aid that paid for it (and I currently don\u2019t have a lot of money). My school does flat-rate tuition though for 12-20 credits I think, so would it matter? If there\u2019s no academic or financial consequences to withdrawing then I will literally leap to the opportunity. \n\nFrom college-student to college-students, any advice?\n\nTL;DR: A class that is a core requirement for my degree is being taken online asynchronously, and I\u2019m really struggling with it. Minimum grade needed to pass is a C, which I currently *just barely* have, and I\u2019m feeling burnt out from doing a bunch of assignments *hoping* that I\u2019m doing them correctly. I have A\u2019s in all of my other classes. Withdrawing would take me from 16 credits down to 12, so I\u2019d still be considered full-time. Not passing the class would be a big hit to my GPA. Either way, I\u2019d likely have to retake the class again, and I think face-to-face for this class specifically would be better for me. I\u2019m just worried that financial aid may be affected, or that the school would want their money back or something. Thoughts?",

      "text": "Stick with the class.  You're currently passing, so it seems unlikely that you're suddenly going to drop to a failing grade if you keep your performance/effort constant.  If you get to the end of the semester and nevertheless find that you will have to retake the class next semester, then you will still have benefited from completing the semester in that you will have been exposed to the whole semester's worth of material, which should make the class easier next semester.  So either you'll finish the semester and pass and not have to worry about this class again, or you'll finish the semester and be familiar with the whole content of the class, so things will be easier next semester.\n\nGood luck.",
