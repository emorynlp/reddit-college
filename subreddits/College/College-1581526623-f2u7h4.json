  "text": "Mine was just this week when I informed my teachers that I would be missing my specific college\u2019s job fair. Literally every single class I\u2019m in had a \u201cJob Fair Attendance\u201d completion assignment. So I received a zero for all but one class for that assignment. The reason I missed the job fair was because I had an actual interview with an engineering firm in a different city. Left me extraordinarily annoyed. Got the job tho.",

And he couldn't firm a coherent email so all our correspondence was confusing. (I was working a full time job at the time, 8-4.30, and he refused to talk on the phone outside of 2x 3 hour long office hours.) When I presented my final project he got up and left in the middle of it. \nI graduated, walked, shook his hand and said thanks for helping me through it. And was notified 48 hours post graduation that he had failed my final project. \n\nTLDR: Univ of Alaska sucks. I have project PTSD now. And this is just for my bachelor's. My Masters story is just as bad. \nGo WGU!!  Its a good school!",

We inquired about this, only to be informed that married couples were no longer permitted to live on campus. \n\nThis change came as a part of our school\u2019s religious Title IX exemption, which gave them the right to discriminate based on sexuality, gender (read: transgender), and marital status (read: gay marriage). They decided to end housing for all married people so they wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the difference between straight married couples and gay married couples. \n\nThis forced us to move off campus and manage a dire financial situation in our first married months because my wife was student teaching and couldn\u2019t work. I worked two, sometimes three jobs and we somehow scraped by. We still love our alma mater but we definitely won\u2019t forget when they put bigotry over their students.",

I had been going for the AS in Liberal Arts, to which a first year adviser told me it needed 3 credits/1 class. I went ahead and took said course, then thought nothing of it. When I applied to graduate, they said that I still had one more math course left. Turns out that I needed 6 credits and the adviser had told me the wrong thing. Luckily, another adviser (not a first year) tried to help me out and tried to bypass that requirement. After getting yelled at by financial aid for trying to bypass said requirement, the adviser switched my major to General Ed and all of the language proficiency classes I had taken just for the Liberal Arts requirements went to waste.",

The powers that be decided to merge my university with a much larger Liberal Arts college in my state for \"reasons\". This move literally destroyed our campus culture. Our small campus life and traditions that had been around for decades were abolished with the stroke of a pen and my school hasn't been the same since, especially after they, from my vantage point, decided to relocate the entirety of the social scene to the larger campus. Our small campus is practically a graveyard now...\n\nGone are the days where you could just decide to test your project designs; now you must navigate the, seemingly, endless amount of red tape and bureaucratic BS, just to be told, you can't do it, for \"reasons\". Doing anything just about requires advance planning weeks prior for the simplest of events, including scholarly ones. Spontaneity is quite dead, and the innovative spark that you would assume those in power would seek to engender has been all but stamped out. \n\nGreek life, which may have been problematic at some universities, was quite tame. We had our issues with the administration prior to the merger, which Greek organization didn't? However, we had our own roles to play. The Greeks were instrumental in continuing the traditions of our smaller school, it was a responsibility that, while unspoken, was faithfully executed. Now, we are at war with an unsympathetic administration that seem just as keen on eradicating Greek culture, in its entirety, just as they did on our small campus.\n\nIt has honestly been frustrating, if that hasn't been obvious, but I cannot envision myself graduating from this institution, except, perhaps out of spite. Those who succeed after university sometimes donate to their alma mater, I cannot see those who graduated after the merger being all too sympathetic decades from now.",

We have had an accumulative total of 20 fire alarms since the start of the school year but only one fire. The sad part of that is all those alarms have happened at 2 am and mainly constituted people pulling the alarms and running away(also my residence building is 20 stories tall). The admin thought it would be a great idea after 17 of the alarms to put dye in the pull stations but refuse to do anything else but put up posters that say \" Don't pull the fire alarm, make a meme instead\".",

I was told that being in court was not a valid reason to miss class so I had to take a zero on the assignment. Well Monday rolls around and I ask my friend what the assignment was, so he tells me that it was a worksheet and that our teacher wasn't even in class that day. She was too hungover to teacher Friday, so she left the assignment with another teacher to hand out then class was dismissed. So I was given a zero for having a valid reason for not showing up but she wasn't even there in the first place",

      "text": "I've suppressed this memory because it makes my blood boil but: Last Spring semester I dropped below full-time for mental health reasons. Of course, this meant that my scholarships, which required full-time status, were in jeopardy. I submitted an appeal to retain them, and you can bet that I did a ton of research on my university's policies. I met with the Dean of my program (at the time). I met with the Scholarship Appeals lady. Not even a day or two after I met with the program Dean, I get an email from Scholarship Appeals lady telling me my scholarships will not be reinstated.\n\nI was confused because she just simply said, \"you weren't full-time, blah blah blah\". Why allow me to submit an appeal in the first place? She said that when I met with her, she said I could either submit medical documentation or something from my Advisor. That was untrue, she never stated that. If she had, I would have done so. Also she said that since my account was still under my old major, it didn't show reasons for me dropping classes to pursue a different career. (Didn't she know that changes like that can't happen within 1 or 2 days?)\n\nI sent her back a professionally-worded but emotionally reflective essay about how angry I was. And I still am. I hate mindless drones who stick to formalism and I hate being (let's be honest here, uni's want $$$) purposefully misled.\n\n\\*rant over\\*",

I told her that was a lot and if it was distracting I could happily just leave class altogether. Which I did. The following morning I started receiving emails from the Dean of Students about meeting with them and discussing why I was tired and what I was doing that was making me so tired.

It's to help prevent issues such as suicide, because unfortunately that has happened before. I recently more or less found out they are usually a joke. I've had a few because of chronic illness. I got told to \"grow up\" and that \"I needed to be more responsible\". Like okay is this like being sent to the principal's office or something? I guess someone said something because now campus safety will basically barge in on anyone missing for more than three days.",

The toilet thing shouldn't be hard, \"hey im in here, pls turn on the lights\". Ok no problem. In execution, it turns into a \"hey Chapstick was a horrible person and turned off the lights and im upset\" which is absurd. But, people are weird.",
