Our small campus life and traditions that had been around for decades were abolished with the stroke of a pen and my school hasn't been the same since, especially after they, from my vantage point, decided to relocate the entirety of the social scene to the larger campus.

Spontaneity is quite dead, and the innovative spark that you would assume those in power would seek to engender has been all but stamped out. \n\nGreek life, which may have been problematic at some universities, was quite tame. We had our issues with the administration prior to the merger, which Greek organization didn't? However, we had our own roles to play. The Greeks were instrumental in continuing the traditions of our smaller school, it was a responsibility that, while unspoken, was faithfully executed. Now, we are at war with an unsympathetic administration that seem just as keen on eradicating Greek culture, in its entirety, just as they did on our small campus.\n\nIt has honestly been frustrating, if that hasn't been obvious, but I cannot envision myself graduating from this institution, except, perhaps out of spite.
