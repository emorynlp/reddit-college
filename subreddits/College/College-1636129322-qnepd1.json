  "text": "Reason I am asking this question is that I am moving out of my parents house and the place I have found that is affordable is 40 minutes away from school ( around 33 miles) it just one straight drive on the highway. I don't know if I am crazy for contemplating this choice because money is tight and I need a place to live.\n\nI am going to school for theatre so I would be there about 4 to 5 days a week.\n\nThanks and have a great day :)",
