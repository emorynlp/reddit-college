  "text": "I haven't heard back from my professor yet so im trying to do this myself. Im in nursing program and our class syllabus reflects a percentage system for grade calculation:\n\n4 exams that are 10% each\n\n2 midterms that are 12.5% each\n\n10 quizzes worth 5% altogether\n\n1 final worth 30%\n\n\nSo my current stats are:\n\n\nExam 1 = 90\n\nExam 2 = 86\n\nExam 3 = 66\n\nExam 4 = 68\n\nMidterm 1= 75\n\nQuiz 1-5 = combined avg of 95\n\n\nSo syllabus uses the percent system i mentioned above. Meanwhile our blackboard grading uses a points system.\n\nBoth give me different answers. If i go by the percentage system alone i get like between 78-80 avg. \n\nIf i go by blackboard its 412 /500 = 82.40. And blackboard claims this calculation is based on the percents listed in their syllabus.\n\nAm i missing something?",
