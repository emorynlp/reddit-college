  "text": " Hi\n\nA little background - I work a full time job and hold a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering. I have always been inclined to pursue something in the field of aerospace engineering/ aerodynamics - even if it isnt a career. Since I am working full time, I was wondering if there are any long distance/ online options available , Iam based in Canada!\n\nThanks",
