  "title:": "Went from being on Academic Probation to the Dean\u2019s List (Freshman)",
  "text": "So my first semester I didn\u2019t try very hard and didn\u2019t study thinking that I could pull the same stuff I did in high school and ended straight up failing half my classes and getting a 1.26 GPA. Over winter break I thought to myself you can do better than that and in the spring semester I applied myself to my studies a lot more diligently, started going to office hours and supplemental instruction classes even if I didn\u2019t think I needed to, and got help from my fraternity brothers who had taken my classes before and ended up getting a 3.57 GPA this semester and got on the Dean\u2019s List. Moral of the story: never give up and you can always do better; even if you failed a couple classes :)",

This motivates me to keep striving. \n\nI have been struggling so badly with my math class because I have dyscalculia (math version of dyslexia). I got a D- in my class and it has killed my hopes of ever becoming the best version of myself that I dreamed about but reading your story is motivating. This fall when I go back I am going to try much better this time and not let myself crash again.\n\nI hope to be like you and be able to make it to the deans list or heck even get a full ride into my dream veterinary school. This makes me so hopeful for the future. Thank you so much! Wish you the best of luck with your life. :)",
