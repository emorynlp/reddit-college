He walks his dogs around campus and has been accused of attaching gopros to them, so he can see up girls skirts. I have looked into his records and he was convicted on February 3, 2006. He is a tier iii sex offender which is the highest tier you can be, which means he committed a gruesome act. He was charged with Code: 18.2-374.1. Which is something to do with child pornography. He also has other charges for solicitation of minors as well. Is there anything that can be done so he is not allowed on campus? I am scared for my friends and I to walk around knowing someone committed such heinous crimes to minors. \n\nI would also like to add not sure if this helps but there are minors who attend my university. \n\nThank you for any input you may have to help me keep my classmates and friends out of danger.", "author": "gamergalhaha", "created": 1632383378, "retrieved": 1632800754, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "comments": {"he1gczy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptq9sj/sex_offender_on_campus/he1gczy/", "text": "This may be unethical(?) but perhaps the most you and others can do is make it very uncomfortable for him to go to the campus if you catch my drift", "author": "grownrespect", "created": 1632448407, "upvotes": 0}, "he0t6tu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptq9sj/sex_offender_on_campus/he0t6tu/", "text": "I go to the same college so I know who you\u2019re talking about\u2026.we were really worried at the beginning of the semester when we found out. \nThe unfortunate thing is, most people don\u2019t know.
