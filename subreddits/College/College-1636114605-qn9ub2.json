  "text": "Hey everyone. So Im a junior and I plan on studying abroad next semester, however, the place I\u2019m planning on going is a place where no one else is. I\u2019m planning on traveling to Bhutan (a place I didn\u2019t even know existed until I applied) and the only reason I applied is for my major. Literally everyone and their mother is going to Italy while I\u2019m going to a small south Asian country and it\u2019s hard not to develop mob mentality. Everyone will be going out to party and traveling throughout Europe while I\u2019ll be stuck in a country that has none of that for 5 months. I know this will be a great opportunity for my degree since it\u2019s perfect for my major but I don\u2019t want to be stuck somewhere for 5 months and regret it, especially since once you\u2019re there, u can\u2019t leave unless it\u2019s an emergency. Anyone else ever study abroad in a less than ideal place? Could u tell me your experience?",
