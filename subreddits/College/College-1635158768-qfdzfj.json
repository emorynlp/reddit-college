  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to get a computer science degree for 3 years now but the calculus is just killing me. I\u2019ve done fine with my computer science classes and I really enjoy them but I\u2019ve constantly had problems with my calculus classes. I\u2019m failing calculus 2 for a second time and I\u2019m just now starting to realize there is no way I\u2019m fulfilling the calculus requirements of my degree. Is there anyway I can stay in the computer science field without completing calculus 2 or do I need to cut my losses and completely exit the computer science field?",

If you really, really can't pass the class and still want to stay in the field, I'd look into whether your university has a CS minor or CS certificate, and then switch your major to something useful/relevant without the calc requirement -- what that's going to be will depend on your university's offerings.",

The BA only requires Calc 1.\n\nHowever, keep in mind many upper-level CS courses will require Calc 2 as a prereq. So, you may be limited on classes you can take. Or, see if other tech degrees interest you, such as IT or Digital Forensics, etc. \n\nI'm not sure what classes you have taken in CS that were doable compared to Calc 2. Yes, calc 2 is difficult, most definitely. But I'd have to argue that some classes, like Automata, have been considered just as difficult if not worse. I've known several classmates who dropped Automata this semester and switched to the BA program for this very reason.",
