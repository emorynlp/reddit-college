  "text": " \n\nI'm finishing up my bachelor's in history and I don't know what I want to do after I graduate. Here are my options.\n\nLaw school: My aunt and grandmother paid for a $700 lsat prep course and I'm enrolled to take the lsat in January. I'll take it again in February and then shoot my shot with a bunch of different law schools that are easy to get into. However, I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer. It sounds like it'd be a good career path and I'd be able to fight for people who can't fight for themselves. But law school is super intense and rigorous and I don't know if I want to do that.\n\nMaster's in library sciences: I love, love, love history and old things and I would love to go into some type of archiving job. It's the dream. But it's also a tough field to get into since there are so many people wanting to be archivists and not enough people looking to hire.\n\nMaster's in Europe: Studying is the easiest reason to be in Europe long-term and so studying to get my master's might be the only chance for me to stay in Europe for an extended period of time since all of the other routes to get my visa are really difficult.\n\nOther things:\n\n\\- Need to be in a city that has great public transportation or is walkable\n\n\\- I don't have any family or friends or anything like that tying me down\n\nSchools I'd probably get into and actually want to go to:\n\nLaw school: Yeshiva Cardozo in NYC and UC-Hastings in San Francisco\n\nmaster's in library sciences degree: CUNY Queens College\n\nmaster's abroad: I don't have any schools nailed down yet.",

      "text": "I just had a archivist job. I want my ms in information science (similar to lms).\n\nBe prepared to travel as my library has trouble finding people because it was remote I got lucky.\n\nI got into this job over data basing photo for online usage.\n\nBut brush up on genealogy and volunteer with your local library or historical society and start there. \n\nIf you truly want to pursue.\n\nI am a genealogist. In the daughters of the American revolution, and literally got on the committee to work with American rev war pension records. My chapter (it\u2019s part of USA 250 in 2026) wants a book written a marker for our American rev war ft.\n\nIt\u2019s nuts but there are ways.\n\nYou can be a lawyer and do some of genealogy on the side as all you do is pull hard records, census court case newspaper etc on a person place or thing.",

      "text": "Your predicament sounds quite similar to my own! I completed a bachelor's in history and been looking into grad school for either law, library, or continuing with history.\n\nLaw school can be rigorous but I know many history majors who entered it unconvinced they would like it and left it having loved it.\n\nMasters of library science can be difficult to get a job with, especially as an archivist, unless you happen to live where archives are abundant (like D.C.). That being said, elementary, middle, and high schools often hire for the school library, as long as you aren't totally wedded to archivist.\n\nMaster's in Europe I've looked into as well (and applied to actually). I can't offer much more other than try to match what you want to study with whatever university you want to apply for. I've been told that one university having faculty in a broad range of fields within a subject can be uncommon in Europe, depending on where you go.\n\nBest of luck!",
