  "text": "Im taking anatomy at a community college and its so much more straightforward than my quote on quote competitive public school. theres no bullshit weedout mindset to deal with and the professor is actually willing to help everyone. theres no poorly written abritrary questions on the test that 80+% of student get wrong. The questions actually test you on the  stuff you learn in class and dont try to trick you on purpose just to lower your score. everything is concise and i feel like i dont have to spend hours feeling anxious trying to teach myself the basics that my professor chose to ignore. God it feels good to actually have an education that doesnt  just treat me like a number. cutthroat competition and grade deflation aint it chief. go to cc's if u have the chance",

The instructors there tend to be more experienced at teaching at lower level.\n\nSecond, community college classes tend to be easier, which might provide a false sense of \"better teaching\".\n\nI can't really comment on biology. But as a statistics professor, I have to say we are currently having a major issue of students not learning what they needed to learn from community college math courses.",

      "text": "Absolutely not, but I think everyone has their own subjective experiences, and not all colleges are the same. I felt like my time at community college was a waste. AP/Honors high school level education, underpaid uninspired professors, heavy focus on political correctness. 2 years in community college felt like a really weak introduction into higher education, and more like an assembly line for political ideologies. I feel like I never really learned much in most of my liberal arts classes, compared to my science classes. My time at Uni was much better. It was more focused, and my teachers were more interactive and caring (lower student:teacher ratio too). We also had so much more resources at the 4 year. My community college cut half our dissections and made them \"virtual\", and we had to share 1 classroom's set of models with 3 other classes. In university we always had our full dissections and enough models for everyone. Sometimes I wonder if I would have had a more objective targeted education if I had gone to University all along.   \n\n\nAnother thing I liked about Uni was my peer group. I feel like we all worked really hard to get where we were at, and our study groups and collaboration assignments were much more productive than Community college. In community college, 75% of the people in our groups wouldn't do their share of the work or participate. Some were very open about being on academic probation. I felt like the work always came down to me and one other responsible student, and the rest were just cruising along for the ride. I couldn't trust asking most of them for help either. When I was at my university, my fellow students felt so much more intelligent, and I was more comfortable asking them for help.\n\nSure, community college may be easier for some. The test questions are somewhat dumbed down, and aren't as challenging as a professional university. Are you really learning when the question is \n\n\"What is H2O?: \n\nA.) Water \n\nB.) Spaghetti \n\nC.) Your professor \n\nD.) Lava\" \n\n(I'm joking of course, lol, not that easy). \n\nHonestly, I've never had a problem feeling like my professors were trying to get me to fail. It's not in their interest. I think that's more of a case by case thing. The only teacher I had who was like that, was in community college and she wouldn't give out A's. It really comes down to your professor and their own motivation. Professors with chips on their shoulders, and professors who have one foot out the door already, generally won't give you the same education and experience as someone who's passionate about their work.   \n\n\nIt was insightful how we both had opposite experiences! What state are you in?",

It was easy to curate my schedule at the CC with instructors I could verify that way, vs half of the time I can't even find my instructors in RMP at Berkeley. Quality wise I don't think it is massively different, (and can't really compare my upper divisions to CC), but I do think for myself it was easier to find the better instructors at CC because of this, and have a better experience there.\n\nAlso for my department specifically, I got to know almost all of the instructors really well/still work with them, partly because I'd taken 2-4 classes from each (also TA'd in the dept), and there just aren't as many vs at the UC I have repeated instructors but not at anywhere the same rate/they just have so many more. It isn't really a negative, but I do find it a little harder to interact (though that can also be attributed to zoom university) as I just don't know them as well/am unlikely to take as many classes with them vs my CC experience. The positive is there are just a lot more class options, though.",

IGETC is not a requirement but it satisfies all if not most of the GE's that you would have to take once you transfer to the UC. So basically IGETC satisfies the 7 course pattern and some extra GE's.\n\nHowever, it's not recommended for stem majors because stem majors have to take many more classes compared to say social science or art students.
