Got on a volunteer program to talk about the importance of reading at low income area elementary schools while in uniform. \n\nShe was a busty gorgeous elementary school teacher, I was a chainsaw of an Airmen at 18. She thanked me after presenting and gave her the number to my little garbage t-mobile phone I just picked up. She refused, I insisted, she brought up the age gap, told her that seeing her in her element made my heart glow. Her age was irrelevant. She accepted and it kicked off from there.\n\nHow is that predatory? Everyone has a story, fortunately for you.. mine are mostly kick ass.",

Preferred body description inlcudes a type that is able to \"be confused for a young boy\". (check Xiao_Mei_Mei link) \n\nNot only that but he also preys on women with low self esteem because he feels they will \"try harder to please\" (check AbyssWaifus, Underarmors, and Xiao_Mei_Mei link). Which is ideal so he can influence her in a \"middle school uniform\" (check Xiao_Mei_Mei) while also explaining how he prefers Asian women because they are submissive and subservient.

He will feign ignorance if you engage with him it isnt worth the trouble and if you try to talk he tends to disregard your message by talking about his proof being an [Asian woman](https://imgur.com/a/szHIn3f) he \"knows\" and shares stories of her checking off all the stereotypes.
