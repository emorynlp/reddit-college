  "text": "Idk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m an engineering student, or if it\u2019s because i\u2019m a freshman, or both, but college is hard. I feel like im getting the material, a lot of it is review from high school, but whenever I take quizzes or tests, I can never get a \u2018good\u2019 score and my confidence has seriously faltered and it\u2019s only the first month. It\u2019s starting to make me question why I\u2019m even here when everybody else seems to be doing great. I\u2019m trying not to let it get to me, but I just have this overwhelming feeling of \u2018I\u2019m gonna fail this test no matter what I do\u2019 and it\u2019s kind of heartbreaking because I worked my ass off to get to where I\u2019m at now, and it feels like it\u2019s getting shoved right back in my face. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Anybody else?",

      "text": "College is hard, and especially in intro engineering courses.\n\nWhether it\u2019s right or wrong, the point is to weed out people who don\u2019t have the grit to get through it.\n\nSpend extra time studying, use office hours, take practice quizzes.\n\nThere\u2019s a line where you can work too much, but I highly doubt you\u2019re near it. College is a big step up in effort, and no one really preps you for it. But you\u2019ve got to give more than you\u2019re used to.",

I did and found myself having to learn effective ways to study and learn since I couldn't rely on the HS method of cramming notes at lunch before a test. The engineering classes don't get much easier either so focus on learning how you learn material.",

      "text": "Do you struggle with tests? You might need to work on your test-taking strategies. Studying with the test in mind and taking tests well are skills you can improve. I wouldn't necessarily trust that 'everyone is doing well,' people probably don't want to admit to struggling so you won't see it. Talk to somebody at your school and see if there are resources to help you! Maybe even your advisor and evaluate if you've taken on too much work.",
