First off, Trump thinks he\u2019s doing a great favor to the US by restricting H1-B visas but it\u2019s not really working that way( especially for tech). Now this decision by ICE simple shows how stupid the administration is. I really don\u2019t understand why they want to strip access to quality education from talented people ( who are foreign nationals ) studying in the US. It\u2019s not like y\u2019all aren\u2019t making money off of us! Additionally, it is such a HORRIBLE act to force students to travel during this pandemic, shell out even more money in this difficult time and risk not being able to come back. Even forcing universities to have in-person classes. Seems to me like this is the message they are sending:\u201d Hi! We  would love for you to contract the virus and make your life even more difficult, especially you foreign nationals. We would like you to not be educated in our homeland. Don\u2019t come work here either, so more US citizens can be successful.\u201d\n\nMoreover, half of the most talented researchers in tech are foreign nationals. It seems like the US being a tech hub is literally doing everything in its power to lose that status. Having a president who thinks consuming disinfectants can cure COVID and is against foreign nationals entering the country only makes out situation worse.  I really don\u2019t see why they have to take such harsh and stupid decisions like these. Jobs fine, you think we\u2019re taking away something from US citizens. But an education, seriously ? We international students first of all have a lot of restrictions while studying and working. We pay a helllll of a lot more money than citizens, we have no access to scholarships / financial aid. Why in the world can\u2019t we just study in peace despite having so many things that already make an education in the US so tough for us ? Really wish we had better individuals making such important decisions. Sorry for lashing out but this is just total blasphemy and I understand some of you may not agree with my opinions and that\u2019s your choice but these are my opinions and I stand by them.\n\nTLDR: They are stripping talented international students from quality education and are making their life hell by forcing them to travel.
