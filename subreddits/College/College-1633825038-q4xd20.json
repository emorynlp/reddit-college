  "text": "So, I'm in a completely asynchronous class right now and the basic structure is 1 discussion post, 1 quiz per week, with a midterm of the first 6 and discussion posts, and then a final with the later 6, and a few sporadic essays. Right now, I've received my quiz back with a low B, and my discussion posts with a few points knocked off but no comments. I have no clue what questions I missed nor do I know what I did wrong in the discussion posts that earned me points knocked off. Right now I'm at an 85% which isn't bad (though I will be honest considering the amount of studying and notes I took I thought I would have an A because I felt like I Understood everything) but I'm more worried about the future when I have no clue what I'm doing wrong/did wrong, especially with the discussion posts. Is it too much to expect that the prof will at least say what we did wrong on the discussion posts or at least release the questions that were answered wrong? I'm pretty sure Canvas, which is what we use, has an option to release the wrong answers even without releasing what the correct answer was, but my prof has that turned off. I'm just a little frustrated because the rest of the assignments are identical formatting until the end of the term and if the prof doesn't tell me what I did wrong then I feel like I'm going to keep making the same mistake. Thoughts?",

Does your discussion posts have a requirement where the initial post itself is due before a certain day? I use Canvas as well, and at my school you get points deducted if the initial post is not posted by Thursday. I don\u2019t know how other schools have it, but maybe this could be a possible explanation if you weren\u2019t aware?",
