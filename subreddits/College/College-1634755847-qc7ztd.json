  "text": "Would really appreciate it if you can try and read this whole thing and give me your opinion, or what you would do in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI unexpectedly got into an extremely high end college last summer and I'm in the first couple months of my freshman year. Unfortunately, I absolutely fucking despise it here. I'm extremely depressed, have horrible anxiety/social anxiety, and have no social life whatsoever. I hate my classes and have no motivation to do the work, but I manage to force myself to just barely do it on time and get fine grades. Basically, all I do is play video games, do the school work, and contemplate how much I hate my life here.\n\nA couple of my best friends from high school feel the same about their college and have already made up their minds to switch to a fully online college and live in an apartment together after finishing the first semester they are currently in. I am invited to this and it seems like a great plan for me, but is a very big decision. If I switch to online and join my friends in their apartment, I will have a guaranteed social life, be a happier person in general, save a shit ton of money, have more freedom, be able to see my family more, live through a much more memorable experience, and still get the same degree in the end. Also since I am not doing any clubs or activities at all and just sit in my room all day, I feel like the only thing I would be missing is the in person classes and face to face help from my professors, but is that really worth 75k a year? (online college can be like 10k a year) I am not worried about the online learning part because I did full online for almost 2 years in high school and it was totally fine.\n\nMy only issues are that it is a huge downgrade. This college that I am in now is probably a once in a lifetime opportunity and if I can manage to somehow stick it through and get my degree here, I will most likely be more educated and more confident in my career which gives me an overall higher chance in a stable future. On top of that, my family would be much more proud of me. I'm also not sure if I can handle working a job to pay for the apartment and doing college work at the same time with my bad mental health (never worked a 9-5 in my life) but I'm sure I would eventually get used to it.\n\nWhich would you do? Is my well being and happiness or education more important? Is this something I will regret?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Is the online college going to be giving you the same degree that your current college is offering? \n\nIf so, then I would 100% no doubt drop the college I\u2019m in and go with my friends. After living through a year of exactly what you\u2019re going through I can tell you that it fucks with your mental hard, if I had the chance to do that with my friends, then I would and I know I\u2019d be so much happier and it seems like you would be too. In fact next semester I\u2019m transferring to online college because I just can\u2019t handle being on campus. \n\nIf you really think your mental health is worth a piece of paper from a well accredited college then by all means keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Otherwise I\u2019d take the other route. \n\nBest wishes and good luck man.\n\nEdit: typo and spacing",

      "text": "What is your ultimate career goal? If you are going to grad school (or want to go to a prestigious one at least), you might want to stay at your school. If you are aiming for super competitive and selective career, you might want to stay at your school. BUT if you are aiming for a good career in maybe not a super major city, and importantly will get better grades at this online school, then I would prob go for online school. I would probably see if there are chances to do an online major at an accredited university, like maybe asu instead of Phoenix or something. 75k a year is an INSANE amount of money and you will probably be paying that off over decades instead of way less time. I would probably do online but I don\u2019t know what your life goals are.",

          "text": "So I've been thinking of a bachelor's in graphic design or a computer science degree which to my belief is possible through online college. These both do not need grad school which is nice.  Computer science should be fine but graphic design/video editing are pretty competitive. Why do you think it's better to stay in this school if I'm aiming for a competitive/selective career?",
