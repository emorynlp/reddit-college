You're not alone, really, and there are other ways to enjoy your time in college without one. You could always try asking around and seeing if anybody can give you a carpool. That might not be helpful for me to say to you lol, but still",

Everyone here has a car and goes all over the surrounding areas to parties and stuff and I can't cause I dont have a dime, working endless hours here at campus dining cause my parents flat broke, and we only own 1 family car. I can't afford a $20 Uber/Lyft to go 3 miles so I am left to the bus system which, while it works, really ties me down to the immediate college area. And yeah I live about 2-3 miles off campus so I cannot easily take any other transportation and no one is willing to carpool.\n\nAll to say I get it and yeah it sucks but try to make friends with the folks on campus, lot of times they also don't have a car or if they do they are more willing to drive you if yall hang out. I am kind of a freshman cause I am a transfer here so its my first year at a 4 year university as I came from community college but the point is college can absolutely be fun without a car. A college town ideally should be made for public transport and walking and mine is hopefully yours is as well. Also you are saving lots of money cause you don't have to pay for parking passes which at my school is almost $400-500 a semester and that only guarantees you parking on the outskirts of the campus. \n\nKeep grinding it will get better, most people take their car for granted cause it was given to them by their parents and, at least at my school, most kids got cars that are pretty new 2018 or older kind of stuff. I get it man but as I said keep grinding the fact that you have to work for everything you get is a really valuable asset since it gives you immense maturity",

I actually had a car but parking was at a premium at my college, so I didn't bring it until sophomore year when I lived off campus.\n\nMy school actually offers (not sure if they still do) a car rental service for students where you pay by the day. I would look into something like that through your school, as well as maybe Turo and carpooling with others. Surely you can make a friend who can drive you to school.\n\nYou're definitely not the only one and it affects seniors too. Me and my friend are seniors now and I drive him to places because he still doesn't have a car. I try to be there for him like that, but I'm graduating this semester so I don't think it can continue any longer. It's a huge expense that people take for granted. I'm sorry you don't have a car but don't feel like you need to struggle. Reach out and also work towards affording a car if you can.",

You have to pay for the car, oil change, gas, car parts, insurance , parking , etc. That all starts adding up and it\u2019s one less stress you have to worry about. I recommend you start saving up now so you can get a great car instead of the shit boxes most students drive. Then the wait will seem worth it. Good luck OP!",

I had a car my senior year and I totaled it (accidentally it was a whole mess omg) but I had a rental car for the rest of my senior year of high school. I lived on campus for my freshman year, as I already stated, but maybe you could take a campus shuttle? Or ask potential classmates for a ride?\n\nIf none of those options are available, I guess that you can just not attend the community service events. I know for myself, I used to always get anxiety asking people for rides. You could possibly try to find some electric scooter or bikes (or buy a bike outright) to ride to campus events?",
