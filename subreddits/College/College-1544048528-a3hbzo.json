Were any concerns you may or may not have had well placed? If they were (a) present and (b) well placed I suspect the issue is more or less that they're no longer relevant. If you didn't have these kinds of concerns then the question is whether or not your motives/intentions are the same as the societal messages you were picking up on.\n\nHere's an illustration. In NZ (my \"here\"), it's really not terribly difficult to get to university. If you can get University Entrance (a national qualification based on school results) then, in practice, you've almost certainly got the rank score for Auckland's BA or BSc programmes (and maybe some of the others) and if you've done that you're in. And that's for one university when there are seven (six?) others. So, if the goal is university, it's a breeze.^1\n\nThis is a complete contrast, for instance, to the main character in the movie The Perfect Score (standing in for America's societal messages) who has a very specific goal. As I remember, he needed at least X on the SAT in order to study a specific architecture programme at a specific university and by the nature of this admissions process was pretty much relying on a single exam. At least the characters in The History Boys who, again, have a more specific goal (i.e. Oxbridge) also had an interview on top of the exam. These goals are very specific enough that they're kind of binary... which immediately makes for higher stakes on top of being harder ambitions to start with than simply \"go to university\".^2\n\n^1 I say that because that's how I found getting UE. But even when I was at school when UE was much easier to get only 70.9% of my fellows got UE. The last few years it's been more like 63%. So, obviously, it does depend who's talking... not that I'd have thought of this without scanning this thread. For context, I actively thought I had a shot at getting the maximum possible rank score (I was very far from doing that in the end).\n\nThis is quite long so a tl;dr might be:\n\n1. Societal expectations are relevant only when they're relevant to you specifically.\n2. How much of a formality was getting in *at the time*?^3 \n\n^2 And to emphasise my initial point about the level of worry... compare a friend of mine who wanted to do medicine. I asked him to state his certainty in his getting in to the MBChB once. He said either 95% or 99%. He got in (and, indeed, has done very well). With that level of confidence there's no real need to feel like being accepted or not is a big deal... no matter how important the outcome is, the decision is reduced to essentially a formality.\n\n^3 Black Swans is a really weird expression here since 9/10 swans I've ever seen are black but I think the Wikipedia article on the probability idea is that people tend to decide that they should have seen something unexpected coming after the fact even though this truly wasn't the case based on before fact information.

These are kids who've always done well in classes, whose parents helped them with homework or applications or whatever else, who had access to SAT prep materials, who actually had people telling them they needed to study, maybe someone even took the time to show them *how* to study.

It's more like you've just been following the path the adults set out for you.\n\nBut think about how things might have been if you didn't have any of that. What if your parents never helped you with anything school-related, never looked at applications with you, never cared what your grades were like? What if your family didn't have money for prep materials, or even food? What if your school didn't bother with college talk because they didn't think any of you would have a chance to go? What if, despite having no help whatsoever, you still managed to get accepted to a good school? Would it feel like an accomplishment then?\n\nSo, if you're feeling like getting into university wasn't that big a deal for you, well, maybe it wasn't. Maybe you were helped along so well by the adults in your life that university just feels like the next step in the boring slog you've been railroaded into since childhood. That's ok, it's fine to feel that way.\n\nBut, before you start talking to folks about how easy it was to get in and how being there feels like nothing, think about who's nearby. There's a good chance the person right next to you had to fight tooth and nail through an endless mire of bullshit just to get accepted anywhere, let alone this amazing school, and overhearing you talk about how getting accepted was no big deal might crush whatever glimmer of pride they were starting to feel about themselves.

Once you achieve something, it soon means nothing to you again. \n\nJust think about all of the things you've achieved in the past. Got a good grade on an exam 4 semesters ago? Got invited to a party in your first week? Whatever you can think of, if it happened more than maybe a month ago, I can almost guarantee that you don't really care about it anymore. Sure, you can still be proud of it, but you're not going to lie awake at night smiling over that assignment you did well in 3 years ago because it isn't a part of your current life. \n\nSame thing applies to SAT/ACT and university applications. The moment you submit them, you may as well burn them. You'll never need them again, literally no one gives a shit about what you did in HS, and you'll soon forget even what *classes* you did in your final year. \n\nThe fact that you no longer care is a good sign. It means that you've moved on and found more important things to think about. The only people happily reminiscing on their HS stats and the application process are the people who peaked there and have since been a failure in whatever sense. If someone is failing university but did well in HS, you can be certain that they'll tell you all about their old GPA.", "author": "NoxiousQuadrumvirate", "created": 1544063730, "upvotes": 134}, "eb6p4ep": {"link": "/r/college/comments/a3hbzo/looking_back_at_high_school_makes_me_feel_like/eb6p4ep/", "text": "It\u2019s the same for undergrad to graduate school.
