However, it seems like students just don't tend to get scholarships after they start college.\n\nFor those who have gone out and applied, how much success have you had with getting scholarships after you already started school?",

I don't receive the money directly, and the scholarship doesn't cover materials.\n\nOn my own, I have applied to various scholarships and only received one.\n\nI'm a minority women and a first generation college student. I have also been through trauma. Yet, I still haven't won a lot of scholarships (in reference to the other comment).",

      "text": "I spent several months applying to essay scholarships. For relevant background, I have a 4.0 as a college senior and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a decent writer. I was applying during my sophomore-junior year.\n\nAlthough I got close (personal emails from sponsors) on a couple of them, I didn\u2019t receive any from that endeavor. I did get a small one from a bank for a uni-related application and one from the uni itself, though.\n\nI hate how this will probably sound, but you should probably hear it anyways. I looked at past winners for many of the scholarships, and there were certain..themes.\n\nTo put it bluntly, all else equal, if you are a minority or first gen student, have a disability, have cared for someone with a disability, have gone through trauma, or (possibly) are a woman, you have a greater chance at winning the essay scholarship than someone who those terms don\u2019t apply to.\n\nThere are the most opportunities available as a freshman compared to later years. If you want a more reliable resolution to this issue, I would look to employers that do tuition reimbursement. I think UPS reimburses $5k/yr. I worked at Home Depot and they reimbursed $1.5k/yr. That reimbursement is tax free. Just a thought.",
