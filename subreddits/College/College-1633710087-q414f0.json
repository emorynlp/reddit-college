  "text": "I\u2019m currently enrolled in 17sh, 5 of which are from the class I\u2019m thinking about dropping (ASL 1). I\u2019ve been lost in this class for a while and I\u2019m currently sitting at a 62%. The midterm exam is coming up and I know Im not going to do very well. I don\u2019t know if I should try and improve my grade throughout the rest of the semester or just drop it and try again at a later time.",
