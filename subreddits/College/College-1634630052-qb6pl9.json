I didn\u2019t meet anyone until my last semester and I had plenty of guy friends who were in the same boat. I know how hard it is and how lonely it can feel. Try doing some clubs or activities that tend to have more girls and just try to be friends with them, the rest will come. Run your race, not theirs!",
