  "text": "Hey everyone. I\u2019ve been having a really hard time lately when it comes to forming deeper relationships with people through talking with them. My whole life I\u2019ve been on the more introverted side of things and it\u2019s been really hard to see how much fun my friends here are having while im struggling.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t make me feel good about myself, you know? I want to get to know people but I really struggle with saying the right things to make people want me around them. My biggest regret has been not joining any clubs this year and that has been eating me up from the inside because im just not realizing how much I fucked up.\n\nIdk im feeling some type of way about myself as a person and I just want to change shit but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s stopping me. Maybe someone here has advice idk, but I\u2019d appreciate any at this point. Maybe it\u2019s a problem from within I don\u2019t even know I\u2019ve been depressed a good amount of my life maybe that\u2019s stopping me I\u2019m grasping at straws at this point I just need another perspective",

      "text": "Making conversation with people is a lot harder than people realize, and the people for whom it's hard for get really distressed when they see people do it easily. Two points: the people doing it easily usually have a lot of practice, and you're making assumptions by assuming it's actually easy for them, people can pretty good at faking shit while terrified.\n\nYou're not going to know how to ride a bike instantly if you've never ridden one before. You're not going to be able to program right away if you've never done it before. And believe it or not, socialization is a learned skill just like those, and a lot of people are not taught it correctly. Hell, they're not even taught that it's a skill sometimes and so they freak out when they can't do it because they think they should just know how. \n\nLook into therapy. They can help you with this.",
