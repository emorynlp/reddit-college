  "text": "Hi! \nI am currently enrolled at Cal Poly (SLO).\nMy dads way of showing love was taking me to sporting events, which fostered a love for sports in me and i always imagined i\u2019d go to a school with a huge sports program like an oregon or a boulder so i could have a team to cheer on the rest of my life, go to games with with my dad, etc.. \nAnd then i got into cal poly. When looking at choices like boulder and asu, cal poly sticks out a bit. a higher reputation in academics, everyone around me (except my dad) was pretty much telling me i\u2019d be an idiot not to pick this school, that they would die to go there, etc etc. So, i figured i\u2019d get over not having football and just went anyways. \nNow i want to preface that i haven\u2019t been here very long. it\u2019s been about 3 1/2 - almost 4 weeks only. but, i think sometimes when you know you know. it\u2019s not move in jitters, i\u2019ve made good friends here, i\u2019ve settled into a routine, but it\u2019s not home. And its never going to be the experience that I want, they will never have a decent football team, i won\u2019t be able to cheer them on from home, and football/sports/spirit isn\u2019t the most important thing to consider for schools but it DRASTICALLY changes the experience and quite frankly i\u2019m feeling like i got bullied into going to my highest academic school when it so clearly does not align with the one thing i wanted from my school for years. \nIf I were to transfer, i would want it to be for the spring semester. Because if i\u2019m set on it, it would be really difficult to stay for the full year and not be miserable, in my opinion of course. my college counselor doesn\u2019t really get it, says to give it a shot and i\u2019m trying but again my issues are something that i can\u2019t change and that will never change at this school. it feels very small. she told me i needed to have a much better reason to transfer. (they also don\u2019t have my preferred major, Marketing, here if that adds). \nShe doesn\u2019t really understand where i\u2019m coming from and how i feel. So, to the unbiased, do you think i\u2019m being ridiculous, should wait it out? is it really that hard to transfer for second semester?",

      "text": "As someone in a different, yet similar situation. My college as well is very academic, there are sports, but no one cares unfortunately, not even the school. No real advertisement of sports, only thing they do advertise is chess and the gaming team. Even then, our chess people are supposedly world class but idk where the hell they are, the team is small and they blend in too well lol. \n\nI also went with the best academic option I could get. In terms of ranking, this is the number 3 school for what I'm going for in my state, and it was the best option I had going for me on that merit. But I did get into other schools, schools with better sports programs, school spirit, camaraderie and  reputation. I opted to go for this one. \n\nFunny enough, I knew a guy who was studying mechanical engineering, and he and I were classmates in physics at a community college and when the time came around for applying to universities, he got into the same school that I did. I congratulated him and was expecting he'd be going there, until he told me he wasn't. I asked why, and he basically said the same thing you did. He said that if he was going to be putting in years of work anyway, he'd rather have a team to cheer on while doing it. And so, he went to a different school with a better sports program.\n\nAt the time, I was so geeky I couldn't understand his rationale. I thought the whole point was academics and surely there would be some of the stuff he was implying there wasn't at my future institution. But it turns out, that dude was right. He was spot on. My school is pretty anti-school spirit, no real feeling of \"belonging\", nothing to be proud of really. It's more or less a larger community college with good academics. That's the vibe. \n\nMore over to your point though. It sounds like SLO is not entirely the same as my experience over here at XYZ institution. I do follow in those other peoples' opinions in saying that is a really good school. But having had a somewhat similar experience with the pressure to go for academic prestige and all that, I can just say that in some ways it's bullshit. It's only cool to have the trophy of acceptance into the academic superior place for like a week, then you realize what it is, and how you actually feel about it. And that's when you find whether or not YOU, the consumer, actually values it. Not what everyone else thinks or feels, but how you think or feel.\n\nI say trust that feeling. It sounds like you know what you want out of college, you know what you'd be okay spending money on, and you know what you'd get more out of in the long run. Academics are everywhere. No matter where you go to college, you will get an education. But as you've determined, not every college has the same ecosystem or opportunities allotted to students in terms of socialness, camaraderie, and securing a sense of ownership and pride of being a member there. That is something a ranking website will not be able to tell you. That is something only you will be able to determine. \n\nTL;DR Different person in a different place, but a similar experience. I heard you, it sounds like you got your head on straight and know what you want out of school. Go get it.",
