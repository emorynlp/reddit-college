  "text": "**If you want to read the story that began this, I made this post in October:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor\\_said\\_i\\_hacked\\_into\\_his\\_computer\\_to\\_get/](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/jcuhw7/professor_said_i_hacked_into_his_computer_to_get/)\n\nHey everyone. I come bearing good news. I ended up winning an academic dishonesty case against my professor, who claimed that I cheated on a Zoom administered exam because I answered a single question with something that he didn't teach in class. He claimed I searched up my answer because he saw something similar online. This all started in October, when my professor held a meeting with me and tried getting me to confess to something I did not do: cheat. He then proceeded to report me to the college even after I explained my side of things to him and told him numerous times I didn't cheat and that he's making a mistake.\n\nFor all of October and most of November, I was utterly depressed. All of my hair fell out and I lost like 10 pounds, for real. I was so stressed that I couldn't even eat properly. Waking up every day felt horrible. I felt like I had a huge weight on my chest and I wouldn't be able to get it off, ever. I couldn't focus on anything this semester, friends, family, even my other classes. I couldn't even leave my room and talk to my parents, and whenever I did, I would cry. Parents can't do much but show you sympathy and reassure you. What will be the outcome? What will happen to me? Will I get kicked out of college? These were the questions I thought about 24/7, and sadly, my parents couldn't answer them.\n\nI'm a pre-med student and a cheating accusation could derail my entire track to medical school, my lifelong dream. I thought my life was over. Yeah, I know this sounds dramatic, but it really isn't dramatic when you're living through it. On top of that, I go to a really prestigious and expensive college in NYC, I felt like all of the money my parents worked so hard to save up and spent on tuition for me would've gone to waste if I didn't win this thing. Premed student or not, just being accused of something you didn't do while being completely innocent can ruin you, especially in college, where you're just starting to experience adulthood and independence, stuff like that.\n\nAfter the professor pursued his case against me, I still didn't back down. I challenged his accusation and wrote out my appeal letter and sent it to the dean. I kept on going to his lectures, taking every single exam and submitting every single assignment and homework. I didn't miss ANY of that, and that's extremely important to do when you're faced with a false accusation like this. My professor stopped grading my work, though, and admitted he couldn't grade me fairly anymore because I was disputing his allegations. I reached out to everyone I could, the deans, my advisors, the department chair, to inform them of this. I was being treated like I was guilty by this  even while my case was pending.\n\n**RESULTS: I WON THE CASE.** After torturous weeks and weeks of waiting, I found out from my college's dean a few days ago that the case against me was dropped completely because my professor's claims were unreliable and his insufficient \"evidence\", which was an assumption, didn't make any sense. I had an incredible support system behind me throughout all of this, and I'm so glad my name was cleared. Just because of a stupid, careless mistake on my professor's side, my entire college career could have been ruined.\n\n**If you actually cheated and got caught, don't even try to appeal your case. It will most likely fail and you'll end up digging yourself a deeper hole, and the consequences for your academic violation could be even worse if you lie about it! Colleges hate liars and you'll make things even worse for yourself by appealing the punishment. Please don't risk getting expelled for something like this. Own up to it, learn from it, and move on. And stop cheating!!**\n\n**BUT if you're falsely accused of an academic violation and you're innocent, DO THESE THINGS:**\n\n1. During the initial meeting with your professor (if they offer one) to discuss the violation, make it clear that you didn't cheat, don't apologize for anything, explain your side clearly and calmly, and definitely communicate to the professor that you will be appealing the case if they decide to report you. **Don't let the professor take advantage of you,** because this is what happened to me. Had I defended myself properly, I wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place.\n2. **APPEAL, APPEAL, APPEAL!** If the professor does end up reporting you, know that you have the right to appeal by your university. I'm pretty sure this applies to every single institution in the U.S, at least. Start drafting your appeal letter, or prepare what you need to say during the hearing.\n3. If you can afford an educational lawyer, definitely hire one. It's not necessary and they won't be able to directly defend your case, but it's nice to have someone who can help you write your appeal letters and locate any evidence that you need to defend yourself.\n4. Reach out to an academic advisor, the department head, the deans, whoever has some sort of power. Don't be embarrassed to inform them. The more people you have on your side from the beginning of the process, the better.\n5. If there's an ombudsman/student representative in your university, TALK TO THEM. Set up a meeting and ask them to walk you through the process and what you have to do to protect yourself. They should even help you write your appeal letter. I didn't have an ombudsman at my college (weird, even though my college's law school is well known) but I had my advisor, class dean and the department chair on my side.\n6. **Don't stop attending the classes** where you were accused of cheating in. Keep doing everything you would've normally done-- homework, tests, assignments, etc. Don't miss a single thing, seriously. If you do, it can make look like you just gave up and don't care about your academics. I even went to review sessions for exams and asked my professor a ton of questions on topics I didn\u2019t understand. Remember that it is your right as a student to have your questions answered and your work graded while your case is being reviewed.\n7. **Have patience.** Academic violation cases can unfortunately take a lot of time and you just have to wait to hear from the committee or whoever is going to review the case. Also, during the pandemic, there are a lot of academic integrity cases anyways because students are literally cheating left and right and getting caught red-handed, even over Zoom administered exams. However, there are other innocent students (like me) who didn't cheat and are being accused due to misunderstandings or just sheer negligence on the professor's side.\n8. **Trust the process, and GET OFF REDDIT!!!**  Unfortunately I was an idiot and came to Reddit seeking help. I posted about my case (linked above) and desperately asked strangers for advice. Some people said that I'm not going to win the case and that my life is over. These comments really made me second-guess myself and my college. I thought that my college could indeed convict me of a false accusation. Turns out all of those negative comments are wrong. Here's some good advice from someone who commented on my old post: **\"Some rando is not going to ruin your academic career unless you allow them to\"** and I agree with this 100%.\n\nSorry for the long post, but this is what happened. I won the case and I'm going to take my final for this class in a few weeks. It was stressful, it spoiled my semester, but I learned a lot from it, especially how to defend myself, even if it's against people who have power over me, like my professor. I know that as a future doctor I'll be getting a lot of false accusations, threats and lawsuits from patients, and honestly, this situation has slightly prepped me for all of that!\n\nIt's sad and unfair how some professors can get away with maltreatment and false accusations, ruining a student's life. But if you know didn't cheat, then don't worry, you will be fine. Don't think that your college will just side with the professor since they have more \"credibility\", that's not true. **Yes, the process is extremely frustrating and stressful, but the process is not unfair.** Remember to defend yourself and don't back down. If you did cheat and you got caught, though, I don't know what to tell you. Actual cheaters deserve the consequences and that's all I'll say. Yes we all make mistakes, but if you cheated and you're punished, accept the sanction and move on. That's due process being served.\n\nI hope this post was helpful. All hope is not lost, friends.\n\n**TLDR; I was falsely accused of cheating by my neurotic professor who pursued an academic violation case against me to my college and I won the case. Some tips/advice for those who are going through something similar in college**",

I agree with professors point of view tho that it does seem unrelevent to put in a term she hasn\u2019t taught and how sketchy it appears to be. She hasn\u2019t filed a case but I\u2019m ready for whatever cause I know in my heart I didn\u2019t search anything up. When she emailed me, she implied already that I searched something up on google and it raised concerns. We used lockdown browser and I didn\u2019t have my phone next to me but kinda hurt how she implied that. I think I\u2019m more so scared of that stress that is going to follow if she does a case but if that happens, I just know that my innocence is going to really help me. They might not see it but I do.",

      "text": "I too have gone through something similar. This just happened to me and my cousin last week. We both worked on a lab together for a programming class and since our work was similar, we were reported by the teacher for having similar work. We had been doing work together all semester long and now this lab was apparently an issue. My cousin and I were also part of a group chat for about a week that had apparently been sharing answers to homework and labs all semester long and because we were part of the group chat, we were flagged and reported as well. I was so stressed about it that I nearly failed both exams I had last week. I couldn\u2019t do anything for days. But in the end we just accepted it because in the syllabus it states that students can only engage to a \u201chigher level of thinking\u201d with other students but apparently can\u2019t do assignments together. My teacher said we could write up the algorithm on a white board and gotten to the same answer but we can\u2019t write code together on our living room TV. We didn\u2019t see any other point in trying to appeal because the teacher would show our assignments to the board of people we\u2019d have to be in front of and it would have been over from there.\n\nHowever, I know I\u2019m not a cheater. I\u2019m just trying to get through school and get a job. I finally found something I\u2019m in going to school for and in my first semester this happens to me. Thank goodness I or myself cousin were not suspended and it was more of a \u201clearning experience\u201d but the school continues to keep it on their record and we have to attend a plagiarism class. The only learning experience I got from it was 1) not to be apart of any mass group chats 2) any sort of teamwork is discouraged especially in the middle of a pandemic and 3) with that logic, apparently it took one man to build the space shuttle.",

No one knew how to do it, he intentionally puts it on there to see who cheats and wants you to come ask him about it. I ask an upperclassmen for help (allowed in this class as long as I state I referenced someone else for help) and get the problem MOSTLY right, still missed quite a few points. Flash forward a week or two and I get an email saying I need to set up a meeting with him. He accuses me of cheating on several problems in the entire homework and I need to confess and he\u2019ll be putting a letter on my academic file. I obviously say I didn\u2019t cheat, I got help from an upperclassmen and stated that on the homework. Flash forward another 2 weeks I get called in for another meeting, he sets the problem down in front of me and tells me to do it, I try but after a month of other things going on and a problem I didn\u2019t completely understand in the first place I tell him I don\u2019t remember, yet get part way through the problem. He then tells me I can confess to cheating on it or he will go through the rest of my homework\u2019s for the quarter and will look for other instances of cheating. If he finds anymore it will result in me failing the course and possibly more from the institute. I again say I didn\u2019t cheat and got help from the upperclassmen. At this point I email the dean of students as the professor is basically threatening me with all of this stuff. A couple more weeks go by and he finally talks to the upperclassman. I get an email, he\u2019s dropping his case after talking to them and taught them better ways to help people on assignments in the future.",

I kept denying that I did and she was planning on reporting me for her opinion that I plagiarized, but eventually decided to drop the case thankfully. It is so important to stay calm and defend yourself! This professor tried to take advantage of me because I went to her for help, but you just have to hold your ground and know that if you did not plagiarize, then you should be okay and there is hope!",
