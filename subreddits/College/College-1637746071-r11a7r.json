  "text": "I live in an apartment complex with 3 roommates. I\u2019m on the first floor with a sliding door that we walk in and out of. We have two parking spots conveniently outside of our door right in front of our small porch. The problem is that our neighbors directly above us are very childish. Everyone in college drinks and has people over and what not, the thing with these guys is that they are in a frat and don\u2019t give a fuck about anybody but themselves. They even stole our bong from us and we have no way of proving it. Every time they drink they throw beer cans, spit loogies, and throw up on our cars/ in front of our porch where we walk every day. I confronted them in an aggressive manor and the kid who answered the door was \u2018pleading the fifth\u2019 as you will\u2026 acting like he didn\u2019t do anything. I called him and prick and as I walked away he says \u201cat least my car doesn\u2019t have stains on it\u201d. That drove me the wrong way. Now we need to get back at them some way or the other. I could contact the landlord but that\u2019s last case scenario because that could cause more trouble. They started a war. Drop your ideas!",

      "text": "Contacting the landlord should be the first thing you do. \n\nYou've got to play like adults do. If you go to their level, you'll ultimately lose. \n\nRead your lease agreement, understand the agreement that you and them both legally agreed to. Contact the landlord. If they are violating the agreement, it's cause for eviction or at least a warning. \n\nYour city will have noise regulations as well. If they are making noise past those times, start calling the non-emergency police line. Generally, kids doing stupid shit like that will be smoking pot and cops showing up is a big buzz kill. Plus, they could be underaged drinking. \n\nYou'll have to get a camera for your car. Car cameras are an excellent investment anyways and they can be set to trigger every time movement happens by your car. People can't be vomiting on your car. You need to keep a log that you went and spoke to them about it and next time it happens, get ahold of the landlord or police to start a paper trail. I'm not sure the extent of the damage, but property damage is illegal especially if they continue doing it after you've asked them to stop. \n\nRealize that anything you do on their level will equate to a stronger force by them. Behaving like children towards children will elicit childish responses. Go at them like an adult and they'll have adult consequences. Children don't like that. \n\nOther than that, fill a fucking super soaker full of mustard and spray the mother fuckers.",
