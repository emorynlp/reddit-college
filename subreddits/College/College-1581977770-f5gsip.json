I also used to work 70 minutes away from my community college, so I really sympathize with your commuting situation.\n\nIn terms of mindset, this is your job, it is your responsibility and to your benefit to go to class. I don't want to put you down, but it's almost embarrassing that you are showing up consistently late to a class in your major. I could see if it was something pointless or awful, but these professors and classmates are very important and you're making a bad impression by being consistently very late to class. I am probably one of the few that does this, but I treat my classmates like coworkers and my professors like bosses. I pull my weight on group work, I ask professors for help when I need professional advice or help with homework, and I help my classmates if they need it. I am embarrassed to turn in an assignment that is not well done. I am embarrassed if I slacked off on a group assignment. Maybe my major is very different from others, but we are a tight knit group of about 30 students going through most of our classes together (construction management). Everyone knows who the slackers and unreliable people are, and no one will work with them as a result.\n\nIn terms of physically doing it, I know this may be soul crushing and I'm sorry to tell you this, but you have to wake up around the same time everyday. While I'm in school, that is 9am. While I'm working that is 6:30am. On the weekends we can maybe stretch it from 9am to 10:30am, but I can't sleep until noon without messing up my schedule for the whole week. It's much easier to wake up early, if you consistently do it everyday.

(Cognitive Behavior Therapy) which is basically \"make it a routine\" except for the start which can be a bit brutal.\n\n----Cognitive Behavior Therapy stuff. \nYou have a sleeping area, only use it for that. Don't lay in bed doing other stuff.\n\nYou choose a time to go to bed, people require a varying amount of sleep but 8 hours is probably the best way to start. Keep in mind that while you feel like you need less, you are paying for it by an unnoticeable loss of efficiency that you probably can't afford. \n\nYou have 20 minutes from when you are in bed to fall asleep. If you are still awake, get up and stay up, try again tomorrow.\n\nThe impossible part for you will be to avoid unnatural light and your screens, I understand that try to use an application that reduces blue light two hours before your planned sleep time or where blueblocker glasses (they are amber tinted sunglasses) Blue light is wake up signal that you would get from the morning sunshine, and it literally tells your brain to wake up. \n\nAfter two days you'll definitely be able to fall asleep at the right time, and if that time is early enough you'll not feel so lazy in the morning.\n\n----Alarm Stuff\nI find the extreme alarm clock ringtone is effective for a smartphone. If you're really really bad about your alarm, use something like the early bird alarm app that allows you to choose a condition for the alarm to stop. It ranges from taking a picture, scan a qr code, solving a math problem, a voice recognition, etc... I've found that if you use a specific qr code, and you hang it up somewhere you have to get up and go to... That will solve most of the snooze and roll over problems. \n\n----Circadian rhythm \nYou can encourage your body to naturally wake up in the morning by watching a sunrise, and I do mean that, literally stare into it. It works even if it is cloudy as long as you look in the right direction without anything between you and the sun. (Glass blocks stuff) \n\nBy avoiding blue light before bedtime, you can set your body's time to sleep. \n\n----About My Routine. \nI wake up at 5:30, when I'm not sleep deprived I will wake up around 6:30-7:15 without an alarm. And I effin hate mornings.\n\nEdit: I tended to game late at night. I found that I could simply put that at the beginning of the day, and go to bed earlier.
