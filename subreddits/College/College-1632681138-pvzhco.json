  "title:": "Should I step down from my Club President role early?",
  "text": "I plan on talking with my club's advisor and my executive board (E-Board) sometime next month or in November, but figured I'd ask random people on the Internet first.\n\nI first became my club's president last Spring; I wasn't \"elected\" to the position, I just took it because no one else wanted it. The old president even pushed two other club members to become president because she wasn't keen on me becoming president. Needless to say the semester did not go well at all. The most people we had at a GBM was 10 people, and we had some socials where it was just me and one E-Board member present. I strongly considered stepping down but ultimately decided to stay on and see if things got better.\n\nFast forward to this semester, we had 120 people at our first meeting; but of those 120 people, only 20 showed up to our second meeting. I feel like I have good ideas and an overall good strategy for leading the club; but I'm not executing. My E-Board is great and I couldn't ask for a better group of people; they're definitely carrying the club. I'm not very charismatic, nice, or outgoing so I feel like I repulse new members; especially since I'm the one presenting the meeting slides. I'm thinking that the old president was right and I'm not the right person for the job. The club needs someone who is the complete opposite of me to be able to grow. Our club has potential and I think I'm holding it back, should I step down after the end of this semester? I'm graduating next Spring so I'd just be leaving early.",

      "text": " A couple ideas:\n\n1) Delegate your responsibilities out to club officers. You have an executive board? Great! Put one member in charge of bringing the food, another in charge of conducting the meetings, etc.\n\n2) Present your leadership strategy to the board and ask for their opinions on it and on how you can work with the board to see that your leadership strategy becomes a reality.\n\n3) If you feel that ideas #1 and #2 won't work, say so to the board.\n\n4) Hold a club election to vote for your replacement. Publicly endorse someone you have reason to believe would be the best president the club will have. If the rules state that all club officers must be appointed, and there's no way to change that, the election can serve as a sort of \"opinion poll\" that tells the person in charge of appointing the next president whom the club would prefer to be president.",

          "text": "I have no issues with task delegation, I think I did a good job reorganizing E-Board roles at the beginning of my presidency. I mainly struggle with the human aspect of leadership not strategy; I'm not charismatic, outgoing, or nice and that really affects the club retention. Unfortunately, if I'm the \"face\" of the club, the club members have to like me. I do care about the club, but I think me stepping down might be the thing that could push it to be better. Any one of the E-Board members would be a 100% better President than I am.",
