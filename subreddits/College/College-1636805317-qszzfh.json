  "text": "I don\u2019t even know how to make this sound sensible but I\u2019m having second thoughts about college. I want to go and I\u2019ve already received my first acceptance letter. But how will I pay for it? My parents can\u2019t help and loans are scary. There isn\u2019t enough scholarship money for this to work and loans scare me. I don\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life in debt. I want to live the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d: college, stable job, marriage and kids, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible for me. There\u2019s definitely a lot more to this but is there anyone who went through the same thing? Or anyone that has an answer?",

You may get a managerial operations type role but outside of your industry that's gonna be your thing.\n\n\\- If you switch industries it's like starting over again. Hello just above minimum wage pay and always working holidays. \n\n\\- You actually need to look at the skills/requirements of the job. Most of the time this means you possess an actual acumen (you can evaluate risk, you know what the financial statements are, what goes on them and why, stakeholders, you can speak the language of your engineers meaning you know project management).\n\n\\- And everyone in those C-level and above roles has has someone help pay their way through college most of the time (if you're like me it takes longer if you pay it yourself). Management too is also mostly credentialed. That's just how it is. Look it up in the Bureau of Labor's Occupational Handbook if you haven't seen it with your own eyes already. \n\nUnfortunately the education became more necessary the more I learned.

      "text": "Lucky for you, this is a question with findable answers! Go to your college's website, and look for their career destination surveys. You can also go to LinkedIn, and search people who went to your intended school, in your intended major, and see what they're doing now. A lot of what career options depend heavily on what you do *outside* of academics, but doing either of the above should give you a general sense for the kind of jobs that people who you'll be sharing a degree with are doing now. Then, you can parse out the average salary you can probably expect after college. Try to estimate a yearly budget, and see how much net you think you'll have after taxes and expenses on a yearly basis given the likely field of occupations your major may open up for you. Then, calculate your total indebtedness after graduation, and figure out if you'd reasonably be able to pay off that debt on a timeline you find reasonable. Compare these calculations with occupations that you could secure with no degree, an Associate's, or even see if grad school could open up some sufficiently higher paying careers (grad school ofc would require a bit more math to estimate additional debt). If you stand to be making more with a degree, and you'll be expected to not have too much difficulty in paying off your debt, then college is at least fiscally worth it. There are other factors, like the kind of work college grads vs. non-college grads do, the benefits of the networks you can build in college, the chance to engage in interesting things like research/public service/etc, but as far as the brass tacks of figuring out the financial impacts of going to school, you can figure all that out with an afternoon on a spreadsheet. The internet has tons of info on how to do all these calculations, if you need help figuring them out. Good luck!",

      "text": "It depends on where you want to go with your career. Look at the Bureau of Labor Statistics website and fiddle around in there. That's a big factor in how I decided how much education and the general area I wanted to get it. I knew I would need a college education for my career path, but not how much, would a bachelors be okay, would I need my masters, or perhaps a doctorates (PhD) (it would also turn out I indeed needed a doctorates....)\n\nThat's also where I'm getting at. Depending on the field you want to go into your level of education also matters.\nI'll use my major for an example:  I'm in Astrophysics. Extremely brutal, but depending on the position I want to go into depends on my education. The positions I want to get into depend on a doctorates because I want to go into the NASA type of research level. This is essentially what the Astronomy/Physics department advisor told me, that because I'm aiming so high specifically for my career I should get my PhD because if I were to get my masters for the most I'd be able to work in an observatory, or to teach the subject with the ability to get a higher position. With a bachelors I'd mostly be stuck to working in museums or teaching without being able to rise up to being a department head and such like that. He told me he only got his masters, so he was able to get a high position in the teaching field, but he wouldnt be able to go further than that. This was an estimate of what they told me, but that's specific to my career path and how high I've set my standards to.\n\nThe same process but with different careers can also be applied, like oh you can only be a manager in so and so career if you have your bachelors. Think of the same way in the medical field too, you need an education to go into the field, but depending on specifically what path you're taking depends on the amount of education. There are several pathways in the medical field where all you need is to go to a technical school, take a specific pathway at a community college, or a certificate. I'm not talking about general education though just in case you got thag idea. It's specifically for the position, like being a phlebotomist or being an x-ray technician. I really recommend going to technical school to do something like this if you arent sure, because even though it's not \"real\" college, you can still make a ton of money and the amount of people in those fields are dwindling. I would've gone to technical school if I didnt figure out my current plan to college. I made sure to back a plan a, b, c, d and I mean that literally.\n\nIf you really do want to go to college specifically, there is enough money for scholarships, you just have to find it. You won't always get picked, but there is a ton of scholarship money out there. There are scholarship websites that work, and some where you have to do all these steps just to apply for one scholarship (those are the bullshit ones in my opinion). You should look up the school you want to go to and search for their financial aid/scholarship department website. I can almost guarantee there is one for every one. (I say almost because I dont have the time to look at every single college websites).\n\nLoans can be scary, but if you have to resort to that option then stick to federal student loans. That is what I'm doing and federal financial aid. I have to resort to this because for what I'm aiming for unless I work for years living in my parents basement without spending money on rent food whatever to live somewhere else in a dead end job I would never be able to pay for college.\n\nYou should also take a good look in the FAQ for r/financialaid (it's something like that... just search financial aid on reddit and you should find it. Not that hard).\n\nYou also have the option to work through college, you can pay off your loan during college too, it's not like you have to wait until the last moment where you only pay interest (depending on the loan you get).\nYou also have the endorser option too, my cousin endorsed my loans because they owed me big time and knew I wouldnt screw them over.\n\nThat's all I can think of my brain is fried, I have an assignment due by tonight and I got a midterm and essay due next week. You also have gen ed requirements in college, and if you go to community college first for gen ed then four year college be careful of where you're going because there is a change that not all of that will transfer over depending on where you're going. I did not want to take two years of school just to do it all again because the college I wanted to go to decided lol no, I would've been pissed beyond belief because that would've been about two years wasted for nothing. This applied to me specifically because I legit went cross-country for college. The community college back at home had a page in their website of all of the colleges that would completely transfer all credits to because it was affiliated with the four year colleges in the area and in the state. You can look up your community college and see if you can find a page like that or email their admissions team about it.\n\nGood luck soldier.",

Don't believe this our school is prestigious nonsense, that is purely a salesman selling point, or you need a college professor in order to learn something.

I took all my pre-reqs at a community college and looking back it is one of the smartest moves I made before transferring. The only time that (oh our prestigious school) would be in a play is if they are teaching some new cutting edge technology/method that you can't learn somewhere else for cheaper and you are specifically learning (i.e. Stanford having the only CS degree in the 70's or some new medical tech or something at say Johns Hopkins).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I want to live the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d: college, stable job, marriage and kids, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible for me.\n\nThis generation is slowly being cheated out of that, but It's very possible, but this is a huge potential life pitfall and you need to play your cards right.\n\nColleges of today are without shame or guilt preying upon this generation and don't be part of the joke that is [being played on this generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOebuG_5Knk) of getting sold a useless degree  through predatory lending. They've lobbied and rigged the system to where student loans are pretty much the only debt you cannot declare bankruptcy to get out of.\n\nI have no debt and am finishing up a second professional degree in my thirties and really laid down what should have been some good years of my life to make that happen.\n\nI know too many peers that have large amounts of student debt that they are on track to die with and for a degree that really isn't doing much for them.",

Shouldn't employers not really care about the degree requirements if you have the equivalent in experience?\n\nThe problem with work experience replacing education is that the employer cannot know the applicant/employee's knowledge without extensively testing them, as work experience is limited to learning what you need for the job. Obviously it is rather expensive for employers to extensively test every applicant, so that is why they favor education. With education (certified by university/accrediting board for X field like ABET for engineering), employers know that the applicant/employee has a strong knowledge foundation that doesn't lack critical areas. If applicant/employee lacks knowledge in a critical area that they need to learn something else, then it will take very long time to fix that, then learn the other thing.\n\nIt is like a house: someone lived in it for many, many years, maybe decades or centuries, and presumably renovated and repaired it over time. But when you buy it, and now you want to renovate it in some way, maybe you discover the house can't support it because it was not built properly, or the builder long time ago took a shortcut because he was not constrained by regulations. So now you have to wait for repair before you renovate. But with new house, it is all up to code. Maybe it doesn't have all the nice renovations over the years, but at least you don't have to figure out what is missing and what is not. And maybe you can do multiple renovations at the same time, which is faster than the other case.",

I honestly wish I had taken one of these classes. They had classes in things like automotive technology, culinary arts, web design, etc. It was never really pounded into our heads that we should all go to college.

IMO, community college is the best place to go since it is cheaper, more flexible, and you're set on just a type of path, unlike uni: to earn a bachelor's. It is one of the best places to go figure things out without going into crippling debt while going into college \"undecided\". It could be that you decide you want to be a  respiratory therapist, car mechanic, or a commercial truck driver, instead of studying biochemistry or any four year track. It could also be that you decide to drop out of CC because you have satisfied your curiosity or an opportunity showed up and it can't help you anymore.  Also, don't think the \"American Dream\" is for everyone to go to college, get a wife, and get a house. It could be that you're happier as a minimalist truck driver who lives in an apartment and has casual sex once in a while. \n\nJust my $0.02.",

I'm 22 and just now started this year because I waited and thats okay. It gave me time to explore career fields and come back with a better plan for what I want to do with my education.\n\nI struggled on my own long enough to realize I don't wanna do this forever, scraping the bottom of the barrel for bills when I could go back and get an education or learn some skills. I don't regret deciding to go to college at all, I love it, and I'm doing better than I have in a very long time. Keeping up with the loans are scary at first but it's really not once you get used to just being conscious of your finances more. I don't really worry about it anymore.\n\nMaybe look into a two year community college first though if you're still worried, that's what I'm doing. With Student Aid I was eligible for a little over half my tuition on a grant alone and then the loan as well as work-study programs and scholarships. Just don't back out of the opportunity. There were a lot of people who told me I didn't need school but they had all gone and were doing significantly better while I was climbing my way up. \"You don't need college\" is some of the worst advice I've ever received.

Use this year to get your bread up. Work full-time at a place that offers a high minimum wage like Target or Costco. Maybe you can wait tables too or learn a useful skill you can profit off of. Depending on what you want to do, you may be able to get some low-level experience working in your desired field. Find a roommate or two so your rent is cheap. Don\u2019t blow your money on dumb shit like a new car, $100 shirts, or eating out every night. \n\nAfter one year passes, enroll in community college and cut your hours at work back to maybe 20 hours a week or so during the fall/spring. Bump back up to full-time over the summer to revamp the bank account. Study hard for 2 years and, if you do really well, you shouldn\u2019t have a problem getting scholarships from your transfer school, organizations you\u2019re involved with, or externally. You typically wouldn\u2019t qualify as an independent student, but you could always try to get a dependency override. If you can pull it off, you would probably be eligible for a full pell grant. \n\nAt this point, you should have enough money to pay for anything left over if you\u2019re at a state school. Some schools also have interest-free payment plans that will allow you to pay your remaining balance over the course of the semester. Keep in mind, you would need to attend a 4-year university within that same state to be eligible for in-state tuition. \n\n2 short years later, you could have a debt-free bachelor\u2019s and a solid entry-level job at just 23 years of age, well on your way to accomplishing the American Dream.",

Less than 30% went towards higher education. Many of my friends went into the trades or working some receptionist job after high school. I took a gap year off and am now going to community college because I want to be an electrical engineer, so I am majoring in electrical engineering. It has been an amazing time for me since I get to know people of different education levels and ages, pursuing things like dental hygiene, HVAC, Nursing, GED, etc. It is quite diverse.\nNot to mention, my job is paying for everything.\n\n>Now of course trade schools are a thing and anti college nuts love pushing it, and its a good gig don't get me wrong. Decent pay for very low cost but the problem is they're all labor jobs. Not everyone likes working their body and being dirty and tired all the time.\n\nOf course, and most often, they are exaggerating to think that they are a secure ticket to 100k+/yr when the average tradesman makes a modest living (50k-65k). Most of the time the exceptions are business owners, self-employed people, and union people.\n\n>If you want a desk job = college.\n\n>If you want a labor job = trade school\n\nNot necessarily true. You could get into IT w/o a 4yr degree (with caveats, of course), whether it's an associate's from community college, certs, or talent. For certain jobs like engineering, accounting, investment banking, etc., yeah you NEED said degree.\n\n\nAlso, you don't even necessarily have to go to trade school to become a tradesman. You could be an apprentice or go and do volunteer work (Habitat for humanity (carpentry), for example) and a potential employer could scoop you up if you are good at what you do.\n\n>Both pay well and have their own cons/pros.

                      "text": "I should\u2019ve specified, I work mostly for RVs. The other stuff is just on the side. The reason is that where I\u2019m from, there is year round demand, and RVs are essentially recession-proof. Everyone needs a place to stay, and there\u2019s a major surplus of RVs around here that people just set to the side and forget about. \n\nCarpentry work is the main issue with the RVs. They\u2019re mostly made of wood, so leaks absolutely wreak havoc on the roofs and floors. My wife and I are able to do most any repair like that, it just takes forever. Would make more economic sense to hire someone. \n\nAs for mechanics, they are a dime a dozen. A lot of people work on motors as a hobby, not many people do carpentry for fun\u2026 and if they do, they have other business tying them up.\n\nI also try and stay away from major mechanical issues. The most you\u2019ll ever really see from something that has sat for years is a bad fuel pump and fluids needing to be replaced. \n\nAs for building the mindset, you really have to do some self-reflection and ask yourself what you want to do with life. Many people are satisfied working somewhere forever and getting a very consistent income. It provides nice safety and comfort, absolutely nothing wrong with that. But it seems like as of recently, society as a whole is moving towards wanting to work for themselves. \n\nThat being said, do something you generally enjoy. Personally, I love talking, negotiating, selling, and the rush I get from getting a big hit. Use any extra income you have to fund what you need for the business. For myself, all I needed to do was save up enough to get my foot in the door. I\u2019ve gotten RVs for very very cheap, a couple hundred bucks. It\u2019s just a matter of finding the right ones. \n\nBut if your business is power washing, for example, save up money to buy supplies. Then practice on friends/family. Don\u2019t charge a thing, just do it for experience. Take before and after photos. Then once you\u2019re confident and comfortable with the work, start to advertise not only your business, but yourself. The most important thing I\u2019ve found is not the product or service you\u2019re offering, rather, it\u2019s the experience the customer has in dealing with you. \n\nAt the end of the day though, it just depends what you like. If you\u2019re great with people, more of a sales/negotiation based business would work. If you enjoy working independently more, find a niche in the market that isn\u2019t oversaturated, and market your skill in that niche accordingly. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you enjoy what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019ll inevitably be successful in it.",

      "text": "I agree 100% that you should go to community college for 2 years first instead of going straight to a 4-year university. It should knock out the Gen-Ed courses and make the whole experience go quicker because it\u2019s less time. Less time = less tuition needed. Community College is usually cheaper too. Cheaper = Less overall tuition needed. I have planned out my whole degree plan, which is why I know this. I would also be willing to help you plan yours if you need help with that. Usually academic advisors are suppose to help with this, but mine has not, so I became my own academic advisor and anyone else\u2019s (I became a Certified Life Coach and this is one of the things I do\ud83d\ude06).. but I do think it is important to talk to whichever  one is assigned to you at your school (if you decide to go).\n\nMy Experience: \nGoing to 2 years of community college is helping me a lot with Gen-Ed requirements (and some specifically for Psychology, etc.) for the university I would like to transfer to! Then, instead of it taking me  4 years for a bachelor in Psychology, it will take me about 2 - 2.5 years. I say 2 - 2.5 years because I\u2019m considering minoring in Criminology/Criminal Justice, but I don\u2019t particularly like school AT ALL, so I don\u2019t know if I can tolerate doing it for longer than I \u201cneed\u201d to. \ud83d\ude06 \n\nAnyway, my biggest advice is to DOUBLE CHECK THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CREDITS WILL TRANSFER TO THE UNIVERSITY YOU CHOOSE (wanted to say that part in capital letters, just in case \ud83d\ude02). In my case, the university I want to go to has its own transfer credit calculator on its website. It lets me put in all my community college courses and lets me know which courses can replace the 4-year university\u2019s courses. Once it\u2019s calculated, it shows me how many it thinks transfer and a percentage of completion. It says 66 credits transfer and that I\u2019m at a 55% degree completion (\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc) and that\u2019s not counting what I plan to request to be transferred on top of that (\ud83d\ude33)! Some of them are not obvious, but I plan things out, so I know which classes I will request the specific transfers for. After the specific courses get chosen, it says I can use the rest toward the 120 total credits needed for my degree. That means I only need 54 more credits of 120 credits! So magical.. \ud83e\udd7a\u2728 I emailed the 4-year university\u2019s transfer department and they informed me that I will basically have to show them how the community college courses matches the 4-year university\u2019s courses by comparing the syllabus/course catalog descriptions (and whatever else they request). They said I can only do it AFTER I am accepted, which kinda does not make sense, but I am like a lawyer (but an honest one \ud83d\ude06) and I come prepared with my documentation! The good news is, I already see that most transfer and I only need to request about 4 specific Gen-Ed courses. The main 2 reasons I did this are.. \n\n1. I do not like school, so I want it to go faster and take less money, regardless if it\u2019s FAFSA, scholarship, or out-of-pocket. \n\n2. Community College is usually cheaper compared to 4-year universities. 2 years instead of 4 years should cut the total bill in half or by a lot. I plan to continue my education after and I would prefer not to spend so much time and money on my B.A. in Psychology. \n\n\u2728 TO ANSWER THE OP\u2019S QUESTION IF COLLEGE IS WORTH IT \u2728\nIt can be worth it, it just depends on what you want to do in life. I want to help people and the way I want to do that is to be a psychologist (whether a Clinical Psychologist or a Criminal Psychologist). I also became a Certified Life Coach/Health and Nutrition Coach. Although I help people daily, a psychologist requires degrees. Also, I feel that I will have better resources to help people if I became a psychologist. Will I be doing basically the same thing after I\u2019m licensed, most likely. But society says I need a degree (which is very understandable in many ways, especially if it\u2019s any type of doctor) and it\u2019s my dream to become a psychologist and help people\u2026 Therefore, if I want to help people properly and become a licensed psychologist, I must get degrees. That probably doesn\u2019t sound very positive, but I\u2019m being honest. xD After I got out of high school (2012), I tried community college for about 1 year and I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and did bad, so I took a 6 or so year break (I\u2019m 27 now) from university (and went to therapy)! And look at me now! Almost done with my Associates Degree AND my B.A. in Psychology (and I still go to therapy \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc). Did I do life in a way that\u2019s considered \u201cthe norm\u201d? No! But if I\u2019m a 35-year-old psychologist, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be!!! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\u2728\n\n\nTL:DR (but still kinda long, but less long \ud83d\ude02) - \n1. I agree that 2 years of community college is a good idea. It can get the Gen-Ed courses out of the way and it lets you focus on the subject you actually want to study at the 4-year university. It can also make the 4-year degree go faster because you get the Gen-Ed courses out of the way. For me, I am going for a Bachelor in Psychology, but I am viewed as half way done by the 4-year university, so it should take me about 2 years. I may minor in Criminology/Criminal Justice, so that may take longer (extra 21 credits). \n\nLESS YEARS OF COLLEGE = LESS TUITION NEEDED\nLESS COLLEGE + LESS TUITON NEEDED = LESS OVERALL STRESS\nTherefore, community college before regular university = good. \ud83d\ude02\n\n2. Email the 4-year university\u2019s transfer department or something similar to it, ask questions. \n\n3. Keep track of which courses you\u2019ll need for the 4-year university and check the course descriptions. They may have differing names, but the descriptions are often pretty similar. Whenever you get a syllabus, save it in a folder if it\u2019s paper or in a computer folder if it\u2019s virtual. \n\n4. College/university can be useful depending on what you want to do with life. If whatever you want to do requires a degree, technically that means college/university is worth it, because it\u2019s required. It could also help you earn more money because you have a higher education than your other co-workers. If you want to do jobs or careers that don\u2019t require them, then technically it\u2019s not necessary to go to university. Maybe somewhere down the line you\u2019ll change your mind though, who knows! \n\n5. Talk to the school and see what types of ways one can submit their payments. Obvious ones are FAFSA pell grants, FAFSA loans, and scholarships, but some schools have payment plan options that for out-of-pocket. My community college has an agreement with a company and it\u2019s called the FACTS Payment Plan. It takes the total cost and, depending on when it\u2019s submitted, divides it in 3 or 2 payments. It could be called something else, be a different company, etc., but I suggest you talk to the school\u2019s financial department. I don\u2019t want loans either and loans do sound intimidating. I used to insist I wont get them\u2026 but I realize now that it may be necessary for 4-year universities\u2026 But my solution to reduce the amount is by completing as many courses as possible in community college! The university I want to transfer to says it\u2019s required to have \u201cupper-division courses\u201d*, so I\u2019m trying to knock out all the Gen-Ed courses and as many \u201clower-division\u201d courses** as possible at community college. My last years of my bachelor degree will basically be ALL electives (\ud83d\ude33) that I got to choose to support my degree and that I\u2019m actually interested in. \n\nHopefully all of this makes sense and I\u2019m sorry I wrote so much, but if you or anyone has any questions, I\u2019ll try to answer! REGARDLESS OF WHICH CHOICE YOU MAKE, I BELIEVE IN YOU! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\u2728\n\n____________\n* Upper-division courses usually have a \u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d as the 1st number after the courses abbreviation. Usually found at 4-year universities. \nEx. PSY343 or PS443\n\n**Lower-division courses usually have a \u201c1\u201d or \u201c2\u201d as the 1st number after the course abbreviation. Usually found at community colleges, but are also at 4-year universities. \nEx. PSY243 or EN101",

And making a choice about how much money you are willing to take out (if you end up taking out loans) is easier if you have a plan for what types of jobs you\u2019d be able to land. Like for instance, the highest possible salary you could end up with in your field, the usual position salary, the lowest salary possible. That gives a look into reality and allows you to be able to see if you could afford to pay back loans, while still being able to afford life like rent, groceries, car, etc. And it would help if you lived wirh your parents after graduating, so you could make larger loan payments so you\u2019d have less interest to pay off/you\u2019d be able to pay off your loans quicker. You could also work a couple years and take a break from school so you could save money and not have to take loans out. Another option is community college. The first two years are pretty much gen-ed\u2019s anyway, so why pay more than you need to. You can save so much by going to a CC and transferring out and you\u2019ll be thankful in the end. There are so many different routes to achieving a college degree. And even a few years off can help you mature and allow you to think about what you really want and see that you are for sure about wanting what/where you want to put money towards for your degree.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t tell you how many people I went to high school with or knew from other high schools that went off to college, and ended up at my CC by the second semester or sophomore year.",

Yes, Google hires people sans a degree, but most of these people are not people who can't buy alcohol. Overall, your skills matter more. A degree in Compsci is not required, but can be invaluable under the right circumstances (i.e. no debt and you take internships at these companies). It also depends on the job. Software development? Degree not required, but preferred. Hardware engineering? BSEE or related degree required. Not to mention, it is hard to learn hardware compared to software.\n\nJust my opinion, overall I agree with you.",

The only benefit i see to a private school is connections, knowing people will get you ahead quicker. You can offset this by doing very well and being well-rounded. \n\nMake sure you fill out FAFSA, and apply for a lot of scholar ships. I'd recommend a community college first, get your associates. The first 1.5-2 years will be the same at virtually every institution. and a CC will be less expensive (my cc was $120 per credit hour for out of state students ($40 for in-state)) so Associates cost me \\~4k. Which made it where i didn't need to spend as much time & money at a 4 year university. You don't need to get your associates either, you can just get transfer credits. My entire college career I spent 110k, 3 years at CC (because I'm a dumb-ass) then another 4 at university because I double majored, and minored (Environmental, Civil, and GIS/CAD). Though 45k was room, board, food, and various bills. I graduated may 2020, and am now debt free (well student debt free). I worked my ass off while at uni too. It can be scary, trust me. But loans aren't the end of the world. \n\nTake a look at what you want to do. STEAM fields tend to have a higher payout short term maybe a decade to fully payoff loans even at the private institution cost.\n\nEngineering is a great field with lots to do, but isn't for everyone. \n\nMedical can be paid pretty well, though again that's not for everyone. And 12+ years of school for a doctorate will lead you to into a lot of debt. We always need RT's and Nurses, which dont require a doctorate or masters. \n\nUnfortunately Education doesn't pay as well as it should, so don't go into this field expecting \"tons of money.\" Go into this if you really want to teach. Its a draining job. \n\nBusiness is a bit of a mixed bag, marketing can make a butt load of money. Same for accounting, etc... but I don't have a lot of experience with this field, so can't speak about it to any degree of certainty. \n\nIn the engineering field, we need a lot of CAD people, so that's always a possibility. Not a full blown engineering degree in terms of difficulty, but is tedious and not paid as much as an engineer either. Will always be in demand though. \n\nTrade schools are another option, same with construction, it wont be easy on your body to do every day for the next 40 years, but it can pay VERY VERY well. \n\nfeel free to PM if you have questions.",

Be sure you practice coding and pursue extracurriculars/ internships. This guy went through many majors before sticking to what I think is graphic design with an emphasis in UX design, wasting money and time in the process because he was unsure. As long as you're very sure about your major choice (which is amazing btw) and you plan ahead, it will be 10/10 worth every penny. Good luck!",

It has definitely taught me a lot, what I want in a job, how to work with people, etc. it really just depends on what you want to pursue and if you know what you want to pursue\n\n\"Worth it\" is highly subjective. An electrical engineering major who knows they want to be an Electrical Engineer, who started at community college, took on as many internships as possible, graduates in 4.5 years and 0 debt, degree only costed them 32k, and makes 70k upon graduation, would most likely say \"HELL YES! It was worth every penny.\"\n\nA kid who has no idea what they want to do who majors in \"fluffy bunny studies\" , changes their major various times, going back and forth between uni and CC, wasting their time and quadrupling their costs, doesn't pursue any internships, and then finally graduates with a degree in \"hot potato studies\". They get a job at 45k a year but has 70k in debt. When asked if college was worth it for them, they will most likely say \"ABSOLUTELY NOT! I pissed away 7 years and have 70k in debt for a dead end job!\"\n\nIn my opinion it is definitely worth it, but it just depends.",
