  "text": "The only 8 am class I have, which is also the only class before 11 am I have, has an attendance policy I\u2019ve personally never encountered before. Basically, for each class you miss without a medical note, 1 percentage point gets taken off of your final grade. For example, if you ended up with a 95% in the class but you\u2019ve missed three classes, your final grade would be a 92%. Have you encountered a more \u201cextreme\u201d attendance policy?",

I had courses in undergrad where if you missed more than one week\u2019s worth of classes for unexcused reasons, you\u2019d have 15% docked off your final grade for each additional week you missed. For classes that met once a week, this meant that two unexcused absences would drop you one and one-half letter grades.",

If you miss more than 4 class sessions, you become eligible to receive a failing grade in the course\" \n\nIs a line in one of my course syllabi. The it's not as extreme as you'd think though in context: \n\n\"After 4 absences, you could fail. If you miss more than 4 class sessions, you become eligible to receive a failing grade in the course or to be dropped from the course. To prevent those consequences from being implemented, you must meet with me.\r  \n\r  \nIMPORTANT! The point of this policy is not to be hard-nosed. The point, rather, is to prevent students who experience crises from simply disappearing. If you have a crisis, you will find that my instincts are sympathetic. But you need to stay in touch with me if we're going to be able to work out a feasible accommodation. If you simply disappear and then resurface near the end of the semester to try to salvage things, it will likely be too late.\"",
