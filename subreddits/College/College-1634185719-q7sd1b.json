  "text": "I'm a forestry/natural resources major at a community college and I've never had so much fun at school. I'm the kind of person who hates school but my studies are so involved and fun that it doesn't feel like a chore at all. I even got to go into a river in a wader and now I have a field trip coming up where I'm going to do fuel reduction work in a forest. \n\nGoing to a small school is awesome. I know almost everyone in my program and the teachers are always eager to help anyone find a summer job or even a career after graduation.\n\n I went to a university for a semester before switching to community college (couldn't focus on classes) and I'm so glad I did. Don't feel obligated to go to a 4 year university (but don't completely rule it out, universities definitely have their benefits). There are plenty of options even out of community college, and you'll make connections which will help you even beyond school.",
