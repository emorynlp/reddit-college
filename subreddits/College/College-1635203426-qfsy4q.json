  "text": "I don\u2019t understand what is going on with my situation in terms of if I have to re-apply or not. Basically I have a deployment coming up next year and at my school you have to miss 3 semesters and then you have to re-apply. The deployment will be that long and they told me I have to. And it\u2019s not guaranteed that I will be accepted back in. I thought students who are serving were protected and did not have to re-apply and can just start back where they left off. On the military side, a few people who have been through this situation did not have to re-apply. I\u2019m not sure if this is just a school policy and each school varies. Or if the VA rep and advisor I\u2019m talking to don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about and are giving me the wrong information. Does anyone know?",
