      "text": "Waking up at the same time everyday helped me alot. I would recommend using an alarm at first until your body automates the process. Once you get it to stick it should make you feel more energized throughout the day. It really is amazing how such a simple task affects your life in so many ways. Just be sure not to fall back asleep haha.",
