  "text": "Just like the title says, my business prof\u2019s sister was just killed in a car wreck. His class is very difficult and a pre-rec to my major, so I email him often and go to office hours a lot. What\u2019s a way to be sensitive to his loss while also getting the help I need? Any tips? I don\u2019t want to be a jerk, but I also want a good grade.",

If he expects you to continue to perform at the same level in the class without giving help, try reaching out to other professors who teach the course or similar courses at the school and see if they can help you, I'm sure they are sympathetic to the situation if they are in the same department. If your professor seems to want to just focus on his work and continue to help people, then you shouldn't have an issue. Just respect his space if he requests it and play it by ear.",

All my questions had to do with data missing from requirements like word counts and which reading applied to what question if it was overlap. I got really good grades with this method 3.75 at PSU 3.88 at uw and a 4.0 at Georgetown. So leaning on your professor isn\u2019t a requirement to doing well. I would read the required readings with a notebook on my side taking notes and quotes of the most important parts of the readings. I would read the assignments or writings before doing the reading keeping an eye for the answer. I would watch Ted talks and other YouTube videos to supplement the readings. I would study with friends at the library in my undergrad. In grad school I would meet with my buddy and talk about what I learned that week and listen to his summary too. I would also do a weekly journal of what I learned that week, my favorite quotes and how would apply the learnings.",

You have got to be respectful of your professor's space and emotions right now. Or worse, be known across campus faculty/staff as unempathetic, unkind, and unable to adapt and problem solve. I promise it will bite you down the line when you apply for internships, register for classes, ask for letters of recommendation, etc. Word travels FAST among faculty especially regarding something like this. Don't become the break room gossip because you feel entitled to your professor's undivided attention during such a big loss.",

If you have a question, try trawling through the textbook/Google/asking other students. Unless it's a structural question about the class, those options should be able to cover it 99% of the time. No matter what field you're in, you're not going to get through life emailing every question that pops into your head to your boss. \n\nMake a GroupMe or something for the students in your class. Someone in the class probably understands the material well enough to answer the questions you can't find in the textbook or on Google. And maybe start it off by discussing with other students what you can do to be respectful or putting together a care package for him.",

But if I\u2019m paying thousands of dollars for something, I expect support to an extent. \n\nIn my entire associates degree, I had exactly one class where I needed this kind of help.

My college also has tutors permanently on staff in the library that you could use free of charge with an appointment. If you are still struggling in a couple weeks, then go back to prof. But try to use other resources for a couple weeks. As someone that has lost a sibling, it\u2019s a tough loss.",
