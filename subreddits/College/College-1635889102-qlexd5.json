  "text": "Just like the title says, my business prof\u2019s sister was just killed in a car wreck. His class is very difficult and a pre-rec to my major, so I email him often and go to office hours a lot. What\u2019s a way to be sensitive to his loss while also getting the help I need? Any tips? I don\u2019t want to be a jerk, but I also want a good grade.",

      "text": "Respect whatever boundaries he sets. At the end of the day his mental health and healing is far more important than a grade in a class. If he expects you to continue to perform at the same level in the class without giving help, try reaching out to other professors who teach the course or similar courses at the school and see if they can help you, I'm sure they are sympathetic to the situation if they are in the same department. If your professor seems to want to just focus on his work and continue to help people, then you shouldn't have an issue. Just respect his space if he requests it and play it by ear.",
