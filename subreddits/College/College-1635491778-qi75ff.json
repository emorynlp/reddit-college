  "text": "My program is projected to be a 2 year Software Dev diploma. I am only in my first sem and I love what I chose but there is a lot of pressure around me. I am brand new to programming and there is A LOT of work with these classes. Having the chance to gain an extra year would be beneficial to my studies. I have more time to focus and learn while at the same time, more flexible time to do other things in my life.\n\nOne thing is holding me back, It's my parents. My parents want me to succeed in only two years. I don't see this happening. Sure, I might be able to graduate with the diploma but feeling rushed and possibly, not knowing much about programming anyways.",
