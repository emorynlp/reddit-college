It is the antitheseis of everything this school upholds to, such as diversity, and mental health. People here are so fucking caught up in clout, they don't want to give people like me a chance to hangout at all, and I don't even know the reason. My first couple nights here were lit, but now when I hit people up via snapchat or instagram, they lie and say they're working or some shit, and I just want to chill and hit the bars or a house party. I have beer even, it just fucking sucks. I want to transfer to Temple, because I'm from Philly originally in the first place. I feel like I'll blend in there well, and I feel like people are more down to chill with anyone there, because it is a city school, and so many kids go there. There is a bullshit boundary at West Chester, the rich hang with the rich, and kids with mental problems are left to deal with life on their own I feel like.", "author": "mexavans", "created": 1632616949, "retrieved": 1632945973, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"heayn4g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvj883/im_upset_with_the_party_life_at_my_school/heayn4g/", "text": "That\u2019s so different from my school, I can\u2019t even imagine, perks of a stem/eng school IG.
