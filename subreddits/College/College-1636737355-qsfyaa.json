  "text": "I attend a CC, first semester student trying to knock out these Gen EDs. Just curious as to what your guys\u2019 tests are like. \n\nMy history tests are multiple choice and T/F, no critical thinking or explanation questions on it. \n\nMy math tests are pretty tedious and repetitive, I recognize a good portion of the questions on there from previous tests.\n\nI\u2019m not a gifted or \u2018smart\u2019 student, pretty average when it comes to my academic intelligence, but this is honestly too easy and ridiculous. I have some friends in the 12th grade who take much more challenging courses and tests than I do.",
