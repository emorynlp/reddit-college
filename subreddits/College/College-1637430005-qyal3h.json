We\u2019re ambitious, cut throat, and smart, but some of us are just slightly evil. \n\nWriting & Rhetoric is Hufflepuff. All around Major, super chill, all-around applicable, no entry requirements.",

Depends on the chosen field though really, the intelligence analysis and military defense people are Slytherin lol, spying and money.
