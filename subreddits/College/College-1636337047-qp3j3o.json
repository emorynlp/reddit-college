  "text": "Like most of us, I was remote in 2020. I\u2019m a senior now and am back in person. One thing that has been on my mind lately is how this pandemic has showed the true colors of some of my professors and the foundations of the program I\u2019m in. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit, everything turned upside down for everyone. Mental health got worse, people lost family members and friends, people were losing their jobs. Everything was a mess. So when fall 2020 came around and school started (remotely), we were given no slack or words of encouragement for keeping up. \n\nOne thing that sticks with me is one day, I joined class and my professor was disappointed in us for not creating enough work to show (I\u2019m in a creative major so you *always* need to bring progress on projects and you get made to feel like shit if you don\u2019t progress fast enough). She asked us what was going on and one girl spoke up and said we were trying our best with the circumstances we\u2019re in. My professor basically said \u201cwe have been in this pandemic for so long already, we need to move on.\u201d And this felt like a huge slap in the face because she has no idea what people are going through because of this pandemic. People\u2019s family members have died, people have been struggling with mental health, financial problems, etc. \n\nIt put such a bad taste in my mouth and I have noticed a similar and careless demeanor from almost every professor that semester. They didn\u2019t see us as kids trying our best. They saw as robots who should be scorned for not doing enough (and just know, everyone in my major is beyond talented. None of us are slackers!)\n\nAnd now flash forward to fall 2021 now. Towards the beginning of the semester, a boy in my major (and in every one of my classes) passed away tragically. My major is very tight knit and close since the classes are so small and we spend so much time with each other so we were beyond heart broken. People were crying in class, scrambling to set up a vigil for him, etc.\n\nWe got maybe 2 hours to grieve and then my professor was like \u201cwell, we need to get a jump start on these projects now and jump in full speed\u201d as if we didn\u2019t just lose one of our own.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve just been seeing this pattern throughout these past 2 years. When we even try to speak up as students, it doesn\u2019t matter. I just feel very hidden and like I don\u2019t matter at school sometimes because my worth only seems to be based on the work I create. I just wish we were seen as more than robotic creatives. Art/design majors have a lot of toxicity floating around and while a lot of the times, this toxicity comes from competitveness, it comes from the professors. I just can\u2019t wait to get out of here and never look back\n\nAnyone got any similar stories?",

Like before we went online, I was just kind of in autopilot mode sometimes and just didn\u2019t really pay attention to my professors as I was always stressed with work. But my mind has changed so much since being more aware and it sucks these people don\u2019t get evaluated for their bad teaching and inappropriate comments",
