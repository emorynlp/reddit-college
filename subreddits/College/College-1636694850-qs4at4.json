  "text": "Currently in high school, a junior. \n\nBy the end of this school year, I will have done 2.5 years of history classes (World Cultures, AP Gov, APUSH) and 3 years of science classes (honors chem, honors bio, AP physics.) \n\nIs this enough for college? I really want to take both business incubator and auto shop classes 1 and 2 next year but will have to cut out science and history classes from my schedule. Will likely be interested in a career in business/engineering of sorts.\n\nAny insight is appreciated, thanks!",
