Senior here who also had a rough start this semester. To prevent from being overwhelmed, I would try to sit down and make a schedule for things. You're going to have to plan to have a rough week where your staying on top of currently due assignments as much as you can and getting those others in. I made a deal with myself to do three assignments a day, sometimes that meant only doing the ones due the next day but often I found it made me do the ones due, then at least one late one. Make a plan basically. \n\n Not sure how big your university is but I would reach out to the prof and let them know you have been struggling but you have a plan to get these assignments in. I would say especially for bigger classes, don't expect an answer. \n\nIf you are really really behind or are finding it hard to catch up due to missing the content, go to office hours. Super helpful and can show that you care about your own success. \n\nLast but not least, if this was due to mental health issues, make sure you have all the resources you need. Go to counseling services, make sure you check in with yourself and other, and focus on getting a routine.
