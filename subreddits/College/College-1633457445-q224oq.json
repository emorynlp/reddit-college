  "text": "I used to identify as a 1st-gen college student, as neither of my parents completed school. But when I was a sophomore, my almost 50-year old father decided to go back to finish his degree, and recently completed it. Have I lost 1st-gen college student status?",

By that criteria, you should still consider yourself first-gen.\n\n\u2026 but practically, if there\u2019s a program you want to participate in you should check with the program coordinator.",

However, I did not receive the benefit of that, so I still declare myself first Gen.",
