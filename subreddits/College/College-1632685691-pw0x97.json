{"sid": "pw0x97", "link": "/r/college/comments/pw0x97/should_i_report_my_professor/", "title:": "Should I report my professor?", "text": "So in one of my classes the other day our teacher randomly brought up something that had nothing to do with literally anything. It had nothing to do with the class, it had nothing to do with our books, it didn't even have to do with the conversation we were having at the time. Randomly the professor says \"I need to tell you guys about my sister by the way, she is crazy\". She then continues to explain that her sister who did a lot of drugs in her early years randomly started to act crazy a month prior to when we were in class.\n\nShe then randomly brings the conversation over to Donald Trump. Saying that her sister voted for her and she then asks \"Did anyone here in this class vote for Trump?\" \"I just wanted to know\". Then a student says \"Yeah I want to know too, so we can all see ahead of time\". As I look around the classroom I can see a lot of people get uncomfortable. Black, whites, asians, hispanics, etc, literally everyone is uncomfortable. I did not vote for Trump, matter of fact I did not vote for anyone.\n\nBut this comment made me extremely uncomfortable because it was an attempt to divide the classroom, even if that wasn't her \"intent\". It made me uncomfortable also due to the fact that if anyone did raise their hand, they most definitely would have been shunned as the professor was steering the conversation towards that. Which obviously showed because another student brought up the same thing in a aggressive manner. IDK if I should report her or not but I feel like I should because it is unacceptable in a college classroom. I posted this some where else on Reddit but felt like I should post it here, so other college kids can give me a perspective.", "author": "pouringafour", "created": 1632685691, "retrieved": 1632945515, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 501, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hehtdn8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw0x97/should_i_report_my_professor/hehtdn8/", "text": "Getting political isn\u2019t good.", "author": "BrosephMyth", "created": 1632763981, "upvotes": 1}, "hehs809": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pw0x97/should_i_report_my_professor/hehs809/", "text": "Had a prof that ranted on about everything under the sun and called my sociology.

You\u2019d call it what it is: thought suppression by someone in authority. \nTrump supporters will no longer feel free to discuss in that class without fear of ramifications from that Professor, such as tougher grading or an overall less positive environment. \nAnd I don\u2019t say this simply out of some rosy-eyed ideal. No, it\u2019s strategy. If people \u201cclam up\u201d with their ideas, it becomes ever more challenging to extricate those ideas and help the student examine them and find fallacies. In other words: you\u2019ll never be able to help those students because they\u2019ll never open up to you. Which means they\u2019re more likely to hold onto their beliefs and remain unexamined. They\u2019re more likely to feel victimized, which is a recipe for extremism (seriously, google it). Plus, it\u2019s basic psych: the more practice someone has saying \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to something, the more likely they are to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in the future. So if they continuously say no to their ideas/beliefs being examined because they\u2019re practiced in saying no and are practiced in having a sense of \u201cvictimization,\u201d and if there\u2019s external evidence supporting their sense of victimization \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f stg this is college, at least act like you know how to use the information you supposedly learned.

If you tell this story to people who\u2019ve had this Professor and they report a similar encounter, ask them to sign a letter or something (groups of students are much more difficult to deal with than 1 or 2 pesky little buggers lol). \n\nNo one\u2019s  freedom of thought and conscience should be pressured like that by those in authority/with power over them.
