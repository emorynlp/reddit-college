  "text": "My daughter just went away for college and I'm wondering what the best advice (hey even average advice) you might have for a parent of a new college student.\n\nLike, what would you wish your parents would do, or not do.\n\nI didn't go away for school, and frankly my parents weren't very good at being parents, so I'm feeling a little lost on how to make her life away at college a good one. I keep buying her stuff/calling/sending little letters but I don't want to be annoying, and honestly, she's so sweet she wouldn't tell me anyway.\n\nAny advice or tips would be great.",

My freshman year she ordered me a care package for each holiday and was just always vocal about me being able to call her if i ever needed anything. Let your daughter come to you, reaching out once a week or so through text isn\u2019t clingy.",

      "text": "i\u2019ll say it\u2019s important to allow her the freedom to explore, find herself, get used to being away from you and grow into adulthood. meaning you don\u2019t have to drop by every weekend (unless that\u2019s what she wants! then by all means do so!) and you have to trust her to make the right decisions and allow her to make mistakes. but just don\u2019t forget to still\nbe there. yes she has to get used to being on her own, but still call/communicate! yes she has to find herself but never stop helping her! \n\ni think it\u2019s really easy to accidentally pull away TOO much because you\u2019re trying to give them that space for growth and learning, and you\u2019re also trying to not be annoying but just remember that\u2019s it\u2019s not a bad thing to still keep that closeness and show them that you\u2019re still there. give her to the chance to come to you, but still be there and don\u2019t be too distant.\n\nalso, one thing my mom continues to do that really irritates me is put all the communication initiatives on me. meaning, she gets upset if we don\u2019t speak for a day but she doesn\u2019t always text it reach out, and just expects me to do it. i find it annoying because it has to be a 2-way thing. a lot of the time i\u2019m either in class, studying or sleeping and i know she has work so we have to both make the effort. remember to not put it all on her, it\u2019s a 2 way thing. like someone said earlier, sometimes i wish she\u2019d just call more. i struggle a lot with my mental health, and she knows this, so sometimes it\u2019s just hard to initiate a convo because i can go all day/days without speaking when im in a bad episode and i just need someone to reach out to me, to help me remember how to speak and that im not alone. last semester was my first, due to covid i didn\u2019t get to start in the fall and i was placed in a dorm with people i didn\u2019t know, and never got the chance to know because they were always gone (it was a suite style dorm so we all had our own rooms, so communication wasn\u2019t forced like it would be in a traditional) and i didn\u2019t have in person classes so i had no friends. i\u2019d go DAYS without even opening my mouth, i was so depressed and i just wanted my mom to reach out to me sometimes, but she kept putting all communication solely on me and sometimes i just .. couldn\u2019t. we all go through rough patches in school (and life), and with covid still an issue, things are still hard for a lot of people, so just remember to call. if you haven\u2019t heard from her in a day or so, don\u2019t be upset with her, be patient and listen because something could be wrong. truly, i think that\u2019s the absolute most important part of it all honestly",

      "text": "A cute idea is sending care packages. I would love and appreciate that if I was dorming super far.\n\nEdit: Oh I see you already do that. Maybe during phone calls ask her how she's ACTUALLY feeling and remind her that she can tell you anything. Maybe remind her that you have get back on those bad days. \n\nSometimes I'm scared to tell my mom when I'm struggling because I don't want to feel like she's wasting her money on my education or something, or I'll be anxious to mention I had a bad day because I don't want her to judge me or worry. \n\nJust do whatever you can to listen and support her. I'm sure you already do this because you sound like a good mom, it's just being reminded verbally that she has that support can really make a difference.",
