  "text": "At this point I'm really desperate, I tried speaking to people during the first month and approached people but now its fall break and I have ZERO social interaction. I joined the nerd club and was a total outcast I went to 2 meetings and if I ever spoke I was completely ignored. I am at a party school and have no idea when and where parties are, and genuinely I just dont want to be the only person in the dining hall sitting in the alone section. Is there anything else I can do or is it too late for this year?",
