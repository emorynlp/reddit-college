  "text": "I would love to talk with anyone who has left the labor force. That means anyone who decided not to work while attending college, decided to retire early or just quit their job because they had enough money saved. I'm writing a story on declining labor participation rates for a journalism class. If you know anyone, I would love to connect with them.",
