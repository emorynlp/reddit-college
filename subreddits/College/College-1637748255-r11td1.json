  "text": "Took a gap year and went back to college this fall. Took 2 science classes and a math. WHY did I think this was a good idea when I\u2019m a dumbass to begin with?! \n\nIf I know I definitely won\u2019t pass one of my classes, should I even bother showing up to the next two exams for that class? Would I make it any worse if I did that? \n\nI have a chance at passing my two science classes as long as I don\u2019t fuck up the next few assignments & quizzes, but I think my math class is a lost cause. Jfc I can\u2019t believe myself.",

Even a D is better than a straight up fail. \n\nYou can also start trying to find a Study Group for your math class. Talk to your peers. Be proactive. \n\n\nI also want to let you know that all this \"lazy fucking idiot\" talk may make you feel better as you tear yourself down, but it's not productive. If you've been struggling this semester/quarter try and figure out why. Perhaps you're ADD/ADHD and never realized it. Or you're suffering from depression (like so many nowadays). Talk to your campus psychology center (most U.S. campuses have one), they can schedule some appointments where you can just talk to someone and learn coping strategies. \n\n\n\nGiving up is the lazy fucking idiot part. Learning from your mistakes is the Plus Ultra mindset All Might wants us to have.",

          "text": "Plus Ultra Mindset All Might wants us to have? What in the heck are you talking about.\n\nOP, get your ass in gear. I would highly suggest following through. You paid for it, at least you can go to get an idea of how the exams work and the content in the rest of the class. All is not lost.\n\nYou should work on setting 'laws' for yourself. For example, that every single assignment gets finished and that you NEVER skip a class. If you can manage those two things, your performance will improve greatly. From there, you can set up other small goals for studying. You don't have to study for hours and hours and sell your life to corporate college.\n\nCollege isn't hard. Keeping yourself disciplined to get things done when nobody is watching is difficult. You need to build your discipline for schooling. Even setting aside a block of time each day just to take care of college stuff will greatly reduce stress and improve your grades.\n\nI'm confident that attending classes daily and completing all assignments will help tremendously. It's important to make sure that on the assignments you strive for the highest grade possible. Since you're given a ton of time to do them, it's imperative that you take the time to know the content so you can get full points on assignments.",

Isn't working hard kind of how you succeed in college? \n\nCollege *isn't* hard. I'm unsure why my opinion is shit because that's what I believe. I'm sure there are other people who think the same thing. Just because it doesn't fit your opinion means it's garbage? That's very close minded. It's hard for some people to stand on their own two feet, that doesn't mean that standing is hard.\n\nWhat is wrong with reiterating good advice? You're upset that I built upon your suggestions to the OP? \n\nI know the internet has demonized 'pull yourself up by your bootstraps'. I'm sorry I hurt your feelings for saying that people should work hard in college. Working hard will make you successful in college. Expecting good grades without working hard will ultimately fail you. \n\nThe OP is 'lazy fucking idiot'. What does he need to do? Work hard and pull himself up by his boot straps. Or we should just give him an acronym and some pills! That'll do it!",

Telling OP to just work harder and have more discipline is basically the same as telling a depressed person to just cheer up. \n\nClearly it would be amazing if it was simply a matter of work ethic, but from OP's sharing it sounds like there's more going on than just a matter of work ethic. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/Hh59lPG5ifk",

Please take a break if that is what you need. But know that you are worthy, smart, intelligent and your grades now are not a determinant of your self worth. College can be hard, but you have to get in with a goal in mind, prioritize your learning, engage with  your professors if you are struggling, no one knows everything and you are in college to learn.\nI wish you all the best.",
