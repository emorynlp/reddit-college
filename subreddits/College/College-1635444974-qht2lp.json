About time, homework, resources, life, budgeting, etc. Literally anything! \n\nI\u2019m also working a full time job M-F 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM. Weekends off.",

Utilize a planner and plan your weeks out. What assignments you\u2019ll do what day, what class you\u2019ll dedicate each day to etc. It\u2019ll keep you sane and let things from piling up so you don\u2019t spend three days awake without sleep bc you left everything for the last minute. It\u2019ll also let you have a social life/time to rest on the weekends if you keep yourself caught up during the week. Otherwise you will burn out fast.",
