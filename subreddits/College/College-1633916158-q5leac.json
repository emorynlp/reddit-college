  "text": "I had an extension for a test from October 3rd (being the original date) to October 10th which is today. And I have a hard time waking up, so I got to work around 3:30pm for this test. Well I end up doing pretty good on it in my head, and I was just double checking my answers and feeing proud. Then I go to upload it to my college\u2019s website and I find out that my professor has graded the tests 20 minutes ago, and had notified us via email. \n\nSo, I got a 0. But I was under the impression it was due at 11:59 pm, so I emailed her explaining this. \n\nWhat do you guys think, am I going to get a 0, or will my professor accept the test I emailed her?",

When I tried to submit my work later that day, it had already been closed \ud83d\udc94 you should double check with your instructor, but now you've learned your lesson. You had the chance to take it since the 3rd and you decided to do it last minute....",

I\u2019m in school and I think your best tactic is to write something like:\n\n*Dear Prof.\nI want to apologize for getting my test in late, I made an assumption that the Oct 10th extension meant that we had until the close of the day to complete the assignment. I realize I should have confirmed this instead of making the assumption. Part of college is learning to better manage my time, and I will certainly take this as a learning experience. If it\u2019s possible for you to grade my exam, maybe with a point deduction for being late, I would appreciate it, I just don\u2019t want a zero to skew my average. If that\u2019s not possible, I understand, and will be more timely in the future. Thank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nStudent*\n\nIf you word it in a way that shows you are taking responsibility for the lateness, and request a grade as a favor, while giving your prof \u201cpermission\u201d to not grant you the favor, you will likely get it graded. Be polite and take responsibility, even it\u2019s a misunderstanding.",
