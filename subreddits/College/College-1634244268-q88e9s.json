  "text": "Heyo, I was just wondering if there was any way for professors to find out you reused an essay you wrote in high school. My paper was never posted anywhere online and only turned into my high school teacher. I\u2019m gonna change it up of course to meet the requirements of the paper but should this be okay?",

It\u2019s a memoir piece and usually I\u2019m very excited to write but college and work has been very difficult lately and with the deadline coming up it seems less and less realistic for me to create a full piece I actually think will be worthy of submitting. I guess it\u2019s the easy way out but it\u2019ll relieve some stress.",

Maybe you wont get found out, but if you do it is a big deal",
