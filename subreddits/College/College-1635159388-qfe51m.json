  "title:": "Do CS professors have a turnitin that they use, how deep do they check for plagiarism, plz help?",
  "text": "So it\u2019s 4am I forgot I had a project due, I did most of it, but there was a part that was online and I originally copy and pasted until I realized that he said he would check for plagiarism. I then changed everything, the format, the variables, some of the code itself, and I ran it into a plagrism checker and for some it doesn\u2019t come up at all, but for one it came out to around like 30 percent or so. \n\nI was so paranoid that I hired someone to do it just in case I can\u2019t come up with anything bc it\u2019s due by tomorrow. I\u2019m such a mess and a wreck, and like holy shit I don\u2019t know what to do. I can just cite my sources and then technically I can\u2019t be tried for plagiarism right? I just don\u2019t want to cite things and lead him on the right path so maybe I\u2019ll cite things that are similar but not where I found the probably code. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how deep he checks, and if he manually does it himself, or if he has a algorithm. All the assignment says is that it\u2019s going to be checked for plagiarism, but I can explain the code if need be. \n\nWhat should I do, I almost had a panic attack earlier, and I just am a mess? \n\nI have a test and this all due by tomorrow and I just feel like dying.",

I don\u2019t think he has failed to catch a single person who cheated yet.",
