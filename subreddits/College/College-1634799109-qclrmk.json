  "text": "Hello guys! Just wanna ask if it's worth it taking  Information Technology or Comouter Science in college since i don't really know much about the industry especially the salaries and demands, I'm really worried since i have a cousin who studied computer engineering and is now currently. It would be very helpful if you guys can give me some legitimate data and whether or not should i pick that course, thanks!",

      "text": "You can\u2019t go wrong with either, but if you hate math stay the hell away from CS. I got an A in every programming class I\u2019ve ever taken, but the math killed me to the point of a major change.\n\nThe CS degree is the best choice, but only if you\u2019re very smart. You can really get any tech job with either degree if you have the drive, but a CS degree will make that first job a bit easier to get and more pay.\n\nLets say for a second that the world is linear and a CS degree pays $70k out of college. The IT degree would pay $60k. It\u2019s less, but both are still very good investments, especially since mid career pay will massively increase. With an IT degree you might rely a bit more on certifications and self study outside of college, but for me, that\u2019s a small price to pay to avoid a math minor.",
