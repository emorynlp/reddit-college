  "text": "My group has to do a research project on businesses, and we chose to do a quantitative study because a case study fell through when the company didn't repsond. We have the questionnaire ready, but now we face the problem that all company email lists we find cost over 50-100$. \nThe two professors overseeing this are very unhelpful, they have no advice or help to offer, I've asked multiple times. They just say it's  \"difficult\". I voiced concerns about company response from day one but they didn't listen.\nSo, does anyone know of an email database with english speaking companies? They can be from anywhere and in any industry.",
