I preferably want my work to STAY at work and not trespass into my personal life, as I have a very low stress tolerance and get annoyed easily if people put too much pressure on me. I also want to earn enough money to have a good living standard, and hopefully also get to travel without work tying me down constantly and having my bosses force me to work weekends and after hours. I've had enough stress in high school and college, I want to LIVE a little after this is all done.", "author": "bananasushis", "created": 1632187374, "retrieved": 1632801307, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdo38df": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps8ffp/unable_to_decide_between_my_major_choices_and/hdo38df/", "text": "What you describe can be a case of the broader the major, the better. \n\nMany people go into the arts without any degree in such. Doing freelance work already will help tremendously to build a portfolio by yourself.\n\nTeaching in any capacity is also one of those things that's broad by itself. I know many people who don't have a degree geared toward teaching specifically, but they're teachers anyway. Many even have backgrounds in psychology. If you do decide to become a teacher, there might be extra steps to expect in getting certifications to do so without a degree geared toward it, although that's common in many fields.\n\nAdditionally, going into anything with international relations or political science also seems less than promising if your ultimate drive in that is to become a diplomat. That's a career that you might have to work toward with experience in lower-level jobs in politics.\n\nThat all leads back to psychology. Some people even stereotype psychology students as those who have no idea what they want to do after college, but the degree is so broad that everything usually turns out OK in that people find something they like. There are many options as to what to study in graduate school with an undergraduate degree in psychology, and it's usually those graduate degrees that lead to what people who started in psychology do for a living.", "author": "yourangleoryuordevil", "created": 1632189708, "upvotes": 1}, "hdo0ncy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps8ffp/unable_to_decide_between_my_major_choices_and/hdo0ncy/", "text": "Ok I will give you some warning: English as a Second Language can be a very fluctuating field depending on politics. COVID has hit a lot of these programs hard (a LOT of them have closed around the nation as a result of nobody being able to travel).
