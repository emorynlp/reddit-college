  "text": "I keep changing my mind about what classes to take in January. I have taken classes before but I always took them online. However labs, clinicals and other classes need to be taken in person. The class I need to be take next semester only needs you to attend six times in person. The rest of it is online. I'm just shy, anxious and scared I'm going to be judged. When I went to college when I was younger when I needed to start taking in person classes I freaked out and dropped out. In a way it was kind of a good thing because I didn't care back then and didn't know what I wanted to do. However five years later I'm pretty sure I know what I want to do. I know it's not high school but I am too sensitive and scared. Lol. Wtf? Shouldn't I be excited about this not scared? \n\n\nAm I overthinking this?",

      "text": "I would say you're overthinking but doing so justifiably. Everyone has feared judgment in some way. It's usual to have that fear in places where there's a preconceived idea you need to fit in there. I think it comes down to the common saying that most of the things you worry about are things that never happen. You have to do what you have to do, and as long as you do whatever that is, it's a job well done.",
