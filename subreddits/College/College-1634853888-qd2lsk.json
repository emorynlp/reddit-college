If you require work to be shown at least, most websites will not show the steps for free. If the goal is to understand the material Free response homeworks that require shown work and cannot just be simply put in a calculator because the nature of the question can easily turn homework into a good practice resource that should be worth something. The thing is, plenty of professors (at least at my university) just take questions from textbooks and change nothing. I can't blame them for not wanting to painstakingly make the homework themselves, but it is just my two cents, it adds so much more stress to the student when their exams are worth most of their grade because it just teaches to study harder for exams than just for general conceptual understanding. Imo, regular knowledge quizzes that are worth a pretty good part of the grade are the best way to show if someone's knowledge is progressing without them having to worry super hard about finals.",

It also might boost a students morale to do better if they\u2019re getting a grade for that work, but it goes both ways and they can easily find the answers and get easy points added to their grade, so there\u2019s both pros and cons to it. A lot of students will respond better to a professor who is more understanding and will want to try harder in that case, so being stern and \u201ctough\u201d might not always be the best way to go about it.",

Your outrage is from not seeing it before or being used to it.\n\nMy impression is that this is not common in North America. It is quite common, however, in much of Eurasia. It isn't unreasonable, it just puts a lot of responsibility on the student to study all of the material and understand the subject well.",
