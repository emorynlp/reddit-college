I assigned roles to everyone by giving a very detailed outline and telling them who's doing what, assuming they have no disagreements (which they didn't).\n\nFast forward to two weeks before the project is due and I already had my stuff done, but I also noticed nobody even *looked* at theirs yet. I figured what the hell, I'll check again next week, procrastination is a popular thing. Checked again, still no results. No matter how much I bugged them about it (which I did a lot of), we were down to 2 days before it was due before they mutually agreed, without me, that we should all just take a 0 on it.\n\n I'm not about that, so instead of messaging the professor, I called out of work and stayed up for \\~35 hours straight working on this shit. Submitted it with an hour or so to spare. Our grade came back being a 100 and they were all confused, but only said \"cool.\" when I explained what I did. They didn't even fucking thank me, just.. \"cool.\" from one of them, a \"thumbs up\" react from another, and nothing at all from the third.\n\nI'm still angry about that and it's been over a month.
