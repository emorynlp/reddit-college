  "text": "Should I double Major? I'm a BA Student, currently enrolled as a Major in Sociology, Minor in Psychology. I was thinking of changing my minor into a major. Is it a dumb idea? I mean, there is a connection between these two subjects? (hello social psychology). I want to hear your thoughts. I structured my papers for future enrollments and I reckon it is doable. :\\^(",

There's a lot of noise going on about sociology, people are saying this is not a job-worthy subject, but I don't want to drop this Major. I love studying socio.\n\nThe problem is the cost of the Psychology subject. It requires an additional paper in my final year, therefore pricier.",
