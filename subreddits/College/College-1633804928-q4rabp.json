  "text": "is it valid to make a complaint about a prof while currently taking the course with them? obviously, i'm fearful of any repercussions, such as biased marking (which there's no way to prove because you can't go into the mind of someone to collect concrete evidence)currently taking a course with prof who is being adamant about not replying to emails, very difficult to get a hold of in terms of communication\n\nmentioned they would host office hour, so i went in person, but they never mentioned it would be virtual (all the previous times I met with them in person, so this was totally unexpected) , so I took the bus all the way to school and eagerly brought all my notes with me only to be met with no replies after me knocking on the door, I was waiting outside of the office and then realized that they were still hosting a zoom meeting but weren't in their office (previously they hosted zoom meeting in their building office and you could see them in person if you wanted to, so he would be able to communicate in person and virtually while being in their office building) so I entered the zoom meeting and asked the prof why they weren't at their office, apparently the prof said that that day's office hours would be virtual\n\nI asked if they received my emails , of which I have sent numerous, all have gone ignored\n\nI've also sent a  message to them (through another platform), no response\n\nthis isn't a one-off instance, on first day of class, i asked if i could book an office hour appt with them, they said yes nicely in person\n\nwhen I emailed them, they eventually told me they were too busy to book office hour appt with them\n\nit seems only they will send emails to me only when they want to, but I can't email them, or they selectively choose which emails to respond to, I really don't believe that they didn't read my email, I'm pretty confident they read my email but just deliberately brushed my emails off or ignored them\n\nprof just told me they weren't reading their emails\n\nthey only also uploaded the last 2 lecture recordings 2 days ago when the midterm is coming in 3 days from now,i don't believe they're accessibility-friendly either, because i'm sure there is at least one person in class registered with accessibility so they would be eligible for extra time, but there's a lecture right after the test , unlike another course where a professor would give a 10 minute buffer time to allow those registered with accessibility some time to travel from accomodated testing centre to class\n\nthey are probably a full professor so probably me complaining to the department head/chair wouldn't do anything, right? plus, they probably have a status of seniority, and people would respect them since they are a researcher who publishes papers\n\nplus, i think they will obviously know who complained and then probably hold a negative attitude towards me when evaluating me , right? there's also no way to prove that someone does hold a negative bias towards me after I complain",

If there are not, and you get no response, you can complain to the chair that you have followed the instructions and you get not response.\n\nNobody is required to record lectures if they are live.  If you mean that this is the course content and it is uploaded late, you can also send that to the chair.\n\nYou will have to be more focused and clear in your email",

      "text": "First, professors are under no obligation to read and respond to emails, hold office hours or record lectures (unless all instruction is remote), however they are subject to providing accommodations per the requirements of and in conjunction with the disability office.  Are your lectures all remote? Or are the recorded lectures just a bonus and the original lectures are in person? Of course it\u2019s great when/if they do all those things. As far as recording lectures, it\u2019s usually the responsibility of the student subject to any conditions of the professor and/or school. Often a contract is signed by the student regarding use, sharing, privacy and disposal. \n\nSecond, I think that complaining will get you very little because professors have wide latitude to conduct themselves and their courses as they choose. You\u2019re probably not the first student to be frustrated with this professor\u2019s attitude unfortunately. Is there a TA or a tutor that you could meet with regarding your questions?",

A lot of it sounds like miscommunication and a busy professor, which are not infractions and best worked out between you and your professor. It is common not to respond to unapproved communication methods, this is professional not being rude. If the professor has clearly stated they are not reading E-mails this is worth reporting.\n\nYour concerns about consequences from reporting is called retribution. This is not allowed. If you choose to report you should state you are concerned about retribution and use that word specifically. \n\nFrom what information you've given it seems more likely there's been miscommunication with you professor and the situation would be best resolved by talking to them about your concerns.",
