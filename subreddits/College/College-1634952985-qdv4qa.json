  "text": "Anyone have any thoughts on this? Sophomore in college, but did the entire first year online, so kind of a freshman actually. Vague asf because I don't actually know what to write. I'm happy enough doing what I do (studying, gym, look for work / internships) but I'm in a really big campus and thought it would be nice to group up with people with similar goals and I have no idea what to start. CS major if it matters.",
