I'll go, but I'd rather just hang out and have a chill night with a smaller group of people. I'm neither extremely introverted not extremely extroverted, so it's not that I don't want to be surrounded by people, it's just that I get overwhelmed in large, loud settings. \n\nAnyone else in the same boat? \n\n<3", "author": "beepbopboopbop69", "created": 1632537221, "retrieved": 1632946019, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he9p387": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puxw9s/lonely_due_to_not_loving_the_bar_scene/he9p387/", "text": "Same here. Nothing wrong with having a stay-at-home chill sesh where you eat tacos and watch movies. Wish I knew more people at my school who'd be down for that. Even if I did, though, I'm not sure anyone would be interested because they all already have their own small friend groups and I'm, well, just the acquaintance.\n\nBut I'm sure for you, it won't be too hard to find someone with the same interests and if you don't, no worries. There's a whole big ass world out there right after you graduate and yes, it can seem intimidating, but I feel as if it's a fresh start for anybody to try and find that group who are interested in the same things you are.", "author": "TAMUVIBEZ", "created": 1632605580, "upvotes": 2}, "he6jlxn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puxw9s/lonely_due_to_not_loving_the_bar_scene/he6jlxn/", "text": "I\u2019m sure there are tons of people who aren\u2019t into that either!
