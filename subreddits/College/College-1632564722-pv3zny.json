I feel really great that there is a professor that acknowledged me as a student and takes the time to catch up about my studies through the academic year. She really wanted me to go into social science after a research paper I wrote. I am just curious if anyone dealt with a professor rooting for you throughout your college journey? She ended up happy after hearing that I went toward Psychology with one of my majors. I am definitely not use to it but I suppose, It feels really great and been very encouraging to continue with this major.", "author": "Natural_Process_2011", "created": 1632564722, "retrieved": 1632800310, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"he9q429": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv3zny/is_it_normal_for_a_college_professor_to_check_up/he9q429/", "text": "Definitely normal in the sense it's totally appropriate.
