  "text": "I took Bio 101 virtually last semester and it was easy at first but once we got into biochem, it was a bit harder. I\u2019m okay at memorization. I need a second lab class and can either do the second part of Bio or an intro to environmental science class. \n\nI\u2019m terrible at math (disability) and spatial stuff. I\u2019m wondering which would be easier and what environmental science actually is like. Is it as heavy in memorization as bio? \n\nI\u2019m gonna be pretty busy next semester so I don\u2019t have time to put 110% into whatever lab class I take.",

          "text": "Bio 102 description is exact same as bio 101: Focuses on biological processes with a chemical foundation, including macromolecules, cellular structure, metabolism, and genetics in an evolutionary context. Explores the core concepts of evolution; structure and function; information flow, storage and exchange; pathways and transformations of energy and matter; and systems biology. Emphasizes the process of science, interdisciplinary approach, and relevance of biology to society.\n\nEnvironmental science: Explores fundamental components and interactions that make up the natural systems of the earth. Introduces the basic science concepts in the discipline of biological, chemical, and earth sciences that are necessary to understand and address environmental issues.",
