  "text": "Meetings can either be extremely valuable \u2014 or a complete waste of time.\n\nIf there\u2019s one I\u2019ve learned during the (almost) two years of remote work, it\u2019s how to run an effective meeting.\n\nGiven Zoom-fatigue and the lack of work-life separation we face today, **meetings should be more intentional, purposeful, and objective-driven than before.**\n\nI\u2019ll go through how I run meetings and break down the mechanics for effective, productive meetings below.\n\n*Scroll to the bottom for a TL;DR / Quick Guide*.\n\n**I\u2019ll go over three sections:**\n\n>**Pre-Meeting**  \n**During Meeting**  \n**Post-Meeting**\n\nPretty self explanatory.\n\n# \n\n# Pre-Meeting\n\n### \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0f Intention & Agenda\n\n**First \u2013 consider:** ***do we even need a meeting?***\n\n* Can we solve this asynchronously?\n* Will it be easier to communicate via documentation or email?\n\nKeep this in mind as you read through the next few sections.\n\n**Broadly, there are 4 outputs from meetings:**\n\n1. **Share information** \u2014 cascading information to others, answering questions, and providing new knowledge.\n2. **Make decisions** \u2014 weighing upsides and downsides of decisions, sharing point-of-views, and coming to a decision.\n3. **Achieve alignment** \u2014 getting all stakeholders to agree on a subject.\n4. **Discuss ideas & feedback** \u2014 brainstorming new concepts, sharing retroactive feedback, and creative problem-solving.\n\nI\u2019m missing a few here that include team building, and community and skills development, but those are less operational so I\u2019ll exclude them for now.\n\nPersonally, I think that majority of brainstorming work should be done offline and asynchronously. We require *deep work* to come up with good ideas meeting environments usually aren\u2019t conducive to that. But if pre-work is programmed in, they can be effective.\n\n**Each agenda item in a meeting should map to one of these outputs.**\n\n>*Sample agenda:*  \n**1. \\[Share\\] Marketing Campaign 9/23 Updates**  \n*Andrew to share updates on campaign targets, goals, and spend (5 min)***2. \\[Decide\\] Product Communications Tactics**  \n*Sarah to present 3 options for communication tactics (5 min)***3. \\[Align\\] Q3 Product Roadmap Prioritization**  \n*Jim to lead product roadmap review and ensure all stakeholders are aligned with priorities (10 min)***4. \\[Discuss\\] Feedback on Q2 Tools**  \n*Jane to drive retroactive feedback session on Q2 tools workstream (5 min)*\n\nBe purposeful with your agenda.\n\n### \n\n### \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Attendees\n\n**Who will be involved? What role will each person play?** Use the RACI framework (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).\n\n>For example:  \nYou may be running the meeting and are *responsible* for the work effort.  \nYour manager may be *accountable* for the work result.  \nYour cross-functional partners may be there to offer a perspective on how it impacts their segment and are *consulted*.  \nYour skip (manager of manager) may just be there to be *informed* on how progress is.\n\nEach individual will play a different part in the meeting according to these expectations.\n\n**How many people will be in the meeting?** Keep in mind Amazon\u2019s *Two Pizza Rule*:\n\n>*No meeting should be so large that two pizzas can\u2019t feed the entire group.*\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to involve all participants in engaging discussion if the group is larger than 8.\n\nIf the intention is purely to share information, can it be recorded or live-streamed later? Can someone take meeting notes and share a recap?\n\nSeek opportunities to minimize live meeting time and give people time back.\n\n## \u231b Timing & Format\n\n**I schedule my meetings to start at either :05 or :35.** This gives folks an additional 5 minutes to take a break or dial-in, if they\u2019re back-to-back. Ending a meeting hardly early never works.\n\n**95% of my meetings are 25 minutes long.** The remaining 10% are around 40 minutes. I barely have any meetings that go over an hour.\n\n**You start to lose someone\u2019s attention at around 20 minutes.** Longer meetings should be reserved for all-hands and other more passive, information-sharing type meetings.\n\n[**Parkinson\u2019s Law**](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/what-is-parkinsons-law) (or it\u2019s inverse) holds true here:\n\n>Work expands or contracts to fill the time available for its completion.\n\nKeep meetings tight.\n\n### \n\n### \ud83d\udcbc Materials\n\n**Pre-reads should be sent at least 24 hours ahead of the meeting** to ensure participants have a chance to familiarize themselves with their material and develop a point-of-view.\n\n**Context and details to provide participants a baseline understanding of the subject should be included.** This is information that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be communicated live.\n\n*At Amazon, meetings start with each attendee sitting and silently reading a \u201c*[*six-page, narratively-structured memo*](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/what-jeff-bezos-learned-from-requiring-6-page-memos-at-amazon.html)*\u201d for about the first half of the meeting.*\n\n# \n\n# During Meeting\n\n### \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf93 Attendee Roles\n\n**Generally, meetings have 3 roles:**\n\n* Leader / Driver\n* Participant\n* Recorder (optional).\n\n**The leader or driver owns the meeting** and the work required during both the pre-meeting preparation phase and post-meeting action items.\n\n* The leader should be comfortable leading the participants through the agenda items and facilitating discussion.\n* The leader is responsible for the overall atmosphere of the meeting, and that it\u2019s positive, safe, and productive.\n\n**Participants** contribute to meeting discussion and agenda items.\n\n**Recorders** are optional roles that can take notes, livestream, or record meetings if the leader does not have the bandwidth to perform these duties while driving the meeting.\n\n### \n\n### \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Introductions & Context\n\n**To kick-off the meeting, these items should be communicated first:**\n\n* Introductions\n* Why we\u2019re having this meeting and what the goal is\n* Agenda overview\n\n**For newer, less established meetings and groups, introductions should be done prior to jumping into the material.** If time is tight, the meeting driver should take the lead in making the introductions.\n\n### \n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Notes\n\n**Do not forget to take notes.**\n\nI used to be guilty of this. Unless you have a photogenic memory (fewer than 100 people in the world do) \u2014 take notes.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple template you can use to capture meeting notes:\n\n>**Key summary points from each agenda item** \u2014 discussion, outcomes, and takeaways  \n**Action items** \u2014 proposed actions and pending items  \n**Ideas** \u2014 ideas and questions that you have during the session\n\n# \n\n# Post-Meeting\n\n### \u2705 Summary & Next Steps\n\n**Send out an overview of the meeting summary and next steps within 24-48 hours after the meeting,**\n\n* Capture summary points from each agenda item, action items, and additional ideas (see framework above)\n* Assign accountability to each action item\n* Determine the need for a follow-up discussion or regular cadence\n\nThis ensures that the meeting contents are actionable and top-of-mind and participants will appreciate this.\n\n# \n\n# Conclusion & Quick Guide\n\nYou\u2019ll realize that most of the time and energy is spent *in preparation* for the meeting.\n\nIf you\u2019re intentional and diligent in preparing for the meeting, your meeting will likely go smoothly.\n\nI\u2019ve included a TL;DR below for you to refer back to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## \u2714\ufe0f Quick Guide\n\n>**Pre-Meeting**  \n\\- **Consider: do we even need a live meeting for this?** Time is valuable \u2014 give time back where possible.  \n\\- **Be intentional with your agenda ahead of time.** Agenda items should map to one of these outcomes: *Share Information, Make decisions, Achieve alignment, Discuss ideas & feedback*  \n\\- **Decide who to include in the meeting and what role each individual should play.**  \n\\- **Design the timing and format meeting.** Keep meetings under an hour and ideally under 30 minutes. Consider starting 5 minutes after to give folks a break.  \n\\- **Send pre-reads at least 24 hours ahead of time.**  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**During Meeting**  \n\\- **Start with introductions and high-level context.**  \n\\- **Ensure you know what your role as a meeting leader / driver entails.** Consider assigning a recorder.  \n\\- **TAKE NOTES.** Summarize key points from each agenda item, action items, and ideas.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Post-Meeting**  \n\\- **Send out your polished notes and next steps within 24-48 hours after the meeting.**  \n**- Assign accountability for each action item.**  \n**- Determine the need for follow-up meetings.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you like this kind of stuff, I write more on growth, productivity, and performance for your live and career on www.andrew.today",
