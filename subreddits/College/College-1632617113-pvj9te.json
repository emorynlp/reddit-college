I\u2019m currently dorming with a friend and someone else that I don\u2019t know. And god fucking damn they both snore so loudly. I bet the entire hall can hear it. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep for more than 4 hours since I got here and I\u2019ve been drinking at least 2 cups of coffee every day. My friend has also been following me and gets annoyed when I try to do my own stuff.\n\nI told them about their snoring and honestly what could they possibly do. Stop breathing? And I feel awful telling my friend to go away so I\u2019m just stuck. I\u2019ve been hating every social interaction because I\u2019m so god damn tired. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about sleeping in the lounge when it gets bad but I have a whole year to deal with this.
