  "text": " \n\nI will be taking 16 credit hours (6 courses) next semester to finish my associate's degree. However, I\u2019m internally debating whether I should add a second Japanese course (4 cred hours), which would be 20 hours and 7 courses in one semester.\n\nI'm currently taking Japanese 1 and I love learning it. This semester was a breeze since I already knew most of the stuff that was taught but I still felt like the class was worth it. But even so, I don\u2019t know if I should take the continuation of it.\n\nAlso, one of my courses is an internship course so I\u2019ll have to work 100-150 hours for 8 weeks. I don\u2019t know how stressful it will be if I add another course. All of my classes are semester-long except one that is half. Thoughts?",
