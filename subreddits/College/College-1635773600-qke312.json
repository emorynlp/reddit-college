  "text": "Withdrawal deadline is tomorrow. I already have one W from calculus II and one F from intro physics on my transcript. I'm retaking both of those classes right now. I'm doing great in calculus II this time around, I should finish with an A if I'm not lazy. However, I'm still struggling with physics. The physics department in my CC is awful, my professor is 80 years old and doesn't lecture very much, I don't even know what my grade is because he doesn't enter anything, he bragged about people failing his first exam every year, and he doesn't answer questions in a helpful way at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've never struggled with a class this bad before, but I don't think it's my fault. I have classmates who took AP physics many years ago in high school and said that course was way easier than what we're taking now. It's an intro class, yet our professor never explains any practice problems because we should \"already know\" how to do them. I've tried studying from every resource possible and I'm still not doing great on his exams, not that I even know what my grades are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I take the chance and try to finish the semester with possibly earning another F or D and maybe a C if he ends up curving the entire class? (I need a C to go onto the next class.) Or should I save my sanity and other grades and take the W again and attempt it at another college? Doing this would also delay my transfer to a state school by another year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso I saw the note about Dropping Courses Megathread, but I have no idea how to post there. I hope this post is okay.",
