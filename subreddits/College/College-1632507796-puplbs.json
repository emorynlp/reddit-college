Should I ask for it to be corrected or should I not worry about it?", "text": "I graduated with my Associate's degree at the end of this summer semester and I just got the physical degree in the mail yesterday. I was so excited to finally get it and I couldn't believe that I was finally holding it in my hands! However, upon further inspection, I realized that my name wasn't technically correct on the diploma. \n\nI have an accent mark on a letter in my name and a lot of forms on websites don't let you enter text with special characters. Because of this, I sometimes bypass this by putting an apostrophe instead of an accent mark on my name because it kinda looks like an accent mark. However, on legal documents when special characters aren't available my name is usually left without the accent mark altogether. \n\nWhen I got my diploma in the mail, it had an apostrophe on it from when I must have used that \"placeholder accent mark\" technique on some form in the past. I'm worried that since it's a legal document, there will be a problem with my name not being technically correct on the diploma. I really hope that they will be able to include my accent mark, but in all likelihood, they will probably have to leave the mark off altogether. That also irks me a bit because that's also technically incorrect, but it's the \"official\" incorrect spelling, you know? It also has my middle initial on the diploma and I was kinda hoping they would include my whole middle name so it matches how my name is written on my high school diploma as well. Should I contact the school and get it corrected or is it too minor of an issue to fuss about?", "author": "Novella_Rose", "created": 1632507796, "retrieved": 1632800352, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"he52roz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puplbs/my_name_is_technically_spelled_wrong_on_my/he52roz/", "text": "Yes you should get it fixed and you should do it sooner rather than later\n\nThis is a big deal later on when you do background checks etc. It means it is also wrong in their records", "author": "PersephoneIsNotHome", "created": 1632518380, "upvotes": 6}, "he4k3zm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puplbs/my_name_is_technically_spelled_wrong_on_my/he4k3zm/", "text": "You deserve to fuss about this and have your proper name on your diploma!", "author": "huntsber", "created": 1632510622, "upvotes": 1}, "he4io0t": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puplbs/my_name_is_technically_spelled_wrong_on_my/he4io0t/", "text": "That should've been corrected freshman year.
