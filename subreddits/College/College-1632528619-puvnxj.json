However i\u2019m looking at colleges to transfer to because i genuinely just do not like my current school for a number of reasons. I\u2019m a nursing major and the idea of going to school in scotland was something that just randomly popped in my head. is it possible to transfer to a school there and graduate, and then work in the US? i\u2019m still completing my prerequisites, just fyi. I would like the option to work in the US after the fact if i decide to do so.", "author": "lilmakk", "created": 1632528619, "retrieved": 1632946050, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {}}
