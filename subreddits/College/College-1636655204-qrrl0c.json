  "text": "I'm taking College Algebra & Trig at my CC right now, and I'm doing very well in it. I plan on taking Pre-Calc next semester then Calc 1 over the summer.\n\nHow well would I have to do in Pre-Calc to make sure I do well in a summer Calc 1 class?",

      "text": "I think so. I would definitely not recommend calc 2 in a condensed form though. That one is tough. \n\nCalc 1 will be about interpreting graphs in a new way that you've probably not thought of before. Looking at what the slope of a line is at a specific point. Looking for minimums and maximum values within a range, and finding how things change relative to other dimensions like time or temperature. Also you'll probably touch on integrals towards the end which is about adding up all the area under a curve (area and volume) Very interesting and helped me to think about the world in a different way.",

      "text": "Whether taking it in the summer or during the fall, the biggest thing you need to take with you from pre-calc is your trig identities and know the unit circle inside and out. Also, make sure you have a good foundation of algebra, in which you are able to catch most silly mistakes if you go through an algebra problem. The ideas in calculus aren\u2019t that hard to understand, but the algebra can be a real killer in calc I if you\u2019re prone to making these silly mistakes. If you think you\u2019re managing pre calc well, then you\u2019ll be in good shape for the summer",
