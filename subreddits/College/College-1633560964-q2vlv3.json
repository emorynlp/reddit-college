  "text": "hi so i havent ever been to many school or social events. been in GT programs since the 4th grade and didn\u2019t go to a normal highschool for 3 years of it (it was a college highschool hybrid). because of this and covid i\u2019ve never been to any kinda parties, never had a prom or a homecoming and most of my peers would only meet up outside of school for movies or group studying. i know i go to a massive party school, my university takes up 2 town roads for all their fraternities and sororities and my mom especially is trying to push me to go to some college parties after i make some friends. she says she\u2019s worried i\u2019ll be missing out on my last chance at real school life fun because i\u2019m too nervous to ask around about where parties are being held. the only time i\u2019ve ever heard of college parties is through movies or articles talking about how common it is for women to be drugged and raped at them. it\u2019s just a scene i\u2019ve never been a part of and i\u2019ve only heard passing pop culture knowledge of that honestly hasn\u2019t given me the best impression of them. but i don\u2019t want to shoot the idea of going to one down so quickly, even so i\u2019m still nervous and unsure. ig my question is, what are they actually like? and are they worth going to?",

      "text": "If you don\u2019t want to go, don\u2019t feel pressured to at all!! People think college is all about partying but there are so many people and groups who aren\u2019t interested in that. \n\nI am a big partier, though, it\u2019s super fun. I encourage you to try it if you\u2019re interested but only go to a party/bar you\u2019re comfortable at, with people you\u2019re comfortable with, and don\u2019t go to hard, too fast!",
