  "text": "So I decided to do bio and I didn\u2019t expect to jump straight into a lvl 2 course rather than an intro course and I don\u2019t have any background knowledge about bio. I have a 75 in the class rn and I got a 72 on my 2nd exam(scored 70 on first). And exam scores are worth so much so my grade is gunna get dragged down a lot. Last day to withdraw is on November 5 and idk if I should cuz if I withdraw I\u2019ll be left with 12 credits and will have to make up the 4 credits I lost by taking more classes. I have another quiz on Friday and I\u2019m struggling to study for that already and will score bad again so I\u2019m scared of failing the class cuz it\u2019ll affect my gpa but at the same time I don\u2019t want to withdraw since I\u2019ve been thru half of the semester already and finals are in like a month and a half.",

      "text": "If you feel you can't do well on your next test and exam I would look into withdrawing. Maybe take this class during winter or spring semester. A 'W' looks a lot better than a C- and below and won't impact your gpa. Final exams are usually cumulative so if you are feeling overwhelmed with the material maybe take the 'W'. If you'd rather finish the course make sure to go to your professor's office hours a lot and ask lots of questions.",
