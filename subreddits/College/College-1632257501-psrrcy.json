Every day is the same, commute to class, sit through, and go home right after. It sucks scrolling through social media and seeing all my high school friends have fun and make friends in college while I'm stuck at home. \n\nIs there anyone else in community college who feels the same way? I'm thinking of transferring to a state school after one semester. If I enroll for the spring term, would I have any difficulty adjusting to life on campus or making friends if I missed out on the fall semester? Another thing I'm worried about is the fact that I would be on campus in winter (spring term starts in January), so everybody would be stuck inside and there wouldn't be a lot of events to help the transition compared to fall.", "author": "ame_errante", "created": 1632257501, "retrieved": 1632800920, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"hdshid1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psrrcy/community_college_and_loneliness/hdshid1/", "text": "Your not alone. I also graduated school in June and I'm feeling exactly what you feel. I'm super jealous seeing some of my friends move out and go to university. I go to CC as well but my school is still all online so I'm even more isolated. I also live at home with my parents. At least you get to go to school in person. And you also have the opportunity to go to a university. I myself can't afford university at the moment,  but I plan to transfer once I get my associates. My advice to you would be to try your absolute best to make some connections with people in person and online. Your my age so I'm assuming you've heard of discord. It's a great way to connect with others and will definitely help with the lonely feeling. I personally just join random servers with people that have the same interests as me and meet people there.
