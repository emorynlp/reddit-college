  "title:": "Can I report a teacher for locking the zoom room a minute after class starts?",
  "text": "Okay. So one of my classes is at 9 AM on zoom, I attend it pretty diligently. I'm a pretty good student. Then one day the teacher decided that they wanted to make a rule in which if you came one minute after class started to the zoo....you would be absent and couldn't attend the entire hour and a half of class. Keep in mind that two absences means your dropped. So it starts at 9:00, & I came in at 9:01 one day because my internet was cutting out and the teacher decided to test that day & so I'm gonna get a zero on a test in which I can't take because I showed up at 9:01!! And I'm just frustrated because it's like I am a good student, & I can't take a test she told us about DURING class over being one minute late. And I can't even attend the class period! And I might get dropped because I might have missed two classes over being one minute late!!!\n\nSo my question is: Can I report this? Or shall I just bare it for the rest of the semester. I don't normally get this frustrated & I just don't want this to happen to anyone else in my class.",

      "text": "Absolutely, especially considering not everyone\u2019s devices are perfectly in sync. The difference between 9:00 and 9:01 is not even noticeable to a real person. I\u2019d email the teacher about it and if he tells you to fuck off bring it to their superior",
