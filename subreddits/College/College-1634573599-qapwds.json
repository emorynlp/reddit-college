  "title:": "I'm so far behind online classes. Should I catch up or focus on assignments?",
  "text": "Title says it all. I'm studying philosophy, sociology, and psychology. I'm in week 4 of my first year. \n\nI've been struggling a lot with adjusting but think I'm okay now. However, online college is still an issue. \n\nI haven't attended many prerecorded lectures. It takes me an hour (listening, understanding, and taking notes) to get through 40 minutes of 2hr classes. \n\nI also have assignments due in a few weeks. Should I cut my losses with the online classes and focus on my essays?\n\nI have next week off and plan to do a lot of work.\n\nThanks in advance.",

If any are late and if your professor(s) allow late work for a penalty, turn them in. \n\nMake sure you at some point watch the lecture but the numbers are the name of the game.",
