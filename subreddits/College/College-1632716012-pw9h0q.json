  "text": "Hello everyone. I am graduating in December 2022 and I am planning on starting med school in fall 2023. This would leave me with a little over 6 months off of school. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do or where I should live? I have to renew my current lease soon in my college town and idk if I should stay here, go back home or move somewhere new.",
