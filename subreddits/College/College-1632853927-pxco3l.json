  "text": "Question for full-time college students: what do you do for work? Does it allow time for studies as well, or do you feel overwhelmed? \n\nI currently work at the college I attend. While I love my job because it lets me prioritize my education, I can only work 25 hours at minimum wage. I am looking into getting a better paying job next year but I am worried about balancing work and school. Just curious as to what everyone else is doing!",
