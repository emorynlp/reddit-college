  "text": "I just turned 21 today!!! I have already told my friends I don't want to go out to a bar and get shit faced but I do want to try some sort of alcoholic drink. I'm really worried about feeling drunk, since I have anxiety and think I might have a panic attack. What are some good drinks for people who are lightweights who just want a little taste of being drunk but not completely blacked out?",

      "text": "There are just so many kinds of alcohol, it's hard to provide direction.  \n\nHard Ciders are probably the easiest place to start.  \n\nLight beers, Lagers, Pilsners and maybe Brown Ales are IMO the easiest of the beers to drink.  \nIPAs are urine in a bottle or glass that hipsters try to tell each other taste really good to their \"advanced palate\".  \nBelieve it or not Guinness (an Irish black beer) is easier to drink than you might think.  \n\nI'm going to suggest a couple of cocktails that are pretty easy to drink, while still letting you experience \"hard liquor\".  \n\n* Jack & Coke (Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey and cola)  \n* Jameson & Ginger (Jameson Irish Whiskey & Ginger ale)  \n* Vodka-Cran (Vodka & Cranberry juice)  \n* Mojito  (White Rum, mint, simple syrup & soda)  \n\nAll of those are gender-neutral, available at pretty much any bar, and are way easier to drink than a 15 year old Scotch \"neat\".  \n\nNote: A Mojito, if served with real mint leaves (as it should) is a somewhat complex drink, and deserves an above-average tip for the bartender.",

      "text": "To add, you will have to try hard to get blackout drunk. You will absolutely not get wasted on just a light drink or two. So please don't be too worried! You're going in knowing you're being responsible, so at most you will likely get tipsy. Tell the bartender as well that it's your 21st, and so prefer lower alcohol drinks. They will be cognizant of it (and might even give you something special since it's your birthday). \n\nI second the recommendation of hard cider, since it tastes the best (imo) while still being alcoholic. I would probably stick to a maximum of two until you can better feel how alcohol affects you, or just one if you don't really want to get that tipsy. Depending on how long you'll be at the bar, you could probably have another one.\n\nHappy birthday, and good luck \ud83c\udf82",
