  "text": "So in my fall semester as a senior studying molecular biology and this semester has been rough. I have 3 major classes that probably should have been spaced out but couldn\u2019t, that I\u2019m now struggling in. I have never had this much problems in previous years, maybe one class gave me trouble but everything else was fine, but just this semester sucks. Everyone around me is becoming doctors so they are all really good meaning there are no curves to help me and since these are end of year courses there are no upperclassman tutors I could hire. \nOn top of that I have to pick classes for the spring in a week as well.\nI feel like I\u2019m stuck in a bad spot where it\u2019s to late to change to something easier, to late to transfer to a less expensive school. \nI know I\u2019m not the only one who has ever had to deal with this and I\u2019m just wondering how others got through the stress and depression of accepting you won\u2019t finish college on time.",
