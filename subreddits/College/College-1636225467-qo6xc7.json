  "title:": "I have a friend who talks to me as if she's smarter than me.",
  "text": "I am 22, she is 21. We're both seniors, although I will graduate one semester after her. I started college when I was 19. I am majoring in Clinical Psychology and hoping to apply to an MSW program while she is pursuing some sort of Public Health degree. \nI've paid for my college entirely with financial aid. I was in foster care and receive extra funding due to this. Her family pays her tuition and in her family it is expected that everyone graduate college/pursue a graduate degree- her family is made up of careers such as lawyer's, PA's, just generally high-paying careers. I come from a family where nobody has ever graduated college, heck many of my family members did not graduate high school either. \n\nI try to be really proud of myself. My GPA is around a 3.6 on a 4.0 scale, and I think that my work is really good. My professors have given me high-praise, used my work ad future examples (with permission), I don't know I just try to feel proud of my accomplishments because when I was 17 and 18 I was told I had no shot of getting into college/figured I'd end up just in poverty or dead or something forever because of how bad my life had been at some points. I remember in high school my guidance counselor telling me to not waste my money or time applying to college, I had no chance after missing a lot of school when I was being moved around the state. She said I would be setting myself up to feel more disappointed. I applied in secret anyway to a really good university in my state, it was the only one I applied to but I love it. - Anyways, I'm glad I got this far, but I feel like my friend really talks down to me. \n\nYesterday we were in the middle of a whole other conversation (about Chinese food, literally) and she randomly said to me \"I wish I had a sob story for my grad school applications.\" I said, \"I wrote my college admissions essay about some of the things that happened leading up to college, and about foster care. I was very surprised when I got in though. I wrote it during a car ride on my cell phone.\" She told me that she wished she had a chronic disease or horrible life she could write about so she could get in for public health, and that I was lucky I could write a cool essay about foster care and make a good pity story for an MSW. It was kind of weird. She always makes me feel bad if I say my homework took me many hours, since I have 4 classes and she has 6, and hers don't take that long/she's never cried or panicked over an exam (Lol I cry during every Stats exam, I pass but I still cry I swear it's funny). Then she asked me if I have my MSW applications done. I said that my school (we go to different schools) is still finishing up Spring apps and that I won't be applying until Fall or wait til the Spring 2023 term, since I'm graduating in Summer. She started telling me I better hurry up if I want anyone to recommend me. I get the impression that she thinks I am not intelligent, or that I am lazy for taking less credit hours/longer breaks than she does.   It's really bringing me down. Am I being paranoid or am I reasonably annoyed? I'm trying so hard, yet feel so behind.",

Only an immature person would say something like, \"I wish I had a chronic disease so I could write a good college essay.\" When you mature you realize that you are lucky that you haven't had struggles that make for an interesting essay. You are super-smart and I hope you are very proud of yourself.",

If her work can\u2019t speak for itself and get her acceptance into the program without a sob story maybe she should consider a career change.",

You would definitely rather have a boring story in your essay than suffer through everything that having a chronic illness puts you through. Not sure how I feel about people like this working in public health tbh.",

Accomplished or not, those attitudes of supremacy are never worth dealing with. \n\nBitter people only serve to infect others with their negativity. Don't let em bring you down and put some distance or just outright stop being their friend.\n\nNot to mention it sounds like she's been coddled her whole life and she doesn't know or has the ability to emphasize with you. Comes from a fundamentally different reality. It's up to you whether or not you wanna actually open her eyes to just how easy her life has been and to actually talk to you with some respect.\n\nEdit: The only people that glamorize suffering are people that have never really suffered at all. And it's gross on how she wishes she had a tragic past to fill in some ridiculous origin story.",

You have a rough start, a sad childhood,  things you overcame, anything but a sob story. She sounds like the unintelligent one. If she had half a brain, she could put her energy and excess free time into volunteering with Big Brothers Big Sisters or as a CASA advocate. Then she'd have something to put on her apps. Pain does not make us worthwhile. Overcoming it does. You're my hero.",

My friend would occasionally gaslight me to tell me how lucky I am to have been able to get into the uni I'm in even though deep down inside I know I worked bloody hard for it. I had to re-evaluate my friendship with that 'friend'. I let him know about how I felt and drew some boundaries. In the end, he never stopped so I just stopped contacting him. \n\nI'm not saying that you should do the same causs this is just what I did. She sounds jealous and doesn't sound like the type of friend I'd want to have around.",

At first, I thought anyone that was remotely nice to me was my friend but I learned that they were simply classmates. I was kicked out at 16 practically homeless and used that in my college essays. Plenty of girls at college have told me they were jealous of my story. They wished they got the same amount of scholarship and aid as me. If she makes you feel bad about yourself I would end that relationship ASAP. I\u2019m also a senior and studying to be a Social Worker. If you ever need to chat feel free to message me!",
