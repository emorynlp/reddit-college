  "text": "I've been in this Program BS Civil Engineering for almost 4 years now. My batch mates are to graduate next sem and I'm still here, haven't taken my OJT class yet.\n\nBack on my 2nd year in my college path, I failed a subject and it made me extend my college years - I blame no one, i'm done on that phase. At times I just feel insecure on my batch mates as-well-as anxious to where I am going.+ Some of my family members are expecting me to graduate on time. I have siblings that need my support and I don't want to lose on this track.\n\nBUT, i want to take a break, not only on school, not only at home but on life. I want to have my me time like (1-2 years ATLEAST) to find my self. To find my interest. To make life. To learn and grow. But, i don't know how: i don't know to say even to anyone. The fact that I don't also know if that 'process' will sustain me financially too.\n\nPs. I haven't proofread this post. I don't want to read this after writing. I just can't. Thank You.",
