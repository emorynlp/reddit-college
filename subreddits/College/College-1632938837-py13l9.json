I switched to a liberal arts major but I can't change my classes till after this quarter is done. I can not handle my precalculus and intro to computer science class. I could continue my intro to cs for another seven weeks but I can't go on with precalc anymore. I have a precalc test on Friday that I know I am going to fail. I am only in my third of week of school and wont mind starting a liberal art class and catching up because I'm a lot better in those kind of things but the period to drop classes and pick up new ones is long gone. \n\nI would drop my precalc class but I need 8 hours to be a full-time student and dropping this class will leave me with 7 hours. I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to the psych facility for a second time . What I'd like to do is replace my precalc class with another class and if possible replace my intro to cs class as well. desperate for any advice", "author": "redcityaventura", "created": 1632938837, "retrieved": 1632945355, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
