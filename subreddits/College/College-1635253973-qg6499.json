  "text": "I have very bad mental health. I\u2019m **currently seeking treatment** but some days it\u2019s really bad. \n\n\nI wanted to inquire about accommodations but I wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it\u2026 anyone with experience have any insight? I specifically wanted more flexibility with attendance and can\u2019t really think of much else I\u2019d ask for, i more so want to know about the actual process \n\n\nLike do you bring paperwork, a letter, or do you just go speak to the person organizing everything? How long does it take for accommodations to get approved?",

They will need to provide you with documentation that you'll take to the disability office at the university.\n\nThe disability office will work with you and the professor to reach a compromise about what accommodations are possible.\n\nI will caution you that just because you ask for an accommodation doesn't mean it will be granted. There are certain things that simply can't be accommodated while retaining the integrity of the course.",
