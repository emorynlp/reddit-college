  "text": "I found out that I had a huge essay due three days ago (by huge I mean 40% of my grade) and wanted to email my professor to give them a heads up about my late submission.\n\nThe issue is, submissions are supposed to be anonymous, so the professor doesn't know who wrote which essay. Do I still email them? I just want to apologize, for the most part. I know I already look really bad and I'm not sure what to do.",

But unfortunately the professor knows who's submitted their work and you will still be penalized for being late.",
