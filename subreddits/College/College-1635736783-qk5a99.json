  "text": "Since I\u2019m planning to transfer schools(about 50% acceptance rate or a bit lower), I\u2019m expecting my GPA to be close to 4.0\n\n* the Japanese course is extremely easy(doesn\u2019t require to study outside the class) also for chem lab\n\nACTUALLY these are the classes that I\u2019m taking this year already and those ends in December. My average for psyc is 94 and I definitely could\u2019ve done better. Should I drop or not?\n\nThe reason why I want to drop\n\n1. For every psyc exams, there were at least two questions that I could've got right if I had more time to read the textbooks. But this class gives 5 questions for extra points so that's why I got a good grade, but I could've got 100.(I always crammed the exams in 3)(I just don't like that the other colleges will think this was my 100% effort)\n2. I need time to figure out my specific career path, but I don't have time to .(but there's only 1 month left until this semester class ends so idk)\n\nThe reason why I don't want to drop\n\n1. I got only 2 exams left out of 4, and I don't like to feel that I wasted my time.\n2. It might be better to take lots of classes since I might be busier with the hard subjects in the future.\n3. It feels somewhat nice to be busy(?)",

You've posted this multiple times on multiple subs and you've had at least three unique posts get several answers, so perhaps instead of posting the same thing over and over, tell us what you want us to say.\n\nI will say this, as a parting remark. 94 is an incredibly good grade and if you genuinely think otherwise I honestly and truly recommend you seek counseling right away, because the first time you get anything below a 90 you're going to melt down.",
