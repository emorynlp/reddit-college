  "text": "Hi, I'm a 21 y/o \"junior\" in college in the US. I've pretty much done all of my general education requirements. I'm struggling to choose a major or career path, and I really just want to hear how other people came to their decisions. \n\nI've always wanted to work with animals in some capacity, but it's also very important to me that I be financially stable as I didn't have this growing up. I'm depressed and stressed, and thinking about picking a path makes it worse. (I did just start seeing a psychiatrist, got on some medications, and will start talk therapy soon) I feel like I did in my freshman year, spending money/getting in debt with no clear end in sight. \n\nAny advice/stories are appreciated! How'd you pick your major/career goals? Were you always passionate about that topic? If not, how'd you choose?",

      "text": "From my first psychology class I knew I wanted to be a psych major. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing currently. I\u2019m graduating next fall with a BS in psych and from there I\u2019ll go on to a graduate program. \n\nI understand it\u2019s not as easy for everyone to pick a major, but I\u2019d at least start by identifying the classes you enjoyed the most, write down why, and see if the majors related to those classes have any job opportunities you are interested in. I would at least start from there if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nI wish you luck in figuring it out! It\u2019s completely normal to feel stressed about this, it\u2019s the rest of your life to think about. I\u2019m sure whatever you decide will be the best option for you!",

      "text": "So my path was a bit chaotic. I wanted to get into a field that would pay me a lot of money so I began majoring in computer science because I had a slight interest in cyber security. I layer changed my major to computer engineering because I did this NCAS event and thought it would be pretty cool to make rovers and work with robotics. Knocked out a few programing courses, cal 1-3, and my science requirements, but in all honesty I was miserable. I hated the math and the programing so I decided to do a field that I was interested in for awhile which was education. I ended up changing my major to English which shocked family and some friends, but I loved the work. The profs were cool, I like writing,  and ended up getting the opportunity to work on a publication as an undergrad. After undergrad went to work as a teacher and did that for awhile. Now I'm a grad student and really enjoy what I'm doing. The best recommendation I can give is honesty pick what you want to do. Yes, other jobs will have higher salaries, but if you get up everyday hating what you do life really isn't worth it.",

      "text": "You may be overwhelmed so a way to at least narrow down the majors is to print a list and physically cross off the ones you know you have no interest or desire to do. Then you can categorize the rest into tiers of which you like better then others. Once you get it down to a more manageable number, do some research on the majors. Read about the classes that are needed to graduate, the course descriptions, and if you\u2019d be interested in taking them. And also look at what careers you can do with the degree and if it\u2019s something you could see yourself doing (and paying your bills and being satisfied with). \n\nRemember, life is a journey. Where you are at any given moment doesn\u2019t determine where you\u2019ll end up. So take some stress off yourself and have faith in yourself that you can always change your path if it\u2019s not leading you in a direction you want to go.",
