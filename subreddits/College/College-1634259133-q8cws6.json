  "text": "I am not talking about fantasy football. I have a calc 2 WhatsApp group with 12 people in it. After the midterm and final exams, whoever gets the lowest exam score in the group, and whoever gets the lowest overall score in the group needs to have a punishment. This is to motivate all of us to work hard.\n\nHere are some punishment ideas:\n\n1. Make him an \"I suck at calculus\" t-shirt and he must wear it for 2 consecutive weeks\n\n2. Have him recreate an MV of a song, chosen by whoever gets the highest score in the group\n\n3. Have him treat the other 11 people to a meal, or giveaway something\n\n4. Have him walk/cycle the entire length of the Tuen Ma Line, HK'S longest rail line, which is 57 km long. He must stop by an entrance of every station and post a picture of it.\n\nAny more ideas?",

Obviously the person who gets the lowest exam score needs the most help and it would be torturous to have to do extra work on the subject. \n\nMake them write a rap about calc 2, or slip calc phrases into their everyday language use for 2 weeks, etc. They have to answer calc 2 problems before they go to bed from every person in the chat.",
