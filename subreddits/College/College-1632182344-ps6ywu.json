I know it's really not that deep, but it's been getting to me lately. I'm a senior and this is my second year at my new school as a transfer student. Last year, all the COVID precautions made it easy to keep to myself and go to class and leave. Now, everything's back to normal and I've never felt more like an outsider... \n\nI work part-time to support myself and really don't have much time to hang out on campus, and even if I do, I don't bother because like I said, it's lonely and depressing. I literally don't know *anyone*. I've tried talking to people on the first few days of classes (multiple semesters) but nobody is ever interested in anything beyond the stupid icebreakers. I actually met this one guy who happened to be in a few of my classes--we were partners for the icebreaker on the first day and chatted it up a bit. I was excited because it seemed like there was potential for a possible acquaintance, but then the next class he sits nowhere near me. It's five weeks in and I don't even bother anymore. I literally just go to class and go home. \n\nIt's very disheartening to see my college experience come near an end without having made a single friend throughout these five years. I know in the long-run it's good for me because I'll be graduating debt-free, but in the short-run it's really depressing and has a terrible impact on my confidence and mental health.", "author": "tall_penguin", "created": 1632182344, "retrieved": 1632946576, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 537, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"hdt71kv": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps6ywu/commuting_to_school_is_lonely_and_depressing/hdt71kv/", "text": "First year student commuter here.

I also have extra time saving from commute so I start doing yoga + general exercise, call my friends and hang out with my family more often, read some books, pick up new hobby (tennis and learning Chinese) and start my small business. With the amount of homework and those extra activities trust me you don't have time to feel lonely, you'll wish for time to SLEEP.

Those jobs pay less usually but you'll be around more students throughout the day.

I know I'll have to pay it back one day anyway but at least I can enjoy the time now that I won't get back. After college, everything becomes about paying bills anyway.

Learning to disengage and be apathetic towards the world helps deal with the isolation. \n* Some video games\n* Youtube videos, esp ones with talking, to act as background noise\n\nThings that helped but might not be as easily available\n\n* Baking\n* Gardening\n\nStill fell into a deeper melancholy than normal but survived. I just kinda lost interest in life and hobbies but I stayed alive.\n\nTalk therapy really helps... I don't have a mental disorder or anything that warrants a special type of therapy or psychiatry treatment other than just checking in with an LCSW every coupla weeks. It's just general, vague talk therapy.\n\nEven with that, there is immense value in having a non-judgmental person listen and talk to you. I have a \"tough love\" family, so it really helps having that.\n\nYes, it does feel weird to \"pay to have a friend\" but well, you gotta take care of yourself. Right now mental health systems are a mess, but if you are seriously having issues with depression, staying sane, etc please consider it as an option.\n\nI think maybe also having family around helped. It's better than nothing, but not very supportive like a friendship.\n\nOne of my siblings is my best friend, although I am not theirs. I dropped them off at college this fall and its definitely much harder now.\n\nWhen I lived near the mountains I used to be really into the outdoors. I live 4-6 hours away now and I'm thinking of getting up at midnight to get to the lots before they're full, just to get away from things.", "author": "neverfakemaplesyrup", "created": 1632188849, "upvotes": 47}, "hdnwq06": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps6ywu/commuting_to_school_is_lonely_and_depressing/hdnwq06/", "text": "Honestly, doesn't bother me one bit now.
