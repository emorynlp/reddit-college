  "text": "Um, so my political science professor's lectures have become increasingly right wing as the semester goes on. Out of curiosity,  I googled him and found out that he used to work for one of those \"women's pregnancy centers\" that are actually just anti-choice Christian organizations that prey on impoverished women. I also found out that he has worked as a staffer for politicians with far-right and racist ideologies. \n\nOur latest assignment involves a total revealing of our own political ideologies, and I dont feel comfortable with that, and don't trust my professor to treat or grade me fairly. What should I do?\n\n*edited for spelling, typing on mobile and my stupid thumbs are big",

      "text": "who cares about the professor's opinions/beliefs? as long as they don't bias the grading, it's fine. consider the possibility that your professor has been doing this for many, many years, and you most likely are not the first person to have this concern, or even be the first person to report him (whether concerns were founded or not). Plenty of people are reasonable in the real world, even if their opinions disagree.\n\nwait until after grade is published. Until then, everything you say is speculation and won't be taken seriously by anyone because the prof so far has not done anything wrong. Like when people call police on black people walking/driving around in rich neighborhood. It's good to be alert, but you have no reason to call police/administration.",
