  "text": "Hi!\n\nI hope this question isn't too weird, I have a test coming up next week for my finite math class and I was wondering whether anyone's professor has allowed them to use an erasable whiteboard on a math test? The one I have is 11 inches so it's not large at all. I'm gonna see if I can ask my professor tomorrow. I don't have anything against pen and paper, I just feel more comfortable using my whiteboard when solving problems.",
