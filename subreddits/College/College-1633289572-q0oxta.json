  "title:": "Want to talk about how the pandemic has affected you as a student?",
  "text": "Hey there! I hope your semester is going well so far. I'm looking for students who would be interested in sharing how the pandemic has affected them in their studies. I want to talk about mental health, trouble focusing/concentrating, financial issues, etc.; pretty much any way that you feel the pandemic has impacted you as a student.\n\nI am working on my capstone project in the Journalism department at San Francisco State University and decided to make my project about the impacts that students are facing during this time. This is a semester-long project that will result in a long-form written article, but I'm looking for students to talk with in the next few weeks who want to share their experiences and are willing to participate in this project.\n\nIf you would be interested in sharing your experiences, please do reach out to me as I would love to hear from you. If you know anyone who might be interested in speaking with me, I would appreciate it if you could point them my way. Thank you!",

Every semester I have less strength to drag myself through my classes and my parents expect A's every damn time.\n\nIm tempted to just drop out, work full time and actually be happy. If I work full time I can afford a $1000 apartment.",
