I'm much more motivated and a month in I haven't fallen behind. I mean the pandemic is still pretty lonely and I'm tired of the monotony, but atleast I can keep up with responsibilities. I'd recommend looking into psilocybin as an option for those struggling right now. I stress doing research and introspection before taking anything though.",

              "text": "I took one gram the first trip, and 2 grams the second time.  For reference the average full dose is close to 3 grams depending on body weight and other factors. I wanted to see how I reacted to it first, because I wasn't completely confident in my mental state, and wanted to reduce the odds of a bad trip.  As for my mindset, it's hard to describe exactly how it's changed. If anything I feel a bit more open minded, but that's trait I've always kind of had. At the same time I can recognize that it's easy to fall into similar patterns of behavior and thinking. \n\nI wasn't able to officially be diagnosed, but I exhibited many symptoms of depression before my trip. During that time I felt like my outlook on things were darker, along with the lack of interest and motivation in doing things. The day after the trip I immediately felt energized and content with things. Although my immediate situation hadn't changed, I felt more capable of changing things, and actually had the drive to do so. The best way I can describe it is almost like I had a reset. I feel more like myself in that sense, but my experience was almost just a perspective shift. I think that's for now the best way I can put it. \n\nI haven't yet taken a full dosage mostly because I've been busy, but I'm exploring micro dosing in the mean time.  If you want to hear more about my actual experience tripping, or talk more in general feel free to PM me. I hope this was helpful! :)",
