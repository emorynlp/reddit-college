No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because \"your notes should be your own\". No recordings of lectures because \"I don't want to be put on Youtube\". No reduced weight on public speaking because \"your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dropped the class, resulting in a W on my transcript. I'm kind of pissed because that W might hurt me when I go to transfer to a four-year university or apply for grad school. I have an appointment with my counselor at the Disabled Center next week, but is there anything I can do about that W? Should I file a grievance?
