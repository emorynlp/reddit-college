  "title:": "What to do when a professor refuses to accommodate student disabilities????",
  "text": "I have a learning disability--I have a pretty severe stutter and an auditory processing disorder, so I go through my community college's Disability Center to get academic accommodations that allow me:\n\n\\*extra time on exams\n\n\\*a note-taker\n\n\\*recordings of lectures\n\n\\*reduced weight on public speaking assignments (because of the stutter)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a professor who has completely refused to accommodate this. No extra time on exams because... Idk, she just likes making arbitrary rules. No note-takers because \"your notes should be your own\". No recordings of lectures because \"I don't want to be put on Youtube\". No reduced weight on public speaking because \"your professors at four-year universities won't cut you any slack\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, she's giving me Fs on everything. I have not been understanding things in class because I don't have note-taking assistance or recordings of the lectures to refer back to (if a professor is iffy on one, they usually allow the other and so I at least have ONE method of self-help). I filed an exam request at the Disabled Center anyway, and she wouldn't sign it, so I got a C- on the exam. I knew all the questions, I just felt so rushed, I couldn't do my best. And I've failed a public speaking assignment BECAUSE of my stutter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dropped the class, resulting in a W on my transcript. I'm kind of pissed because that W might hurt me when I go to transfer to a four-year university or apply for grad school. I have an appointment with my counselor at the Disabled Center next week, but is there anything I can do about that W? Should I file a grievance? I'm really lost.",

If you are allowed extra time or whatever by that office and the prof isn't honoring it, they will deal with it for you.  Or should. That should be your first step.\n\nSpeak to the counselor there about what your next step should be - they will know if you can file a medical withdrawal, take the class again and whatever options you have based on your school's specific policies and according to the ADA laws.\n\nIf for some reason they are not helpful , then you should look [Here for a local chapter of The American Association of People with Disabilities](https://www.aapd.com) and they should be able to put you in touch with an advocate (social worker, counselor etc) who can help you.  \n\nYou want someone at your back if your school's office isn't on your side, though I have never personally known that to be the case.",

I'm glad you have a meeting scheduled with them, but if they knew about everything, I'd be very concerned about why they didn't run interference with the professor and/or escalate the issue higher up the chain of command. \n\nI'd also look up your school's Civil Rights/Equality Office (I've seen many different titles - look for the person responsible for ADA compliance) and make an appointment to speak with them. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. \n\nEdit: The US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights may also be an avenue for recourse.

Give clear examples on what this professor is doing that violate your accomodations. Have you met with your professor and actually given her your accomodations form? Most professors at any college or university assume you are a normal student unless they have an accomodations form. My professors have always given me access to material. Also, there may be a peer tutoring center. Most colleges do have these either on campus or online to support you with your studies. If you have done everything possible, then yes, I would file a grieviance report, but be specific on what the professor didn't give you. Also, most colleges have a testing center where you can test outside of class if you have extended time listed on your document.",

Document everything. Threaten to contact a lawyer or the Department of Justice (who often handles ADA discrimination cases on behalf of people wronged) if your school doesn't handle this properly which includes having your full accommodations followed by all professors, the W removed, and ability to re-do the tests/assignments where you weren't given your accommodations.

You don't know OP or what their actual symptoms are, and you aren't the disability support worker who decided what accommodations they should get. \n\nPlus, if OP doesn't find it easy to take in auditory information, why would they suddenly be fine with understanding the lecture while looking down to write notes? I also have issues with auditory processing, and it's really hard to understand people unless I can see their lips. Talking on the phone is not possible, for example. And if you're suggesting that they use the recording and rewatch it in order to take down notes, isn't that a bit unfair? OP has to spend *at least* twice as long just to get their notes down. That's precisely what disability accommodations are trying to address. Note takers are a common allowance.\n\nLook, I don't think that taking notes on a laptop is an effective way to learn, but I'm not going to tell people that they *must* take notes by hand. Maybe they have terrible handwriting. Maybe they have arthritis or an injury. Maybe they're in a class where laptop notes are okay. Maybe they just prefer it. So maybe a perfectly healthy person *would* do better taking their own notes, but there are lots of situations where forcing someone to do that would actually disadvantage them. ",

They have never been employed by a college for longer than two years, so I'm wondering if this is part of the reason why. That's none of my business, though, so I ought not speculate, I guess. Just going to go to my meeting with the Disability counselors and go from there. If it does end up going to court or anything, I want to make sure I'm doing things by the books. ",

Like u/bl1y said, there's a likelihood that the court will end up telling her to do that and throw the case out. This will take longer and only result in OP losing money and being more frustrated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTalk with the school first (not just the teacher). If nothing happens after doing that, then you can start talking with a lawyer.",
