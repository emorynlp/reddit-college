  "text": "People say college is where you find your people and your passion, but the only thing it did was take away any and all motivation I had for anything and saddle me with suicidal thoughts. I\u2019m coming out of it this year with not a single person to call my friend. So much money and so much time only to end up worse than where I started. \n\nAttending college has been the biggest mistake of my life and I wish I wasn\u2019t lied to when people said it\u2019s the best time of your life, cause it sure fucking wasn\u2019t",

      "text": "It\u2019s not suppose to be, at least I think so and I\u2019m currently in college. It\u2019s a cool place to learn about different subjects and get a bit of experience into what you like and don\u2019t like. Not a waste of time especially since people around the world want the opportunities you got. I haven\u2019t made friends either yet but I have learned a lot about myself which is also really nice. I still have a lot to learn about myself and sometimes I feel really anxious about nothing and other days just to by because I sat outside with other students and did my hw. It\u2019s cool but what comes after college and the career you get into is what counts. Career will take up majority of your life and that\u2019s where you have the money to enjoy yourself not college. Change your perspective and it\u2019ll get better. And who cares if you didn\u2019t make friends, find a part time job and talk it up with them. Most friends come from working or seeing each other everyday.",

Be fair with yourself and give credit to what you've accomplished even if it's small. At least you made it through. You can move on from this experience able to say you did it.",
