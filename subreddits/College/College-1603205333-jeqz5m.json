  "title:": "Why do students have to give professors and admin slack due to the pandemic but we don't receive the same?",
  "text": "May be a confusing title but:\n\nWe're in the middle of a pandemic, everyone knows that. Usual financial and health problems are worse for everyone, there's more anxiety in the air due to elections and covid, yet students don't seem to be getting any sort of recognition for the unusual times. The workload is as much as ever, no pass/fail grades, a lower quality of education online(I love online but it's still lower quality on average and everyone agrees on this)\n\nBut when it comes to problems with distance learning from the college's side(bad technology set ups, online exams not working etc), the excuse I'm given from them is that 'its a pandemic, we're trying to adjust to the new circumstances'. Well no shit so are we! You keep classes at the same difficulty, if not higher and want us to feel bad for you when you're not prepared to provide us a high quality education for literally thousands of dollars??\n\nThere are some of us who're on the other side of the world and have to live through an entirely different timezone to attend classes. I for one, spend all day sleeping and have to stay awake through the night because my professors want me to attend live classes and not just look at recorded ones.",

      "text": "I agree. My professor was supposed to give us access to the take home final exam for the whole weekend, but he didn't set up the dates correctly. So, the exam access was only between midnight and 8am, and it was 3 hours. We have to make all these accommodations for the teachers who don't know how technology works, yet we have to be perfectly on time when turning in assignments. My teacher said we only get a one-time pass, where she will accept the assignment late. If you have any other internet or power outages after that, you're getting zeroes on your assignments. The teachers need to give some more leniency if they expect the same from their students. We are paying the same price as a quality education when our teachers don't know how to post a recorded meeting online. The teachers shouldn't all be using the same excuse of \"Well im too old to learn how to use technology\". This is the age we live in now. If you can't teach in our environment, news flash, you aren't a teacher nor are you teaching. At least for my college, the professors have been given the entire summer to learn how everything works, yet we only have a week to learn how to use it. There is no reason for them to not know how to use the technology if they were provided with literal guides and taught how everything works.",

      "text": "Another professor chiming in here. While I agree with what one of the profs said below about us not getting much slack at all--it's very true, and frustrating, for administrators to expect the same quality under these circumstances--there's one huge difference: we're getting paid and you're not. (Now, a ton of adjunct faculty, which is roughly 66-75% of faculty in the US, are NOT paid well at all. I have to put that in here.) So yeah, you're spending a bunch of money on a substandard experience while being expected to keep insane hours, the same workload if not more, and with the same grade consequences. It's not right.\n\nRe: the workload, my best guess is similar to what someone else said: We are putting all the small assignments you would do in class into the lesson plan/homework. And yes, this can be difficult to estimate in terms of time on task. But I do also believe some profs think that because you're online/remote, somehow you're more likely to slack off. I know some professors at my institution are giving MORE work than normal, which is crazy. I think most students will have realized by their junior year at the latest that professors are really bad at keeping in mind that students have anywhere from 3-5 other classes. That didn't suddenly change during the pandemic.\n\nI campaigned at my institution for pass/fail grades but was told that it lessened the value of the degree, which is b.s. in circumstances like these.\n\nMy first advice is to communicate a lot with your professors. If I don't hear from someone, I don't know what's going on with them, and frankly, it's hard to keep them in mind when I've got other students who ARE reaching out to me. It's not too much at all to ask for a few extra days on an assignment. If someone doesn't have a track record of abusing such requests, then I never have a problem agreeing.\n\nMy other advice is to organize and speak up. Because here's the open secret: You're spending a bunch of money, and you can take that money elsewhere. Students more than faculty and staff have sway with college administrators when they present a united front. Think of it this way. If your tuition is $35k, and just 100 students speak up, that is $3.5 million dollars speaking. And right now, a ton of colleges are facing extreme financial crises.\n\nYes it's hard, very hard, for all of us. But I want you to know that you're right to be asking this question. Stay healthy out there.",

Obviously some professors are naturally better at handling these situations whilst others are just horrible towards their students. \nAs for your advice: I really think it's good and I've been trying to do it. I've communicated more with professors and tried to help them understand our side of it. And the 2nd point about organizing and speaking up is what gets me. I've been trying to get people to do that with me but students are just not up for it. They may be scared of administrations or maybe expect nothing to come out of it. I'm hoping things get better for both students and faculty.",

              "text": "Hey, I appreciate your reply! And no worries, I certainly didn't take your original post personally. I thought that one prof made a good point and wanted to back it up for the sake of other students who might read this. I appreciate your understanding; I think a lot of students actually understand it very well once I talk about it with them. But I do believe you all are in a terribly hard position right now, too, and it doesn't help for profs to act like it's the exact same position. Where I teach, we have a lot of students who come from underprivileged circumstances, poor schools, and environments that are hostile to them because of their gender or sexuality or race/ethnicity, including their own homes. My experience, education, and income all give me an advantage in dealing with this that so many students just haven't had the chance to obtain yet. \n\nHas your increased communication with your profs helped at all?\n\nI get what you're saying about students being reluctant to speak up. I'm sure the reasons are both of the things you mentioned plus the fact that everyone is just stressed out and squeezed for time. The sad thing is that you shouldn't have to be speaking up and organizing at all!!! It's another undue burden to place on the shoulders of young people trying to get a decent education right now.",

Although there is still a difference that someone unaccustomed to it can be negatively affected by. Still, this issue of online vs in-person classes is highly exaggerated to apply to all online classes rather than merely poorly taught ones through COVID-19.\n\nIf by difficulty, you mean in terms of projects, assignments, etc. Than I can agree that there should be less of it or that it should be scheduled appropriately, although the actual content learned in the class shouldn't be watered down just because we're having a pandemic.\n\nAlso, your personal concern is very strange. Why would you sign up for classes that you would have to stay up at night to get through just to complain about it on Reddit? Is it bad that this happens? Sure. However, these restrictions are often put into place for valid reasons that are at the discretion of the individual professor, so acting as if this is a systemic issue in the education system is very strange and unhelpful. I'm sorry that not every professor can keep in mind that some of their students signed up for classes on the other side of the globe, but expecting this type of treatment from every professor is unrealistic. University professors aren't here to hold your hand like high school teachers are, usually students have to deal with these issues on a case by case basis, it happens. Is it right? No, but it's always been like this, this pandemic changed little but the problems faced.",

I assumed the exam was due at midnight and obviously I was wrong.....

So obviously shitting my pants that I'm getting a 0 on a 50 point exam in a class that only has 300 points total..... The next test, she forgets to make it open on canvas and doesn't open it until 6 hours later we all receive a message \"oops sorry guys! Still getting used to canvas, good luck on your exam\".... The hypocrisy was painful and feel it's exactly what your talking about.......

Like??? Why are these professors forcing students to do more work than would normally be required? Why am I having to go out of my way to watch lecture videos you recorded months ago instead of just watching you lecture live over zoom? I have another professor who doesn't even do zoom sessions, he just posts recorded video lectures to our college's LMS alongside some homework and mini essays. To be fair, he gives students the work at the begining of the week and gives us until 11:59 pm on Sunday to submit things, so I'm willing to be more lenient with him as he gives students the time they need. However, I have one professor who DOESN'T. EVEN. RECORD. VIDEO. LECTURES. HE DOESN'T LECTURE. AT ALL. He just gives us **auto-graded assignments** (save for a discussion assignment that happens every other week or an essay test) that open on Wednesday each week and close ON FRIDAY. AT NOON. We basically have two and a half days to do all assignments in the class for the week that are majorly AUTO-GRADED. Like, if you're going to make most assignments auto-graded anyways, why don't you give students all the time they need to complete them? I can understand if you were having to hand-grade assignments, but 95% of the assignments are just auto-graded. This professor has me stressed trying to do 5-6 assignments in a two day window. \n\nHonestly, with the online format, it seems like most professors are getting a break. They can just post video lectures they recorded months ago - or better yet, not go through the effort to record/do lectures at all - to the class and give auto-graded assignments. It cuts their grading and overall work required in half while forcing students to go out of their way to do more work for the class than required. Professors who are using the online format as a way to be lazy and force students to do more while not offering leniency legitimately piss me off.\n\nKeep in mind, I know that not all professors are being lazy with the online format, and I appreciate the professors who do put in the work for the class while being understanding to students. Professors who are still doing their job to the best of their ability with the online format and are not cutting corners - I salute you! Keep being great, I'm sure your students are grateful to have you as their professor this semester.",

I'm willing to grant that the classes/professors you're referencing are less than ideal, if not outright shitty. \n\nFirst thing to know is that generating online materials takes much more time than you're realizing. **Teaching online is not a break; it is a nightmare.** \n\nEverything takes more time because everything needs to be extremely structured. This goes for every assignment, but it multiplied by all the small learning objectives in the curriculum that normally can be handled informally, and which now need extremely specific instructions and assignments. These \"extra\" assignments were always there, but now they looks to students like bullshit busywork\u2014and to be fair, when poorly done, it is identical to bullshit busywork. \n\nYour professor probably fell back on this (terrible) format for the class because all he had was terrible options. It is almost certainly because of cheating. If permitted, everyone would just google all the answers. This happens constantly; studies show it, students admit it, everyone knows it. Cheating degrades the quality of the degree you are paying for. Time limits and proctoring help to mitigate cheating in online classes, and that's why he would use those. \n\nBut, using synchronous time for testing instead of lecture/discussion sacrifices the best way to learn. It is absolutely a bad course design. Worse, he is being his own proctor, and I guarantee he hates it. But, surprise, proctors are in high demand right now, and your professor is likely forced into doing it himself. \n\nNow, at this point, there is a \"better\" alternative, but you're going to hate it even more. The best learning outcomes are gained from open-book critical essay exams. That's the only thing that gets around all these problems without sacrificing the quality of the education. It is also the only way to get all the things you're asking for. Buuuut, these types of exams are really fucking hard. Students hate them. They require a high level of knowledge, critical thinking ability, and writing skill. It is not practical for every course to do this\u2014especially if you're still building the required skillsets and knowledge for critical writing in your field. \n\nSo, having no real access to the better choices, we're back to self-proctoring and video lectures.",

In another class I have a 300pg book, 50pgs of textbook reading, and the beginning of a 9pg essay to start by the end of the week. I literally am on my laptop, studying etc all day and can't keep up! If I were still working I don't know if I could do it. I'm so thankful I am able to stay at home with my family in this time though. Ok wtf am I doing. Back to studying.

Open up a private zoom meeting and record yourself seeming interested. Save that recording and use it as your virtual background when you have to attend a stupid zoom class/lecture/meeting that you would rather avoid. Use that virtual background to handle attendance and use software like OBS to record the class/lecture/meeting. I should add that not all laptops/computers can handle this approach.",

Like, I don\u2019t think participation being a quarter of my grade in one course is a good idea, it\u2019s hard to speak up during a zoom class (my uni is completely online during covid).

If it seems they disallow it, then do this anonymously.\n\nIf you are required to sign something to submit a complaint, don't. It most likely contains an agreement that you will not make the dispute public, which just gives them the opportunity to ignore you.\n\nIf you can't submit a complaint without agreeing to reveal your identity or sign an agreement, just drop it on social media anonymously and have your friends share it.\n\nKeep in mind that college administrations are not your ally. They are *at best* neutral and interested in keeping their image clean and their student body enrolled. Don't trust them to do the right thing or not retaliate against you. Instead, appeal to their desire to keep their image clean. Put it on social media and let the student body get riled up. They are more likely to respond to that.",

It is like he doesn\u2019t care and he\u2019s not doing anything in the class. We entirely teach ourselves from the book, his half assed powerpoints that are riddled with errors, and links to short mylab video clips. I tried communicating multiple times with him, which he dismissed or ignored my emails.\n\nI finally contacted the dean of that department and after a couple of emails exchanges where I argued my point, as well as provided solutions, I got resolution. My professor uploaded lecture videos from another professor.\n\n\nThis is what worked for me. \n\n-Log EVERYTHING! \n-Think about what you NEED. (what is missing from the class that is important? ASK FOR IT!)\n-Communicate your needs or concerns with your professors. \n-Communicate with other classmates to see how they\u2019re doing. (You might find people who can help you with the work or allies to go to the dean together.)\n-Utilize any student resources that you can. (Tutoring center, math lab, educational videos, many are available online now)\n-Contact your academic advisor for advice!\n\n(If none of these are working for you)\n\n-Contact the dean of the department or whoever is above your professor. \n\u2014\u2014Make sure you provide your evidence(good thing you logged everything). \n\u2014\u2014Argue your case (they may try to dismiss it, but DON\u2019T let them if something is really wrong) \n\u2014\u2014Provide your own solutions (these are people too and they can\u2019t think of everything) \n\n\nIf you\u2019re failing the class and there is no pulling your grade up, then withdraw and try again next semester with a different professor. IT IS OKAY TO WITHDRAW AND TRY AGAIN! \n\nThis entire situation sucks for everyone and unfortunately not all of us are able to adapt as well as others to the change (professor\u2019s and students).",

It's not affecting then in any way besides maybe having to answer some questions, but is it really THAT much of an inconvenience? \n\nI remember spring semester I had a MWF class. However the second week of class I had an important 3day EEG I had to do for my epilepsy. With an \"at home EEG\" I have dozens of wires ATTACHED TO MY HEAD connected to a little device that's so expensive that the hospital only had 5 to lend out because they said it cost too much to get multiple machines. I literally had to WAIT to be able to get the EEG because someone else was using it. And I commuted from the city to a college town. So I obviously wasn't going to travel almost 2 hours on public transportation and attend multiple classes with an expensive heavy  machine attached to my head smelling like 3 day old chemicals. My professor was SO mad about it. She said I shouldn't have scheduled something that long during the school year. I told her that my neurologist decides when I can take the EEG (if you're still having seizures they're not gonna test you to see if you have seizures lol), and that I also had to wait to be able to use the machine, and she said either way it was irresponsible. What do you want me to do? I'm trying to get cleared to drive and this was the earliest I could get it done. The rest of the semester she treated me like shit. Wouldn't call on me in class if I raised my hand but when she had hard questions that no one knew the answer to she would call on me and I'd get it wrong and she'd embarrass me in front of everyone. For my final project she gave me a 95% then 4min later I got an update on my grade and saw that she lowered it to a 90% yet her feedback for that grade was the same as it had been when I had the 95%.",

I don't mean to sound rude, but I have trouble sympathizing with you when you describe it as a mere \"mental health day,\" and it doesn't seem like you bothered to notify the professor when it should have been clear that it was a requirement.

Online classes can be a mess, and I've felt the same thing about the workload, but I know some profs are putting in insanely high number of hours of work, up to three times their normal, since they have to prepare recorded lectures, hold in person class, and maintain a structured online classroom. There's definitely a ton of problems with distance learning, but often profs are accommodating if you explain your circumstance and ask them one on one for extensions or help with something. I think it really depends on the individual prof and class. (Middle management, on the other hand, seems to be a mess everywhere right now.) \n\nAfter reading some of your replies to comments, I 100% understand why you're frustrated. The lack of accommodation for international students is definitely one of the biggest shortcomings for profs and online learning in general across the board. Same thing at my school, classes are all marketed as being able to be done asynchronously, but students are graded on participation so 5-10% of points are lost for intl students who decide not to be nocturnal.",

It totally wastes time and has left a lot of us struggling to understand the course material and not performing well on exams because they go off-topic so much in the middle of lessons to make Zoom-related comments. Ex: they start discussing a part of the lesson plan that they think we might find boring, and coincidentally someone shuts off their camera.

It\u2019s difficult though when we clearly have less say over how things play out.\n\nBe sure to communicate with your professors. I have f***ed up a couple of times and my professors have really worked with me to set me straight. I missed two labs that I won\u2019t get a make up for, but my professor sat with me for 4 or 5 hours over a couple days to make sure I learned to work the software and knew the material. Another one consistently adjusts due dates and adds extra bonus assignments to help us understand things. \n\nOver the summer I tutored a few kids from a professor that was absolute shit. No online lectures, no explanations. He told them to go to the tutoring center if they needed help and didn\u2019t respond to emails at all. I gave them the email address to the department head and encouraged them and their frustrated friends to email her about his class, and this semester he\u2019s improved significantly. \n\nComplain on Reddit, I\u2019ll totally validate your feelings on this. But also don\u2019t limit your complaining to here.",

I don\u2019t need extra time or a quiet room during exams for example.  In high school they said I was \u201ctoo smart\u201d so they didn\u2019t understand what I was learning in classes and my IEP was dropped. It\u2019s really hard for me to advocate for myself when I know that people just think I\u2019m lazy. I told my mom yesterday during my mental breakdown that I wanted to get re-evaluated and she said that my ADHD was never \u201csevere enough\u201d and that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have waited last minute\u201d etc. The bottom line is I\u2019m struggling and there\u2019s not really anyone to help me. Sorry for the rant.",

I do think they are lazy when they write me at 20 minutes until an assignment is due and want to complain/can't get it turned it/etc for an assignment that has been open for a long time and without a good reason.    \n\n\nHowever, I also realize that some professors, especially those not experienced with ADHD or those in Biology (like me) or Psychology, may not understand the complications that go into this disorder.  I know more than some because some of my grad students have it and many of my students do as well.    \n\n\nDon't listen to your mom about it not being \"severe enough\".  WTF?  That is total crap.",

      "text": "I think every professor will tell you that our perception of the situation is diametrically opposed to yours.  We have been urged repeatedly by our administrations to be as lenient as possible WHILE maintaining the same academic standards (WUT??); in my institution, not to take attendance; to allow students who have not attended class to nonetheless evaluate us, which effects our job applications and opportunities for tenure/promotion; to decrease the amount of work students are responsible for; to be prepared to \"pivot\" from one mode of instruction to another, as needed, without warning; to retool classes we've taught successfully in person for years or decades to an online format; and finally to do the \"emotional labor\" of being strong and positive in front of students when many of us have childcare obligations, elderly parents to care for, etc.  Students can miss one or several class meetings without question or reprisal; we cannot. I can't speak for all of professordom, but I personally am feeling very squeezed by the demand to deliver high-quality instruction, each day, in an unfamiliar format, while it ever more difficult to demand anything of students due to the administration's fear that they'll jump ship and we'll lose much-needed revenue (insultingly little of which, by the way, goes into our pockets).  I also think it's worth mentioning that many of your instructors likely spent their summers, as I did, in endless \"professional development\" \"opportunities\" instructing us on how to teach you better online, time that we diverted from our scholarship (which is also vital to our advancement).  In my case, at least, these \"opportunities\" were expected but not compensated - i.e., I worked a job for free all summer to improve my students' experience in the fall.  So the idea that professors are being cut any slack, particularly as students who are dissatisfied in any way for in any reason (whether the fault of the instructor or not)  are able to head over to RMP to make their dissatisfaction very personal and very public, is not one I can agree with.\n\nI do sympathize with your situation, however, and I have several students in the same boat, three of whom Zoom into my class at 4:30 a.m. their time.  They are among my best students and it blows my mind how awesome they are. There is no denying how difficult this is, and actually it's my response when my local students complain about having to the work - if my student in Indonesia hasn't seen sunlight in months and is crushing it, then you can bring yourself to turn something in, Abigail.  I admire your resolve, and I hope you can push yourself through. It sucks.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on, though, is that administrators can get fucked.",

Yes, definitely teachers are also going through problems and having to deal with the pandemic as well, and believe me, I personally was very open in my thinking to give teachers the benefit of the doubt when any problems came up or just to cut some slack, and I still am, just to a lesser extent. The reason is because I expected students to get some slack too in the first month or so of the semester but I saw very very little forthcoming. I know it isn't a perfect society but I would've been more willing to cut some slack to teachers if we got the same in return. At this point it's just frustrating that I have to attend college in a pandemic as if these are normal times.\nI also am pissed at those students who are using the pandemic as an excuse for their laziness and hate for college. I know I can't judge not knowing the full picture but there are definitely some out there who're doing this, ruining the experience for others.\n\nAnd yes. Admin can get fucked.",

Our students are only required to attend a 3 hour, MWF course once or twice a week. We are expected to teach them all the same content as before the pandemic. What I have seen is a very sharp divide between students who make the effort and those who don't. Some (not all) of the students who decide not to attend have simply stopped turning in assignments. My failure rate is going to be ridiculous because the school wants students in F2F classes, but do not have any way to do it safely or effectively. Its all about the money and, as hard as they are trying to make the students happy, it's the students who are getting the short end od the stick.",

When asked about their lack of engagement, they reliably invent some nameless \"emergency\" that I don't feel I can ask them to specify under the circumstances, or a sudden and improbably technical failure at the precise moment I call on them.  My fail rate isn't catastrophic, but I often feel that I am single-handedly dragging a half dozen thankless horses to the trough.

              "text": "I can speak to the number of assignments, at least in my case.  A big chunk of it is that we (professors) can no longer assign little stuff on the fly in lectures (like \"work on this example in small groups and then turn it in for a few points at the end of class\"), so all of our assignments need to be super structured and planned in advance.  \n\nIn addition, if we're not meeting with you in person, we don't see when an assignment is too big/tough the same way.  All we see is a problem that *we* think is reasonable that nobody turned in.  This makes us bitter that we're putting in all this work to rewrite these assignments to work better in a virtual format, but we're not seeing any effort on your part because we don't see you actually working on it, especially if you don't come to office hours and/or ask questions in class.  \n\nAnd as someone who was working from 8AM-10:30PM yesterday to write a \"virtual o-chem lab\" assignment while keeping up with my normal lecture prep (and with two young kids at home with me), this shit is hard.  Rewriting assignments is not easy. especially if you're in a field with certain nearly concrete expectations of what assignments need to be given.  The curriculum of organic chemistry doesn't care that there's a pandemic, I still need to figure out how my students can get the lab experience of conducting a distillation or recrystallization without resorting to the god-awful Labster simulations.",

I only have 12-48 students in classes, but in those 48-student classes, if I accepted emailed assignments, I would be totally overwhelmed by every student who tried to upload a PDF one time and then gave up and just emailed the assignments for the rest of the semester.  I'm not saying that's you, but  we're not not supposed to make exceptions for one student that we won't make for other students, and if word gets out that I accept emailed assignments, half the class will be emailing those assignments.  This is also a logistical nightmare, because now the assignment files aren't attached to your Canvas assignment, so I can't just use the grading functionality; I now have to separately download all 20 emailed assignments, keep them organized despite the fact that half of them don't have the names written on the PDF (why would they? it's attached to the email, right?), open them in the right order to grade alphabetically (which is its own nightmare, because grading alphabetically means I know who submitted what, and my own biases and favoritism creep in)... you see how this can open several other cans of worms, despite the fact that on the surface \"it's just one assignment and I couldn't get the uploader to work\"\n* As far as the watching videos outside of lecture and also attending lectures, this is usually done as part of a flipped classroom model where you do the assigned reading or watch a video before coming to lecture and then spend the lecture discussing the material or working through problem sets.  But even if it's not set up that way, the classical model of a college course is that you spend two hours outside of class for every hour in class, whether that's watching videos, reading the material, studying, or working on assignments.  So, while we frequently miss the mark (maybe the assignments take more time than we thought or maybe the reading is usually skimmed before class, etc.), that's what we're aiming for. \n* It is overwhelming to keep track of everything, but that's also going to be true in any situation where you're going to college full-time.  It's possible that a chunk of your struggles this semester is just that if you passed all your classes last year, you're now taking harder classes where we (professors) expect more of you and want to do less \"hand-holding.\"\n\nThis is not to excuse professors that are just blatantly ignoring student needs; however, the same way you usually have a reason for doing things, there is usually a reason for policies that professors have.",

I definitely empathize with my profs right now, for the most part I see them working extremely hard to deliver the best classes they can despite the situation, and some have been more lenient with us students too. One of my profs has gone absolutely above and beyond by meeting with each of us over zoom in one on one meetings every two weeks, to answer any questions we have and update us on our performance.\n\nAt the same time, I see a lot of very different stories here on this sub. Some students seem to be granted little to no leniency by profs who don\u2019t care, or are really poorly equipped to handle an online semester. I get it, it was unfair to suddenly expect profs to know how to teach online at the same quality as they usually do. It kinda sucks for most of us. The admin needs to be doing better, starting with fair compensation for profs to do trainings focused on online learning. In fact profs probably need to be paid more in general.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m biased here because my uni generally has an incredible group of profs and an absolute shitshow of an administration.",

                      "text": "u/collegeappacc, I understand what you're saying, I really do. I was a college student not all that long ago myself, and I thought similarly to how you do. The problem, in all honestly, is that you simply have no idea what you're talking about, because you've never seen the other side of the coin. And I don't mean that as a criticism, it's simply reality. I can't hold you at fault for not knowing what you have no way to know. How could you? You're not a professor, and your overall experience with academia is very limited.\n\nSo, I'm going to address a couple of your points. I don't mean for anything I say to come across as harsh, and I absolutely do *not* mean any of it as a condemnation of you personally. But, I will be blunt so that the points are clear.\n\n>similar to professors, students have limited time. A lot of professors can't understand that - we have things due every day for so many classes.\n\nProfessors understand this perfectly. Do you think that once you become a professor, your memory of all your previous experiences is wiped? We know you have other things to do. But, the honest truth is that most college students will never have a less busy life than what they have now. Of course, some college students have to work full time to pay the electric bill and keep food on the table, some students have children, some students have to care for an adult family member, and so forth; those are challenging paths and I wish them well. But the vast, vast, overwhelming majority of college students, in the USA at least, do not work, have no private family care responsibilities, etc., and have in fact have almost no other actual obligations other than their studies. The average college student certainly has *nowhere near* the amount of obligations, professional or private, that the average professor does. So, the \"I'm really busy, cut me some slack\" argument is not very convincing. Everybody is busy. But the reality is that the average college student is the least busy by light years.\n\n>I don't understand what professors lose by showing a little leniency - I really don't. Professors are in full control. If students are struggling, professors won't get in trouble for extending some deadlines.\n\nUnfortunately, the blame for the fact that we are often loathe to cut you some slack lies with your fellow students. It can be summed up perfectly by that old expression \"If you give an inch, they'll take a mile.\" The reason is that, once we show leniency, the demands for *more* and *more* leniency in situations of greater and greater significance never end. *Ever*. If we extend the deadline by a day, then the person who was two days late complains about losing points and threatens to contact the dean or go to the media or some other nonsense. If we extend the deadline by a week, roughly the same number of students will *still* not turn in the work on time and then will request *another* week. If the only deadline is that all assignments must be turned in by the last day of class - i.e., i*f we litterally give students the entire semester to do their work at their own pace on any schedule they want*, guess what? Some will still not meet that deadline. And then can you guess what happens? They email begging for extensions even though the class is now done and the semester is now over. For some people, not even *the entire semester* is enough leniency.\n\nAnother thing you have no way of knowing, at least not to the degree of the average professor, is that many of your fellow students behave *horribly*. This was perhaps the single most shocking thing to me when I switched from being a student to the other side of the desk. The amount of outright lies, scams, schemes, deceits, and organized fraud we encounter from students on a weekly basis is mind boggling. I know, right now you're sitting there thinking that you don't believe me and that I'm exaggerating to make a point, because you're probably a decent human being and you assume that everybody else is decent too. They're not. Not at all. For every request for leniency or special treatment because of extenuating circumstances I receive that I really do think should be granted, I get 5 that I can prove to be frauds with minimal effort, and then another couple that are almost certainly bald-faced lies that I just can't prove. Amazing how often the internet seems to go down *in the student dorms* right at 11:58 PM, and yet campus IT has no evidence of any outage that night, and yet other students in the same dorm didn't have any trouble submitting on time. Amazing how often a student swears up and down that he submitted the assignment an hour before the deadline, yet the Learning Management System has no record of the student logging in at any point that day. Sometimes students undertake more work to fake an excuse for missing a deadline than it would have taken to just do the assignment and meet the deadline.\n\nI know, I know, this sounds crazy. I thought so too when I first started as faculty. But now these kinds of rampant lies and attempts at deception and cheating (the cheating, my god, don't even get me started on the cheating) are just another Tuesday to me.\n\nSo, why don't we just be lenient all the time? Because if we are, the requests for more and more and greater and greater leniency never stop, and because every time we do show leniency, we can't shake this nagging suspicion that we're being played.",

That report agrees with the data you found that 70% of full time college students work (as in greater than 0 hours), but the number who work full time was around 26% (having fallen steadily over the last decade).  At the time I wrote the post, I almost went back and edited it to make it clear that I was referring to undergrads who work full time (as I had specifically mentioned full time work in earlier parts of the post), but I didn't bother, because whoever it was who responded to me was in a rant and clearly not interested in any kind of actual discussion.  The point is that the vast majority of undergrads have no full time work - except college.  *College* is their full time job, but too many of them do not treat it as such and instead treat its deadlines and requirements as optional or mere suggestions.  They wouldn't do that (I presume) if they were at a regular job, so it is aggravating for professors who work with dozens or hundreds of students to continually have students who ignore their obligations and then have the gall to ask for special treatment.\n\nAs I already explicitly acknowledged, I clearly understand that some students have to work full time to keep food the table, etc.  When they work full time and go to school, they've accepted a very challenging situation, and it's very impressive when they manage to juggle both situations successfully.  But when you think of the millions of typical undergraduate students right out of high school who live an average college life in a dorm on an average college campus, comparatively few are in that situation.  Take a look at r/Professors sometime if you're interested in this topic.  Hardly a week goes by without a thread about excuses and requests for special treatment that the poster received.  Among the occasional legitimate reason for an exception to be made, you'll find everything from implausible excuses to excuses bordering on the outrageous to examples of students actually manufacturing fake evidence to support a request for special treatment.  The sheer volume of utter nonsense we face from students every week of every semester is enough to make the happiest, most bright-eyed person jaded.  It's why we have to be rigid most of the time.  As soon as you break and start granting exceptions, the tide overwhelms you.\n\nI make no claims one way or the other about graduate students, whose work relationships with their universities are of a completely different nature than undergrads.\n\nThanks for your inquiry.",

But since I'm a professor and you're a student, let me teach you something you apparently don't know: almost no science professors at a major university are \"just teachers.\"  We all have years and decades of professional research experience, and our careers live and die by our continued research output, which determines our ability to win the grants that fund our work.  They don't give multi-million dollar research grants to people who don't have \"any practical job experience.\"  \n\nNow, just to be fair, there *are* some people at the university level who just teach, usually introductory classes, but these are not what people typically think of when they hear the word \"professor.\"  Even the non-tenure-track or instructional-track faculty have master's degrees or a Ph.D., and to earn that degree they had to do professional work in their field.  So, there is almost literally nobody at a university who has no practical job experience.  Keep that in mind the next time you think you know better than your instructor, who depending on their age likely has a decade or more of professional experience in the field.",

If the policy is to drop one quiz score, we get emails asking us to drop two quiz scores, and if we refuse to drop the 2nd quiz score, the student will lose a scholarship and have to drop out of college and how will we sleep at night knowing we ruined his life, etc. \n\nIf a class has a policy of allowing three unexcused absences for any reason, you can guarantee there will be a student who skips three classes for no reason and then unexpectedly misses a fourth class due to oversleeping.  That student will then want an exception and demand to pass.\n\nBasically, there's no point in having class policies as a professor if you keep making exceptions, and once you start making exceptions, that door can never, ever be closed again.",

Additional claims of internet problems will require actual evidence, for the simple reason that based on reliability statistics for most major US internet service providers, the probability is very low that the internet goes down for the same student on more than one occasion AND those occasions all just happen to be test times.  If the student lives in a very rural region or a place where the internet is known to be less reliable, that can be taken into account.  But for the demographics of my university, cases like that are the minority.\n\nSo, overall, if you claim the internet goes down during a test, you get the benefit of the doubt, but not an infinite number of times.\n\nEDIT: I should also point out that the above comment only applies to exams that are taken over the internet in real time.  If the exam is a take-home exam where, for example, students are given a whole week to complete the exam and simply have to submit it by a certain deadline, then the same policy as for regular assignments applies.  No special consideration for not being able to submit the exam a minute before it's due when the course system shows that you didn't even download the exam until 45 minutes before it was due.  If I see evidence that you've been diligently working on the exam the whole week but have trouble uploading it, then perhaps we can come to some kind of understanding.  But that is rarely the case.  Most of the ones who, mysteriously, have trouble uploading something a minute before it's due are also the ones who show no activity in the course system for 6 days and 23 hours before the weekly deadline.",

The idea that teachers always need to be able to adapt to any brand or product is asinine. It's not \"adapting to technology\" in a general sense, it's specific programs. And those programs are constantly changing and updating and resetting program settings. We're cutting out a wealth of information teachers have by bottlenecking it through bad implementation, and that's just how it's probably going to be because of the pandemic anyway.\n\nYou can have little patience for professors who refuse to provide resources but I've worked with professors who genuinely try everything at their disposal and they're often worse off than professors who just plow through with everything they did before.\n\n>some of us actually fare worse in person compared to online\n\nSo work on that or, and \"the simple fact is\", tough shit.",

The worst part is I don't have it the worst at all. I know some classmates who work for really crappy companies with no choice over their schedules who work night shifts, double shifts, insecurity over hours, etc., plus have to manage a full time workload or they will lose financial aid. And then you have these professors who get so offended that a student cannot come to their \"non-mandatory\" synchronous class or because a student cannot complete a busy work assignment that was hidden on Canvas, never discussed, and added with a day to spare!

I have to show people, mind you that have worked for the government for 25 years nearly all of that ON A COMPUTER, ok, I have to show this person how to open a web browser and search a site and then show them how to save it to favorites. Now, they have PCs, laptops at home, they own a smart phone and a tablet, but yet this is so fucking foreign to them. Same way with teaching older professors how to do classes thru the web. For us young whipper-snappers who were basically built on computers it's simple, but just 5 years older than me and half the people are like wtf is this? and wtf am I supposed to do with it? Granted OP and the rest of the college/school world should be getting the same treatment they are expected of from their professors. There's no reason why your exam failed to open but showed you took it, there should be no reason why you can't record a lecture and pin it to blackboard or what have you that way students who have to work extra now, who have to take care of sick family now, and have other slightly more important things to do than listen to a old as f man talking about English comp 1, or whatever. If the professors can't figure it out then they need to find someone who can show them how to do it.\n\nWhen I was in my last semester, it was Spring 2020 and one of my professors couldn't figure out how to do our SLES-12 Linux class virtually without us being able to run our virtual machines. So his plan was to just fail us all and start again in the new semester. I was not about to take this class over again. I was half way thru and this shit started. I told the department chair and she granted me a leave with another class to fulfill my requirement, but I had already taken 3 Linux classes so this one was just another linux class same things different operating system. So they were fine with it. My friends in that class had to do class over again Summer.\n\nIt's definitely harder now with the pandemic and it seems no end in sight. Professors CAN and SHOULD do better especially if they are expecting perfection out of their students. But just to say they've been given the opportunity to learn how to do virtual classes doesn't mean shit. I've seen some crazy shit in my just 9 weeks of working in IT.",
