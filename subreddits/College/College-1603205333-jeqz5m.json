If you can't teach in our environment, news flash, you aren't a teacher nor are you teaching.

While I agree with what one of the profs said below about us not getting much slack at all--it's very true, and frustrating, for administrators to expect the same quality under these circumstances--there's one huge difference: we're getting paid and you're not. (Now, a ton of adjunct faculty, which is roughly 66-75% of faculty in the US, are NOT paid well at all. I have to put that in here.) So yeah, you're spending a bunch of money on a substandard experience while being expected to keep insane hours, the same workload if not more, and with the same grade consequences. It's not right.\n\nRe: the workload, my best guess is similar to what someone else said: We are putting all the small assignments you would do in class into the lesson plan/homework. And yes, this can be difficult to estimate in terms of time on task. But I do also believe some profs think that because you're online/remote, somehow you're more likely to slack off. I know some professors at my institution are giving MORE work than normal, which is crazy. I think most students will have realized by their junior year at the latest that professors are really bad at keeping in mind that students have anywhere from 3-5 other classes. That didn't suddenly change during the pandemic.\n\nI campaigned at my institution for pass/fail grades but was told that it lessened the value of the degree, which is b.s. in circumstances like these.\n\nMy first advice is to communicate a lot with your professors. If I don't hear from someone, I don't know what's going on with them, and frankly, it's hard to keep them in mind when I've got other students who ARE reaching out to me. It's not too much at all to ask for a few extra days on an assignment. If someone doesn't have a track record of abusing such requests, then I never have a problem agreeing.\n\nMy other advice is to organize and speak up. Because here's the open secret: You're spending a bunch of money, and you can take that money elsewhere. Students more than faculty and staff have sway with college administrators when they present a united front. Think of it this way. If your tuition is $35k, and just 100 students speak up, that is $3.5 million dollars speaking. And right now, a ton of colleges are facing extreme financial crises.\n\nYes it's hard, very hard, for all of us. But I want you to know that you're right to be asking this question.

Why am I having to go out of my way to watch lecture videos you recorded months ago instead of just watching you lecture live over zoom? I have another professor who doesn't even do zoom sessions, he just posts recorded video lectures to our college's LMS alongside some homework and mini essays. To be fair, he gives students the work at the begining of the week and gives us until 11:59 pm on Sunday to submit things, so I'm willing to be more lenient with him as he gives students the time they need. However, I have one professor who DOESN'T. EVEN. RECORD. VIDEO. LECTURES. HE DOESN'T LECTURE. AT ALL. He just gives us **auto-graded assignments** (save for a discussion assignment that happens every other week or an essay test) that open on Wednesday each week and close ON FRIDAY. AT NOON. We basically have two and a half days to do all assignments in the class for the week that are majorly AUTO-GRADED.

I can understand if you were having to hand-grade assignments, but 95% of the assignments are just auto-graded.

They can just post video lectures they recorded months ago - or better yet, not go through the effort to record/do lectures at all - to the class and give auto-graded assignments. It cuts their grading and overall work required in half while forcing students to go out of their way to do more work for the class than required. Professors who are using the online format as a way to be lazy and force students to do more while not offering leniency legitimately piss me off.\n\nKeep in mind, I know that not all professors are being lazy with the online format, and I appreciate the professors who do put in the work for the class while being understanding to students.

We have been urged repeatedly by our administrations to be as lenient as possible WHILE maintaining the same academic standards (WUT??); in my institution, not to take attendance; to allow students who have not attended class to nonetheless evaluate us, which effects our job applications and opportunities for tenure/promotion; to decrease the amount of work students are responsible for; to be prepared to \"pivot\" from one mode of instruction to another, as needed, without warning; to retool classes we've taught successfully in person for years or decades to an online format; and finally to do the \"emotional labor\" of being strong and positive in front of students when many of us have childcare obligations, elderly parents to care for, etc.  Students can miss one or several class meetings without question or reprisal; we cannot. I can't speak for all of professordom, but I personally am feeling very squeezed by the demand to deliver high-quality instruction, each day, in an unfamiliar format, while it ever more difficult to demand anything of students due to the administration's fear that they'll jump ship and we'll lose much-needed revenue (insultingly little of which, by the way, goes into our pockets).  I also think it's worth mentioning that many of your instructors likely spent their summers, as I did, in endless \"professional development\" \"opportunities\" instructing us on how to teach you better online, time that we diverted from our scholarship (which is also vital to our advancement).  In my case, at least, these \"opportunities\" were expected but not compensated - i.e., I worked a job for free all summer to improve my students' experience in the fall.  So the idea that professors are being cut any slack, particularly as students who are dissatisfied in any way for in any reason (whether the fault of the instructor or not)  are able to head over to RMP to make their dissatisfaction very personal and very public, is not one I can agree with.\n\nI do sympathize with your situation, however, and I have several students in the same boat, three of whom Zoom into my class at 4:30 a.m. their time.  They are among my best students and it blows my mind how awesome they are. There is no denying how difficult this is, and actually it's my response when my local students complain about having to the work - if my student in Indonesia hasn't seen sunlight in months and is crushing it, then you can bring yourself to turn something in, Abigail.  I admire your resolve, and I hope you can push yourself through. It sucks.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on, though, is that administrators can get fucked.", "author": "Judythe8", "created": 1603207770, "upvotes": 167}, "g9fvz9s": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jeqz5m/why_do_students_have_to_give_professors_and_admin/g9fvz9s/", "text": "That's just sad.
