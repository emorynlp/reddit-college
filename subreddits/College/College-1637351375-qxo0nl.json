  "title:": "Is it academic dishonesty for a friend to email me their paper for a class they previously took that I'm currently in?",
  "text": "I was confused on a paper I have to write for one of my classes in graduate school. I emailed my professor for more clarity but didn't expect a response for about 1-2 days. So I thought I would ask a friend who already took the class. She told me she would just email me her paper, without any grading from the professor, so I could see a example. I'm writing about a different topic and will use my own ideas. I'm freaking out because she used our school email to send it. I'll also add that my professor had posted a sample paper before, but I didn't know for sure if it was exactly what was expected for the assignment. Am I fine & just being paranoid?",
