  "text": "Hey, this is a really sad post, but I think I'm going to drop out of my dream college by the end of the semester. I'm currently a third semester student, and last semester I had a really rough time mentally being trapped in a dorm room all semester and never seeing anyone. \nBecause of this I was kicked out of my major, put on academic probation, and am now forced to have to meet the requirements for another major by the end of the semester, which I haven't even started until this semester. \nI am now drowning in work and have 2 As, 1B, a D, and a F for grades, with only a month left in the semester.\nOf course I am going to try to stay in this school, and continue to bust my ass every day, but its starting to become apparent I might actually flunk out. \nI don't know why I'm posting this, I guess I just feel worthless right now and am too afraid to tell any of my friends and family I might be dropping out of college so I thought I'd post this. \nIf I did flunk I'd be able to start over at community College which isn't the worst thing in the world, it just sucks that everything I've ever worked for might be coming to an end so quickly. \nI don't know what else to say.",

      "text": "Everything you worked for is not coming to an end, it\u2019s just getting a detour. Something similar happened to me when I was in College. I over extended myself, got overwhelmed, then just tried to mentally escape all of it. I was in a position where I had to work for my food and apartment and my parents paid tuition. I couldn\u2019t do it all. I licked my wounds, went home and enter my local CC. Took a year to get myself in check, met some nice other students, figured out what was important to me and what course of study I really wanted. After a year, I enrolled at a local state university and excelled. Life is rarely a straight line. I hate that HS and colleges don\u2019t talk too much about this. Of all the people I know, only my spouse exited HS and ended up in the exact profession position he aimed for.. even then he went to 2 different universities with a stint in the army in between. Hang in there, there are great things in store for you and the sum total of them is not measured by your grades.",

      "text": "See if you can do a temporary withdrawal from your school. Honestly, your grades aren't that bad but you should be able to talk with your advisor about what you're thinking of doing and even if it takes you a bit longer you can always take a lower course load especially if your classes are heavy hitters. However, in terms of leaving it would be better to do some type of temporary withdrawal which will save your record but it will also give you time to figure out what you want to do and give you the headspace to chill out without the stress of classes",
