I shouldn't be living in housing next year which should completely get rid of having to take more loans out even if I end up paying the same amount for apt. rent (though it is possible that I may not be able to move out until maybe my 3rd year so i dont know.) Is $9500 manageable? About $4000 is also a parent PLUS loan because my mom is somewhat helping me but I plan to help pay her back. I also have a campus job and will be delegating 90% of my $$ towards paying that back. (Also I do know that community college would've been cheaper but I didn't end up going with that so it's a moot point. Just wondering ya'lls opinions. :) ) \n\n((This isn't necessarily a FAFSA question so it's not in the megathread, but if this is inappropriate for the thread I can delete it.)", "author": "bittersweet_teaa", "created": 1632174338, "retrieved": 1632946732, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hdnjle3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ps4lmk/is_9500_for_my_first_year_of_college_a_lot_to/hdnjle3/", "text": "I would say $9,500 your first year isn\u2019t terrible IF its not $9,500 every year.
