  "text": "Long story short , I found out last minute that I had two 10 point weekly assignments and I only had enough time to submit one. I really shouldn't bother emailing my professor because Im an idiot that has has no excuse for missing an assignment and they don't accept late work\n\nAs of now, I've been making an effort to submit all of my assignments on time. If I continue to just stay on top of my work, is the missing 10 point assignment still something to worry about?",

          "text": "The grading breakdown of the class is cumulative and adds up to 200 points. The HW/Weekly Assignments portion is worth 160 since 16 weeks of the semester times 10 points is 160.\n\nThe final exam and the attendance/participatuon grade are both worth 20, so if I manage to do well on the exam and submit all assignments with the exception of the one that missed, I imagine that I could probably make it out with a decent grade.\n\nIf there's anything I happen to miss, feel free to let me know. I know its never smart to rely on the help others rather than taking respobsibility for my own, but this is something that's been stuck on my mind as of lately, so I figured seeking advice on this sort of thing is better than living in constant worry.",
