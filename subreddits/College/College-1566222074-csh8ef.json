Please add any safety tips that you have regarding responsible use of alcohol.\n\n>Welcome to your first (and hopefully only) bout of alcohol poisoning. That shit is deadly.  \n>  \n>**DO NOT DRINK SO MUCH.**  \n>  \n>First of all, if you're underage, don't drink. I have to say that, it's a sub rule to not engage in or advocate for illegal behavior.  \n>  \n>Second of all, assuming you are of age, control your consumption. That means a few things:  \n>  \n>1. Know how many drinks are in your cup. A filled 16 oz solo cup is 1.25 beers, 4 wines, and a deathsentence of liquor.  \n>  \n>2. Know that your body can only process 1 drink per hour. A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. *Pace yourself.*  \n>  \n>3. Keep track of how many drinks you've had and over what period of time. Look at your phone when you start drinking, else you'll have no idea when you started. Look at it every time you get a new drink, else you'll have no idea how much time has gone by. *Pace yourself.* **IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY DRINKS YOU'VE HAD, YOU'VE HAD TOO MANY AND IT'S TIME TO STOP.**  \n>  \n>4. The feeling of inebriation is, in my experience, a delayed effect. By the time you feel buzzed, if you're still drinking, you're going to get drunk. By the time you get drunk, if you're still drinking, you're going to get sick. *Pace yourself.*  \n>  \n>5. When you've had enough, and someone offers you another, for the love of God **SAY NO THANK YOU**. If you have to walk away from a game of beer pong, so be it. *Pace yourself.*  \n>  \n>2,000 college students will probably die from alcohol this year.

Never drink on an empty stomach. If you haven't eaten in a while, just stuff your face with as many carbs as possible.\n\n2. Drink lots of water. Keeping up with one cup of water per drink is hard, so just make sure to have a glass of water with you if you're in a private setting or take a break every couple songs to grab water in a party setting.\n\n3. Know how to calculate drinks. One drink is defined as 0.5 oz of pure alcohol. To calculate the amount of drinks you are having, just multiply total oz by % alcohol. Of course, this is imprecise when drinking out of cups, so if you're making mixed drinks just measure with shots. Shots are generally a drink, and the same with a 12 oz beer. My calculations are just for larger drinks like FourLoko or hard cider.\n\n4. Learn your limit. The first few times you drink, set a hard limit on number of drinks, erring on the side of caution. Stick to it for the night. Then, if you decide at the end of the night you didn't get drunk enough, increase that limit for next time.\n\n5. Help your friends and get help from your friends. Ask them how much they've had to drink, calculate how much is in a drink you give them, etc. If you're talking about how much you've had, you remember it better. That's I disagree with the common advice of \"don't talk about how much you've had to drink that's dumb freshman behavior\".

Have a DD, an Uber, a bike even (still illegal btw, but way safer than a car) or SOMETHING. Alcohol can ruin your life on its own, but not quite as quickly as a DUI can. Please don\u2019t get one.\n\n- eat before you drink. Not right before though. Eat, digest, drink\n\n- find a drink you like that sits well with you and stick with it. I\u2019m a big fan of whisky and beer - specifically Coors light. I know exactly how a large amount of Coors light makes my stomach feel, and I know I\u2019ll be able to handle it. Even if it\u2019s Coors banquet instead of Coors light I know I need to be more mindful. Turn down the shot of tequila...unless that\u2019s somehow your drink. In which case idk if I can help you.\n\n- drink a ton of water. Fuck all the \u201cdon\u2019t break the seal\u201d nonsense. be ready to piss constantly - it\u2019s just the way she goes. I try to keep my piss as close to clear as possible. If it\u2019s dark, I know I need to chug more water\n\n- set yourself up for hangover success. Brush your teeth, pour yourself a glass of water and leave it on your nightstand, etc. I know you will forget this sometimes, I still do occasionally, but part of the reason I stopped drinking so much is because I was sick of wasting days being hungover. Now I\u2019ve realized that you can still get drunk and have a productive Sunday for example, you just have to prepare for it.\n\n- don\u2019t turn it into a competition.

Think PBR, High Life, Budweiser.\n\n- A **strong beer** is about **8%** ABV. That's _double_ the amount of alcohol. Think IPAs or stouts.\n\n- **Wine** is usually around **12%** ABV. That's _triple_ the alcohol of cheap beer.\n\n- **Liquors** are measured in \"proofs\" where **1 proof is 0.5% ABV**. So a 40 proof Bourbon is 20% ABV, a 100 proof Tequila is 50% ABV, and Bacardi 151 is 75% ABV. When in doubt, assume 100 proof or 50% ABV.\n\nTo figure out how much alcohol you're consuming, multiply the percent ABV by the volume.

So, sorry if I sound preachy, but I've been there, done that, and can now give sage advice. \n\nDrink with someone who is looking out for your best interests. I drink with my fianc\u00e9. He's always making sure I am safe, drinking water, no one touches my drink, I'm not doing anything that will come back to bite me in the ass, and that I get home safely. The last thing you want is someone taking advantage of your intoxicated state. It could end up with someone hurting you, posting to social media, or even rape/sexual assault. Please be careful and have someone watch your back who knows what you would or wouldn't do sober, so you don't end up doing it drunk. \n\nDrinking as much water as you do alcohol will help with hangovers. Especially because it is still summer, it's warm, and you could end up very dehydrated. Please make sure you drink plenty of water. Dehydration, heat stroke, heat exhaustion, alcohol poisoning, it is not fun. I got heat exhaustion and dehydrated at a country music festival. I was puking, my head was pounding, almost passed out, and was sick in bed for days after. Now I can't be out in the heat like that anymore. Nonetheless, drinking out in the heat. Water will help flush out the toxins and make sure you are able to get out of bed the next day. Also, make sure you eat. Complex carbs. Oatmeal, breads, pasta, complex carbs. It'll soak up the alcohol, and if you do vomit, you aren't puking out just straight beer/liquor. \n\nDon't feel pressured to drink. I get it, you're out with friends and they're drinking so you want to be social. But if you don't feel like it's a good idea, listen to your gut. That party will still be fun if you have a cup of soda instead of beer. Don't keep drinking because someone offers it. Know your limit, know your line in the sand. \n\nDon't drink underaged. Don't drink and drive. Both are illegal. Being the \"lame\" one may cost you right now, but drinking underaged or driving under the influence and getting caught? That's thousands of dollars in court fees, attorney's fees, bond money, and getting a conviction on your record. I'm a paralegal for criminal defense. Please, I'm telling you from experience, it really isn't worth it. Not only that but driving while under the influence can be deadly. You could seriously injure or kill people/yourself. \n\nYou don't need to drink every night, at every party, every weekend, or every chance you get. You don't have to be stereotypical college-aged person. How long you can do a keg stand doesn't hold near as much weight as a good GPA.

If you have a friend who has been puking their brains out and passed out, SLEEP BESIDE THEM. Sure it's gross and something you don't want to do but people will choke on their puke and die. It happened to someone at my school. KNOW THE SIGNS OF ALCOHOL POISONING AND CALL 911. Nobody wants to get in trouble, I get it. However people will literally die.\n* **Both parties cannot consent to sex when drunk.** Sure there are blurred lines here I will not get into, but it is a RULE OF THUMB that if you are drunk, or the other party is drunk, they **cannot** consent to sex. If this is heterosexual relations, men will get hit with the book on this one. Pack it up, get a number, and text the next day to get breakfast if you really like the person. I promise you, you will never regret putting it aside for 8 hours. Plus, drunk sex is *not that great anyways.* \n* **When drunk, if you have sex you will make poor decisions.** If the nonconsensual part is not convincing, if you are drunk you will forget to use a condom, use it poorly, or just say \"screw it\" and not use one. You will be putting yourself (and/or your partner) at risk for STIs and pregnancy. DO NOT DO IT.\n* **If you see someone drunk and another person is making advances, be a good person and intervene.** Find their friends, strike up a conversation, sit them down and find out how to get them home and safe. There is no need for anyone to contribute to the toxic sexual assault culture - do not encourage your friends to advance on drunk parties. Read the signals and find a same-sex friend who can help them out of the situation.\n* **For the love of god do not drive drunk.** Sure we're probably talking about dorm parties but some colleges have frat houses, etc. that are off campus. Your $30 uber + $50 parking ticket will be cheaper than a DUI, manslaughter charge, or your own life. Do NOT trust your friends who have had even one drink to drive you home. Budget accordingly prior to having your first drink. ALSO, many colleges have free pick-up/bus options to encourage students to be responsible. *Please* take advantage of these. My college had one - the university police would pick you up they didn't check your age or ask any questions. \n* **Do not drink drinks that you did not pour, and watch your drinks.** There are exceptions (when you trust people unequivocally) but this is a huge problem. One party at my school had a whole punch bowl spiked and about 4 sexual assaults that night. A good way to avoid this is to prepare ahead of time and bring your own drinks, say no, and always hold your own drinks. \n\n***Safety is your number one priority when you are drinking.***", "author": "Katey5678", "created": 1566236637, "upvotes": 32}, "exf9gb6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/csh8ef/alcohol_thoughts_on_staying_alive/exf9gb6/", "text": "Just thought I'd put this out there: there is no shame in being a lightweight!
