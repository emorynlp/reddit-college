  "text": "Idk if its just mid semester burn out talking but I decided I want to try engineering this semester because I think its neat and enjoyed the engineering projects in highschool. But now I'm not sure I've learned a lot more about what it's like as a job and I am feeling somewhat disillusioned. It seems like their might be less of the more creative engineering design positions and more of the testing and analysis models and reporting type of jobs which sound so boring. Where as in highschool the things that made me like engineering were smaller scale projects done in small groups or individually where you got to figure out how you wanted to do things and their was some planning involved obviously but also a lot of just making it and seeing what happened as part of the process and you got to do a bunch of different parts of the project.  The reason I wanted to do engineering was to be sort of a place where my creative and stem sides could find common ground and its starting to feel like the gap is still really wide. Also I'm just sick of doing math problems most of the day every day. Like I don't even dislike math sometimes even like it and am good at it but ugh.\n\nSo now I'm not sure how many lasses to continue taking in engineering . But also thinking of trying a cad course because I remember designing parts was neat in solid works but that doesn't really carry over into anything except the architectural drafting program not even engineering. Even the core requirements change a bit depending on what program I decide to stick with because I'm starting at a 2year. That's not even counting how I also have to plan around where I want to transfer to idk. I'm all worried about this because to get student loans their is the whole must complete program in 1.5 times the allotted credit. Only thing I really know for certain is I want to do an art minor because I like art and want to pick up some skills from formal classes but not a major because I don't want to be a pro artist. Idk I feel like I oscillate from being excited by a lot of things to finding most things not interesting enough or to impossible. Both make it hard to decide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo like when would be the time to stop experimenting and actually have a plan so I don't get screwed by the college loan rules.",
