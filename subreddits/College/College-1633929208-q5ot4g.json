  "text": "I'm majoring in economics, the one social science that seems to be most math heavy and along the way I didn't learn how to think mathematically. whoops!\n\nAt the point I've grown past the basics of supply and demand and am supposedly ready for all the fun models like cost minimization & production functions. It's killing me. It feels like the first time I've had to apply algebra & calc to real world scenarios & not just cookie cutter problems. Up to this point I've done math by memorization but that just isn't cutting it here. I can do one step of a problem and make sense of it sure, but the whole procedure overwhelms me.  I don't get why step 1 connects to step 2 besides seeing it that way in the PowerPoint.\n\nI have deadlines for projects & an important test coming up and I feel like I need to train my math skills,  *fast*. I have no clue where the best place to start is though. Does anyone here have any advice for learning how to actually do math?  Study groups aren't really an option as this is one of those online classes where nobody talks or knows each other, and either way it feels like my problem is beyond just this econ class but with math in general.",
