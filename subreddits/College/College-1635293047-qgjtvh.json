  "text": "Everyone is always \"good night professor\" \"good morning\" now in chat, I do say \"good evening everyone\" and it's always ignored so Idk. I am not an introvert, I just don't feel the need to do it every single class specifically to the professor. Do you guys always greet your professor personally?",
