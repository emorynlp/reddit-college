      "text": "Well it varies by location so I will give you a dynamic answer you should be able to use in most places.\n\n\"Good\" is a job that provides enough for you to cover average expenses (including some discretionary/fun), while saving at least 10-15%, and provides some yearly PTO (in the US it isn't mandated; 10 days is good for a new grad but still below world standards) and decent health insurance. This is a common and decent post-college job. It's somewhat average for a student who looked at the major and made sure they could get a decent job in it.\n\n\"High\" for me would be meeting the above requirements but being able to save at least 30-40% of income without having a roommate, giving up a vacation, or otherwise cutting expenses. This isn't the average for a four year graduate and is more common for in-demand fields.\n\nThe \"good\" definition is what you should look for when justifying a major. Along with not having more loans than the major's starting salary (less than half is great). Generally the degree isn't worth it if you can't end up with something like that.\n\nThere are ways to leverage your salary in certain fields, such as switching companies a year or two in for a big salary increase or working remote from a lower cost of living area.",
