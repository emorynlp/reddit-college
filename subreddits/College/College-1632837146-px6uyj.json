      "text": "Yes, there are kids in my class who are constantly talking and being general idiots during class. It's a web and mobile app development class, focusing mostly on design, so the room is full of Macs. Whenever we're on photoshop, these two morons sitting next to me will draw dicks and shit. Which I wouldn't mind, in fact I might even join them if I didn't hate their guts. They have this thing where they shake the mouse so hard and then laugh like its the funniest shit they've ever seen. They talk all class, making jokes that would make a toddler roll their eyes.\n\nThen there's the whale. This fat bitch at the front of the room who always has to interject and make it about her. I guess she's had some mental issues, which I sympathize with, these last  couple years have been pretty hard on me (don't want to get into detail, but a good friend of mine killed himself). But holy shit. I want to slap her and tell her to shut the hell up. She has that annoying rich dumb white girl voice, where she holds the last syllable of the last word in whatever garbage sentence she's spewing, and at the last second she raises the pitch of her voice. Example: \"My project is for a non profiiiiiiiiit\". Took this directly from class, when the teacher was giving another student advice, she decided she needed to open her fat mouth. I don't know if you can tell, but I really don't like her.\n\nI've noticed that it's normally younger students, but that doesn't mean older ones can't be annoying either. If I had to guess, they probably just don't care. They're here for the parties, not the degree. My best advice, ignore them. Even though it's hard, try to focus on the class. If they aren't paying attention to the class, then they should fail, right? You'll probably never be forced to listen to their idiocy ever again.",

If you noticed she had a deep scent the first week of school why no try to change to a different professor instead of sitting there mocking her. They act like they\u2019re still in high school and they\u2019ll wake up real fast hopefully.",

      "text": "This isn't a \"new generation\" thing. It might be in your country, but in the US it relies more on the specific location/background of the students moreso than generation.\n\nThat being said, while older students were rude when they were 18-19, most grew the fuck up and eventually learned to be respectful or they became \"that guy\" that everyone knows is an asshole.\n\nChances are most of today's young students will also grow up eventually, so I wouldn't worry too much. People have learned \"adulting\" at later and later ages, so some patience can go a long way. I think covid has also stunted student's development-- not ust academically, but socially. I doubt it's permanent. \n\nEither that, or our society is falling to pieces, which is also a distinct possibility, lol. Realistically, though, people just need to get back to practicing interacting in person with real human beings which will help them develop some empathy.",

              "text": ">  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good thing\n\nDefinitely not a good thing, but it's hard to change systemic cultural shifts. In the US, 17-18 year olds in high school are often treated like children, so it's hard to be surprised that they act like children when they turn 18 and go to college. But getting parents and the k-12 system to change their style of doing things so as to facilitate real life \"adulting\" skills would be (and is) a massive undertaking. \n\nAt this point, I think most people have given in and accepted that people won't learn how to adult until after they're 18 and attend college or join the workforce or military or do whatever it is they choose to do after high school. The problem is that now *colleges* have started babying students (at least first years if not most students at the undergrad levels, although usually upper level undergrads do get treated more like adults than the freshmen) so you sometimes have students making it all the way to graduation without having been forced to \"adult\" too much and then end up unprepared for life even as a 21-22 year old. Young adults who go into the workforce or military don't seem to have this same problem, so I think unfortunately colleges specifically are contributing to the problem.\n\nAgain, this is my experience in the US specifically, so your mileage may vary elsewhere.",
