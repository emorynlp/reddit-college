If given the option, nobody really shows up because if they have the option to not show up they\u2019ll take it even though they don\u2019t like online. When I previously talked about the routine, you were kind of forced into doing things which is why people liked it. Mid-way through, two of my professors got fed up by the small class sizes that they said they\u2019re just going go to online for the rest of the way.\n\nFrom my experience, courses really should only do one or the other. I don\u2019t mind either decision but it should only be one.",

Some universities did it in a shady way like UofT in 2020 first semester when they only announced that school will be done online only after the deposit deadline for dorms and offered no-refunds (the second bit might be wrong but I\u2019m too lazy to fact check). If I remember right, they were the last school in Ontario to announce online only learning. By second semester, many dorms were empty. \n\nUWindsor was a lot better in that they announced online-only learning and offered refunds. I think they even closed off one of the dorm buildings because it had no residents.",
