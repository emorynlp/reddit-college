  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI have exams next week Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. I want to drop the test on Tuesday as I feel that it would be best for me and my academics but I missed the dropping deadline. What excuse could I give I could still do the tests on Monday and Wednesday but still miss the Tuesday test. Please give me some ideas. Thanks already",

That\u2019s unlikely without medical/emergency documentation, and even then, you\u2019ll probably be given an alternative version of the exam that may or may not be more difficult.",
