  "text": "So, my friend recently parked near the college aaaand he parked on green teritory, actually mud...I live in Europe and police gives you tickets if you park any where thats not a parking zone, and not to mention a green surface. But its not green, its dust/mud whatever you wanna call it. Legit everybody parked there, now everybody avoids it. Parking zones are always full so we need to park elsewhere. My question is, is it okay to put 4 tiles/ceramic/concrete under the tires, drive onto them and not get a ticket...? Sounds silly but makes sense lol",

Placing tiles on the ground doesn't magically turn a non-parking zone into a parking zone. \n\nRealistically, traffic cops would probably just get a good chuckle out of your creativity and then give you a ticket anyway.",
