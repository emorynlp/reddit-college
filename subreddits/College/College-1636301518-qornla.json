  "text": "I'm about to finish my first semester and it has been terrible and lonely. I have nobody to talk too and no friends. Throughout the first couple of weeks I joined clubs which was suggested by a reddit user on a previous post. It went terrible, I tried to be apart of the group but whenever I said something I would be completely ignored for no reason. My roommate spends 95% of his time at his girlfriend's house. I really really want to break free of being a friendless loser but my confidence is at an all time low with the experience I had joining  clubs. Is there a way to find friends after the first semester?",
