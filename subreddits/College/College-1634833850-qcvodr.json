  "text": "Hey guys ... So I joined college and it's just been a month I've already payed a $ 3000 non refundable but I don't really like the place that much the teaching and the atmosphere isn't to my liking ...\nso like I applied for this other college ..the reviews say it's great and I've wanted to go there too .. but the problem is for my last two years I'll have to be in a hostel ...\nI'm super confused I don't know what to do should I tell my parents ? Or just bite my teeth and try to get through without changing colleges ...",
