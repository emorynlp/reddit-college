  "text": "Hi guys! I need some advice. I am a Biology undergrad but do not wish to be in the field anymore. I have always been interested in engineering/comsci.\n\nI have two options:\n\n*Get another bachelors in ComSci and spend 4 years there\nOr\n*Take 4 prerequisite classes for a Masters in Software Engineering and spend 2 years in a Masters program\n\nI feel conflicted in spending another 4 years towards another Bachelors and money. \nIs a Masters beneficial towards getting a job if I have a Bachelors in another field?",

      "text": "Many U.S. colleges don\u2019t accept applicants for second bachelor\u2019s degrees. An example is William and Mary in Virginia: https://www.wm.edu/admission/undergraduateadmission/how-to-apply/transfers/faqs/index.php I would research the college\u2019s transfer policy if you decide to apply for a second bachelor\u2019s degree. For your situation, it is unlikely that you would need to take the full 4 years of classes for a second bachelor\u2019s degree, since many classes will probably transfer. Going to grad school would open up more career options.",
