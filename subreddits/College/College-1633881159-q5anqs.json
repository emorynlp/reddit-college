  "text": "As another prof, I really sympathize with students.  I have come across a ton of stubbornly backwards colleagues in my profession.  Do any of you have these experiences?  It was certainly common in my day, and I don't know how common it is today, but I have witnessed it... \n\nI can't tell you the number of times I have witnessed professors, when doing example problems, use ethnic-sounding or Asian names in a humiliating scenario to try and be funny (\\_\\_\\_ is picking up her welfare check.  3 of her kids have different fathers...).  Etc.  I've certainly witnessed a lot of inappropriate interactions with profs and female students...\n\nI have also witnessed some professors single out students in marginalized groups and expect that they'll just share their experiences to the class.  There was a post on r/professors about a prof being accused of bias from a title 9 coordinator.  The prof asked 2 non-binary students (who are \"treated with the greatest respect,\" according to the prof) to participate in a Planned Parenthood forum.  The prof did not ask any other students or make any announcements to the class about it.  The prof expected that the non-binary students would do this and seemed disappointed that they didn't participate.  The prof says \"I think they have been 'trained' to look for offence rather than appreciate the attention.\"\n\nThe prof also had a diversity statement that they took issue with:  *If you prefer to be referred to by the plural pronouns, them/they, please make sure I know this.  Be courageous to let your peers know as well.  We are all open to learning new ways to communicate with each other.*\n\nThe number of professors on the subreddit saying that \"kids these days are too fragile\" was a bit disheartening...",

Here's the recommended language from my department's syllabus (I didn't write this but I use it):\n\nName and Pronoun Use\n\nIf your name does not match the name on my course schedule (and my class roster), please let me know as soon as possible so I may adjust my records. My pronouns are she/her/hers. If you would like to share your pronouns with me, I welcome that. For more information about pronouns, see this page: https://www.mypronouns.org/what-and-why\n\nThis language is more general (not just addressing the possibility of they/them preference), and it's offering students a chance to share with you (\"if\"). This normalizes the practice more than saying this is a \"new\" way to communicate (while this may truly be a new concept for the instructor, drawing attention to it being new is focusing more on the instructor's feelings about it instead of the true goal, which is normalizing pronoun conversation/not drawing extra attention to it).\n\nAlong this line of thinking, if a research opportunity seeking gender nonconforming students happens in the future, I would suggest sending out a general email/announcement to all students instead of just approaching the ones you know to be nonbinary - there may be many others who haven't made their status known who would benefit from hearing this info.\n\nOf course your original actions were done with best intentions in mind, but just thought I'd give some perspective on why these students may have felt this way!",

Colleges, at least in the US, are companies. They do what they can for money. Ever noticed that white ass schools have ten minority students who all play football or basketball? It\u2019s for financial reasons. There was a frat that had an annual hazing ritual of having each guy drug fifteen girls EACH. One girl (and probably more) got raped. The school sent out an email. Nothing else aside from that. It\u2019s so disgusting, even other girls and (ex) friends of mine started to say that the girl was probably exaggerating etc. And this is normal.",

Therefore, we rely more on our experiences over critical thinking when we are older.\n\n**But what you described seem to be a different problem. You are describing the older generation being more insensitive to racial inequalities. Apart from people who are bigots (which can be said for all generations), this could potentially be explained by the cultural differences.** \n\nBeing an Asian American myself, there are a lot of things I thought were normal but apparently were not. An example if watermelon and African Americans. My family love watermelons. It is one of the most commonly eaten fruit at my house hold during summers. One time I had a house party, and I served fruit plate with watermelons. Later a colleague told me that I should avoid that as watermelons are associated with anti-black racism in the US. I honestly was not aware of that. To me, I was serving a delicious fruit that I deeply enjoy. But to my African American colleagues, it could potentially make them uncomfortable. \n\nSo back to the old vs young topic at hand, some older people might not be aware they were being insensitive. To them, they didn't openly attack anyone, or say something that's factually untrue, or treat people differently based on race/gender/whatever. This could be because what are considered insensitive today are not as bad back then.\n\nThat being said, if after being pointed out of their insensitivity, and they double down, goes on the offensive, and insist it's your fault for feeling hurt, then that's just bigots showing their true color.",
