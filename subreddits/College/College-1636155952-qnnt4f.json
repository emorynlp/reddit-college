  "text": "I\u2019m a 19 y/o college student living with 3 roommates in an on campus apartment. (We\u2019re technically not allowed to have pets at all but I know a lot of people still have pets) I really want a cat and talked to my roommates about it and they are all okay with it and would all help me watch the cat but it would be my primary responsibility to pay and care for it. I want a cat, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the smartest move as a 19 year old college student since I don\u2019t have permanent housing and I have never owned a cat before. My mom doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s smart, but I want a cat so bad.",

      "text": "Your mom is right. It\u2019s not a smart idea and it doesn\u2019t really matter what you WANT to do, it\u2019s what you CAN do. What happens when the campus housing finds out about the cat? What if you get kicked out? Are you able to move somewhere else, that also accepts pets? Or will you just have to get rid of the cat? You know going in that you aren\u2019t allowed to have the cat. If you don\u2019t like that they don\u2019t allow cats, move elsewhere and then get one. But can you also afford a cat? Supplies,vaccinations, vet visits, etc? Too many people get pets when they shouldn\u2019t and it\u2019s not fair to an animal to go into a situation that puts it in limbo.",

Do you think all of its needs will be fulfilled? Do you think you'll be able to spend multiple hours a day playing with it? Just some things to consider. Make sure you're ready for the commitment :)",

If it gets sick will you be able to afford vet bills, or will you basically sentence it to death? Imagine you can not take care of the cat and return it back to an adoption center. You are only going to make it's adaptation to humans and other homes worse.\n\nWhen you are older and more stable, you can then adopt a cat and  it would be better for the two of you",
