  "text": "how important really is college? What can I do if I don't want to go to college? I'm in my last  year of high school and already very worried about my future. Not sure if going to college will really be the best decision for me, but my parents will never agree on that until I give them an explanation of what I will do after school.",

      "text": "It\u2019s fine not to go to college, but you should have at least a vague idea of what you want to do instead so you aren\u2019t just freeloading off your parents for the next decade.\n\nYou could go to trade school and become a mechanic/electrician/plumber etc, you could get a standard entry level job in retail or a restaurant, you could work in construction, you could get a CDL, and many other things. What do you like to do? There are plenty of jobs out there that don\u2019t require a degree, but most don\u2019t pay as well, at least at first, unless they are skilled (and you need to get those skills somehow)",

      "text": "It\u2019s only important if you have a real plan. Most kids go to college and think they will automatically land a good job just because they have a degree, it\u2019s not like that anymore. Like the post above you have trade schools and other certification programs. Or even look into the military, I went that route and very successful because of the job experience, veteran hiring priority, and GI bill which literally pays you to go to school.",
