      "text": "for sure. The other day I spent a whole hour trying to ask for advice from my professor in the most respectful, grammatically correct, professional manner possible, and she just flat-out didn\u2019t listen lol. I\u2019ve also had professors respond with one word like \u201cyes\u201d despite my spending ages stressing out about emailing them and making sure I phrased it properly. It kind of just makes me wonder if I should just give no fucks either \u2014 like I genuinely feel like my emails have been far more professional than those of my professors",

      "text": "Honestly, as someone who stays in contact with just about all of their professors and was taught a very formal way of email construction, it depends on the professor. Sometimes you just need to play it by ear depending on your current rapport with the professor, but as a general rule of thumb I err on the side of being formal in email and more relaxed in person. It\u2019s natural to feel a bit of worry about speaking to people who are important or who could help change the course of your future, but they are human just like the rest of us. They vary. Some may be fine with a more laid-back style of communication, while others may prefer the formality that is typically expected when writing emails. Either way, professors probably won\u2019t get offended if you go too formal, but going too lackadaisical can easily come of as rude or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, if you remember, Anton Ego had just as much of a joyous, amicable side as a harsh, critical one by the end of the movie. Professors come in many different shapes, sizes, and manners of conduct and speech because they\u2019re just people like us. And in most scenarios, professors want to see students succeed and are there to help. I wouldn\u2019t fret about your interactions with them too much; keep the emails classy and respectful and you should be fine.",
