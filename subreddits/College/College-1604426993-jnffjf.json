I keep doing that. If I had any shame at all, I\u2019d feel embarrassed. It\u2019s so hard to remember people that don\u2019t have academic freedom. You\u2019re like Gen X; angsty and frequently forgotten in conversation.\n\nI\u2019m writing to follow up on my original post: [An Honest Letter from Your University President About Why We\u2019re Opening This Fall](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/hxd9z8/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/)\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to address the disappointing survey results we received from you. Yes, faculty, over 17% of the student body is currently in quarantine or isolation, but we gave you a Zoom license and a 720p webcam with a microphone that captures all sound within a two and a half foot radius. Be resilient. This sounds like a \u201cYou\u201d problem. If you need help, ask the instructional technology group that we\u2019ve underfunded for the past decade and kept on a hiring freeze even after they lost a quarter of their staff to private industry. \n\nAnd please stop asking if the students in quarantine are okay. They\u2019re perfectly safe in the Holiday Inn down the road. No, the bad one. Dining Services is making sure they get their meals at least three times a week. Breakfast is an overripe grapefruit and Saltines. The vegetarian option is a chicken salad sandwich. We include a 6oz bottle of water. That\u2019s 2oz per meal! For those of you who\u2019ve asked: the wifi matches the quality of a strong home internet connection from 1997, so don\u2019t let them lie to you when they get kicked out of your hybrid/flexible/in-person/circus/flipped/blended/shitshow/mishmash/Sisyphean instruction on Zoom because \u201ctheir internet cut out\u201d. They\u2019re fine. \n\nStudents: We built our entire reopening plan around your ability to do something all 18-22 year-olds excel at: Self control. Yes, this has led to a massive uncontrolled outbreak on campus, which is why we need to assign blame to the people who\u2019ve done the most to create these incredibly dangerous circumstances: **You**. I cannot believe that when freed from the restrictions of home life with your parents, the first thing you decide to do is try to *make friends*. I mean, who does that? It's not like we've spent your entire lives selling you on the college experience. We\u2019re trusting you.\n\nFaculty: Since we don\u2019t trust the ~~scapegoats~~ students, and to reassure the business faculty who are assigning tests that Pearson and McGraw Hill wrote in 2003, we\u2019ve invested heavily in Proctorio. This will allow us to surveil the students from the discomfort of their apartment or dorm room (sorry, \u201cresidence hall\u201d). Blinking more than 15 times in a minute, wearing red sweatpants, or having dark skin will automatically fail the student and trigger a meeting with the student conduct board. Via Zoom, of course. \n\nNow then, on to spring. I know many of you are feeling tired from not having any fall break, but good news! This proves we can get through a semester without *any* break. Maybe even \\[drum roll\\] spring break! That\u2019s right! Instead of a much-needed break in the middle of one of the coldest, darkest, most uncomfortable times of the year with no major holidays or time off between January and April, we\u2019ve opted to eliminate spring break in 2021. For those of you feeling stressed, we encourage you to try any of the following meditative exercises our Wellness Czar/CFO has provided:\n\n* Spend time reflecting on how lucky you are to have a job. \n* Create a spreadsheet of how expensive it\u2019d be to take a job at the next closest university 58.3 miles away. \n* Disconnect from social media.\n* Calculate the chances someone with COVID actually washed their hands properly after they left the communal bathroom you just used. \n* Make a list of how many days it\u2019d take for you to become homeless if you quit right now. \n\nIf you are a faculty or staff member who fought us tooth and nail for accommodations to work remotely this fall, this does mean you\u2019ll need to re-apply for spring. The application process will require you to submit the following to HR: A form with a detailed rationale about why you need accommodations (with citations in MLA 9th edition format), two doctor\u2019s notes (one must be from your dentist), a Starbucks gift card with exactly $2.37 left on it, blood samples from your children that you personally extracted, a fourth grade report card (doesn\u2019t have to be yours), the last five digits of your mother\u2019s social security number, and President Obama\u2019s long form birth certificate. The original. If you cannot provide these things, your application will be rejected. This policy should help the administration continue its decades-long tradition of disproportionately disenfranchising our female faculty and staff who have children *and* the desire to follow a meaningful career path in their field. \n\nNow to answer some other questions you\u2019ve been collectively ~~pestering us with~~ asking:\n\nNo, we will not acknowledge the backbreaking burden of the affective labor staff have been doing since March. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not \u201cfine\u201d. Do the same thing I\u2019m convinced you do when you say you\u2019re working remotely: Pretend you are. Our faculty need strong, reassuring leadership, which is why  you as the people tasked with executing the mission we've created with no input, representation, or feedback from you are going to provide it. Act like everything\u2019s normal and do it with a smile, sweetheart. \n\nNo, we will not be paying the Student Life staff more despite the extraordinary circumstances. We let them live for free in the same dorms as their COVID-infected classmates, who they are now required to check in on daily so my administrative assistant can tell these annoying parents that their student\u2019s taken care of when they call. The dozens of hours of overtime this semester on top of their regular courseload mean nothing. You thought we meant it when we said \"Their first job is being a student?\" Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, oh that was good. Wait wait, let me get the senior staff on a Zoom call so you can say that again. They're going to love this! Oh, and tell the RAs to consider this semester a life lesson on what it means to be on salary, and that \u201cOther duties as assigned\u201d is a literal statement. \n\nYes, this semester has put the Black, Hispanic, and Latinx members of our community at higher risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services and dining staff.\u00a0But if they don\u2019t like it, they can just go get another job. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in the midst of a second generational recession. I mean could you even *imagine*? \n\nNo, we will not be doing pass/fail this semester. Why does everyone keep asking that? Be resilient! When I was a junior in college I got strep throat and was out of class a whole afternoon! I did the work to keep up despite the massive hurdles placed in front of me, and I expect the same of our students. \n\nI feel this must be said in closing: You all seem to have forgotten that a key part of the administration\u2019s COVID strategy is **Performative Normalcy**, so don\u2019t expect your \u201cpedagogical mission\u201d or \u201csafety\u201d to trump our operations. We are back in-person for a reason: **Money**. I don\u2019t know how you missed this. We sent it via email at 5:01 on last Friday, 23 minutes after we\u2019d sent another email announcing the largest uncontrolled outbreak of the semester. Contact your supervisor if you need productivity tips for managing your email. \n\nSocially distanced hugs and kisses,\n\nYour University President, PhD.", "author": "world-shaker", "created": 1604426993, "retrieved": 1632946795, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2114, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gbhxlzq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jnffjf/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/gbhxlzq/", "text": "At a certain point, the Tholians will complete their web, and we will be trapped in this region of space, forever.", "author": "Talosian_cagecleaner", "created": 1604784607, "upvotes": 1}, "gbbouax": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jnffjf/an_honest_letter_from_your_university_president/gbbouax/", "text": "This is sadly so relatable.
