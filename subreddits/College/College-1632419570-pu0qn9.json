I have taken this professors macro course and struggled a lot and in order to succeed with an A on the final I studied for two weeks. \n\nPreviously it was during quarantine and he did no zoom and it was all fend for yourself. His courses are based off of exams only which is very scary to me. Having previously taken one of his courses this past exam I felt as if I knew what his test would look likely and how to prepare. \n\nI read the chapters, I did his \"homework\" question (he doesn't grade these), I didn't miss his class, I studied the main themes of the chapters, the points he went over in class, I did questions in the book we didn't even go over as well as studied back and forth with another student and even did all of his practice essays. I felt absolutely ready and like this year would go so much better for one of his courses. \n\nI took the test and none of it looked familiar it was all very hands on and had no definition type questions. I drew graphs I did math that we never went over and I answered the essays just as he had told me was correct for the practice.\n\n We got those exams back today and I flip it over and what do I see?... a D+...like excuse me what a D? I thought I had done everything I needed to. When asking others who are more knowledgable than me they had either done the same or worse. Mind that this is all after the curve. \n\nI will note as well that I had three other exams as well that week and I wouldn't consider myself a bad test taker. I average an A or B on tests. \n\nWhat possibly else can I do when I feel as if I have done everything?", "author": "cccshelbyccc", "created": 1632419570, "retrieved": 1632800736, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he5911l": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu0qn9/studying_for_difficult_classes_when_you_feel_like/he5911l/", "text": "Go to office hours", "author": "PersephoneIsNotHome", "created": 1632521082, "upvotes": 1}}}
