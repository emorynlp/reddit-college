Animal Farm, The Jungle, The Republic, the list is expansive. \n\nAdditionally, considering key topics in the bio and chem fields are very political (gene editing, use of stem cells, behavior altering medications, organ cloning, etc.) it makes perfect sense for them to be discussed on those programs. \n\nI could go on. That said, I'll stick to my original point. Those who complain about politics in school (despite politics playing a role in most academic disciplines) are complaining that their point of view is not looked at in a good light. ",

I did meet her daughter a few times though and she was a really sweet girl.\n\nAlso in an anatomy course we were going over reproductive organs and  diagram of a penis showed up. The professor started giggling and then she said \"wow, that's a little small isn't it?\" It was super unexpected because she's normally doesn't joke during lectures but that one had several of us laughing because of how random it was.",

The liberal window dressing conceals that colleges function within and for capitalism. ",

But in order to use those things, they have to teach. I\u2019ve had professors from childhood development, to photography, to mathematics, that were all doing a study of some sort. The university would only let them conduct the study if they taught a certain number of hours and/or classes. My child development professor actually canceled her office hours one week because she wanted to focus more on her study instead of the class. And she just did. ",
