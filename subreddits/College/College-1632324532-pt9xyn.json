She goes to bed at 10 or 11 pm because she's unable to be productive later in the night and tries to wake up at at 5 or 6 am. I go to bed at around 12-2 am because I'm most productive later in the night and wake up around 8 or 9. While I've tried to adjust my sleep schedule to sleep earlier, sometimes when I have a lot of work, I stay up. \n\nWhile there's not really an issue with with the time we go to bed (I try to be quiet when she's sleeping), the problem is when we wake up. I'm very sensitive to alarms: even if it's not my alarm ringtone, my sleepy brain thinks it is and wakes up. Meanwhile, my roommate literally incorporates alarm sounds into her dreams and takes a long time to shut the alarm off. That sometimes leads to me permanently waking up at 6 am on 4-5 hours of sleep.\n\nIs there any way for us to compromise our wake up times? We've tried a vibrating alarm on her fitbit (doesn't work), having her alarm next to her bed so she could shut it off faster (worked for a while, but doesn't help when she's dreaming about the alarm). We've also discussed keeping air pods in while she sleeps but they only last for 5 hours and that's not long enough. My roommate and I get along really well; the only incompatibility is our sleep schedules and we're willing to try and work things out.

Het brain is still breaking down the sleepinducing chemicals, or in the middle of rem...\n\n Especially if she is remembering vividly dreaming, this happens iirc when a person in REMsleep is awoken...  and maybe it explains her incorporating exterior impulses ( the alarmsound) into her dream\n\n*I'd suggest* your roommate \n\n- *go to bed earlier* maybe 9:30pm, \nso she gets more needed sleep ... OR at least a little bit earlier, so her wake-up time coincides with the end of a sleep cycle. \n\n- double check if there is *any light/sound pollution*. Everyone, but especially people who are sensitive to sleepissues should avoid watching tv before bed, as well as reading on the phone, listening to a podcast that's too loud... \n\n-  avoid stress before bedtime. Anxiety and the overthinking, can be cause of problems with falling asleep... Thus maybe causing problems waking up and hearing the alarm\n\nBest I found is sleeping in total darkness, maybe an audiobook on low volume and on a timer in a slightly colder than room temperature room but with enough blankets handy . Made-up bed is a bonus.

Lol.\n\nI know u said the AirPods doesn\u2019t work cause they die but what about the ones with the cord that plug in? Have u tried that? That\u2019s like the only option I could think of.
