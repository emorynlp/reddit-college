  "title:": "How to wake up early with an alarm without disturbing your roommate?",
  "text": "My roommate and I have vastly different sleep schedules. She goes to bed at 10 or 11 pm because she's unable to be productive later in the night and tries to wake up at at 5 or 6 am. I go to bed at around 12-2 am because I'm most productive later in the night and wake up around 8 or 9. While I've tried to adjust my sleep schedule to sleep earlier, sometimes when I have a lot of work, I stay up. \n\nWhile there's not really an issue with with the time we go to bed (I try to be quiet when she's sleeping), the problem is when we wake up. I'm very sensitive to alarms: even if it's not my alarm ringtone, my sleepy brain thinks it is and wakes up. Meanwhile, my roommate literally incorporates alarm sounds into her dreams and takes a long time to shut the alarm off. That sometimes leads to me permanently waking up at 6 am on 4-5 hours of sleep.\n\nIs there any way for us to compromise our wake up times? We've tried a vibrating alarm on her fitbit (doesn't work), having her alarm next to her bed so she could shut it off faster (worked for a while, but doesn't help when she's dreaming about the alarm). We've also discussed keeping air pods in while she sleeps but they only last for 5 hours and that's not long enough. My roommate and I get along really well; the only incompatibility is our sleep schedules and we're willing to try and work things out. Any suggestions?",

      "text": "Haven't seen anyone comment this yet, so:\n\nThe art of waking up (and hearing your alarm) = knowing when to go to bed and the discipline to stay consistent\n\nIt sounds to me as someone who isnt getting her needed sleep\nif it takes her a while to regain awareness & shut off the alarm, it could mean her brain is still working on waking up. Het brain is still breaking down the sleepinducing chemicals, or in the middle of rem...\n\n Especially if she is remembering vividly dreaming, this happens iirc when a person in REMsleep is awoken...  and maybe it explains her incorporating exterior impulses ( the alarmsound) into her dream\n\n*I'd suggest* your roommate \n\n- *go to bed earlier* maybe 9:30pm, \nso she gets more needed sleep ... OR at least a little bit earlier, so her wake-up time coincides with the end of a sleep cycle. \n\n- double check if there is *any light/sound pollution*. Everyone, but especially people who are sensitive to sleepissues should avoid watching tv before bed, as well as reading on the phone, listening to a podcast that's too loud... \n\n-  avoid stress before bedtime. Anxiety and the overthinking, can be cause of problems with falling asleep... Thus maybe causing problems waking up and hearing the alarm\n\nBest I found is sleeping in total darkness, maybe an audiobook on low volume and on a timer in a slightly colder than room temperature room but with enough blankets handy . Made-up bed is a bonus. Warm tea and Incense, if you wanna go all out.\nGood luck!",

Not fitbit or phones though, I mean the actual vibrating alarm clocks that can shake much more powerfully and actually wake people up.\n\nAfter that I suggest that you get out of dorm-style living as soon as possible and secure an apartment or other housing that **gives private, 1-person bedrooms**.\n\nThis problem is awful to deal with, and can cause you to suffer badly and get tense with your roommate (personal experience), especially if you are a light sleeper or are sensitive to alarms. So don't put up with that. Get away from shared bedroom living as soon as you can.\n\nEarplugs can also work though you have to hope that you do not miss emergency fire alarms or sirens of any kind. Maybe your roommate does not sleep deeply enough to sleep through those and can wake you up in an emergency.",

Put in the ear plugs and blip the air horn.  After a few times, anxiety will get your roommate up quicker.",

She uses a Google Nest Hub as her bedside clock so it is easy for her to turn it on to white noise overnight to drown out most of my alarm clock noise until her alarm goes off. She says she does hear the alarm most mornings but it is no longer enough to wake her up fully.\n\nAlso - wireless noise canceling headphones could work, most of them have fully charged runtimes of +12 hours and if it is connected to your phone you could have the noise cancellation turned on so it muffles the sound of your roomies alarm and your phone alarm itself would then ring in the headphones making it so you don't miss out on that as well.",

This is YOUR issue and you need to find something YOU can do so you sleep. \n\nYou say you dont wake her but Im doubting if the first few hours of sleep is truly restful. The fact you are giving her anxiety shows you are being pretty rude about this and not taking any responsibility for yourself. Shes being polite and quiet but like 99% of the people in this world, she has an alarm to wake her up. She shouldnt have to \"fix\" this. \n\nWell, you recommended she use a vibrating alarm so why dont you do that yourself? You recommended she use headphone or ear buds so why dont you try that? You are honestly asking her to do things you wont even try. \n\nPerhaps you could try a white noise machine near your bed which will buffer the alarm noise. Both of you could trial alarms that are more pleasing to the ear as well. But this needs to work both ways, not just on your roommate. Perhaps you could try some sleep aids like lavender, melatonin, etc.",

How about you take a step back and don't try to assume everything about me and my roommate's situation? I left a lot out for the sake of clarity \ud83d\ude01\n\nI don't know if my roommate setting up 5 or more alarms a couple minutes apart at 5 or 6 am is technically my issue lol. She's also a very heavy sleeper, so it doesn't bother her too much if I sleep late (there's a reason why it takes her forever to get up). You think I haven't tried the vibrating alarm? I have...on accident in the middle of the night. I think I might've tried to repress that awful memory of not being able to find that snooze button on my fitbit for 40 minutes. The only reason I suggested that option to her in the first place was because it definitely woke me up lol. She has a different kind of fitbit so it didn't work for her. I do understand that working through these slight roommate is a two way street. That's why I'm asking for (and open to) suggestions and this morning, when she suggested that she sleep in the common lounge area instead of our room, I immediately shot that down.\n\nI am going to say that this might be the most helpful comment I've seen on this post so far! Thank you for that :D You've connected a lot of dots that I hadn't really considered before and a lot of the puzzle pieces are fitting into place. Three weeks ago, one of my friends recommended these really good ear plugs she's been using to shut out noises, so I'll order that from Amazon tonight. And I'll have to figure out how my fitbit alarm works so that it doesn't go off randomly at night and set it up to work with my schedule. Thank you for the suggestions and have a good day. It seems like (from the tone of your voice) you might be having a bad day so go treat yourself or something! \ud83d\ude0a \ud83e\udd70\n\nAlso, my roommate and our friend found this post already so hi roomie and friend if you're reading this \ud83d\ude01 :)",

If you have a smart light, you can set the light to turn on either at the same time as your alarm or 5-10 minutes before your alarm. This would help subconsciously wake you up and you can reduce the sound of your alarm as a result!",
