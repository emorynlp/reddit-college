  "text": "History is currently the only subject I can handle.. I am curious about anthropology but again these are all useless degrees and a waste of money. I don\u2019t know what I want to do when I graduate. I thought of working in a museum but at the same time I can\u2019t see myself in that field. I don\u2019t know if I want to get a phd since the current major I\u2019m doing(secondary education with biology) ain\u2019t going so well and I have C in biology class and might go lower so my gpa is low plus idk if I wanna study so long just to teach and do research at the same time. Being a professor seems too much work. I thought of law school but I\u2019m not sure if I can handle all the writing and reading and pressure. I barely read and write good essays. I\u2019m also terrible at math so idk what to do anymore. Idk how I\u2019m able to handle history since it has a lot of reading and writing.",

      "text": "Neither history nor anthropology are \u201cuseless\u201d degrees. They both hone writing, communication, and critical thinking skills.  A *ton* of jobs just require a degree and don\u2019t care what field.  No, you may not use the specific knowledge, but a lot of people don\u2019t, the degree isn\u2019t useless\n\nThe real question is, what do you think you might like to do?  I would definitely not encourage the history professor route.  \n\nWhat do you see yourself doing?",
