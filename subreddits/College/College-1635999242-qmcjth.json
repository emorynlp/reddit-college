  "text": "I'm 41 and just finishing an AS. I don't have a lot of hobbies, other than sometimes reading philosophy (currently picking through Freud via Althusser), talking with family, seeing the occasional friend, and so forth.\n\nIs there any benefit to me pursing a BA in philosophy? I don't expect career benefits, as I am already established in my career as a designer at a publicly traded company.\n\nIt would be purely to continue down the educational path. In my own reading, I am largely self-guided, and could just continue down that path, though do see benefit to the academic format as well.\n\nPlus any upper division classes I would take would probably be asynchronous, like at Arizona State Online.\n\nAny thoughts?",

      "text": "Similar circumstances here so I will offer my thoughts.\n\nClasses on the undergraduate side are designed to quickly build an understanding of the central ideas of the course material which can be helpful with getting oriented in the subject.  Seeing as philosophers tend to read, argue, and influenced each other, this orientation process can be helpful in interpreting texts without having to read those texts in full.\n\nAs many philosophers lived in different periods, I have found occasionally that the course materials can help clarify the period language into relevant modern terminology. Hobbes, for example, speaks of body and motion, but the course notes I recently read clarified that body could be translated into the modern term matter.\n\nIf nothing else, you could always just take one course to try it and see if it feels right.",
