  "text": "Okay so basically I'm a freshman in college and so far its not going so great. I've never had mental health problems before but I've had to start seeing therapist on my campus. At first I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong but I'm starting to get the suspicion its the school I go to. I decided to go to a really small all honor school in FL and so far I'm hating it. I didn't realize that at this school 90% of the people go home on the weekends and most people live like 20-30 mins nearby, so most of the time I'm just really lonely and I haven't found anyone I can relate to here yet. Also I'm having huge problems with the academics. I'm actually doing fine in my classes but I'm exhausted and the way that credits are here I have to take 6+ classes to get 15 credits, next semester I'm taking 5 and that's only 13. I would be able to handle how hard these classes were if I didn't have to take so many to get to or over 12 credits. Also there really aren't that many teacher so they're super spread out so there isn't really any possibilities for 1-on-1 time that was promised. Basically I'm just really miserable, stressed, overloaded with work with 6 classes for my 1st semester of college, and am struggling, is this just a freshman 1st semester thing? Would it be better to just bear it and continue going to my university? Would I just be better going to a bigger public university like UCF, for both the social scene and academics?",

          "text": "I'm an Honors Bio major, I'm fine with the difficulty with my classes it's doable, but I'm having more issues with the amount of these classes that I have to take to get to full time since it feels like a lot of classes. I'm feeling super spread out and discouraged since I'm taking 6 classes and its only 15 credits. I'd be able to handle 5 for 15 credits, but its just that I am taking 5 classes next semester and its only 13 credits. For the amount of work that I'm doing I feel like the credits don't match them. When I looked at UCF transfer credits I would've only needed 4 of my classes from this semester to reach 15, so its really the main reason I feel like transferring tbh.",

For me, that means a 16 hour day M-F that makes me want to die. But it gives me 1 day for additional studying and 1 day for complete school free freedom and I can do the things that I actually want to do. This makes the rest of it bearable.",
