      "text": "You're not going to get kicked out for failing one term. No college does that. But I can guarantee you you're going to get a call/email from your academic advisor, will likely be put on probation or get a warning that you will be put on probation if it happens again(depends on whether your uni has a grace period for new students, most do), and you'll be put on an official plan to improving your grades.\n\nTake this as a learning lesson and step up. You can recover. But if you don't recover now, you likely won't later, and that's going to be **really** bad.",

      "text": "You are not going to get kicked out for failing your first semester (this is coming from the person that got all Cs and a D their first semester of college). What my advice is to you is try to have a balance in your life between studying and other things (work, social life, clubs, etc.) Get an agenda, print the syllabus to know when things are due, and study at times that best fit your schedule. Or you can ask your advisor about Freshman forgiveness. Freshman forgiveness is a policy that is intended for freshman that are still adjusting to college by allowing them to retake course when you earn a D or lower. Hence, you are given a second chance at the classes that may hurt your GPA. For me, that was an option but you can always retake the class and make sure to go to your advisor and make a plan on how you will pass next semester.",
