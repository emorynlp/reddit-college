Lazy and only putting minimal effort just enough to pass classes, and it hurt my GPA a lot. Until 2 semesters ago that I started taking school seriously.\n\nHowever, there was this one class that has a reputation in my major that it is very difficult, and many people have to take it 2-3 times just to pass. So I\u2019ve delayed taking this class for forever because I was so afraid. \n\nThis semester was almost my last semester (only need one class in summer to graduate now), and with my school offering the option of S/U grade because of COVID-19, I realized it\u2019s time to finally take this class.\n\nIt turned out to be one of the most enjoyable classes I\u2019ve ever taken. The prof was also great. I genuinely enjoyed the subject, and put in so much effort that I earned an A in the class that I was always afraid of. At the end I didn\u2019t even need to petition for S grade like I intended to at the start of the semester, and this semester turned out to be my best semester. I\u2019m so proud of myself.", "author": "sharetan", "created": 1621558800, "retrieved": 1632802167, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 978, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gz7es3z": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nhgai5/i_got_an_a_in_the_class_i_had_been_afraid_of_for/gz7es3z/", "text": "Check out Zoom_Orgo on instagram", "author": "mnm821461", "created": 1621805586, "upvotes": 1}, "gyyf5v4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/nhgai5/i_got_an_a_in_the_class_i_had_been_afraid_of_for/gyyf5v4/", "text": "Funny how your mind switches like that after/durin a class.
