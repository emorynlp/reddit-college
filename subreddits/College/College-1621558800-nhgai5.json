  "text": "I\u2019ve always been a bad student. Lazy and only putting minimal effort just enough to pass classes, and it hurt my GPA a lot. Until 2 semesters ago that I started taking school seriously.\n\nHowever, there was this one class that has a reputation in my major that it is very difficult, and many people have to take it 2-3 times just to pass. So I\u2019ve delayed taking this class for forever because I was so afraid. \n\nThis semester was almost my last semester (only need one class in summer to graduate now), and with my school offering the option of S/U grade because of COVID-19, I realized it\u2019s time to finally take this class.\n\nIt turned out to be one of the most enjoyable classes I\u2019ve ever taken. The prof was also great. I genuinely enjoyed the subject, and put in so much effort that I earned an A in the class that I was always afraid of. At the end I didn\u2019t even need to petition for S grade like I intended to at the start of the semester, and this semester turned out to be my best semester. I\u2019m so proud of myself.",

Throughout that semester, I kept telling myself I'm not good enough for the major, I need to change majors, etc. I remember studying for hours on end and getting stuck on extremely simple programs for *days.* Furthermore, I was absolutely terrified of the notoriously hard classes (Data Structures an Algorithms, Networking II, Operating Systems, Calculus III, etc.). \n\nSomewhere along the line, something just clicked. Programming felt natural, I could figure out the right way to code almost anything that came to mind, etc. My GPA went from a 2.1 to a current 3.6 overall and a 4.0 in Computer Science related classes. I got an A in all of the classes I was terrified of.\n\nI'm at the point where I have one semester left and it's *all* general education, as I finished my major and minor early. Yet for some reason, I'm still convinced I'm not going to make it. I never thought I'd be good enough to get a college degree, but I've made it to 108 credits so far... somehow.",
