  "text": "It's not the classes themselves or the work that's the problem here (well they are problems but they're a whole other story). I'm talking about being at a college campus that you don't like the feel of. Something about the way the campus looks, the way the buildings look, what you see outside your dorm window, etc. feel \"off.\" Like you just don't like how the campus is laid out and you don't like how big and grey that stained stone-looking building looks down the street. I just don't like the feel of it, sometimes to the point where I don't even want to leave the dorm and I'll close my blinds because I can't stand looking outside my window.  It's weird because I went to a community college before this and I *adored* that campus. I loved the way the campus was set up and loved the buildings and didn't even mind the study rooms. I miss that place. How can I deal with living at this campus I'm currently at? Oh, and just about every time I go find a new place to study I feel like it gets \"ruined\" and I end up not liking it. Probably because I know it's at this campus I don't like so I end up not liking that place either because it's a part of this giant place I already don't like...",
