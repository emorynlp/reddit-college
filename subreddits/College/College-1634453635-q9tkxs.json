  "text": "I\u2019m in my second semester. I\u2019ve had to do remedial work and etc. I was wanting to go for history but changed my mind and I absolutely want to go for paralegal. One class I\u2019m taking is intro to liberal arts. Is there a way to get out of this class. I\u2019m half way through but it\u2019s pointless since the credits won\u2019t be applicable to para and it\u2019s such a dumb class. We had to pick a flower from the ground and write a paper about how it looked and how it made us feel. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
