  "text": "Hi! I am a college student. I used to be living at home before coming to college, I will have breakfast waken up, and now everything is so different. The first thing I did when I wake up is make my bed, and then I have to wait for the laundry room to be ready, and I cleaned my cup, then I brushed my teeth and washed my face, and then I have to re allocate the lundry room, when I finally sat down and used all my morning energy on the chores, I am hungry because there is no breakfast, I struggled in my mind if I want to make my own breakfast and go through the waiting time, the dishes, etc. I just felt everything is so messy and too much for me sometimes. Any advice? How i could be more focused on school work? Thank you",
