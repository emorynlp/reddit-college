It is difficult and I couldn\u2019t imagine finding and maintaining a relationship on top of school.",

She actually went to my school as well but I never knew. I thought she was cool so I decided to ask her out on a date. \n\nBut if you want a gf just go out and talk to girls. A lot of people say college everyone hooks up but that\u2019s only a small portion most \u201chookups\u201d are people that were talking or just party hookups which is rare. Just go talk to girls because most people want a relationship than a hookup tbh.\n\nEdit: decided to read the other comments and I saw you think you\u2019re ugly and you will never get a relationship or even a hookup like that. You need to think you\u2019re the greatest thing since the pizza bagel even if you don\u2019t believe because confidence is what makes or breaks any form or relationship tbh.",
