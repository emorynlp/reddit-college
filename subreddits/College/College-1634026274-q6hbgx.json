  "text": "I am a freshman Comp Sci major (1st semester outta HS), and I am doing BAD. My HS was a performing arts school and the math teachers were actual trash and didn't teach us (Literally passed us along, it didn't seem legal). I am struggling with literal algebra and am failing 3 classes. \n\nMidterms Havent even happened yet to give you an idea of how far along I am in my first semester.\n\nI am an avid software dev (Despite my shit math skills, I picked up programming/Cyber Security fast)\n\nThis is mostly due to the fact that my friend died early into the semester. He literally grew up with me and he died due to cancer at 18... And it made me lose motivation. \n\nI am failing 2 out of my 5 classes. I am just starting out, is it too late already? am I doomed this early into school, and should I drop out? Or should I change majors? I have no idea what to do, I'm struggling and need advice.",

      "text": "First off I just wanted to say that I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nBut don\u2019t change majors, you said so yourself you are struggling due to a poor understanding of math and demotivating. Not going to lie, it won\u2019t be easy, but you can improve your performance.\n\nIn terms of math, you just have to do extra studying for the class. This means doing practice problems religiously, supplementing any topics you are confused on with videos or other sources, going to office hours, and getting help from the tutoring center. Also give yourself a week in advance to begin reviewing for any major test or quiz you may have. As for your other classes, I don\u2019t know what they are but I recommend similar practice. Try reaching out to your professors and see what studying habits they recommend for their classes. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m also a freshman majoring in CS. Math and science are my weaker subjects so I have to do more studying for math to reinforce what I know. And I\u2019ve also never programmed before, so I\u2019m potentially in over my head on this. \n\nIt seems like with this major you just have to accept the challenges and be willing to put in the work to take them head on.",
