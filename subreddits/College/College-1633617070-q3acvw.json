      "text": "Feeling stupid is a feeling you should embrace. Nearly every college student feels stupid at some point, but the key to success is embracing that feeling and being persistent enough to keep working until you've overcome the inevitable sense of confusion that comes with the territory of challenging yourself. \n\nMany, many students just tell themselves they're stupid when the going gets tough and then they quit. Often these are students with very high potential, but hold onto the false belief that if something doesn't \"click\" quickly, then they're dumb and not \"cut out\" for whatever they're doing. This could not be further from the truth! In our culture, we have a myth of the \"genius.\" A \"genius,\" according to the myth, is someone for whom all things intellectual come easy. This is a myth because this is far from reality. Nearly every smart person got to where they are today by busting their asses and sitting through hours and hours of confusion before they worked out the concepts needed to actually understand what they're doing.\n\nI'm someone who is lucky enough to know people who were child prodigies as well as people who would not surprise me if they won a Nobel prize some day. Every single one of these individuals would laugh at the notion that 3 hours is a \"long\" time. What separates the successful from the unsuccessful is the ability to sit with a problem and pursue it for not just hours, but days, weeks, months, and years. Sure, successful people probably have a baseline level of aptitude, but in my experience, its the ability to become completely obsessed with something that makes them extraordinary.\n\nOf course, you don't have to be *that* obsessed to do well. You just need to be obsessed \"enough\" to be able to put in the extra few hours or so that it takes to pass your classes.\n\nRight now you're probably frustrated, so take a deep breathe, relax, and take a break. But come back to those problems, and keep at them. If you can embrace the feeling of confusion and keep working despite that discomfort, then you can be successful as a STEM major.",

              "text": "Very often, optimal methods of studying and becoming strong in an area of study depends on the specific area of study. Unfortunately, I've never taken art history, nor do I have any familiarity with the field. If it makes you feel any better, though, I have a friend who was a history major who very strongly believes that art history was the hardest class he took.\n\nI would suspect that taking notes would be a good start. Another suspicion I have is that maybe reading slower and really internalizing the content and ideas present could help (rather than just skimming through to get just a \"basic idea\"). \n\nI wish I could help you more, but unfortunately, it's just not my field. I have an undergrad degree in music so I do have a bunch of music history classes under my belt, but I don't think it's similar enough to art history that the study methods for those classes would be helpful. I mean, in that case, we had to do a *lot* of listening to a variety of composers and associate musical styles with particular eras and musical elements associated with those eras. I could see, I guess, there being some crossover-- you may want to become as familiar as possible with art from different eras and spend time recognizing elements that distinguish those eras and styles. In practice, you may want to go beyond just the textbook to find further examples (that you can probably find by just googling). It's possible that the textbook won't be enough to sharpen your skills.\n\nTake everything I say with a serious grain of salt, though, because I genuinely have no idea what goes on in an art history class, lol.",

Try not to beat yourself up and just practice more or study in areas where you feel you\u2019re lacking.",

Then come back and take a look at how you can be a little faster next time - maybe find someone to work with, use a study resource online, start earlier, etc. \n\nTry to be less hard on yourself. \n\nI spent 4-6 hours each day on my first circuit analysis class\u2019 hmw when I first took it. I simply couldn\u2019t grasp the concepts, especially taking it online. I dropped the class and am taking it again in person, and though the first hmw still took a few hours, I am now doing so much better and am doing well in the class. \n\nSchool is tough for a reason. If you truly want to be in CS, try to look at these experiences as something that strengthens you.",
