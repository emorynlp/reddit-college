It's sad that it took some people having to feel these things before they took the feelings of others seriously. I know students who struggled with having their health be taken seriously far before the pandemic. I've known students who formerly made fun of their classmates with social anxiety/who dreaded going to physical class, who now face severe anxiety with Zoom meetings and dread their own classes. It's been interesting to witness some of these shifts.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"not everyone\" didn't take them seriously-- I know. My school generously provided a wide variety of mental health services pre-pandemic.\n\nAt least now there seems to be an increase in offering of counseling, psychiatric services, more understanding for both students and staff, etc. I hope everyone has a better chance of getting help now, especially those who have been ignored and dismissed for so long before this pandemic ever happened.", "author": "petiterunner", "created": 1601737402, "retrieved": 1632802200, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 929, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g7lwkoy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/j4ghgh/does_anyone_else_feel_that_the_upside_of_this/g7lwkoy/", "text": "Mine just got worse.
