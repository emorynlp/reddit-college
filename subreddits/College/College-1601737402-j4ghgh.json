  "title:": "Does anyone else feel that the upside of this pandemic has been that anxiety and depression in students is now being recognized and taken more seriously by some schools?",
  "text": "I know people who didn't see these things as being \"real\" in students before the pandemic. It's sad that it took some people having to feel these things before they took the feelings of others seriously. I know students who struggled with having their health be taken seriously far before the pandemic. I've known students who formerly made fun of their classmates with social anxiety/who dreaded going to physical class, who now face severe anxiety with Zoom meetings and dread their own classes. It's been interesting to witness some of these shifts.\n\nAnd before anyone says \"not everyone\" didn't take them seriously-- I know. My school generously provided a wide variety of mental health services pre-pandemic.\n\nAt least now there seems to be an increase in offering of counseling, psychiatric services, more understanding for both students and staff, etc. I hope everyone has a better chance of getting help now, especially those who have been ignored and dismissed for so long before this pandemic ever happened.",

My school has a counseling center which can refer you to disability for both mental illness and mental disabilities (learning disabilities, ADHD etc.). So it\u2019s not that the professors are dealing with it, trained health professionals are dealing with it and then you can ask for accommodations from your professors backed up from those professionals. In fact, if you ask for accommodations and your professor ignores your request they can get in lots of trouble. I think this system works a lot better than just awareness.",

She apparently didn't have strong family support and was apparently being mistreated by heads in the residency program and despite reporting the abuse several times according to one fellow resident who chose to keep their identity private in the article but was threatened to be kicked out of the program altogether and feared spending the next two years in rebound or having to drop out of med school altogether. She eventually ended up jumping off of a parking garage in broad daylight and I witnessed the suicide happen. \nThe next person was an MD student at the MD part of the university I attend. This one was more cut and dry as his new wife claimed it had to do with the student loans he had taken out and the stress they were under to make ends meet even almost losing their home at one point and how he often expressed feelings of guilt and how she would be better off if he was dead because the loans would be cancelled. He eventually took his life through the use of drugs. It was believed to have been an OD at first and reported as such until the wife came forward and confirmed it was a suicide. \nThe third dude I don't have a lot of information on but going on his social media pretty much confirmed it based on the stuff he was saying as well as the university's statement. Died from self inflicted gun shot wound.",

They receive support. Just because I teach psychology doesn't mean I'm going believe any damned sob story that someone cares to vomit on my shoes when they just don't want to do the work. And yes, that is far more common that students who have actual serious problems. \n\nAs for your assessment of my line of work: step off and keep on steppin', sweetie. Better minds than yours gauged my work.\n\nWhinging about emotional needs is all-too-common today. It's doubly so in the psychology department where students erroneously believe I can't spot fraud from a mile away. If a student has a diagnosis, and if they've handled it the right way, I'm able to find out (though not what the specific diagnosis may be). \n\nIn my more-than-a-decade's experience teaching, I've encountered one person with a legitimate medical reason to postpone, delay, or otherwise qualify for special consideration--and she had given birth the week before. Otherwise, I've encountered a lot of liars and excuse makers who just think that, if they maintain the charade, I'll knuckle under and give them a charity grade.

There's an Office of Disabled Student Services that handles these things (very tactfully) and if a student with a diagnosis is having a problem, all I have to do is log into our reporting system, pull up the roster, and there's a flag by their name. I even get a preemptory email if a student in my class is flagged (though I check the roster, anyway, because emails can be forged and the report is a batch process).\n\nI've never worked in this office, but I do know they have a physician, a nurse practitioner, a clinical psychologist, and a social worker on staff / retainer. In essence, there's a system in place that is very reliable. They work with our infirmary to make sure that vulnerable students are taken care of and faculty know when we need to give special consideration for things. (I often see flags, but only student has told me she needed special consideration. Unless a student tells me they need to use that special flag, I don't make an exception because that's stigmatizing and unethical).\n\nMy problem with the initial post and the responses I've received (barring your own) is that it perpetuates the perception that colleges don't accommodate the psychiatric needs of their students--they do. But I've seen this from both ends (as a student with a legitimate neurological diagnosis and as a lecturer dealing with students) and I'm not impressed with the rhetoric on display here. \n\nA new maxim is emerging in psychology: \"Everybody wants a diagnosis until they get one.\" That is, we hear things all the time that simply aren't true. Mental illness isn't fun and I take a very dim view of malingering. One term, I had one young woman tell me that she suffered from \"both dissociative identity disorder and multiple personality disorder\" when, in truth, MPD is no longer in the DSM and DID covers MPD now. Moreover, she gleefully asked if I wanted to meet one of her alters--I almost hit the roof because people with DID never brag about it and are often ashamed to have it. Further, the ability to summon an alter isn't something someone with a recent diagnosis can do; that comes with decades of therapy. \n\nQuite honestly, if people think colleges aren't taking the mental health of their students seriously, they either don't have a legitimate diagnosis or they've made no effort to access the services that are available to them.",

                              "text": "Yes. Students with serious mental health issues are encouraged at the start of their first term (and we have a mandatory orientation course that covers it extensively) to interact with the disabled student services office. Those who follow these instructions find a lot of valuable resources at their disposal including on-campus counseling.\n\nAll universities and colleges in the United States are required by federal law to make accommodation for students with disabilities including mental health issues. No university or college can ignored this mandate and no university does. Even if you attend an online school, they have to make accommodation for you if you have some disability that would prevent you from meeting requirements in a timely manner. \n\nSo this whole thread is really quite the sham. No college or university in the US has ever ignored or downplayed legitimately diagnosed anxiety, depression, or other mental illness. The truth is, though, that we get a lot of students trying to abuse the system.\n\nFurther, both anxiety and depression are over-diagnosed in the United States where a cottage industry has been established that hands out benzodiazepines and antidepressants as if they were Pez. While I'm a big fan of properly prescribed medication, I'm not entirely sure that entering college is the right decision for a young person with a legitimate diagnosis of either of these illnesses. \n\nThe abuse of psychiatric medications on college campuses is a quiet epidemic that will eventually come to light in the popular media. Many students who don't need antidepressants seek them out for the cognitive edge they can grant; students who do legitimately need meds often stop taking them. The theft of psychiatric medication in dormitories is another major issue. \n\nIf some young person had a legitimate diagnosis of either anxiety or depression, I would urge them to take a year or two off between high school and college in order to develop good habits with their medications and to minimize reliance on medication by actively pursuing other interventions that can reduce or eliminate the need for such things (cognitive behavioral therapy does wonders for both anxiety and depression and is worth the effort; learning how to control negative thought patterns can and will alleviate a lot of problems).",

Also I\u2019m smart enough to see through what you typed. You were expecting anxious pushovers on this thread not someone with a spine.\n\nI\u2019m not bratty, I\u2019m telling the hard truth to you. It hurts I know, but you came on here and acted, to use your words \u201clike a brat\u201d\n\nAnd little girl? Really? I\u2019m 20 not three, I\u2019ve dealt with people like you for years because I was in the same spot as the other posters you responded to, and people like you love to push people around and abuse them or treat them like garbage. Do you refer to every female with a mental/neurological/learning issue/ or who is generally \u201chaving a rough time\u201d in your class like that? If you call them little girls that is a way to Infantilize people, it\u2019s another narcissistic tactic by they way, you\u2019ve been showing us you have a lot of those, you should see it but you really seem to be ignorant to it.\n\nI think your just throwing a bratty temper tantrum because you got called out on your shit behavior, and your not getting bowed down to or getting respect from people here. You\u2019re certainly not getting it from me because I don\u2019t recognize you as an authority figure, I don\u2019t have to.\n\nTo get respect you need to give it, It goes both ways. Real leaders and respectable professors/ TA\u2019s don\u2019t need to call people \u201clittle girls\u201d and \u201cdumb brats\u201d. You don\u2019t deserve respect, at least not here, and true respectable leaders don\u2019t play the vicitim, like you seem to be doing with your anger (which most of the time is hiding emotions like shame, guilt, or embarrassment)\n\nSo if respect was what your looking for, maybe you should\u2019ve thought of that at the beginning and treated people commenting here with it and had a little bit of empathy. But you didn\u2019t, you assumed, you made an arse out of yourself, and now people are calling you on it.",
