In case of an emergency, like a bad illness or a broken down car, it can be helpful and comforting to have your family not hours and hours away.

Independence does not come from being geographically far away from your parents or hometown, it\u2019s a decision to take life into your own hands. Managing school work, a social life, and any other responsibilities while not having parents constantly pointing you in the right direction is what will develop your \u201cindependence\u201d. I think you\u2019ll also realize, as I did, that it\u2019s really not as difficult as it might seem.\n\nFurthermore, there is absolutely nothing wrong with going home from time to time. There\u2019s this unhealthy idea that going away to college means not looking back, but if you have a healthy home environment and have a desire to visit from time to time, do it! Of course, yes, it\u2019ll be important especially early on to stay at school more often than not to develop relationships, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t visit family. I personally have a really strong relationship with my siblings and family in general so I enjoy going home a day here and a weekend there to spend time with them because simply put I just enjoy being around them. \n\nI\u2019m only a semester in so take this with a grain of salt, but from what I\u2019ve learned so far, Independence is a decision, not a result of leaving behind everything that is familiar. You\u2019ll become your own person and live independently if you make the decision to do so. If you still have the desire to go off and get away from everything for a while, consider doing a semester or year abroad(I would look into this regardless, honestly). But don\u2019t throw away a great opportunity just because of the stereotype that you \u201cneed\u201d to travel far away for college. You don\u2019t.

If you live on campus you will feel very independent, distance from your parents doesn't make too much of a difference when you're living and caring for yourself.\n\nDespite wanting to be as independent as possible myself having a parent who is close enough buy you groceries or take you off campus is nice. It doesn't make you any less of an adult, just makes the college experience a little more bearable.\n\nAlso if you have lots of scholarships being financially independent is an even bigger leap than moving away from your parents alone imo.
