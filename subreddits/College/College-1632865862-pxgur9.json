  "text": "So this year (since September) my collage has a new timetable. It\u2019s all over the place and one of the bigger issues is a 1 hour lesson on a Friday. Now I take the bus long distance (40mins) and my mum keeps refusing to take me just for an hour as she sees it as a waste of time and money. \n\nSo I then found a EP (extended project: basically you just write a research paper on whatever you want for 6 weeks) and at first I was told a few things by my tutor:\n\n1: I could decide when to go in for the once a month lesson \n2: most of the sources would be online \n3: it gave me 1 A level \n\nAll these things turned out to be false. It\u2019s a 6 MONTH course, I didn\u2019t get to choose and the lessons are WEEKLY with HALF an a level given. Initially I was planning to have my lesson be the Friday morning to justify making the trip and spending the money so I wasn\u2019t just going in for 1 hour.\n\nThen I was told the EP would also be a 1 hour lesson. On the one day off I get a week right smack in the difficult time period where I would have to get a bus 2 hours early, go to lesson, wait around for 2 hours then get the 40min bus home. I was also told this the night before. I called in absent and said it was due to \u201ccourse misinformation and transport issues\u201d and I have no idea how to explain to a new teacher that I desperately want to do it but I just can\u2019t make it or afford it and signed up under different pretences. I\u2019m hoping that point 2 is at least true and that I could mainly access it online and still do it. \n\nDoes anybody know how to go about this? I have adhd and get really stressed over sudden changes and confusion like this. If anybody could give me advice on what to say or honestly tell me if it comes across bad that I called out on the first day please lmk.",
