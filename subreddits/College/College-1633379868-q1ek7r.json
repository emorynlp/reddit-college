  "title:": "How do I deal with a professor who's a harsh grader?",
  "text": "My professor just gave me a zero for an assignment. She commented on the paper that I needed to pay more attention in class and understand basic news writing (I'm a journalism major taking a reporting class.) I'm guessing I'm not the only one who failed because she sent all of us an email explaining that she grades harshly because we're at the point in our college career where our work will be published and journalism is a harsh field. I had her in this class in the summer and dropped her then because she graded too harshly and would never explain why. I figured I'd just try harder in the fall. I thought I did a pretty good job. Maybe not perfect, but passable. I proof read it and made sure every name and location was correctly spelled. I don't want to drop this class since it is a requirement and this class is required for a class I need to take in the spring. I need to pass this course, but it seems like it'll be impossible to pass her classes. Most of her ratemyprofessor reviews said this too, but she\u2019s literally the only professor my school has for this course in recent semesters. What exactly should I do?",

      "text": "Meet with her and figure out what you need to do to pass muster with her. Harsh grading by itself isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing - it gets you used to high and tough standards you will inevitably face elsewhere. Meeting with her would be a first step at figuring out where you\u2019re going wrong and how you can get better.",
