  "title:": "Can I pursue a career in Physical Therapy with a bachelor's in Political Science?",
  "text": "Hello all, this past summer I have finally graduated with my degree! And my original intent after graduating was to pursue law school, seeing as how Political Science is a good major that goes along with it. Well to put things into perspective, I have begun prepping for the LSAT exam and to be frank things are not going good at all. I'm very stressed out and doing poorly on all of my practice exams. The actual exam is this November, and I'm starting to really question myself on whether or not I should pursue law? I know for a fact that tuition will cost me an arm and a leg, and there is no guarantee that I'll have a promising career from this. My mother constantly pressures me into going into law, and it's really stressful to me. And if I don't follow through then I'll essentially be disowned and viewed as a disappointment. When I was younger, I found Physical therapy to be something of interest, since I do enjoy helping people. Can I pursue such a career with my current degree? Do I have to go back to school to get a different bachelor's? Thanks all!",
