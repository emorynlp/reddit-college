I had a Spanish and computer science test last week and I studied for each a lot. Going into each test, despite probably spending a good 5 hours on each studying on top of doing all the class work and homework, I felt I was going to completely bomb them both. However, I got an 89 and 97 respectively. \n\nIt's really nice that those scores came out as well as they did, but I'm worried because not once did I have the confidence that I would be able to pass either. When I talked to classmates after each I said with sincerity that I believed I failed them both until I got my scores back.\n\nHow do you guys manage checking your progress to see if you are ready for a test?", "author": "Hephaestus103", "created": 1632620254, "retrieved": 1632945974, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heapuuo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvk4f4/anyone_else_not_able_to_tell_if_they_are_getting/heapuuo/", "text": "Look up the Dunning Kruger effect, it seems relevant here.", "author": "AceyAceyAcey", "created": 1632623220, "upvotes": 1}}}
