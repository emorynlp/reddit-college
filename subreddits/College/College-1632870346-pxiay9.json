After zoom classes, online speeches and online exams I just lack motivation to study and put forth effort. I am trying my best but I\u2019m not dealing with the stress well at all. Anxiety has been worse with exams this week and next and I\u2019m just counting down till I get a break. I don\u2019t know how I did my hardest semester in person pre covid, it seems like something I could never do now. \n\nDoes anyone else relate? I\u2019ve been seeing people say covid hurt them in terms of grades but I couldn\u2019t feel more the opposite.", "author": "israelipita", "created": 1632870346, "retrieved": 1632945350, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"hepdc9y": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxiay9/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_adjusting_to_in/hepdc9y/", "text": "Weirdly my profs are still conducting online exams despite in person classes. Honestly I\u2019d rather have unlimited time for an in person exam compared to a short time for an online exam. In general I really dislike online exams even though I know they tend to be popular with students. However, I think it\u2019s more of a false sense of security thing because usually you don\u2019t have much time to look at notes so I doubt average scores are much higher.", "author": "lovingtolive", "created": 1632909169, "upvotes": 3}, "hep12x8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxiay9/anyone_else_having_a_hard_time_adjusting_to_in/hep12x8/", "text": "I'm a junior and this semester has been the absolute worst time of my academic career.
