I\u2019m the type of person who gets tired of talking and interacting after an hour. I have close friends (like 7 of them) but i get this awful feeling that its a bad idea to not socialize.

Yes, you can choose to not socialize. Should you however? I would say no. There have been a few times where my friends in my classes had helped me tremendously. Without their help, I would not have done so well.
