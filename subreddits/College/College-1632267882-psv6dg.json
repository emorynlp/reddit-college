We\u2019re in a double and she\u2019s on vc with her boyfriend for at least 4-5 hours a night. She\u2019s so loud. She\u2019s gotten a little better since I talked to her but she\u2019s just rude. She\u2019s yelled \u201cthis is why I said you\u2019re a closet gay\u201d to her boyfriend multiple times when I have pride flags on my desk. She MOANS sometimes for him. She changes her laugh and sneeze to sound \u201ccuter\u201d for him. And her fake laugh is so obnoxious. When I try to vc with my friends they get concerned about how loud she is. She barely ever leaves the room, even for classes. She\u2019s generally pretty nice to me but all those issues are making me hate her a little. Does anyone have any advice? Or am I just overreacting. Ive been wearing headphones so much to drown her out that my ears hurt all the time.", "author": "lavenderliv", "created": 1632267882, "retrieved": 1632946597, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "comments": {"hdt0uhu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psv6dg/how_do_i_deal_with_a_horrible_roommate/hdt0uhu/", "text": "I think that since she\u2019s nice to you \u2014don\u2019t ruin that.
