  "text": "I'm a 22 year old junior in college and it just sucks that everyone I graduated with in high school already graduated college last year.\n\nI most likely have ADHD and am getting evaluated in December (finally), bc I feel like I just can't get myself to listen in lecture or physically get myself to do any assignment. I'm most likely going to fail 1-2 classes (mind you I'm taking 4 classes). Its even messing with my work flow at the office.\n\nSo now I'm probably looking at being a 7 year student. Maybe I'm just pressured by societal expectations. I was initially supposed to be a doctor by 25 but now that looks like 28. I feel like time is slipping through my hands. I feel like I'm behind.",
