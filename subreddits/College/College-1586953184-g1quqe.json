Two reasons -- one about short-term finances and one about long-term economics. First, the short term. I (a university staff member) was on an email reviewing the costs of developing/supporting hundreds of new online classes and dealing with COVID generally: it was an unplanned cost of more than $20 million for my medium sized school. There's always a worthwhile debate about how a school should use its budget, but on January 1 this year, every dollar already had its spot in the budget and then suddenly two months later millions had to be reassigned just to keep the institution safe and running and to provide some simulacrum of an education. So for this semester, the answer to \"should universities be cheaper\" is no, simply because they can't.\n\n(In case someone mentions endowments, etc., I can talk about some reasons they aren't great options for addressing these costs.)\n\nThe second, long-term reason is the same economics that are going to kill a lot of businesses with fixed costs: all income streams are going to be hammered and schools are going to have to make guesses as to which streams can be maintained. Universities revenues are tuition/fees, investment returns, real estate (spaces they own but lease to others), intellectual property, grants, and donations. Investments (thus endowments) are tanking, foundations and government are making fewer and smaller grants, and donors have less money to give. Unfortunately that leaves tuition...it's not a matter of what's fair at this point, it's a matter of \"How do we balance the books enough that we can promise students there will be school at all next year?\"\n\nSo to be clear. Some of you are currently at schools that will fail in the next few years, maybe less, if we don't have a very quick recovery. (If you're at a small liberal arts college with a small or heavily restricted endowment, you need to finish your degree yesterday.) Most of you are at schools that will survive but don't have the option to cut tuition. A small number of you are at schools that theoretically *could* cut tuition, but they'll be loathe to because they currently have no idea how to value those other revenue streams.", "author": "dcgrey", "created": 1587000834, "upvotes": 2}, "fnjfoj0": {"link": "/r/college/comments/g1quqe/since_most_schools_are_now_online_should_they_be/fnjfoj0/", "text": "Most of my classes from my first degree were online.

Also at my school if there is enough kids enrolled (above 45) the professor gets a portion of the $75 fee per student which is interesting to say the least.\n\nAnother issue is if the professor actually teaches, at my current school I only have had 1 online class out of 5 where the professor has put in the time to make audio recordings or PowerPoint's. The other 4 classes have just been read the textbook (teach yourself) and do weekly discussions and hand in assignments. I would like there to be a discount if we are basically teaching ourselves because it's frustrating to pay full tuition to read a textbook on our own.
