One argument my mom pointed to was when there was an outbreak of swine flu in the 70s and because the vaccine was rushed, a bunch of kids ended up getting sick. \n\nIdk how true it is but you could look into it. If anybody brings this up know that was 50 years ago. Nowadays we have much better research.",
