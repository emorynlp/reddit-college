  "title:": "[Academic Misconduct] HELP!! Private Conversation Recorded",
  "text": "Hello r/college!\n\nI'm right now extremely scared and worried because somebody with whom I've had a conflict with in the past slipped an audio device into my room from under the door and captured my friend and I talking about a problem set and then reported me.  This person does not live in my room, was not in the room, and neither of us knew of this.  We thought that the conversation was acceptable, but the student sent it to the professor and they found that it wasn't (overstepping in what we talked about).  It's against both the school policy and the state law here to record like that, but right now the evidence has been passed to the office of Academic Misconduct.  There was no evidence found of any cheating or copying-answers (because as I said, we were trying to be responsible about it, and we were), and so all of the charges made are based this recording. What should I do? Is it okay that I am about to be tried on evidence that was obtained unlawfully? \n\nI'm so scared right now because my whole future is on the line. I'm going to have to rethink everything depending on how this goes, as I was interested in medicine. Anyway, I would appreciate any advice.",
