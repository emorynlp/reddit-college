  "text": "I am pretty close to graduating with a double major & a good GPA. But if I could go back in time I would have never gone to college. I really don't know why I went or what good it has done me? I have a lot debt. Even with degrees that would be considered \"strong.\" I'm still having trouble justifying everything. I also think college changed me negatively in other ways, I am a lot more negative then I used to be for example. Shit sucks. \n\nJust consider whether college is really right for you before you go... It was not for me.",

      "text": "I'll give you the opposite perspective. I actually came back to college. \n\nI'm a smart guy and worked my way up the pay scale pretty quick. Always capped out at businesses about a year or two in. I was making pretty good money at times. \n\nI was also beating the shit out of my body. I was working mostly with people who'd either been to jail or prison, illegal immigrants and most these guys did drugs at work. The hours were 10 hours of STANDING on concrete floors moving thousands of pounds of parts from the CNC router to pallets. \n\nJobs for the uneducated are fucking horrible. You exchange the condition of your body for pay. Your mind isn't making you money at these places. I was working with primarily uneducated people, even in management. None of them knew what they were doing. None of them understood anything. \n\nI've kind of established in my head that there's roughly two kinds of workers: Thinkers and Doers. The doers LOVE working hard all day, LOVE overtime and generally take their injuries as some sort of pride. They exist and the industries really really need them. They don't use their brains much, they use their hands. \n\nOn the other side are thinkers. Thinkers use their brains and skills to improve things. They don't excel at working hard for crazy hours because \"work smarter, not harder\". In certain industries, there's hardly a need for any of these people. I think some businesses are just set up in a way that keeps them from really spending the money for the thinkers. \n\nMonetary debt is so much easier to manage than body problems. I'd take 20k in debt over the back problems I've caused myself by working laborious jobs.",
