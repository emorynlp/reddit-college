I am not just paying to learn, but I am paying for the material as well and so I like to download everything that is offered to us through canvas in case I ever want to look back at what I learned or want to look something up. But also, I pay to be exposed to new material and view it as my property too. Just like if a prof hands out paper readings or worksheets that are yours to keep, online material is yours as well so you might as well save everything allocated over the semester of learning.
