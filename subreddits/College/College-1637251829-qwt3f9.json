  "text": "I'm a senior wrapping up my fall semester. I'm a communications major, science minor. I'm doing really well in my 400 level classes, but there's this one course... oceanography. EES 200. I picked it up as an elective because I had the professor before and loved his other class.\n\nIt's absolutely killing me. I'm barely passing this guy's exams. I got a 69.3, 54, and a 71.5. He has four exams, if you go to all 4, he drops the lowest one. \n\nI'm really not doing too hot mentally and I've got a lot on my plate. I'm also doing the notes for his powerpoints right now and I'm on page 4 of notes and only 2 slides into his second presentation. \n\nDude goes through chapters extremely fast and it's much more material than I'm being handed in my 400 level classes. \n\nI've already pass/failed the class, and my average exam grade if I don't go to this exam will be a ~64% which will be 60% of my final grade. I have at least an 87% total for my in-class assignments which are worth 15% of the total grade. My final cumulative exam is worth 25% and I haven't taken it yet.\n\nShould I skip it and save my mental health for the day or do I force myself to go and see what happens? I can't really imagine doing better than the 54 at this point and as I'm sure many other juniors and seniors are, I'm feeling incredibly burnt out and dead inside. Plus I have a 5-7 page research paper I have to get started on.",

          "text": "That's probably what I'll end up doing. No harm in trying. Just thinking there's no reason a 200 level class should be this hard. The whole class is barely passing and the guy does very little extra credit. \n\nThank you, though. It helps to hear it laid out in much simpler and gentler than I've been telling myself",
