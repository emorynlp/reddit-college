I don't know if this is a normal thing for colleges and universities to do, but here they don't supply us with detailed answers. Only half of the exercises have an answer, and it is always without derivation. I know they want us to work it out for ourselves, and thus really bolster our understanding on a topic. \n\nBut sometimes I really get stuck, and would like to know the derivation of the solution. I do realize that knowing the solution spoils the question a bit, but my reasoning was that; after seeing *how* a solution is derived, it may help with future exercises of the same caliber. Is there any merit to this kind of thought, or is it better to struggle to find it yourself?", "author": "TMWJZ", "created": 1632420464, "retrieved": 1632946157, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdzsggf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu12af/is_it_beneficial_to_also_study_solutions/hdzsggf/", "text": "Absolutely, if you get stuck honestly just look at the solution.
