  "title:": "How do you find a job after graduating???",
  "text": "I graduated in spring, had an internship in Chicago that I had to travel 4 hours (round trip for), and now I CANNOT find a job!!!\n\nI graduated summa cum laude, I graduated 2 years early, and I'm better in my field than most of the alumni I graduated with. \n\nI know that I can exceed at any job in my field, but they all require 3-5 years of experience. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET THAT??? I've used up all of my savings. Am I supposed to just keep taking 3 month internships until I've got 3 years of experience? It makes me so sad to think I have to work for free when I know I'm highly skilled in my field. There also aren't any internships close to me, and if I did another one, I'd still have to take the train to Chicago every day!\n\nPlease, give me hope ! I'm applying for graduate programs next year, but if my job search is a glimpse at how my applications are looked at, I'm kind of ready to give up before I start. I was planning on building up my savings before grad school, but I guess if I even get in, I'll be even worse than I am now.",

      "text": "That\u2019s exactly my experience! Every single job I\u2019ve looked at has been emphasising on wanting candidates with 3-5 years of experience even for so called \u201centry-level positions\u201d and graduate level jobs, which makes no sense as most graduates would only have 1 year max of internship experience. otherwise - they\u2019ll pay you peanuts or openly subject you to corporate exploitation. \n\nIt\u2019s very much down to luck - I know people think luck doesn\u2019t exist, but you need luck on top of an intelligent and resourceful CV. \n\nFor me I kinda gave up, so I\u2019m running my own business and doing side investments instead. I know that\u2019s not possible for everyone but I gave up trying to be an employee.",

My job was originally for someone with more experience than me but pivoted due to COVID and because of my experience -- but they were interested in interviewing before the COVID chanfes happened.",
