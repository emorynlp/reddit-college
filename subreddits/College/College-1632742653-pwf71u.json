  "text": "I\u2019m in college and have like half an idea of what I want as a career but there\u2019s nothing that I really actually feel passionate about yet\u2026 it stresses me out not knowing what to aim for or what direction to walk in. Anyone relate?\n\nIs there anything that made you realize what career you wanted? Anything you are passionate about? Why are you passionate about it?",

      "text": "At first I wanted to keep my options open and was good at math so I chose statistics as I could apply stats to different fields. Then I started working in healthcare too. I really liked the work I was doing and the environment made me feel important. So I decided to go for biostats eventually (although I have a feeling this will change).\n\nOf course, there are steps and other careers that I will qualify for too though. I\u2019m a double major in stats and med lab science (my work was in a lab/hospital). I only double majored because the credits took up my elective credits. And biostats requires a masters degree. So I kept my options open and am aiming in a general direction. I\u2019ll probably worry more about it when I have to apply for my masters. But in general, I know I can get a fun job that I\u2019d enjoy",

      "text": "I researched different career paths and picked one that sounded interesting to me and met other criteria (adequately high paying, a good number of jobs in the field, only required a bachelor's degree). I then interned in a related field between my junior and senior year, liked that experience, and accepted a full-time job offer to stay in that field. I've been out of college for nearly nine years now and have never worked in the field I majored in. \n\nLots of my friends have had similar experiences, in that they ended up doing something pretty different than what they thought they would be doing when they originally picked their major. My friend who earned an anthropology degree is now working as a case worker for refugees. My friend who earned a biochemistry degree has worked in quality for a cosmetics company and a beer manufacturer despite original plans to do something related to pathology.  \n\nYou don't have to plan out your entire career while you're in college, and even if you did, having a plan doesn't mean much. You can't control which jobs are available around the time you graduate, which companies will invite you for an interview, or which companies will extend you a job offer. Ultimately, most graduating college seniors apply for a broad set of jobs and accept their first or second job offer.  \n\nAdditionally, don't think you need to feel passionate about your career path in order to like your work or find it rewarding. It's fine to choose a college major and intended career path for pragmatic reasons, like you think you might be good at a certain type of work and that sort of work is well-paid. Not everyone is going to feel passionate about a particular career field, and you can't really know whether you'll like working as a nurse, data scientist, civil engineer, or English teacher until you actually start working. \n\nYour first job out of college will help you decide if you want to stay in that field or pursue something else, so it's not a big deal if you pursue X career and then change your mind after a few years of working.",

Take as many different classes from different fields as early as you can.",
