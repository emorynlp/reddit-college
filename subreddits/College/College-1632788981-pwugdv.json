We've been having a lot of parties and exchanges with sororities, but I find it difficult to talk to girls in a more than friends way. Like don't get me wrong, I have a lot of rly rly close friends that are girls, but i really don't know how to make a move on girls or even talk to them in a more than friends way (I've never hooked up with anyone). Apparently, at our last party, my friend even told me there were a lot of girls around me for a long time who seemed interested, but I just didn't pick up on it, and as a result didn't go for any one of them. How do i talk to girls at these parties? I've heard the generic \"be yourself,\" but I would really appreciate some concrete advice on this. It's not like I'm ugly or anything; I just don't really know how to talk to these girls.", "author": "Busy-Pineapple9453", "created": 1632788981, "retrieved": 1632945545, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "comments": {"heksk4a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwugdv/how_to_talk_to_girls/heksk4a/", "text": "We're really not all that complicated to interact with.
