  "text": "For context/background: I'm a first-year student so these classes are all intro levels ( Bio, Comp Sci, Philosophy, Linear Algebra, Spanish). I guess my concern is, this is my first time having 5 classes and the transitioning from online to in-person classes plus first time living with the dorms so am not sure how these factors are going to affect me or if it ever does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the sched, I basically tried to put everything in Mon-Wed so I could get a breathing or free time to get things done for the rest of the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts or advice? Thank you in advance!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/54r8u2zztl081.png?width=1731&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8ec4cd7d2776ef49e4f24deabb3516f8d4e4a20",
