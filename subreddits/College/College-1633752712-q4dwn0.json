  "title:": "So.......I kinda failed my first math midterm......",
  "text": "Long story short, I failed my math midterm. First year in uni and I already blew my first exam. Well I didn't technically fail it cause I got a 10% mark deducted because I submitted late, so really I got a 58% which is higher than average, but I gotta be honest, this is a good wake up call, not sure if anyone likes being woken up this way, but I'm awake now. Heading forward, I will be doing everything that is necessary to nail this course and university in general. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're confused by what point I'm trying to make, or what this post is really about, I don't know either. But, I know a lot of people have just gone through what I have, and I just wanna say, if you're in your first year, and you make a mistake on the first exam, don't think this is how the entirety of uni will be like. This may sound weird coming from a guy who just failed (technically passed) his first midterm, but this ain't the end. It can't be.\n\nTake care lads, and good luck on your exams!!!",

At least for me, I don't learn well that way if I can't see the big picture of what is going on. The simple fact is that memorizing formulas and procedures isn't that impressive anymore anyways, as computers can do those things faster and better than a human ever could. However, getting to the correct answer quickly is still the measure of success in math, but that only mattered in the days before computers when the computers themselves were human. Professors just refuse to adapt.",

I had studied for three days prior, but really my studying was more like teaching myself the material rather than review.\n\nTurns out I did do better than expected, but it\u2019s motivated me to change how I study for my class. After each lecture I\u2019m now doing practice problems to reinforce what I\u2019ve learned. Even on days where I don\u2019t have the mental capacity to tolerate the work form my other classes, I supplement it by doing more math problems. \n\nSo far I feel pretty good on what I know. Just keep doing math problems until the material is engrained in your head. And make sure when you study for an exam, it is a review and not a lesson.",
