  "text": "I\u2019ve broken/dented every water bottle I have because I have a tendency to run on campus, and when I mean run I mean SPRINT. It\u2019s fun and it substitutes for my workout some days. The issue is that generally all the backpacks I own don\u2019t necessarily have a very strong net system for the water bottle. Does anyone have any backpack suggestions for a better water bottle security?\n\nAlso if anyone has good durable water bottle suggestions that would be great too (I prefer metal or glass, no plastic please)",

      "text": "This is more of a hiking/travel daypack but it has the best pocket for a water bottle in any backpack I own and has enough room if you don\u2019t carry a ton of large books. The center pocket (in the middle back) actually fits a tall hydro flask water bottle perfectly, keeps it upright, and keeps it very secure. It\u2019s not easy to pop in and out while walking, but you won\u2019t drop it. [Deuter Speed Light 20](https://www.deuter.com/us-en/shop/backpacks/p225711-hiking-backpack-speed-lite-20) (see the pic with the gloves coming out of the pocket, that pocket is really deep)\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what that pocket is even designed for, but it works perfectly.",
