  "title:": "Does this seem like a bit much?",
  "text": "Today we( the entire class) learned that in one week we have a semester paper due. \nThis paper is 10-14 pages long. Plus it must have a lit review as well as an annotated bibliography. We must have 7 sources. \n\nAdditionally, we ( the same entire class) learned today that we need to have a  discourse analysis and textual analysis of two different pieces of media turned in on the same day as the semester paper. \n\nDoes this  seem like a bit much?\n\nNote. Our Professor is retired (emiritus) and since the semester started I have suspected early signs of dementia due to certain behaviors and what seems to be a forgetful nature.",

Additionally, the main textbook is unavailable to half the class. His solution was to place his copy in the library where we can share it.",
