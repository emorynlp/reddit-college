Of my 5 close friends from  high school 2 just aren\u2019t the same, 1 has a job far away and 2 have girlfriends that they have to do literally everything with, which is fine but gets annoying when they literally won\u2019t go anywhere without them. All while I\u2019m working 40 hour weeks. Summer sucks.",

The girl I was very close to in high school and even went on an out of country trip with, is at the same college as me and we NEVER see each other since she joined a frat, she's in a different major and has her own friend group and community. The only time we see each other is when we're back home for breaks and then it's just awkward. I don't know anything happening in her life, she's always texting her friends, she has different problems and stresses than I do and we've just kinda grown apart with sucks. I don't tell her anything about my life, especially because she doesn't usually listen and goes for the \"yeah... right.. oh... yeah\" approach when I'm telling her something and then completely forgets the next time I bring it up. Things and people are different once you go away to college, it's just a part of life.",

I guess where I was trying to go with this is once college kicks in, everyone starts doing their own thing and it isn't your fault, but I would try to keep in touch with those who you were close to though understand if some are being distant.\n\nOn the other hand I recently picked up skating and have started to learn how to ride somewhat decently.

The hardest thing for me is seeing my friends become more who they are going to be as adults. My dumb friends have only got dumber, racist friends got only more racist and humble friends started working high paying jobs that have made them arrogant and judgemental. Its not easy growing up but the best thing you can do is keep a level head and continue learning.",
