I can\u2019t really complain because to some extent this is what I wanted and I am still paying for this school(plus I truly do want to go here and graduate from this place) so it\u2019s my responsibility to live up to the expectations that they provide to me if I want to earn that degree(hence their 60% graduation rate) but Idk, such is life I guess.",

Why did I think leaving any class at 10pm was something I could do without a Redbull?\n\n2. I commute. I'm home around 11pm from school on Mondays now. Its shit. 10/10 do not recommend. \n\nArcheology was earlier in the week so I went to that the first week. Then next day, I went to the bookstore. My astro required textbooks were well over $300. \n\nThe archeology professor required like one $25 book and a textbook that ran around $80... cheaper used/ online.\n\nAfter 3 hours in one night class & seeing that astro would run me more than 3x the amount as arch, I didn't even have to meet the professor. I dropped it before the first meeting. \n\nI always liked archeology a lot more anyway. It's exhausting in a 3 hour lecture & the professor story tells instead of lecturing (more fun for class, but worse for exams)... but now that I read about everyone else's Astro experiences, I am so thankful. At least it's Monday & done & I'm not scrapping by with a C, wondering why it's nothing like watching Cosmos. I do not need my only non major class to overwhelm me with work, I have the 3 classes I need As in for that.\n\n\nYaayyyyy for avoiding all that is intro to astronomy.",
