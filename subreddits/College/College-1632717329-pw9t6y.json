  "text": "I'm a 29M with a Bachelor's degree that I got in 2014. \n\nI'm an alcoholic and I went to rehab a couple times and have gotten the opportunity to \"start fresh\" twice now. By that I mean I left rehab, moved into a low cost sober home, got a food service job, and had time to think about what I wanted to do next. \n\nThis last time around in 2019 I decided to go back for an additional degree through a low cost program and with financial aid. I took to school really well and was working food service and had the time for school. \n\nIn late 2020 once school were fully remote I decided to apply for a job that paid better and had insurance. It was a full time remote position at a major company and I took to that really well and stopped focusing on school as much, but figured I could complete my classes and work full time with both being remote. My school also went to self paced and so there were no longer live virtual classes for me to attend. \n\nI ended up getting a substantial promotion at work and it really became my focus. I fit in well at work and love what we are doing and my new role and feel like I am thriving. My interest in school completely dropped off. \n\nI should also mention my degree path is very difficult, and of the 30 that started in fall 2019 we are at about 5 remaining students. I am currently the furthest along in our program as well for what it's worth. \n\nJuggling these two lives has been very difficult. Even when I decide to relax after a busy day at work I always feel the looming shadow of school over my head due to the self paced nature. I procrastinate and feel awful and then have weekends full of additional work. I'm not happy with this and I constantly feel like I need to be working and it is really starting to drain me and my schoolwork is not progressing at the levels needed to truly be a professional in the field. And after all I've learned, I'm not so sure I truly want to be a professional in that field. \n\nI decided tonight that I am going to withdraw from the program. I will be able to pay off all my school fees and loans within the next 6 months no problem and I'm just going to walk away. \n\nI have no regrets. I learned a lot at school and it was really important to me for a while. It gave me ambition and a sense of purpose. I never would have known that I would land a job I was good at that paid well and get a promotion and find this new path in life so I don't feel silly quitting now. \n\nGoing forward, I will be able to work my 40 hours and then have a normal life. I won't feel like I need to be burning the candle at both ends. I'm working too hard to be this stressed and unhappy. \n\nI'm not saying that dropping out is a good path for everyone. Find the truth in your heart and follow that. I just wanted to share for anyone else in a similar situation and to help myself process these emotions.",
