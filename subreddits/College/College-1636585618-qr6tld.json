  "title:": "My Roommate is Messing with my Mail",
  "text": "So recently my roommate started moving around my stuff without my permission, claiming it was taking up space despite it being at my desk and he always leaves stuff in the middle of the room or the bathroom walkway for me to trip over. I've asked him numerous times to cut this out while also pointing out his own flaws, yet he always ignores me and tells me that my thoughts and feelings don't matter. Whenever I move my stuff back to where it was, he always moves it somewhere else. Recently I put some unopened mail on top of the stuff he would always move, yet he moved my stuff and my mail anyways. Granted he didn't look inside my mail but my girlfriend still tells me that what he did is a federal offense anyways. Could he actually get in trouble for doing that?",

      "text": "Its a federal offense if he steals, destroys, or opens it without your consent, but no what he's doing isn't that. It's just childish behavior that he can't get punished for but you should really try to move out if your lease is only for this semester to somewhere else before this escalates.",

          "text": "I hope either he's only here for this semester or that I can request a room switch once the next semester starts. For now I have stayed at my girlfriend's house a few times but I don't want to stay there since I don't want to disturb her father's work. However, would it be illegal on his part if I left the mail opened but nothing taken out of the envelopes and he moved them? I'm not ever going to claim he opened them to anyone, but will that still change anything?",

              "text": "No, if the mail is already opened and he moves it that would be very hard to prove any misconduct happened if all of the contents are there. But yeah the only hope you have is elevating the issue with your RA. Don't say its a simple issue with the mail, disrespecting someone's boundaries and personal possessions will eventually lead to even worse conflict. If your RAs refuse to listen, go up the chain to the boss of the RA. Email your RA and CC their boss/office by the way, just talking to them will do nothing and emails are a future receipt to use if they fail their duty.",
