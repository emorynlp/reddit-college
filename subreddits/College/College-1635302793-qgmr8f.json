  "title:": "Graduate Early or No (I have to decide by Friday and I don\u2019t know)",
  "text": "I (20F) don\u2019t know if I should graduate college early (I\u2019m in my 3rd year in college and can graduate). I play D1 volleyball for TCU and I found out a couple days ago that I have 17 hours left to graduate. I am kinda done with volleyball but I don\u2019t want to regret not playing all 4 years. I want to go to grad school so it would be nice to be able to start working on my PhD early and to not have to pay another year at tcu (scholarships help but it\u2019s still expensive). I missed the deadline to apply for my dream grad school but I could go to a different one that I also like and play my senior year of volleyball there. I\u2019m also in a long distance relationship and the grad schools I\u2019m looking at are near my boyfriend. I can give more detail if necessary but I really don\u2019t know what to do.",

      "text": "I don't really see any reason not to graduate. If the main concern is playing another year of volleyball, and you can do that at grad school, then what are you losing by moving on with your life? Saving lots of money and living closer to your boyfriend seem like significant benefits, and there's almost no downside.",

          "text": "Hey! Thank you and you\u2019re pretty much right haha. To clarify, some of my worries about graduating early are missing out on senior year fun and not being able to apply to my dream school which I would be able to do if I didn\u2019t graduate early (but I could always transfer there!) so I think you\u2019re right- thank you!",
