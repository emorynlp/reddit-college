I probably had that much weed and more plus about 91 hits of LSD. The acid is what really got me. But the entire experience of getting expelled is really sucky because they make you go through this bullshit process to make sure you've had a chance to \"defend yourself.\" It's not like you get a letter and you're automatically expelled like in some TV shows and movies. He asked me a series of questions and he was recording the entire thing. It's rough deciding if you should answer or not because the courts do have the option of subpoenaing the tapes. I didn't answer most of them because I didn't see the point. They don't take anything else into consideration and just want to beat the courts to see if you are guilty or not. At the end he said we can either have an \"informal decision\" where he expels me or we take some sort of \"college court\" where a faculty member, a student, and someone else from the college judge if I am guilty or not. I didn't see any point in wasting time so I just chose to get expelled. \n\nHowever tell your roommate that there is hope. I was hit with some strong charges (first degree felony among them) but today I am on probation. Don't listen to all these idiots saying he's going to prison. He will most likely get probation since it's a first offense. \n\nFinally, other schools will accept you even after an expulsion. I'm going to SHSU right now on my last semester.
