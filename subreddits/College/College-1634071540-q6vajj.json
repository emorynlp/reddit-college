  "text": "I'm majoring in civil engineering and am taking 18 credits this semester, including an Honor class. I absolutely hate it. I love the construction industry, and I really thought I'd enjoy my major. I enjoy the classes like civil engineering materials, but that is about it. I hate the physics, the calculus, and literally every single class I am taking this semester, and not just because it is hard. If I could at least understand it and it was time consuming, I'd be fine, but I am utterly overwhelmed and just plain hate it all. It sucks. I really don't know what to do. I just want to give up, but at the same time I don't. I know I can't do this anymore. I failed one class semester, barely passed the rest, and barely passed any of my classes in the Fall semester last year. I thought it might get better this year, but so far it still sucks. Sure, it is a little better, but it pretty much sucks just the same. I don't want to give up, though, not after all the money my father and I have put into my college education. In addition, my grandfather went to the same school and majored in civil engineering, too, and I don't want to disappoint him. Still, though, I fucking hate this, I have barely any friends, last year a my Calculus II teacher falsely accused me of cheating (and its still on my record), I am struggling and completely overwhelmed with the course work/load, and I just want to give up and quit absolutely everything.",

      "text": "If you are able to drop 1 course then i would do so, so then 18 units or credits becomes maybe 15 or 14 or whatever. If you can then DO IT, if your college allows you to and you dont have to take that many units then DO IT.\n\nThere should be a civil engineers club or just any engineer club at your college. I would look into that or some hobby clubs to try and make some friends.\n\nLike i said, if you can drop 1 course from your workload and see if that improves anything then good. I know this is a retarded question but are you putting enough time into studying, or at least do you feel youre putting enough time in?",

          "text": "Thank you, and for your question, it's not stupid at all. I definitely do not put in nearly enough time into studying, not because I waste my time, but because all of my time is spent attempting to get the work done for all of my classes and then I just don't have nearly enough time spare to spent actually understanding and studying the material, leaving me having no idea what I am even doing, if that makes sense.",
