I graduated into the 2008 recession, so I feel some kinship with COVID graduates.\n\nWhen I felt the same creeping sense of dread about graduating, I asked my professors what to do. They told me two things:\n\n1) You'll figure it out \n\n2) You'll be okay\n\nI've spent a lot of time thinking about what I wish they would've told me. They were right and wrong. I am okay, and I have figured some things out--but what they didn't tell me was how hard and un-okay many things would be, how hard the figuring. \n\nOne of the first things I realized as a recent graduate is how everyone at college cares for you, from your advisors to the dorm cooks. They want you to succeed, either because they're paid to do so or because they're just kind. But the \"real world\" is not college; people are paid for many other things and generally don't give a shit about you, even when you're struggling in plain sight. They've got their own struggles.\n\nIt was a sad realization. It was also important, because I realized that I'm a person who cares no matter what. Maybe that's why it was so hard for me, but it also gave me information. It's been over ten years (yikes lol) but I've done caring work (teaching, tutoring) that I love more than anything. I have friends whose caring inspires me, and who I trust to take care of me. The tough transitions keep coming--you do not graduate into an adult, get married, have kids, and fuck off--but I've lived through enough of them to remember, to remind myself how alive toughness makes me feel. And even when it's tough, there are always okay moments if you look for them.\n\nI'm not going to tell you you'll be okay and that you'll figure everything out. I don't know! Maybe you'll fall off the edge of the Grand Canyon trying to get a good selfie. Maybe you'll never figure out math because you have dyscalculia like me. Oh well. It would also be boring if okayness and wisdom were guaranteed. What I put my faith in is your inherent weirdness, whatever you can't stop yourself from doing, the things some people hate about you but that your friends (and you) love. Because everyone has those things. Cling to them, worship them, protect them, and they'll keep you okayed and figured. \n\nAnd even if you forget about and abandon those things, don't fear. The most precious parts of you will always be safe somewhere, waiting for you.", "author": "brownidegurl", "created": 1618378186, "upvotes": 3}, "gugcai6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mq78fu/sad_about_graduating/gugcai6/", "text": "I graduated last May, and I had the same apprehensions as you and a lot of the seniors in this thread. I\u2019ve always been socially awkward, and I would sometimes marvel at the fact that I\u2019d even managed to find friends in college. Add the pandemic on top of that and it didn\u2019t look good.\n\nHaving now been out of college for a little under a year, I can tell you that recent college grads are just as eager for the same kinds of friendships as college students are. You\u2019ll probably have to go more out of your way to find those people in the first place \u2014 but once you find them, it\u2019s *mostly* the same situation as college. In my case I was lucky in that I found those people among my coworkers, but for you it might be in a local group or club, or through a hobby. Not going to go into this too much more, but there are a lot of threads around the internet where people ask how to make friends as an adult, and they\u2019re often full of really helpful advice.\n\nI won\u2019t say it\u2019s entirely the same. The most important difference is that you have to be more intentional about your friendships and spending time with people, since you can\u2019t count on just seeing your friends in class or at your usual spot in the dining hall. That\u2019s definitely a skill I struggled to learn at first, and I\u2019m not going to say I have it down now, because I don\u2019t. But it will vastly improve your post-college social life.\n\nTl;dr: The transition out of college is definitely hard, but there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t have the same kind of friendship and community you had in college after graduating. It\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s 100% possible, and it\u2019s worth it.", "author": "secondpriceauctions", "created": 1618374535, "upvotes": 3}, "gug34l6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mq78fu/sad_about_graduating/gug34l6/", "text": "It\u2019s like when you first went off from highschool and then came to college- everything will be ok.

You will keep a few friends and they will be quality friends, quality over quantity. After school everyone thrives in different jobs in different locations and it takes more energy to keep up with people when they don\u2019t live in the same town, or even state anymore. The people that I still keep up with are people I want in my life for awhile. \n\nStart saving for a car or a trip or something that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford to do in college.
