  "text": "Hey all! I\u2019m in my first year and I have fallen so behind in all of my classes. I find it incredibly hard to focus on my schoolwork and stay on top of things. Do you guys have any tips? I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything besides getting meds (context, both me and my parents think I have ADHD but I haven\u2019t been formally diagnosed).",

      "text": "I did all of my work at school in either a lounge or the library. This helped me focus on the task at hand. It was also nice that when I went home, I knew it was my time to rest. I would chip away at stuff in small sections when I could. So, in between classes or while eating lunch/dinner I would read something, do some review, or do an assignment. Also, make a list (I prefer paper) and cross shit out when you are done with it. It is satisfying and makes things feel less overwhelming when you can just see what you have. I was a forensic science major and packed all of my main lecture/lab science classes into 2 years plus I worked full time. Figure out what is best for you. I, personally, read the powerpoints and made notes during the lectures about what prof said. Never read a textbook in my life unless I had an assignment in it BUT that is what worked FOR ME. It took me two years to figure out what worked best for my brain. You can do it!",

I also keep a to do list of everything I need to do, school and normal life stuff. Also if there\u2019s a HW assignment I REALLY don\u2019t want to do I\u2019ll just read over the assignment and not answer anything",

      "text": "Parent here.  A few tips:\n\nFigure out your daily/weekly energy flow.  Are you a morning person?  Do you work better at night?  Do you want to like to go out in weekends?  \n\nUse a planner.  Make sure it's one that works well for your personality... Paper, electronic, simple, complex....whatever works best for you.  Write down your appointments, due dates, and To Do lists.  Look at your planner daily.  Don't use your planner to overwhelm yourself.. be reasonable about your abilities.\n\nOn average, for each hour in classes, a student should plan on spending 2-3 hours on schoolwork and/or studying outside of class.  Plan your time accordingly.  Adjust up or down as needed.\n\nOne good time saving idea is to pack your bag each morning for the entire day, spend your time between classes studying in quiet locations on campus, and not return to your room/home until evening.  If you spend around 8 hours a day, each weekday, on campus working on schoolwork, that will get your pretty far.\n\nPut your phone and social media on Do Not Disturb when studying and in class.",
