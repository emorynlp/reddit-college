  "text": "Currently in my Junior year and im taking 2 AP courses, last year I took 1 AP course as it was the only one avaliable, but im taking these for college, my goal is to graduate a year early and so Im trying to get as much college credit as possible, but, first semester I have a D in one of the AP classes and an A in another. I gave myself a couple weeks to bring it up but it dosnt seems to be going up despite my good work and grades, so if I drop it what can I do to make up for the college credit I won't get there? Anything over the summer?",

You could even use the experience of dropping a class and learning to be more in tune to your body's needs and mental health as the basis of your awesome college essays.",

                      "text": "Most states offer dual enrollment free for a certain number of hours. Deadlines for the spring term are getting close so ask really soon. Ea.asu.edu is open enrollment, but it costs you $425 and your high school might not take it for credit, but you can get it just for college credit. Good part is only the $25 is upfront and you have up to a year to pay the $400. I've used this and it was really good. Classes are just 8 weeks but double speed.",
