  "text": "Currently in my Junior year and im taking 2 AP courses, last year I took 1 AP course as it was the only one avaliable, but im taking these for college, my goal is to graduate a year early and so Im trying to get as much college credit as possible, but, first semester I have a D in one of the AP classes and an A in another. I gave myself a couple weeks to bring it up but it dosnt seems to be going up despite my good work and grades, so if I drop it what can I do to make up for the college credit I won't get there? Anything over the summer?",
