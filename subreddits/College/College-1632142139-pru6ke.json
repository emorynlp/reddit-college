  "text": "Hello and Good morning Reddit :)\n\nSo I am looking to maybe start work on a bachelors degree here pretty soon, and its a very daunting task to me. I have never been to college at all, and I was homeschooled so I never really went to highschool either. I am currently serving active duty military and I was looking to work on a Bachelors degree to add to my profile to help with advancement and maybe to use to become a military officer. Has anyone completed a bachelors degree online before that could maybe offer me some advice? \n\nCollege as a whole is pretty confusing to me haha, so I'm not even sure where to start. I should have applicable credits in Algebra, Environmental Science, English Comp 1, and US History 1(all 3 hour courses that I took through [Sophia.com](https://Sophia.com)), but beyond that I havent done anything. If anyone has any advice on how to get started/recommendations for online resources that would be greatly appreciated. Bonus points if any fellow military members have any tips for me.",

They are often criticized for low rigor/poor quality, have lower-ranking accreditation, and may even result in having your resume thrown out depending on who\u2019s looking at it. \n\nInstead, there are many reputable universities with online programs, so it would be good to search around for programs that you\u2019re interested in and are offered by reputable universities.\n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "I'm currently getting my bachelor's degree online. I got my associates in person right out of high school and then took a couple years off. So I do have some college experience already. Before you even get into how do you start college, you need to make sure you can guarantee you can spend time working on homework and lessons. For every credit hour, it's recommended you spend a certain amount of time per week on classes and homework. And with short due dates on some projects, you have to be able to devote a lot of time. Luckily, you don't have to commit yourself to a full time school schedule. You can take one or two classes at a time if you need to. I'm currently in a program where I have one class that lasts for 6 weeks and then I start my next class that last 6 weeks. It's great for me because I'm working full time as well and I only have to worry about one class at a time. I do still have to put a lot of time into that one class. I'm also taking Sophia classes for my electives, but those truly are at my own pace. My other class has deadlines every week I have to keep up with. \n\nAs for getting started with classes, come up with everything you absolutely must have within a school. The major you're interested in, capability of getting your degree fully online, etc. Make sure their online classes are truly online and now just online at the moment because of covid. Then start reaching out to colleges that meet your basic criteria. See if your major is state specific or if you could get a degree from anywhere. For example, with law, it may be important to find a school within the state where you would practice because of state specific laws. If you can get a degree from anywhere, you have more options for schools. For the school I'm going to, the advisor I emailed with was very helpful to get the information she needed to get me enrolled and provided me with resources to look into regarding financial aid.",

Tuition shouldnt be too bad being military, and I still have to nail down a major that Id like to take.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs long as the college isnt too particular about me missing a class maybe once and a while for watches I have to stand, then I should be okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow much time do you actually spend on classes if you dont mind me asking? I should have most of my gen eds out of the way, and I can knock out any extras in just a few days(sophia is a godsend for getting credits stupidly fast), but for the actual core-classes how long do you think itll take you to complete? No frame of reference beyond the fact that a Bachelors takes 4 years to get usually in regular college settings.",

Currently, I'm just in a generic class everyone needs to take to prepare us for college and the work force. That kind of thing. I don't work on homework every day but I do put in a few hours a few days a week. I try to get some work in during my lunch break but I usually get just about 20 minutes. Not much but still something. I'm sure that my time per week will increase once I get to the classes related to my major.",
