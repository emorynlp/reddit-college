  "text": "Hi, so I live close to campus in an apartment, which is a long walk to the actual campus. I spend pretty much the whole day there when I don't have classes, and I know that is hampering my productivity  such as going to the library and opportunities to make friends and explore the city. However, I feel comfortable there and not at school, and I'm lucky that its a quiet place with relatively few distractions as my roommates are rarely at home. How can I get myself to not be in my room the whole day?",

      "text": "You won\u2019t get comfortable at school without first spending some time there. It\u2019s also helpful to try and separate your \u201cwork\u201d and \u201chome\u201d spaces. I live in a dorm now, but I almost never do my homework in my actual room. I\u2019m always at the library or in a common area, which switches me into \u201cproductivity mode.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what your class schedule looks like, but here\u2019s what I would suggest: \n\n1) If you have big gaps between your classes, don\u2019t go home. Go to the library, and pack a lunch if you need to. \n\n2) If you don\u2019t have gaps in your schedule, commit to staying in the library for 2 hours after your last class finishes. \n\n3) Find some clubs you\u2019re interested in (social media + school\u2019s RSO page) and see when those meetings are. Add them to your calendar and go to them; don\u2019t leave campus between your class meetings and extracurricular events.",
