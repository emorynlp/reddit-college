  "text": "I didn\u2019t star college until four years ago at 24. I thought that as long as you went into STEM, you\u2019d be fine. I also thought I\u2019d actually be done by now. Turns out pursuing a bio degree when you work full time, have mental health issues, and are starting with an 8th grade level of education is hard. I\u2019m about one semester away from my associates in sciences instead of bio, because I couldn\u2019t make it through all of the chemistry and physics classes. I know I could if I actually had time and a reason to care, but I don\u2019t.\n\nI was optimistic when I started. I loved school. But everything is gone to crap. Looking at the current wages, it feels pointless to even bother. People at McDonald\u2019s make more than chem or bio techs.\n\nI\u2019ve tried trade apprentices, but they\u2019re all booked. Worse yet, I\u2019m going to have to move back to my hometown with NO opportunity if I don\u2019t think of a plan quick.\n\nAt this point I just want to say f it and take out loans and finish my degree out of state. My only other option is staying in dead end retail and service industry work.",

Maybe moving out of state will give you some life experience too? Pros and cons list always help me. As silly as that may sound. Military is an option but that is a whole other level of commitment. U have options, congratulations on all I have achieved so far!",
