I commute 80 minutes and my alarm clock didn't go off this morning (apparently my new phone being on mute also muted the alarm).\n\nThis is my first class of senior year methodology. Should I go in halfway through the 3-hour class? \n\nSo far I'm thinking: \nI already emailed the teacher as soon as I woke up.Hopefully if I get there before/if the class gets a break I'll talk to the teacher then.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the input everyone!! I stood awkwardly around the half-open door (trying to gauge if I there was a seat in the back I could slip into before entering). The teacher saw me and decided to let everyone out on 5-minute break. I went in and talked to her and she was super nice about it. I don't know if I'll get attendance credit but the information from the first day was worth going late. \nThanks again, everyone!!", "author": "LeafeniaPrincess", "created": 1547735727, "retrieved": 1632802798, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 577, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"eeg2302": {"link": "/r/college/comments/agycej/should_i_go_to_class_an_hour_late/eeg2302/", "text": "I know this is late, but I'd just walk into class even if I'm late.
