Going to the gym 5 days a week, then yeah I will shower after going to the gym each day. But if I am just sitting in a classroom 5 days a week and don't have time to work out then every other day should be plenty to keep any odors down since I am doing almost nothing other than walking to create any bad odors. I am a swimmer, any time I swim I shower, the chlorine in pools has damaged my scalp sadly. I do not believe you will smell if you skip a shower, its silly tbh, especially if you aren't doing any sort of workout or sitting in direct sunlight for more than an hour (if you are lucky enough to be able to work on homework outside).",
