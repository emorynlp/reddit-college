  "text": "Me and my roommate met on facebook and decided to be roommates. originally we were chilling and we would go to the gym together all of time but after something with this one girl happened things between us has been weird ever since. To keep it simple we just aren\u2019t friends. I have a few friends now and mostly spend my time with them but whenever I\u2019m in the dorm and my roommate is there I just get this annoyed feeling and it feels very awkward. He also has a masterbation problem and once asked me to leave so he could beat his meat (it was like 2am too). Also he just got addicted to pens and stuff which I\u2019m fine with but personally I think it\u2019s sad how he kinda depends on them. He also doesn\u2019t shower after the gym often which I think is gross. Should I switch my roommate next semester.",
