  "text": "I'm from south east asia and I'm about to get my bachelor degree in software engineer and I want to jump straight to a master degree in data science, everywhere in the world if I can since the field is so new here it's nonexistent as graduate option in many unis in my country, not to mention the questionable quality. Now I know due to how much it can cost I need to apply for scholarships as well. But tbh I'm doing pretty well in uni but not super outstanding to a point where it's easy to qualify me a good scholarship, most scholarships are usually for research position and their entry requirements are quite high (involves things like top of the class really high gpas, outstanding achievements, work experience) it makes me nervous. I'm also having a tough time finding affordable university around the world. I feel like it's in 2 extreme either it's easy to get in but the tution fee is so high it may cause be a big debt problem or the entry is really hard but there's adequate support\n\nIs there any tips you guys can give me, do you guys know any affordable university or any options I should do ?",
