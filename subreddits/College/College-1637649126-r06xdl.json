  "text": "Or dropping at least two classes from my schedule. I am exhausted, broke, overwhelmed, sad, and everything in between. I don\u2019t see how I can manage another semester of it right now.\n\nIt sucks because I\u2019m so close to finishing, I only have about a year left. I just got into the program I wanted to get into.\n\nAnyone else take a semester off? How did it help/hurt you?",
