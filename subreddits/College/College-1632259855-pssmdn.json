For the ones I did, the professor set up \"stations\" around the room with different objects and we would have to go to each one and answer some questions about that object.  Objects could be a bone and we'd have to identify what part of the bone it is, is it left or right, etc.  It could also be pictures of histology and we'd have to answer what type of tissue it is, what part of the tissue it is, etc.  Things like that.
