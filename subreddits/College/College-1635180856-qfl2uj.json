  "text": "How hard is a Comp Sci degree for someone who can already code?\n\nI\u2019m 27, and been trying to figure out what to go to school for. What I want to do is program stuff, but not websites/apps etc. I want to get into embedded systems. I was going to go for an electrical engineering degree but a lot of people told me it was really hard, even with only working 30 hours a week. So now I think I\u2019m gonna just get my comp sci degree, and use personal projects to show potential employers that i have what it takes to do embedded systems.\n\nAfter comparing the curriculum of an EE degree to a Comp Sci degree, it looks almost like a walk in the park. And I know a few people that came out of comp Sci not even knowing how to build a computer or code THAT much, and now they\u2019re making bank at big companies.\n\nMy question is, is a comp Sci degree pretty doable while working 30 hours per week? Or is it still suicide like an EE degree? I already know how to code and I know the basics about how computers work etc. thanks.",
