  "title:": "Is comp sci degree possible while working 30-40 hours a week?",
  "text": "How hard is a Comp Sci degree for someone who can already code?\n\nI\u2019m 27, and been trying to figure out what to go to school for. What I want to do is program stuff, but not websites/apps etc. I want to get into embedded systems. I was going to go for an electrical engineering degree but a lot of people told me it was really hard, even with only working 30 hours a week. So now I think I\u2019m gonna just get my comp sci degree, and use personal projects to show potential employers that i have what it takes to do embedded systems.\n\nAfter comparing the curriculum of an EE degree to a Comp Sci degree, it looks almost like a walk in the park. And I know a few people that came out of comp Sci not even knowing how to build a computer or code THAT much, and now they\u2019re making bank at big companies.\n\nMy question is, is a comp Sci degree pretty doable while working 30 hours per week? Or is it still suicide like an EE degree? I already know how to code and I know the basics about how computers work etc. thanks.",

I am currently a CS student that hasn't worked on CS homework in 2 weeks since I end up finishing everything almost instantly. So right now I am just practicing Unity programming heavily.",

      "text": "Yeah, it's entirely possible. Plenty of people do it. Decide if that's what you want and ease into it. Full-time both would be tough, but part time school on top of full time work? Definitely.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a comp sci major and I use to work an average of 22 hours per week on any given week. Anything more than 22 I personally would get really stressed out. I eventually quit bc I got tired of having to cram work, school, homework, studying into one day everyday rise and repeat. Too much for me to concentrate on and not enough time to study. So, depending on your work ethic I think a part time job might be okay. Since you already know how to code junior and senior year will be a breeze. Depending on how much your care about general education course those might be a breeze too. Like others have said school is really a full time job too",
