I know I don\u2019t love that feeling of, \u201cdamn, I kinda am lazy.\u201d Not fun. \n\nSecond, what can you do in the morning that is *for you*? In my case, I try to go on a walk someplace nice, go grab a coffee since I know a couple of the baristas \u2014 always fun to talk. If it\u2019s absolutely buttcheek weather, I probably stay inside, make some tea and a decent breakfast before class. If you have the dining hall, give yourself some time to get there, eat semi-relaxed, and get to class. \n\nPick your clothes and stuff out the night before. Saves some time. \n\nIn short, give yourself a REASON to get up that isn\u2019t class, and go to class after you have done that reason(s)!",

I sleep best when I turn on my heated blanket after a shower because it\u2019s calming so maybe you can try something like that to prepare yourself to sleep to get up on time.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m 23 and I have the same issues.

Unless OP neglected to mention that his evil roommate locks him in his room each night and prevents him from going to class, then nothing is stopping him from going except his own tendency to sleep in.  That's something he simply has to overcome.  No magic tip or trick from us is going to make him do something he doesn't want to do.  He's got to find some internal motivation for getting up when the alarm goes off.\n\nOne of the other posters made the same comment as I did, just using different language: \"there are no cheat codes for going to class.\"  I.e., you either do it or you don't.  So best to figure out a way to just do it.",

No magic \"advice\" or \"tip\" is going to suddenly make him do something he doesn't want to do.  There's no magic spell for going to class; it's simply what an adult student does.  OP has to find the motivation within himself, whether it's a steadily worsening grade, or hundreds of dollars of lost tuition money, or something else.",

I would wake up to get credit for coming to class or something I forget and then fall asleep by accident all the time during the zoom recitation. I felt bad for the TA since she was super nice. I never take those courses at 8am again unless absolutely need to for a certain course or I would learn nothing and be tired the whole time. My tip would be to just put the alarm of your phone somewhere not next to bed then kinda drag yourself out of bed to the bathroom and swoosh cold water on your face then make a cup of coffee like a treat for getting up",

For instance, you can set it to make you solve 3 math problems before you are able to turn off the alarm. You can also set the difficulty of the math problem.   \n\n\nAs someone who is also a student and struggles to not be night owl this is super handy. I also leave my phone on the opposite side of the room from where I sleep. That way I am forced to get out of bed.   \n\n\nAnd finally, maybe have a specific activity that you do right after you wake up? Like wake up, make coffee. Or wake up and work out. The latter has worked for me in the past because I immediately had to get ready to go somewhere and it took me far away from my bed. Best of luck.",

Due to the time difference I had to get up at 05:00 am for classes (08:00 am in the country the college is in) and I didn\u2019t miss even one class. I think what kept me going was that I didn\u2019t want to do it all over again. If I failed that semester I would just have to repeat that subject and keep waking up at 05:00 am everyday. So I kept like 3 alarms just to be sure and made sure I slept on time. Some nights I\u2019d get like 3-4 hours of sleep but I would still attend class. On days like this, I just take a 2-3 hours nap after class, that way I\u2019m not sleep deprived and sleepy the rest of the day. Hope this helps friend.",

Not biological because we don't see in the dark but there are studys (the only English one I know is from chicago) that people that are usually nocturnal that they die way faster because they build up a lot of stress during the day and trying to fit into a \"morning persons\" schedule.\n\n8 hours can or cannot be healthy. Your body might just need 4 hours (mostly older folks don't need as much sleep) but teens sometimes need 10-12 hours.Don't have to be consistent tho.\n\nI did nightshifts and all-night-partys and even without the influence of alcohol I sleep well at any time and didn't show any signs of miscomfort or something like that.\nIt's just better to sleep at night because there are more activities when it's daytime.\nAnd as I said, since we use lights we don't have this natural feeling of being tired when it gets dark.\nI can sleep with sun in my face or when it's completely dark. Maybe I am numb, due to my experience but i think sleep is always great.",

So whatever song(s) is stuck in my head the night before goes on a spotify queue, and after my morning alarm goes off I pop in my headphones and listen to it in bed. Sometimes when I'm hooked on a show I wake up a little earlier and watch some of it before getting up. \n\nIf you don't want to be on your phone like that and you're motivated by food like I am, get a nice starbucks drink or some sort of pastry the night before, so you can have it when you wake up. \n\nThe key is to set all this up the night before though. Your groggy mind will not be scrolling through apps to open up spotify, struggle to think of a song, type it in, and then sit up to grasp for headphones. Don't mind the assholes on here, just figure out what works for you and it will get easier eventually.",

      "text": "The mental aspect of going to classes is another huge aspect. I had a great therapist a few years ago who told me to treat the classes that are hard to go to like they\u2019re not optional. In college, it\u2019s easy to feel like the courses are optional when attendance is not tracked and grade isn\u2019t impacted if you go or not. It sounds silly but you have to tell yourself it\u2019s a set appointment that you can\u2019t miss and there\u2019s no option to opt out. It\u2019s really helped me get tasks done by switching to this mindset towards hard things. This can also help you wake up with more urgency if you feel like you have to go to this \u201csuper important meeting.\u201d Sometimes tricking ourselves is all we need! But I\u2019d suggest the other tips too of going to bed early or even creating a rewards system of small things if you go to help with motivation",

If you think about classes as an investment- something to be proud of an excited for- maybe you'll feel more motivated to go. \n\nPart of this comes with maturity. When I was 19 I felt the same. Now that I'm a student again in my 30's, I watch every lecture, do every practice problem, and take advantage of every resource my school offers that I possibly can. Seeing the payments come out of my bank account helps with the motivation (why pay for something I'm not using?) but it's also just having the desire to learn and be good at my future career.",

They probably don't care if you miss class, and they know you're trying to be there, just make clear that it is a priority to you. Some kids don't care about class and then are desperate at the last second, now is the perfect time to get your act together and get on it.\n\nDeli was the key for me.",

There's no way to trick yourself into this, you have to make yourself do it.  Standing up out of bed is by far the hardest part of getting up so just focus on that one thing.  Alarm goes off, get out of bed and stand up.  Then you can start doing whatever else you need to do to get ready.  Don't think about all that when the alarm goes off though - just think about one thing - stand up out of bed.  Keep doing that and you'll get used to it and it won't be so hard to get up.  I'm 50 years old and I still don't want to get up in the morning, but I stand up out of bed when the alarm goes off, then I start moving towards the bathroom and get ready.",
