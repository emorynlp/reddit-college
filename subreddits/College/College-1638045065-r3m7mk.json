  "text": "I\u2019m sure some of you have experienced this before. Basically, my group members are international students and they aren\u2019t able to write well in English. I end up doing most of the work due to this. It\u2019s been an overwhelming experience.\n\nMy issue is that compared to other groups who have more people with good writing skills, I\u2019m the only one in the class stuck with group members who have poor writing skills. This means that the reports I hand in are less than perfect, as I\u2019m the only one writing/editing them, and I don\u2019t have another group member who can help me with the writing/editing. Just recently, I handed in a report and noticed it had some grammatical errors after the deadline. I would have been able to catch these errors if I hadn\u2019t been burnt out from writing the whole thing by myself. It was about 30 pages in total.\n\nIt makes me angry that my group members are barely contributing anything to our group projects. And, I\u2019m not sure they even can because they have a terrible grasp of the English language.\n\nWhat should I do?",

      "text": "Honestly, at this point in the semester there may not be much you can do about switching groups. To help the rest of the semester I suggest using resources on campus to help with final drafts. Most colleges and universities have a free writing tutoring service. They won't help write your report but can help with grammar and such once it's been written.\n\nYou could perhaps bring up the issue to the professor, and they might grade the reports according to who did the work instead of a blanket each member gets the same grade. I did that in a previous class where I did the brunt of each physics lab report (which were two per week). My lab partner ended up failing the class and needing to repeat since he didn't do anything to help with the reports. Granted my issue was a lack of work issue and not a language barrier issue. \n\nGood luck the rest of this semester, and I hope you can finish strong.",
