  "title:": "(Freshman) I haven't done any of my work for a class since the beginning of the semester.",
  "text": "My biology professor didn't have anything due until the end of the semester for whatever reason, so I just put it all off. I have 6 weeks of work to do and an exam that covers all that at the end of the week. I just don't really see it possible for me to pass at this point, so would it affect anything if i just failed the class and took another science next semester? As in, would that affect my progression with my degree at all? Might not seem like the most logical thing to do, but for context I have a low D in the easiest math class on campus, which I have been trying in. Just not a STEM person. I'm a communications major.\n\nAnd before anyone wants to lecture me, I definitely learned my lesson.\n\nEdit Further context. I'm at LSU so my plan is to take one of the bullshit science classes next semester because there are a lot of them.",
