  "text": "Like for example, you often see people say they study for 3,4,5+ hours a day, are they just lying? I can't even imagine doing that much. Even 2 hours of studying on top of assignments sounds like a ton to me.",

      "text": "I'd say that's pretty typical for engineering students or medical students. Most majors don't require that much studying though.\n\nAlso, some people define \"studying\" differently than others. For example, I'm \"studying\" right now, by some definitions, in that in between redditing, I'm looking at my coursework. If I do this for 5 hours straight, I *could* say I spent 5 hours studying, but in reality I didn't. Some people who engage in \"distracted\" studying probably count the entire time as \"study\" time.",

I would pull all nightes for mid terms and  finals. I found myself in many cases even with 4 hrs, I started not remembering a lot of things, since my mind was being cluttered.\n\nNot sure about anyone else, that was just me.",
