  "text": "So I recently just started school at a community college and I\u2019m studying to go into the electrical field. The only problem I have is just little to no motivation to do ANYTHING. Before the whole pandemic, I was a pretty good student in high school. Sure I procrastinated but I always got my work done on time and I had a drive to be successful. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m just rlly burnt out from everything and it\u2019s very difficult for me to do the simplest tasks. Anyways, I just wanted to see if any of y\u2019all have had this problem and how u dealt with it. Thanks.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve dealt with this many times and here I am in my senior year. Usually, the problem isn\u2019t that you\u2019re not putting in enough effort, it\u2019s that you\u2019re neglecting some other area of your life and your brain is essentially on strike until you sort that out. It could be lack of social interaction, it could be unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, it could be lack of sleep, all sorts of things. Make sure to maintain a balance between school and your life. I personally have a hard time giving myself rest or just doing something fun with friends so anytime I haven\u2019t done that in a long stretch of time, my grades suffer and I get unmotivated. As soon as I have a beer with a friend and talk about life for an afternoon, boom, I\u2019m back in my element.",
