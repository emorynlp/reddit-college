  "title:": "Is a 3.14 GPA good for my first semester of college?",
  "text": "I'm aware that GPA requirements vary throughout different universities, but in my case (and I think it's general enough to be posted in this subreddit), I need a 2.75 university GPA to stay on track for when I apply to my desired major after my sophomore year. I calculated my expected grades for each class (by putting in potential grades for each assignment/exam) and I have a chance at ending the semester with semester GPA of 3.14 (an A and 4 B's or 2 A's, 2 B's, and a C). However, some of my grades could go up, giving me at the most a GPA of 3.34 if I do well enough. In other words, the 3.14 GPA is hopefully the lowest I'll get and the 3.34 GPA is most likely the highest I could get.\n\nThe reason for my GPA being somewhat \"low\" is because I got behind recently and didn't turn in a few things, mainly because I procrastinate, but also because I'm not at my best in the emotional and personal aspects (going through tough times right now, including my dad being hospitalized for a few days). I'm just feeling scared and guilty right now even though I still have a good chance at surviving my first semester with a high enough GPA (which to some, a 3.14 would be low and to others it would be decent). I would appreciate your thoughts and advice.",

You're just getting into the swing of things and considering that we are entering after all this online learning, I think it IS good.",

As I said, my GPA isn't finalized, but if I get back on my feet and put in the effort I expect to get at least a 3.14 GPA (or close to it), a 3.34 GPA at the highest. Nevertheless, your words to give me a breath of relief.",
