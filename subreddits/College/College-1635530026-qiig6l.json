  "text": "I had to withdraw from one of my classes this semester which would put me below 12 hrs. I was thinking about enrolling in a online govt class I need. I am a bit hesitant because it's a 4 week class starting next week. Is it possible for me to pass the class with at least a B? Is it worth it.\n\nI am taking 3 other classes including Precal,hist and an elective",
