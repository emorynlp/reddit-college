  "text": "I\u2019m a high school student who is going to be entering college soon and I just wanted to ask, how do you decide on only one major? It feels like everyday I want to do something different in terms of a career path but I can\u2019t have fifty majors, nor can I attend college for fifty years to obtain them. I have a few choices for majors but I just want to know if they could be the right ones because let\u2019s face it, nobody wants to be disappointed in their college experience. Any advice is helpful.",

      "text": "I started as a business major, but chose to study what I liked to study, which was Math. You will have no regrets if you study one of your favorite subjects. One thing to note is that I recommend you to check out tech-related subjects like computer science, data science, or stats since those will make you marketable after graduation, if you end up choosing one of them as a minor or a double major. That\u2019s roughly what I did - I studied data science for my master\u2019s. \n\nI am actually running a company to help students find their majors and improve their academic performance, so please dm me if you\u2019d like to ask any additional questions! Hope this helps :)",

A good way to do that is to look for job postings in your area and see what\u2019s needed right now. \n\nDon\u2019t take a program just because you think will be easy. Every program is going to be difficult. \n\nTake a year of just general classes. Take an English, math, chemistry, class and see what peaks your interest. \n\nThat\u2019s all I got for you. What were your top 10 options?",
