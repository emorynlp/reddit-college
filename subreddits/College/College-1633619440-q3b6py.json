  "text": "so just a little background, I was at a big university for a year and a half before i got pregnant and dropped out due to issues.  \n\nwhen my daughter turned one, i started community college, and unfortunately had to withdraw due to my father and brother being in a car accident and then getting covid. 2020 was quite a year. \n\nanyway my counseler only unenrolled me from one class, and not the others. I had 3 more. Which in turn ended me up with 3 F\u2019s. I was unaware as he told me he had withdrew me but i guess there was some confusion. \n\nso fast forward to this semester i tried to return to my university but they said my gpa was under 2.0 which was impossible if i didnt even take any classes it should have remained 0.0 showing so (i think im probably wrong) so they would accept me and i got in contact with my counsler who was confused and we just decided i\u2019d enroll in classes again because i really have no other choice and i need a degree. \n\nbut now not only does my gpa suck, but my fafsa is at risk of suspension. I just dont know what to do. is there a point to continue? or can i even do something? \n\nany advice welcome ty in advance",

      "text": "It's sometimes possible to finish up work from previous semesters, or to nullify an item on your transcript, due to extenuating circumstances. I'd make an appointment with a counselor at your college (should be a department there of people who help manage students' progress, enrollment, graduation prep, that sort of thing) and see if something can be done.",
