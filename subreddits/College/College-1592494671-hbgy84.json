I'm assuming you attend a uni now? Or do you still attend cc?) your school. But if you asked me or a few other people, I would say the complete opposite. For example:\n\n That free and great counseling that's supposed to be provided? Barely got it because our offices are usually booked from the beginning of the year to the end. I've only had two meetings in the 3 years that I've been attending the school. It became so bad that my mom pushes me to spend money to get outside counseling from a oos therapist.

Only if you're super poor, or badger them 24/7. Financial aid has a notoriously bad rep in our school, but if you talk to some students? They LOVE them.\n\nMy school has a mix of great teachers and not so great teachers so I'm not going to go there.\n\nEtc etc.\nAgain, I'm one of the exceptions though so I'm not going around calling it a bad school. \nOverall, this didn't really need to be an argument.
