      "text": "I stay focused because I really enjoy what I study. It also helps by avoiding using your phone during study time. For me, a 10 minute break quickly turns into an hour. \n\nWhat i also do I plan everything out in advance. At the beginning of the week I will usually create a list of tasks I have to do for each day of the week. It\u2019s much easier to stay disciplined that way in my opinion.",
