  "text": "\nI (18M) come from a fairly well off and influential family in my city. I live in south India and my city is a huge city and and have multiple educational opportunities. I have just finished my 12th grade and am looking to pursue a degree in engineering (in a field where my family members are working).\nI have gotten a good enough score to get into whatever engineering colleges I want in my city ( only for my course).\nBut I have been advised by a few people including a few of my teachers to pursue the degree abroad (like in us).\nBut in order to do that now I would have to wait another year as I am too late for the application process.\nSo what I\u2019m trying to ask is whether is a degree from US worth putting of joining college by a whole year?\nReddit I\u2019m looking for an honest opinion so please let me know what you all think.\n\n\n\n*Also I\u2019m on phone and posting for the first time so forgive my formatting and grammar errors",
