  "text": "I was planning to go back to college in January or whenever they start back up again every year already done like when I was 17 I'm now almost 28 and that time frame I've been arrested for seven felonies assault with deadly weapon(three different times),grand theft, burglary, possession of Subutex and felony property damage. I was found not guilty and am not a convicted felon but just wanted to know will having the arrests still show up prevent me from getting student loans or using my degree anyone have experience with this?\n\nNote I am not a convicted felon",
