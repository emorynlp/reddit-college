      "text": "For every hour spent in class (or for every credit of the course), assume you\u2019ll be studying an additional 3 hours. So taking four 3-credit courses, that\u2019s 12 hours in the classroom a week, which is an additional 36 hours studying, or a total of 48 hours on school. Then think of that like a job, and add it up with the actual working hours you\u2019re spending each week. \n\nFor reference, a total of 40 hours working is considered a full-time job. 60 hours working is considered a lot. 80 hours working per week is considered unsustainable and unhealthy in most fields (though some highly competitive fields like law and medicine this can be the norm \u2014 and it\u2019s still unhealthy even though everyone in that field does it). Around 110 hours of work per week would mean you are spending every minute awake at work (or school), with no time for things like food or personal hygiene.",

          "text": "The 3 hours for 1 credit hour thing is crazy. My STEM courses don't require that kind of time put in. I'm unsure how I would even stretch some of them to study that long. Some courses *could* require that kind of studying time but I really think that the 3:1 ratio is super duper high. \n\nOP, my suggestion is to quit one job unless you absolutely need the money. Two jobs will put a stress on your education and affect it negatively.",

Weekly problem sets in physics are typically designed to take 10 hours, for a course that is 4 credits, and meets 6 hours per week. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen from my students though, many students don\u2019t need 3 hours per credit, and many need more, it really depends on the individual. 3 hours is a good benchmark, and for students who are struggling it\u2019s the first question I ask them.",
