      "text": "It's crap tbh. My grades are awesome, but my mental and physical health are circling the shitter, even with medication, therapy, and doctor appointments. Before the midterm, I had told myself if I scored less than 75% then I'd drop out and work on getting my metal and physical health back to baseline. But, I passed the midterm with a high B, so I'm still hanging on for dear life! We're seven weeks away from the end of the semester. Seven. Fucking. Weeks.",

              "text": "I was diagnosed with Autism (ASD) late last year. On top of that, I was born with Cystic Fibrosis, though my CF has been brought to heel thanks to medications. \n\nMy main issue right now is the fact that social interaction drains the life out of me. I can get a solid 8-10 hours of sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, drink some caffeine, take my dogs for a morning walk, drive to campus hyped up and ready to go, but being in class for 2.5 hours exhausts me to the point I am on the verge of falling asleep at the wheel on the way home. I\u2019m sure being in quarantine for the last year and a half hasn\u2019t helped me socially. And, since Autism is mainly a neurological condition and not something I can just \u201cfix\u201d like CF or general anxiety, I\u2019m having a hard time figuring out what exactly is going on and how to combat it. I\u2019m working on finding out how to start feeling better with the help of my doctors and therapist, but for now, I\u2019m just getting my ass beat by having to act \u201cnormal\u201d at college. \n\nMy \u201cnormal\u201d facade, while it looks genuine to most people, is fake. It\u2019s all an act. My real self is much quieter, much more monotone, much more withdrawn and aloof, than the facade I force myself to put up when I\u2019m interacting with most people. While my fake self might make me more approachable and charming, it\u2019s really taking a toll on my mental and physical health. For instance, I haven\u2019t been able to eat more than one light meal per day without getting nauseous, and sometimes I sleep for 16+ hours a day. \n\nHopefully, my doctors and therapist will help me find a viable solution sooner than later. The last thing I want is to be forced to drop out due to medical reasons, especially since I\u2019m enjoying what I\u2019m learning and am getting some praise and recognition from the prof and the department chair. That, and I am also sick of feeling like shit. It would be great if I could eat a decent dinner for once.",

That's the best I can describe myself. \n\nDrowned in homework, lots of tests coming up with two already down the drain, and little hopes for flipping the tortilla. Yet, we'll stay home and try to study all weekend. See what we can save.\n\nAll in all, I'm actively considering switching universities. That's the boiling point I'm at.\n\nHope yours is better.",
