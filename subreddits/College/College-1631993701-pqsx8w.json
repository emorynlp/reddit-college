Part of my duties is to also hold conduct meetings with students who have violated policy. The amount of cases we have had come through this year compared to years past is bewildering to say the least. Tons more binge drinking, many more alcohol transports to the hospital, and vomit everywhere. This may sound funny, but when you have to call a parent and explain that their child is in the hospital due to alcohol poisoning, it loses all sense of humor. \n\nLook. I know the last year everyone has been cooped up. We all are trying to reclaim lost experiences. However, you need to pace yourselves. Drink to your limit. Drink only with friends. Do NOT take open drinks from others. Have transportation home planned out before going out. Simple tips you surely have heard before, but I promise you this is not just for your own health. This is for the wellbeing of the community, staff, and EMS. Our local hospital is almost entirely full with COVID patients, and trying to find spaces for students who have severe alcohol poisoning or have been slipped a drug that they did not intend to take, is extremely difficult. Your have far ranging consequences friends.
