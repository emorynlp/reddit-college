(long)", "text": "Hi folks, hope you don't find it bothering that I'm a professor who lurks.   But since Covid, I've joined this subreddit because I want to know what's going on with students' mental health, but don't want my students to feel weirded out if I ask.\n\nWhat I've learned is that a lot of you are Not Doing Okay.   And that Covid-19 and online learning is really, really stressing you out.   And I'm sorry that I don't have any good answers for that.\n\nBut the other thing I see is people struggling on how to study in college, which is so different from studying in High School.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of students are missing out on the very thing that would help you out.  **I'm NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I THINK, I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE THIS IS THE F\\*\\*KING SCIENCE.**\n\nThere have been SOOOO many epistemological studies about easy things you can change regarding note-taking that will literally improve your grades, your exams, and your general understanding.\n\nSome of you will know all of this already.  But note-taking isn't just something we're born knowing how to do and bugs the hell out of me that no one bothers to ever teach it.\n\nSo for those who don't know what are essentially \"study hacks\", here's the science:\n\n# #1) TAKING NOTES BY HAND AUTOMATICALLY STICKS INSIDE YOUR MEMORY MORE THAN TAKING NOTES ON A LAPTOP DOES, EVEN IF YOU NEVER LOOK AT YOUR NOTES AGAIN.\n\n(Link to the study: [https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf) )\n\nWhen it comes to remembering facts, like \"When did the civil war start?\" there wasn't much of a difference.  \n\nHowever, when it comes down to understanding the CONCEPTS, students who wrote longhand did unbelievably better.  As in three times better.   If you want to know why they did so much better, go to hack #2.\n\n# #2) USING YOUR OWN WORDS TO WRITE DOWN NOTES IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WRITING DOWN EXACTLY WHAT THE PROFESSOR SAYS IN THE LECTURE.\n\nDirectly from the study: \"Overall, p**articipants who took more notes performed better whether or notebook or laptop,** \u03b2 = 0.34, p = .023, partial R2 = .08. ***However, those whose notes had less verbatim overlap with the lecture performed \\[even\\] better,*** \u03b2 = \u22120.43, p = .005, partial R2 = .12  \n\n\nFor instance, if the prof's slide says: \n\n`\"Psychologists have investigated a phenomenon known as \u201cattitude inoculation,\u201d which works on the same principle as vaccination, and involves exposing people to weak arguments against a viewpoint they hold.\"`  \n\n\nDon't write that down verbatim.  Write down what it \\*means\\* and in your own words.  Something like:\n\n`If you challenge someone's opinion with weak arguments, but a lot of them, they'll actually double-down on their opinion`\n\nOr, for real shorthand, fast\n\n`Lots of weak arguments = they'll double down`\n\nSo long as you can tell what that means.\n\n# #3) VISUALS HELP\n\nDraw whatever helps you understand the concept, be it graphs or maps or whatever.   Such as:  \n\n\nWATCH THIS VIDEO:  \n\nIt's from a guy that scored 99.9th percentile in his med school classes, and he attributes it to his note-taking skills:\n\nLINK:[https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/study-less-study-smart-what-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/](https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/study-less-study-smart-what-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# #4) HERE'S THE BIG BIG BIG BIG HACK THAT WILL SAVE YOU THE MOST TIME:\n\nReview your notes within twenty-four hours.  This can save you hours of extra studying in the long run.\n\nMake sure it's within 24 hours though!   Science isn't 100% sure why it has to be done within that time frame, but it could be because of (theoretical but certainly not debunked) \"neural dumping.\"  Basically, this means as you sleep at night your brain shits out all the information that is non-essential.\n\nGuess what's non-essential:  calculus.  history.  English lit.     Sure, not to you, but to your brain?  It says, \"F\\*\\*k it, we need the space.  Get rid of this crap.\"\n\nLet me know if any of this is helpful, or if it's just mostly annoying stuff that you already know.\n\nTake care guys.  It's only 4 years of hell, I promise.  After that, it's only 40 more years of hell in the workforce, but at least it's a different kind of hell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:  You can save time with some easy changes.", "author": "emarcomd", "created": 1632247758, "retrieved": 1632800813, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1500, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"he6vod3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/he6vod3/", "text": "Think I have ptsd or rsd from number 1.

So I\u2019d go back to my notes after class and rewrite them in a way that was more organized and personal, so it was easier to understand them when I needed to study.\n\nAlso if you have recorded classes, take advantage of that. Still go to your class, but if there\u2019s a part of the lecture where your exhaustion is hitting you hard or you aren\u2019t quite grasping something your prof is saying, write the time down on your notes.

I know the study it came from, but wow it just didn\u2019t work for me. Remember most statistics have outliers. I always miss things when writing by hand, end up not even being able to read what I wrote later on, and get about 1/3 of the info down compared to when I type. It just made class stressful and I got hand cramps.\n\nWhat *did* work for me though was, if I needed to memorize information, going to my typed notes later and making flash cards of important details (or a hand written study guide) by hand.

Schedule in study time and stick to it. That way when your time off comes its actually restful and refreshing rather than stressful about all the stuff you havent done. \n\n\\-Do active reading rather than passive. When you read, take notes and \"play professor.\" Each section think to yourself \"if I was the proff and I was writing the exam is there anything in here that I would put on an exam or in a review session?\" It serves a dual purpose, it makes sure you are actually thinking about what you are reading rather than just passivly taking info in. It also creates notes for you so that when its time to review for exams you wont have to read the whole book again. It also allows you to tease out any questions you may have so that if you go to office hours you know what you need. \n\n\\-Break up study sessions to about 45 min of any one activity. Doesnt mean only study for 45 min, but dont do much more than that of any one thing. Switch it up, strech, do a quick chore. After about 45 min learning fatigue checks in and often the brain checks out so while you may be putting in time you probably are not actually taking in the information. \n\nStudy smarter, not harder or longer.", "author": "cricketcounselor", "created": 1632254761, "upvotes": 41}, "hdrclra": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/hdrclra/", "text": "Thanks prof, I feel like ur mad at students tho", "author": "Rickysmalls1010-", "created": 1632254710, "upvotes": 3}, "hdrc0uw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/hdrc0uw/", "text": "Awesome", "author": "Zyrobe", "created": 1632254471, "upvotes": 2}, "hdr7n0d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/hdr7n0d/", "text": "I used to re-write my notes in high school (which was way more challenging than my university).

And back when I started, laptops and tablets were not the norm and we all had 500 sheet notebooks and actually used the print textbook lol. Now let me clarify, taking notes on your laptop or tablet can be beneficial depending on the course. Don\u2019t write math notes on a keyboard (although I do \u201cre-type\u201d my notes in Word using the equation function to make them pretty when I print them) and for the love of whatever god you pray to at night DO NOT get tempted to browse social media or YouTube or other distractions. I feel that\u2019s the BIGGEST pet peeve for professors when students bring technology to class. I love writing notes on my Surface pro in one note. For programming, typing in Notepad++ was beneficial. For other gen Ed courses it was helpful. Heck, I\u2019ve even recorded my lectures live on my webcam (audio only though with the webcam off) so I can finalize my notes at a later time. But if you start getting distracted then all the pros of using tech for note taking goes down the toilet (and you potentially ruin it for others who actually use tech in the correct way in a classroom setting).", "author": "XenOz3r0xT", "created": 1632250389, "upvotes": 10}, "hdr0qi6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/hdr0qi6/", "text": "I can honestly say that I've never really studied for HS, since everything would \"stick\"  in class so this is very helpful since my college classes start next week, thank you!", "author": "IndividualBeliefs", "created": 1632249841, "upvotes": 128}, "hdqzubq": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psoeji/lurking_professor_with_some_study_hacks_long/hdqzubq/", "text": "Thank you!", "author": "Mineatron", "created": 1632249465, "upvotes": 17}}}
