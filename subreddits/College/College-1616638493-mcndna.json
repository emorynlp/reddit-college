  "text": "Had a 7 member group project. The project is done in parts- one part is due each week. \nOne member in our group (it\u2019s been weeks at this point) has not helped at all or even said anything In the group chat. Contributed nothing so far. So finally for last weeks assignment we manage to get ahold of him and tell him he should contribute. He says he\u2019ll do part of the weeks assignment. \nWell he never turned it in and we ALL got a zero which lowered our grade. We emailed the professor but he didn\u2019t care and said that\u2019s part of working with a team. The group member has not said anything and no one can get a hold of him. \nWe asked the professor if we could re do the assignment but he did not answer \nI\u2019m just so frustrated. I can\u2019t hold this persons hand to make sure they do the work they say they are going to do.\n\n\nEdit: since some of you aren\u2019t quite understanding: he wasn\u2019t responsible for the entire assignment just a tiny part of it. But it was an all or nothing grade so because his part wasn\u2019t complete it was a zero",

Have backup. If they miss one group internal dead line after the other, do their part but tell the lecturer about your group members shortcomings. Better save than sorry.",

They're the dumbest exercise that colleges regulate.\n\nMost rely on **\"tHiS WiLl rEfLeCt WhAt It'S LiKe iN tHe rEaL WoRlD!!!\"** Yeah, that's 100% bullshit. In the real world, people's jobs are tied to their income, so there's motivation to get at least *something* done,  and it's very easy to pinpoint who is struggling or falling behind. THEN, a company (who acts in good faith) will get that person whatever tools and training they need to make sure that they survive, or they're let go because they did not have the credentials to get the job done. I've been in the working world for a better part of a decade, and in my various jobs (office, delivery, front and back of house in restaurants, etc), this has usually been the case.\n\nIt's especially bad when professors make it a major chunk of the final grade and tie your score based on what another participant did. Some professors have real world experience, which is great. But some toot that b.s. horn bolded above and have been teaching for a long time and have forgotten what it's like to work in an office environment with people.\n\nMy personal anecdote: last semester I had a group project with a guy for my ethics class. I picked him because he asked questions and took notes in class, which showed me active participation. However, he got a job overnight at a shipping warehouse and completely abandoned his part of the presentation. Much like other people suggested here, I got a gut feeling he was going to bail so I did the entire project. I had him record his speaking parts and I did mine. Then, at review time I bombed his portion of the peer review. We still made a 93, including him. So he got a free grade for doing nothing.\n\n\nThere's a reason /r/shittygroupmembers exist, and it's because of crap like what you went through OP. I'm sorry your teammate did that.\n\nI know a class I'm taking next semester is group based, so I purposefully picked out a teacher who weighs the group grade the lowest. F that stuff man. \n\nGood luck OP. I recommend going above your professor all the way to the dean. To hell with that professor, if he gets talked to about it then so be it. His expectations are unrealistic and unfair.",

      "text": "This is so disappointing. Professors automatically assume that by simply putting students into groups and then giving them a task that they will automatically learn how to work well in teams. They don't provide students with the tools to manage group assignments and then compound all of the nastiness of group work by giving everyone on the team the same grade thus ensuring that at least one group member will do absolutely nothing knowing that the other group members will pull them along.   \n\n\nMy colleague and I wrote a book on how to teach using group assignments  - [https://www.peerassesspro.com/how-to-teach-using-group-assignments/](https://www.peerassesspro.com/how-to-teach-using-group-assignments/) (feel free to send your professor the link).  Our research has identified five pillars that inform good practice for achieving effective group assignments.\n\nPillar 1 \u2013 Assuring fairness\n\nOur first pillar acknowledges one of the fundamental issues of group work: contribution. Not every student contributes equally to a project, therefore, it is not appropriate or motivating to give one grade for the whole team. This is why teachers must rely on peer assessments amongst teams to assess contribution fairly.\n\nPillar 2 \u2013 Addressing [freeloading](https://www.peerassesspro.com/glossary/freeloading/)\n\nTo prevent [freeloading](https://www.peerassesspro.com/glossary/freeloading/), educators must outline how a student\u2019s contribution to the group work will determine their grade. At the start of the project, it should be clear to students that the educator will rely on the students to assess the effort of students. This degree of effort will determine if the student passes or fails.\n\nPillar 3 \u2013 Introducing assessment criteria\n\nBefore students begin the group work, the educator must address how they will be assessed. Students must be trained on how to assess their peers. They must then provide feedback in a timely manner so their peer has time to correct their behaviour and contribute positively to the group work.\n\nPillar 4 \u2013 Training students to work together\n\nTeamwork is a learned skill. As an educator, you can help set students up for success by training them to work together. If you do not have a specialisation in leadership or coaching, consider having your institution\u2019s learning centre conduct a teamwork workshop. Alternatively, if you\u2019ve recognised leadership characteristics in some of your students, you could request they conduct a presentation for the class.\n\nPillar 5 \u2013 Preventing dysfunctional behaviour\n\nIdentifying dysfunctional team behaviours, such as outlier ratings or inflated self-assessments, can help you prevent at-risk students from failing. With timely intervention, you can reverse these potential failures around before it is too late for the student.",

Some people are in college for reasons that don\u2019t include getting good grades, so they don\u2019t have any motivation to perform beyond the bare minimum if that, or they just have other things in their life and failing out is just unavoidable at the moment.
