  "text": "Okay. So this one\u2019s about working. \n\nBasically I\u2019m having trouble doing my math. \n\nThe trouble isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t have determination, or drive, or that I don\u2019t see it as an important task to do. \n\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want to do it. \n\nWhat\u2019s strange is the ways my body communicates this before-unknown fact. I\u2019d get up, get ready to do my homework and then I would feel repelled. It\u2019s like the air was taken out of me that was floating me dutifully to the study room. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started talking with myself that I realized I don\u2019t like math and I don\u2019t want to do it. Which is strange because I thought I liked math and the work wasn\u2019t truly painful. But I have feelings deep down inside that tell me that math is a no-go. \n\nAnyone else have troubles like this? Have you felt \u201cready to go\u201d but your true feelings held you back?",
