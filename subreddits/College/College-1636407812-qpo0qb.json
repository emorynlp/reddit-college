      "text": "Same as starting in Fall, but some courses may not be offered in the Spring as they are in the Fall. Especially if they are 2 semester sequence courses (e.g. chem 101 in the fall, chem 102 in the spring - chem 101 may not be offered in the spring).\n\nAlso, if you're coming in as a freshman, people in freshman year spring will likely move onto sophomore year in the next fall, but you may still be classified as a freshman in the system since you may have less than 30 credit hours completed. Other than those technical details, there is no difference in terms of experience.",
