  "text": "So as a freshman in high school, I\u2019m currently taking AP History, Pre AP English, Pre IB, Chemistry and Algebra 2 and I want to double major in Journalism and Psychology. I want to make a set plan and begin striving for what I want so I wanted to see what classes you guys recommend.",

      "text": "I agree with rynpickles. Take dual credit. There\u2019s tons of universities that don\u2019t accept AP credit at all. Even with that being said there\u2019s some universities that will ONLY take AP credit if you make a 5 and nothing less. So if you make a 4 (even though a 3 and up is considered passing) then oh well you took that AP class for nothing and will have to retake it again in university because said university only accepts 5\u2019s or none at all. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not about what classes we recommend. It\u2019s about classes your future university will want. Go to the university website that you want to attend, look up their journalism major, and somewhere on the major\u2019s description page you\u2019ll see a list or a link that will show you the required/recommended classes for that major. Do the same thing for psychology, look up the major on the university website and look at its course list. You\u2019ll really only be able to take general education courses in highschool since you gotta satisfy your high school requirements first. \n\nIdk how smart or lazy or hardworking you are or whatever but, for example, something like chemistry you might not even need. If you think you suck at chemistry check and see if you can take biology or physics instead if those two are your stronger suits. I\u2019m a computer science major and in order to satisfy my science credits I could take either chemistry, biology, or physics. Taking a dual credit class of either of these will more than likely satisfy your high school science credits AND some sort of college science credit. Honestly to me it sounds like you can get away with taking biology dual credit instead of taking chemistry for your psychology major and still satisfy high school and college science credit requirements. Bio is easier than chem fyi. Source? I took chem.\n\nNot sure how competent your high school\u2019s college advisor is (bc mine wasn\u2019t) but assuming that they are\u2026go talk to them about it and see what they say. Sit down and take notes of what they say and do your own research. Trust, but verify: meaning have faith in someone or something, but be sure to confirm their trustworthiness independently. Don\u2019t take everything they say as written in stone. They\u2019re only there for guidance and it\u2019s university representatives who really have the final say. Talk to your parents or college siblings if you think they can help. Talk to your high school teachers and see what they say. It\u2019s always good to get as many opinions as possible because experience talks, but at the end of the day you have the final say in what you wanna do.\n\nDon\u2019t take it the wrong way but your only a freshman like what? three months into high school? You still have a good amount of time to figure out what you wanna do and what classes you wanna take. The fact that your already thinking this far forward into your future should make you proud of your self. Good job. But make sure to stay on top of things like you are now because four years fly by fast. Reach out to the admissions offices of potential universities you might wanna attend and start asking them questions. That what they\u2019re there for. Ask them for a list of classes you might have to take for your majors. Ask them how dual credit works (or how AP credit works with them if you really absolutely wanna take APs). Ask them literally everything you wanna ask them. That\u2019s literally what they\u2019re getting paid for. To help students. Anyways good luck on your future endeavors bud.",
