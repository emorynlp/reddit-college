  "text": "So I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone with this but it\u2019s the time of the semester when you\u2019re finishing up the last few assignments left in your classes and going straight into finals\u2026\n\nWell currently that is me and idk why I\u2019m stressing so much. I\u2019m passing all my classes. I\u2019m taking 4, 1 A, 2 B\u2019s and a C\u2026\n\nAtm I\u2019m just stressing because I have two essays I need to write for two of my classes along with reading two books in order for me ti do the essay. I\u2019m halfway finished reading one and I still need the next. Both essays are due on Wednesday. One is at least 8 pages and the other is just 2 pages. But the class that I have the 2 page essay in is where I have the C and I\u2019m stressing about failing it. I\u2019ve been getting low Cs and I completely bombed the midterm\u2026so I have to do well on this essay and in my final which is causing most of stress. \n\nOn top of it all I got a new roommate and he\u2019s super loud. We both have our bedrooms but his music is loud, he\u2019s on the phone 24/7 loud and I\u2019m having to have my AirPods on to focus on studying. It\u2019s annoying af. \n\nBesides smoking a joint, which I frequently do to calm my nerves, how do I deal with stress? \n\nI workout as well and helps a lot but I\u2019m not what else to do.",

      "text": "Maybe try some autogenic training and it is really important that you prioritize your tasks/essays.\nOnly concentrate on one essay and ignore the ones that come after. Otherwise you will go in panic mode and can't do anything. Think week after week or day after day. \nIf you struggle with this essay , maybe ask your fellow students how they did it.\nI hope this might help you a little bit.",
