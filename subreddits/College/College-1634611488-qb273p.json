  "text": " Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a current student at Stanford University here to offer extremely affordable college essay help to anyone who wants it! I have a very strong writing background, and even spent my gap year volunteering at a professional college consulting firm where I learned the in's and out's of what makes an essay great.\n\nWhat I'm offering:\n\n1. Full mark-up of any essay of your choice, including general, grammatical, and thematic edits (i.e. how to effectively craft your narrative and show the best side of yourself)\n2. Links to free, online resources to improve your essay (the same resources that helped me write mine)\n3. Cost for one essay is $20\n\nIf you're interested, message me on Reddit and I'll give you my Stanford email to share your essay with, and my Venmo to transfer the funds. Please note that I am doing this to raise money for a club event, and that I'll be editing essay only for today and tomorrow (ending at 6:00pm PDT). I still remember how hard and stressful this period of time is for high school seniors, so I would really love the chance to help any anxious students out! Looking forward to hearing back from you all!",
