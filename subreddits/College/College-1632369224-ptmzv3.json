If you do think the course lecture might help you do it, then wait. \n\nSome online classes are just coursework lined up in the queue and is all dependent on your independent study alone. A \"ground\" class is mainly just that with an attendance grade, which I prefer because you get part of a grade just for occupying a physical space, and those online only classes tend to tack on busy work to overcompensate for the lack of course lecture.", "author": "zoyathedestroyah", "created": 1632370065, "upvotes": 1}, "hdxc41d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptmzv3/doing_assignments_ahead_on_canvas/hdxc41d/", "text": "This doesn\u2019t bother me when students do it, but I always caution them that I still expect them to apply course concepts correctly, so they need to read/prepare ahead, too.", "author": "PhDapper", "created": 1632369802, "upvotes": 2}, "hdxbd54": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptmzv3/doing_assignments_ahead_on_canvas/hdxbd54/", "text": "I would read the syllabus or check with the professor.
