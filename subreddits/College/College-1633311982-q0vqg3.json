  "title:": "Took a semester off. Can't seem to focus to get anything done now that I'm back.",
  "text": "I used to be such a productive student. I went to a very challenging high school and easily studied for 4+ hours a night on top of hours of sports a day and other activities. I crushed my first two years of college and got almost all A's while not missing a single assignment.\n\nI took a semester off last spring due to hating online school, but now I can't seem to get ANYTHING done. I've been in school for five weeks and haven't done a single reading or homework assignment, and missed multiple papers. And the thing is, my classes aren't even harder. They are probably easier than most of my previous college courses and even many high school courses. It used to be easy work for me to knock out a 8-10 page paper in a night but now I can't even put my mind on a one page easy assignment.  \n\nI worked outdoor physical labor jobs for eight months before coming back to school and I guess I completely forgot how to sit down at a computer and be productive and use my brain in an academic way.\n\nI'll sit down at my computer for hours staring at a blank assignment or word document, and it's like I can't even get my mind to start thinking about the homework enough to be productive, even if I leave myself plenty of time to work. Even when I manage my time properly, I just can't seem to get my mind to focus on the work until it's too late.\n\nNow I was always a procrastinator and relied on the pressure of doing things last minute to be productive, but I always got EVERYTHING done and now I can't do anything at all. \n\nAnyone else have this problem after a break from school and work through it?",

      "text": "Are you me? but seriously tho I didn't have any motivation at all spring semester. During the summer tho I was very productive and worked 70 hours most weeks, went on vacation before  school started and its like I no longer know how to function. I don't have a sleep schedule. I knew something was off so I signed up for easy classes and still I have no motivation. Like I feel numb.",

      "text": "Yess, I had the same after being away for about 1.5 year. For me, the key was to see my work-span and concentration the same as my physical condition/work-outs. In order to get fit, you have to train it over and over and try to do one tiny bit more every time. \nIt's very logical that your work-span is reduced after not challeging it for a while. So start with a do-able amount and step by step increase the amount of work. Just like training for a marathon. \n\nGood luck with getting back studying and I'm sure in about an half year you'll be back to you highschool study routine.",
