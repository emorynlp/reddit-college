  "title:": "I hate my major and want to switch after 3 years",
  "text": "So I'm a computer science major. I've kept pushing through for the past years but I feel like I barely scraped through all the time. My confidence is super low. I literally don't talk about my course with people cause I'm afraid they'll realize how bad I am at it. I can't do that anymore. Some of the harder courses involve no group work and a lot of coding which I'm bad at. My brain and coding just do not work. Plus I don't want to do any job in tech. I used to think I loved it but doing it for so long has made me realize that I don't.\n\nI don't know how to go about switching as I would move to a completely different major where I am at least confident that I can succeed. I'm already one semester into the school year so I guess I'd have to wait till next September again (not sure).\n\nI don't know how to bring this up with my parents. Especially my dad. He pays my tuition and I feel so bad about switching because I feel like he wasted money on me. But it's gonna continue if I don't find something else to pursue. \n\nI guess I need some advice on how to handle this. Like the big issue or thing that has pulled me back from switching before is having to tell my dad.",

      "text": "If you are this far into the degree, it honestly might be worth it to just plow through. Not saying that is necessarily the right decision for you, but a computer science degree is very versatile. It might be worth doing some research into different careers you find interesting, and seeing if you can get those with a CS degree.",

      "text": "As somebody who is in the same situation, I advise you to switch. Otherwise it will affect your mental state at some point. Yes it's shit. But the only reason you pushed so far was for other people.\nI fell for the plow through, and lost another semester (I'll be 27 if I switch, though I started roughly at 23), well actually years cause I realized early on that I might fail because of the amount and versatility.\nSeriously doing things you hate, it will break you. Switch. You got the luxury of time.",
