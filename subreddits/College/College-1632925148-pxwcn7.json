I live on campus and have my own desktop tower. Have been using the internetfor months now, doing nothing illegal nor having.visited any malicious websites (I've been using the internet.for over a decade now). \n\nToday out of nowhere, my device is blocked from having internet. Called the tech guys on campus, they say the pnoy way to unblock it is to have their antivirus installed on my computer.\n\nDoes this make sense? Is this a normal thing? I really dont feel secure having anyone's antivirus installed on my computer, especially if it means theyll have access to all of my files. \n\nIf this is normal, is there any way to circumvent this?", "author": "banshithread", "created": 1632925148, "retrieved": 1632945353, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"herbs88": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxwcn7/college_wants_to_install_antivirus_on_computer_in/herbs88/", "text": "It's not uncommon. It was required by my undergrad university when I entered 12 years ago and every campus I knew of back then had this rule. I wouldn't be surprised if it's less common now because I'm sure someone's come up with better ways to handle security than to force students to download specific antivirus software, but schools are lazy and don't necessarily update the way they do things.\n\n> is there any way to circumvent this?\n\nDon't try to circumvent it. By doing so, you'd risk breaking the school's rules which could lead to suspension or the like because now that you're an adult actions can have actual consequences and you don't want to get caught up in shit just because of some annoying rule you don't want to follow.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632942960, "upvotes": 1}, "heq7slu": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxwcn7/college_wants_to_install_antivirus_on_computer_in/heq7slu/", "text": "It's standard.

Thats my opinion and like i said ive never heard of anywhere doing this. Id try and find more info on it and see whats going on because it sounds really weird.", "author": "SVUVESPER", "created": 1632925385, "upvotes": 3}}}
