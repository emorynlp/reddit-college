  "text": "I\u2019m talking math 141, and instead of taking exams that give you credit for most of your work we take learning targets which are quizzes taken every week and if you make one small mistake you have to take it again. So far I\u2019ve only passed one learning target and you have to pass 15 to get a C. The semester end is coming up and I feel like I\u2019m falling way behind and I don\u2019t really know what to do. I could only drop the class but that would result in me falling under the 12 credit mark of being a full-time student. I\u2019m really stressed about this and not sure what to do",
