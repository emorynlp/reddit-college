Plus, enjoy it all, sometimes I take a step back and I'm glad I enjoyed the process and everything I learned.

They don\u2019t realize the work load they\u2019ll have compared to their easy life in HS. This is especially worse when you go to a top university, not because it might be harder, but rather you are only comparing yourself to high achieving people. \n\nJust know that you aren\u2019t alone in your freshman struggle, and that things will get better. College is not only a place to get educated, but also a place to grow as a person. You will learn that things aren\u2019t easy, and that you have to take care of everything yourself, even yourself. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t compare yourself to the success of others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday\u201d - Jordan Peterson \nEveryday try and grow as a person, no matter how little that maybe.

My grades are not a reflection of who I am as a person or how I deserve to be treated. If I do well, that's great, but that doesn't make my self-worth higher. If I do poorly, I am no lesser as a person.\n\nConfidence and self-worth should come from a purely internal place, otherwise you'd never grow in the face of adversity. \n\nGrades are an ongoing process, not a final judgement on your intelligence. Depending on the test, it is more a measure of your test taking ability. Even A students fail sometimes.\n\nI consider myself a good student and study for tests and even I fail.

I found that when I was still majoring in maths everyone around me was able to grasp concepts quicker than I could so it was a little demotivating and I felt the same as you. So rather than focus on the grades, I focused on the learning. Sometimes I did need to watch a tutorial or yt video here and there but everytime I felt a spark where I slowly began to connect dots between the concepts presented I felt boosts in confidence and think hey that wasn't so bad. So my suggestion is to not worry to much about the grades, sure it's nice to get that A but in the end it's how much you yourself can take away and apply it. I mean, in the long run, the end game is to find a job right? If you try your best and look back and say hey, I went from not knowing to being able to understand it! You shouldn't underestimate yourself! You're doing great.

There are many other factors that affect your grades, one major one being the prof -- professors don't all have the same expectations and, as a result, they grade differently. Some profs didn't intend to ever teach, they're employed for research and teaching is a requirement they have to do, so they might grade you differently than the prof who really wants to help you learn, grow, and develop your skills.\n\nYou are not the only factor when it comes to your grades. Yes, you choose your classes, and yes, you will have your own academic strengths and weaknesses, but the grade is not 100% on you. So when you remember that, it's easier to remain confident. Just don't let that keep you from continuing to work at it (don't start slacking just because you think the prof is grading you too harshly -- if you think the prof is grading you too harshly, speak to the prof and determine their expectations).", "author": "xPadawanRyan", "created": 1573216326, "upvotes": 249}}}
