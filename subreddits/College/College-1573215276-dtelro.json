  "text": "Okay, so i've been feeling really down lately. Feeling more useless than usual and my confidence is going downhill. I was never like this before. I used to be very opinionated and is not afraid to speak up. But lately, i can't even have myself suggest things even in group works where i usually lead most of the time. I can't even study in libraries. Because i dont want to look dumb to people while im trying to watch tutorial vids in youtube.\n\nEdit: I didn't expect this too blow up at all. I've read all your comments and i'm really thankful for everybody who replied. It will take some time, but i will try to practice the mindset that most of you have suggested. Thanks guys!",

      "text": "Good grades will help you with 2 things. Landing your first job out of college and graduate school. If you're not interested in graduate school, doesn't matter. It will limit the number of jobs available to you, but if you're smart about your job search you'll find your way around that. Focus your job hunt on companies where you know someone that works there. Makes a big difference. Once you have some job experience your GPA becomes irrelevant. Do great at your first job and the rest of your career will go just fine.\n\nI graduated with a 2.9 in Computer Engineering. I'm 6 years out of college and now make 155k a year plus benefits. No one has asked for it since my first job after college (I've had 5).\n\nMy only regret is that if I wanted to go back and do law school my GPA will affect what kind of school I can get into.",

By forcefully I mean just open up your books or notes and start reading and writing. Even if you get bad grades (highly unlikely after this), just remember u gave ur best effort. Keep your confidence up and try again. There's no test in the world which u can't crack if ur persistent enough . Have a great day!",

      "text": "Dude, I legit failed my first college math class and I'm a math major. I was so down that I considered dropping out because I thought I was too dumb for college. I realized I was just overwhelmed and needed to chill and take on less of a load.   \nI began with not trying to keep up with the Joneses because I realized I wanted to take 6 classes like my friends but our majors were different difficulty levels.  Then, I got over the idea I was dumb and that I just needed to watch those pearson videos and Khan academy vids and I stopped gaf. \n\nI took the class the following semester and got an A and somehow my confidence went up with it and I've been doing well since then. I even tutor math now haha... so it was a complete 180. \n\nSo, keep your head up and adjust to what you can handle, never compare yourself, and don't worry about those around you. Plus, enjoy it all, sometimes I take a step back and I'm glad I enjoyed the process and everything I learned. I'm also a mentor now at school and I always share with newcomers the importance of pacing yourself and setting yourself up for success. Next semester is my last one and I have two easy A electives left with 2 difficult 4000 classes. It's good if you can ask seniors or alumni what the most difficult classes will be in order to save easy A classes to take with them.   \n\n\nGood Luck and remember...\n\n# \"Everybody is a Genius.

They certainly don't reflect your ability and competence. Do not tie your grades to your self worth. The most important thing is to understand what you are being asked to do\n\n2. Once it is clear what the professor wants you to do to get a good grade, for most courses it's about putting the effort in. Go talk to the TAs, Professor, your peers if you don't understand something, but you need to put the effort in. You will start seeing the results soon \ud83d\ude0a all the best!",

The difference is some people look at school as everything, they treat their gpa like a it\u2019s a direct correlation to their future salary. Successful people talk about school as a stepping stone and as just one way to educate yourself. Your whole like you should be growing and learning, not just your first 22 years.

What really matters is that you put the effort in and that you make your college experience as fulfilling as possible. Don\u2019t just laze around or skip class (not saying that you do) and then complain about grades. I feel good when I know I put effort into studying as least.",

The mindset that helped me was thinking that I did my best, and no matter what the results, it's just a figure. Move on, and continue doing your best.

Now, that may change as you get toward higher levels of education of course, but you seriously should not worry about looking stupid. School is a place for people to learn. You literally go into school with zero knowledge of some of the subjects your learning. Maybe the first time you've even been introduced to some subject or concept. Give yourself some credit, buckle down the hatches and grind. If you dont understand a concept, get a tutor or friend to explain it to you pedantically if need be. There is no shame in not understanding a concept, lord knows I'm not the brightest crayon in the box. That can be easily forgiven. It is a problem though, if your not willing to put in the work. That cannot be so easily forgiven. Good luck to you\ud83d\ude4f",

I found that when I was still majoring in maths everyone around me was able to grasp concepts quicker than I could so it was a little demotivating and I felt the same as you.

Sometimes I did need to watch a tutorial or yt video here and there but everytime I felt a spark where I slowly began to connect dots between the concepts presented I felt boosts in confidence and think hey that wasn't so bad. So my suggestion is to not worry to much about the grades, sure it's nice to get that A but in the end it's how much you yourself can take away and apply it. I mean, in the long run, the end game is to find a job right? If you try your best and look back and say hey, I went from not knowing to being able to understand it! You shouldn't underestimate yourself! You're doing great. Believe it.",

      "text": "Just remember that your grades are not a reflection of your personal abilities. There are many other factors that affect your grades, one major one being the prof -- professors don't all have the same expectations and, as a result, they grade differently. Some profs didn't intend to ever teach, they're employed for research and teaching is a requirement they have to do, so they might grade you differently than the prof who really wants to help you learn, grow, and develop your skills.\n\nYou are not the only factor when it comes to your grades. Yes, you choose your classes, and yes, you will have your own academic strengths and weaknesses, but the grade is not 100% on you. So when you remember that, it's easier to remain confident. Just don't let that keep you from continuing to work at it (don't start slacking just because you think the prof is grading you too harshly -- if you think the prof is grading you too harshly, speak to the prof and determine their expectations).",

              "text": "\"I can't even study in libraries?\" You have to get past how you're viewed and buckle down and put more effort. \n\nAvoiding \"looking dumb\" will ensure that you \"look dumb\" in the future. The smartest people that I know can appear \"dumb\" sometimes. You know why? They aren't afraid to ask questions. Even questions that most people know the answers to. They have no fear about how they are perceived and have gotten past that. The more important thing for them is that they know and understand the subject matter, even at the cost of appearing to not understand something. \n\nI'm 38 years old and have been in the insurance industry for about 17 years now. What I'm suggesting isn't easy and requires a personality shift which usually happens over the course of one's career. But the sooner you can do it the better off you'll be in the future. \n\nMaybe you're just using it as an excuse to not study? Be honest with yourself. Are you afraid to speak up in groups because you don't know the material? If you don't know the material then why? If you put forth the effort and study regardless of how you're perceived you'll do fine. Trust me on that. \n\nNothing will improve your confidence more than mastering the material. There is no better way to master the material than to study hard and practice a lot. If you get a bad grade ask yourself why or how that happened. What was the root cause? Sometimes you will have a d-bag professor and it just happens. Don't let that get you down. But don't just write it off as such. Soldier on and learn how to get better with each course. Make sure you understand what each professor is requiring at the beginning of the semester. If you're not sure, ask. \n\nYou can do this! Don't ever sell yourself short!",
