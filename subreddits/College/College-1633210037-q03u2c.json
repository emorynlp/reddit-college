  "text": "So I (15F) have always been told that college comes before anything else. \u201cDrop-outs\u201d were demonized to me and it seems in our society college is what makes an adult an adult. I have a lot of anxiety and I\u2019ve been back and fourth on careers my whole life. Detective, Chef, Business Owner, Writer, Designer: Just could never decide. In recent years I\u2019ve been thinking about how cool it would be to be a chef. Mr dream would be a baker, as I\u2019ve always loved working with breads and using cakes to make art. But I don\u2019t wanna be na\u00efve, baking just doesn\u2019t bring in money. Working as a chef can though! But that brings me to my main point. Is college worth it? Student loans and fafsa all really freaks me out. I don\u2019t have any parental support and it just scares me. I know I\u2019m still a kid, but I\u2019m on the track to graduate highschool in a few months (16 in December). I\u2019ve decided that what I do in my future doesn\u2019t entirely matter to me, as baking is my favorite hobby and I can make money with it on the side. As long as I\u2019m with my girlfriend I\u2019m pretty positive I\u2019ll be happy. My career doesn\u2019t entirely matter to me if I can earn enough to support us. \nThe idea of college terrifies me. Absolutely just scares the shit out of me. I don\u2019t want it to seem like because it scares me I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, but I hear all these stories of people who don\u2019t use their degree or aren\u2019t passionate in their field. I just want someone to tell me what to do at this point. Should I waste my time and money going through with a degree if it doesn\u2019t end up going anywhere? I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m still a kid, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing! I do think I want to take a gap year to earn money in between. I\u2019m on leave from work right now for some personal reasons but I\u2019ve been a waitress for almost two years now and I intend on keeping my job (which I love) until college and possibly during. I guess I\u2019m turning to Reddit because I know there\u2019s lots of people like me who have questions about college who can also find answers; and people with success and failure stories. So let me have it! I\u2019m really looking for any help you can provide. Thanks everyone \ud83e\udd0e\nPM\u2019s are open as well.",

      "text": ">  I do think I want to take a gap year to earn money in between.\n\nThis sounds like a good idea. Most freshmen who are coming in straight out of high school aren't ready for college, and they'd be better served getting some life experience so that they can develop a better idea of what they want out of life before jumping into a major they may or may not be interested in and accruing debt. \n\nAlso, being 16 in college is just a bad idea, imo. Maturity is always an asset in college, and as a whole even the 18 and 19 year olds there have yet to develop the maturity to make good use of their time (not to mention the awkwardness with being a kid around adults who want to do adults things).\n\nIf you work and try out different things before entering college you'll then have the ability to develop the outlook needed to be successful in college (if you choose to go to college). Many, many students enter college without the slightest idea of what they're doing and end up wasting a lot of money as a result.",

      "text": "If you plan on still living at home, go work in those fields and see if you like it. If you plan to make serious money as a chef, you'll need a culinary arts degree. Opening your own business? You'll probably want to take some class in the business field, and take some statistics courses.\n\nCollege isn't too dreadful. And it does help you find out what you're good at vs what you're interested in. Start with your electives, since they're easier, will open you up to new fields you may not have ever considered, and are an introduction to the college routine of schedule planning, studying tactics, and tackling finals. You're 15, a lot is going to happen in to you in the next few years that might change your perspective on what you want to do with your life. Especially after you graduate high school and enter the adult world.\n\nGoing the work route is fine too. It's good to build up your resume experience. I didn't wind up taking any majoring college courses until after I got out of the Army and knew the direction I wanted to head.  I will admit, the sooner you enroll in college after high school, the more of that information you'll retain and be prepared for in college. Me, I was in my late 20's in a classroom full of 17-18 year olds. I definitely had some catching up to do.",

      "text": "You could go to community college (save lots of $$) and have your major as general studies or something like that and maybe figure out then what you want to do. Of course you can always later transfer to a 4 year institution. Also check if your community college offers things like certificate programs, which can usually be done in less than a year, saving even more money. \n\nBelieve it or not CC and regular old university aren\u2019t all that different. They follow the same standards really, and you save incredible amounts at CC (which really shouldn\u2019t be necessary tbh). In fact, some people report a better learning experience at community college than a 4 year due to the smaller class sizes and professors actually being there to teach, not just do research (though these are just anecdotes I\u2019ve read, not raw stats or anything).",

It\u2019s just courses and credits and at the end you get a diploma. At first it was hard to go at a consistent self-pace that was sustainable but I leaned into it. I haven\u2019t taken any summer breaks. While sometimes in a fit of depression I ignore my schoolwork for a while, I get back on top of it pretty easily. I think in the end it was the best option for me. Just a little lonely. Thanks for asking!",

That helps in college (students don\u2019t realize just how easy and stress-free they have it in grade school, you\u2019re teacher is handling a lot of the stuff and you move at a much slower pace having 6-9 month long classes compared to 3 months here). Take it from someone who procrastinated almost a whole month away and has to cram for two midterms in 10 days. You don\u2019t want to do that shit in college.",
