      "text": "Dust buster, mini fridge, mop, broom, microwave, keep the about 45 inches or smaller, really depends on the size of your desk. For fucks sakes don\u2019t wait to buy a plunger when you NEED it, bring one with you... one of those shower carpets for when you get out of the shower... if you can get a loft for your bed, I highly recommend it, it creates heaps and bounds of potential room and opens the dorm up so much more. Also i recommend a good area rug, because if your dorm has tile floors they get really cold, and cause calloused feet which are gross. Don\u2019t bring a router or anything that connects to WiFi, right off the bat if it doesn\u2019t have an Ethernet port (unless it\u2019s your laptop, that\u2019s necessary,) my dorms wouldn\u2019t let your google home mini, fire sticks, or other such things connect to WiFi to keep from plugging up the bandwidth... Bring an Ethernet cable just in case, Walmart has them for like $10-$15 depending on the length, get Cat6 if possible it will give you a hair faster internet. Plenty of command hooks and use them they\u2019re a life saver for running cables neatly, putting at the room door or by your bed to hang keys (if your like me you misplace keys a lot, so this was a life saver) and just hanging things in general. Bring a trash can WITH A LID OF SOME SORT. You want that bitch to close to prevent your room from smelling, and if you\u2019re like me and my roommate you won\u2019t produce a huge amount of trash. It can get a bit unsightly, also reminds you to take it out if you can\u2019t close the lid, also girls and dudes the same don\u2019t like seeing a can full of trash if you bring them back to your dorm. Get a little aroma diffuser with good smelling essential oils... (look up essential oil diffusers on amazon, they sell nice ones for cheap) nobody likes a smelly room. The rules for the dorms might say not to but just say you use it for the humidifier if they have a problem with it... They won\u2019t have a problem with it if they\u2019re not a stick up the ass because it smells good (be careful with asthmatic people on this, just use your best judgement.) Just saying from experience it turns a girl on (dudes the same) if your room is clean and free of clutter AND smells good... a clothes hamper that closes is nice too, keep it in your closet if you can, but if you can\u2019t at least you won\u2019t see the mounds of clothes piling up in it, and it helps with the odor of socks and other things you might workout in.\n\nClearly you\u2019ll want to bring your clothes and shit that you want, but don\u2019t wait to bring winter shit so you don\u2019t have to go all the way home to unpack it from your closet to bring it back...\n\nIf your dorms are anything like mine, they have three power outlets, and all on one fckn side of the room, make sure to get there before your roommate does so you can claim that side... in all seriousness though you want that side... bring several power strips, and a couple 15 ft extension cords. Get 2 prong to 3 prong adapters too for the plug ends.\n\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD BRING A MOMENTO OR SOMETHING FROM HOME... I know you say you won\u2019t, but you\u2019ll miss home. The first weeks on your own are nice, you\u2019re free from the responsibilities your parents hand out and can do the mundane cleaning and taking the trash out on your own free will... but I swear to god and the holy trinity that it will wear off and you will have some sort of mild break down when the every single responsibility rains down on you at once. I witnessed my roommate (a 6\u20196\u201d 230 pound black dude who was raised in the 60s block of Kansas City, built like a fckn train) break down in tears bc he realized he\u2019s not a kid anymore... he\u2019s an adult who has his own responsibilities and has to act like it... I helped him through this by sitting in the middle of our dorm room floor and talking about life and what\u2019s going to become of it. Others may not have anything like this (I had one though, that shit hit hard too...) and slowly forget what built them as a person... look at this item and remember why you are the way you are, whether good or bad. Escaping from an abusive family? Look at it and remember why you\u2019ll never be like that... First person to college in your fam? Look at it and tell yourself \u201cima be the first to graduate college in my family too.\u201d Having a hard time in classes, look at this momento and remind yourself why you are there in the first place, what built you as a person, and why you are choosing to better yourself. It helps a lot trust me...",

You want to make sure your room feels like a place you want to go home to every night. Tapestries, posters, and plants can go a long way to help with this. However, some schools don\u2019t want you to cover more than a certain percentage of the wall, so be mindful of that. Also get one of those assortments of command hooks, as you typically can\u2019t put nails in the walls.",

I\u2019d try to stay away from the typical college dorm aesthetic, flags and posters of your favorite alcoholic beverage. Unless you\u2019re really into that, then you do you. Make sure to get some photos of your family and friends, put those somewhere you\u2019ll see everyday. Don\u2019t want to forget about the people that care about you, but make sure it\u2019s not a one of a kind photo as things get lost and ruined in dorms frequently. Side note, get one of those mirrors that goes over a door, a lot of dorms don\u2019t have mirrors in the room, and you don\u2019t want to be checking yourself out in the communal bathroom.",

I've seen some gross dorm rooms. Trash can, disinfectant, a broom and dustpan. I've found swiffer mops to be super helpful too. Cleaning supplies are something that you will definitely use and you probably will have people asking to borrow them as well. \n\n If you live somewhere cold, then a nice soft rug is great in the winter because the floor gets really cold. If you do get a rug, it's convenient to also have a mini hand vacuum of some sort as well.",

It seems like enough, but then you have to connect the microwave, fridge, your laptops, your phones, (I am an engineering student so I had to charge things in the kits given to me while I worked on programming it).\n\nCommand hooks are your best friend, I used them on the cabinet dresser closet and hung my towel/bathroom bag in. (You should have a mesh-like small bag to store your soaps in to take with you to the showers because you do not want to put them down on potentially dirty surfaces!). We also hung small things like umbrellas or holders on the sides of our desks with the command hooks. \n\nI think the real issue would be to pack light. I overpacked out of fear that I wouldn't have all the things I needed at hand, and I ended up going through so much hell packing everything up and moving out. Trust me, you do not need as much clothes/towels/shoes than you think. However, if you live in a place where it is colder, or you know that you will be cold easily, I suggest to bring warmer clothes and a few comfy sweaters. \n\nUnfortunately, my dorm building had a problem with mice so all of the girls had their snacks bitten through or eaten. If you think this may potentially be a problem, bring a 20ish gallon transparent bin with a lockable lid. If you like condiments such as hot sauce, soy sauce, honey,  bring those too! It is frustrating when you finally get to relax from all the hard work you did with the perfect meal and netflix on, but then realizing you don't have any hot sauce to put on your favorite food. 1 reusable water bottle (mine had a built in filter) was also super convenient for me. The best tool I had in my room also was an electronic kettle, its small and portable and heated up water for my noodles (or tea) super quickly. That was one of my best investments in my opinion.\n\nI saw a comment on bringing an essiential oil diffuser: I highly second it because it made my room smell so pleasant and anyone who entered always complimented it. \n\nGood luck in your freshman year!!",

Having an area underneath your bed where you can work at a desk and just chill out was absolutely essential, I was able to be in my room without being on my bed. It also opens up so much more space and everything feels less cluttered. Plus, you have your own space where you don\u2019t have to worry about imposing on your roommate. **If you\u2019re lofting your bed, I would highly recommend getting a rug to put underneath**.
