For fucks sakes don\u2019t wait to buy a plunger when you NEED it, bring one with you... one of those shower carpets for when you get out of the shower... if you can get a loft for your bed, I highly recommend it, it creates heaps and bounds of potential room and opens the dorm up so much more. Also i recommend a good area rug, because if your dorm has tile floors they get really cold, and cause calloused feet which are gross. Don\u2019t bring a router or anything that connects to WiFi, right off the bat if it doesn\u2019t have an Ethernet port (unless it\u2019s your laptop, that\u2019s necessary,) my dorms wouldn\u2019t let your google home mini, fire sticks, or other such things connect to WiFi to keep from plugging up the bandwidth... Bring an Ethernet cable just in case, Walmart has them for like $10-$15 depending on the length, get Cat6 if possible it will give you a hair faster internet. Plenty of command hooks and use them they\u2019re a life saver for running cables neatly, putting at the room door or by your bed to hang keys (if your like me you misplace keys a lot, so this was a life saver) and just hanging things in general. Bring a trash can WITH A LID OF SOME SORT. You want that bitch to close to prevent your room from smelling, and if you\u2019re like me and my roommate you won\u2019t produce a huge amount of trash. It can get a bit unsightly, also reminds you to take it out if you can\u2019t close the lid, also girls and dudes the same don\u2019t like seeing a can full of trash if you bring them back to your dorm. Get a little aroma diffuser with good smelling essential oils... (look up essential oil diffusers on amazon, they sell nice ones for cheap) nobody likes a smelly room. The rules for the dorms might say not to but just say you use it for the humidifier if they have a problem with it... They won\u2019t have a problem with it if they\u2019re not a stick up the ass because it smells good (be careful with asthmatic people on this, just use your best judgement.) Just saying from experience it turns a girl on (dudes the same) if your room is clean and free of clutter AND smells good... a clothes hamper that closes is nice too, keep it in your closet if you can, but if you can\u2019t at least you won\u2019t see the mounds of clothes piling up in it, and it helps with the odor of socks and other things you might workout in.\n\nClearly you\u2019ll want to bring your clothes and shit that you want, but don\u2019t wait to bring winter shit so you don\u2019t have to go all the way home to unpack it from your closet to bring it back...\n\nIf your dorms are anything like mine, they have three power outlets, and all on one fckn side of the room, make sure to get there before your roommate does so you can claim that side... in all seriousness though you want that side... bring several power strips, and a couple 15 ft extension cords. Get 2 prong to 3 prong adapters too for the plug ends.\n\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD BRING A MOMENTO OR SOMETHING FROM HOME... I know you say you won\u2019t, but you\u2019ll miss home. The first weeks on your own are nice, you\u2019re free from the responsibilities your parents hand out and can do the mundane cleaning and taking the trash out on your own free will... but I swear to god and the holy trinity that it will wear off and you will have some sort of mild break down when the every single responsibility rains down on you at once. I witnessed my roommate (a 6\u20196\u201d 230 pound black dude who was raised in the 60s block of Kansas City, built like a fckn train) break down in tears bc he realized he\u2019s not a kid anymore... he\u2019s an adult who has his own responsibilities and has to act like it... I helped him through this by sitting in the middle of our dorm room floor and talking about life and what\u2019s going to become of it. Others may not have anything like this (I had one though, that shit hit hard too...) and slowly forget what built them as a person... look at this item and remember why you are the way you are, whether good or bad. Escaping from an abusive family? Look at it and remember why you\u2019ll never be like that... First person to college in your fam? Look at it and tell yourself \u201cima be the first to graduate college in my family too.\u201d Having a hard time in classes, look at this momento and remind yourself why you are there in the first place, what built you as a person, and why you are choosing to better yourself.
