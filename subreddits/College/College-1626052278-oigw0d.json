  "text": "Am I the only one whose feeling a bit of anxiety about like going back to seeing people in person on campus?? \n\nI know I didn\u2019t do a great job with maintaining like 99% of my relationships with college friends since covid (I\u2019ve been home like away from school literally since right when covid hit) and I kinda got screwed with housing so I\u2019m now living alone coming back to campus for my last year. \n\nPart of me is like ??? Wtf am I gonna do like living alone ??? But the other part of me is thinking like maybe I\u2019m just overthinking???? Idk just could use some positive thoughts I guess lol",

It's just going to be weird at first.",
