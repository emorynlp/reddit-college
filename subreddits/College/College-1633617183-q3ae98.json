  "text": "I\u2019m good at studying but I\u2019m not good at studying for exams. \n\nPreviously I only had 3 subjects so I had time to learn every letter of the lecture slides. But now having 6 subjects, this method of study isn\u2019t feasible anymore as I don\u2019t have enough time nor memory space. \n\nI\u2019ve been told to pay attention to the learning objectives and past papers. However, what I worry about with this approach is that I would miss out points from specific questions. How should one study the big picture and not miss any minor detail?",
