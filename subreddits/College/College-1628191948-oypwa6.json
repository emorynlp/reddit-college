I think it\u2019s cool that you get to hang out with people of different ages and different places but to engage in \u201csexual behaviors\u201d around girls/boys much younger than them it\u2019s a problem. Seniors/Juniors have so much to offer than other freshman and it\u2019s true. They have the apartments, the cars, they know the city, go to the most \u201cluxurious\u201d or \u201cpopular\u201d parties and know everyone around. They\u2019ve been learning all of that since they were new. I don\u2019t think this might be a problem at all but maybe that\u2019s why some girls and boys feel like they need to hangout with the older people, they give so much but what are they asking of you in return? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of seniors at my college and they\u2019ve been one of the nicest people around me, they didn\u2019t ask me for anything and whenever I or my friends need advice on a class or something they help us. I\u2019m saying that some of them don\u2019t have the best intentions, and that\u2019s where the problem starts. Things like the signs with the weird and creepy titles that OP talked about are completely out of place. Yeah, we know frats are the stereotypical crazy party people and that idea comes from TV and movies that portrays them in this way. I\u2019m not in a frat or a full time party guy but I have frat friends that told me, \u201cyeah\u201d, this behavior is pretty common.\n\nMy best advice would be to honestly just make sure you\u2019re hanging out with right people, watching out for red flags and taking care of yourself and your friends. It\u2019s sad that everyone has to live on alert if something happens but honestly nowadays what\u2019s not likely to happen?
