Or go straight with the professor I've done online tutoring sessions and I mean half of them didn't really work out it's hard to explain social learning is why it's hard to be like oh I didn't get this at the last minute while your racing against the clock with some random person you don't know with a problem and no context and just jump on it expecting all the missing pieces come together. You need somebody who can easily point out your mistakes and can see what's wrong why you don't get it alot of tutors even paid won't tell you like actually help you like oh you know what I see the problem you don't get 3.1 ok read 3.1 if it doesn't work well go over that. \nAlot of stuff especially math is because your missing some knowledge alot of times a tutor paid or free won't tell you this. There are free at most college s but still then you have limits and these tutors get paid by the minute so if you don't get something and it takes them 3 hours to go over something simple then that's what it is even if it costs you the class. Picking the right tutor is important. Paid or free. Nothing is truly free. Time is money.",
