  "text": "OKAY people told me to tell my professor that I\u2019m going blind on the last post I made here but I\u2019m not entirely sure how to format my message to him? Do I just tell him I\u2019ve been lacking motivation because I found out I\u2019m going blind??? Help! I need advice. I don\u2019t want to make it seem like I\u2019m throwing a pity party for myself even though I pretty much am.",

I have been struggling emotionally with the prospect of going blind and it has distracted me from my studies this entire term. I just wanted you to know my missing assignments have nothing to do with your course or a lack of interest in learning [SUBJECT]. It is all related to my diagnosis and the strain it has put on my mental health.\n\nI am trying to figure out the best plan of action for me going forward and welcome any advice you might have. Thank you again for understanding.\u201d",
