I  honestly didn\u2019t think there was anything else to do and I was trying to state that working might be your only (or at least the \u201ceasiest\u201d and most lucrative) option. You don\u2019t have to be such an asshole. I was just trying to help.\n\nHow was I supposed to know you had a job when all you stated was \u201cother than scholarships\u201d how to pay for studying abroad? You could have just replied saying that you already have a job and need other streams of income in order to save and I would\u2019ve been happy to try and come up with something different,  but instead you just assumed the worse and chose to be a dick. Include more information next time instead of just expecting everyone to know your financial situation and being rude when they answer your question and it isn\u2019t good enough for you.",
