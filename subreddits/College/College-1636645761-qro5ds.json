  "text": "my school offers a cyber security major that they are in no way equipped to offer, i transferred in the spring of '20 and since have been amazed with how poor the program is run. there is barely any professors that have any experience in the field and there is no structure to classes or real cyber security information being taught. i have been trying to talk to department chairs and deans for help and finally they want to meet with me. \n\ni understand nothing will change and they will try to blame students for not learning but what can i do in this situation. they offered a meeting with the dean of our programs school and the department chair. it would be a 2 on 1 meeting which im ok with since i can stand my ground. \n\nwhat should i do in this situation, i am comfortable advocating for my fellow students since we have discussed how we feel often so i know how they feel too. is there someone on campus i can have sit with me to so maybe i have another admin to advocate with with so they dont just brush me off again?",
