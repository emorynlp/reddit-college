  "text": "So I\u2019m getting the iPad pro for college and I\u2019m considering whether it\u2019s worth buying the magic keyboard with the trackpad. It is like $200 more expensive than a keyboard without it and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m gonna use it. I\u2019m planning on using the iPad mainly for taking notes with the Apple pencil. I also have a macbook pro so the iPad isn\u2019t really gonna replace the macbook. What do you guys think? Is the trackpad worth it? If you have it, do you personally use it?",

I use my iPad for written notes and Mac for typed notes. In my experience, it\u2019s a pain in the ass trying to type on an iPad like you would a computer.",
