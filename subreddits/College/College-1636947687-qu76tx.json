  "title:": "Is it rude to ask my roommate to buy a silent mouse?",
  "text": "My roommate is a gamer.  I have no idea what games he plays but they all involve clicking. Lots of it. He basically lays on his bed with a laptop all day and plays games, clicking constantly. I was fine with this for a while when he played games with intermittent bursts of clicks, but he has been clicking rapidly for about 6 hours straight at this point and it is driving me absolutely insane. I have now left to go study somewhere else, but it's a sunday so most buildings are closed and I don't have many options. Is it unreasonable to ask him to buy a silent clicker mouse if he is going to play games in our dorm all day? I understand that it is his space too, but at the same time, it is my space and my other roommate's space, and I feel like we should be able to actually focus in our room.",

      "text": "I think it's fine if you get along otherwise. I'm on the other side of this - I play games primarily at night and although I thought it was okay since I had everything muted/wasn't on vc, my roommate asked me if I could buy a quieter mouse eventually so I did. It's not really a big deal, and most people should reasonably understand that when you share a space some accommodations should be made.",
