  "text": "Does anyone else feel like information has been a little commodified thanks to increases in educational pursuits?\n\nThe reason why is because truthfully, you pay for a grade. You do not pay for an education, as you never truly stop learning. Anyone who tells you otherwise has bought into the illusion. \n\nI\u2019m in a class called sociology of aging. And I\u2019m really thinking to myself, did we pay for lists of factoids about aging that we could\u2019ve gotten from the Professor free of charge in order to spew empty analyses for the grade. \n\nPeople don\u2019t give a shit about what they learn in class. It\u2019s just a means to an end. I truthfully believe we\u2019ve made degrees and educational status a product to not only be bought with money, but knowledge. \n\nIn theory that makes sense. However, I am starting to realize that truthfully it\u2019s downplaying the actual value of facts as things that lead to deeper understandings about the world, instead of currency I have to pay towards a teacher for a grade.\n\nInformation is now seen as a means to get a grade, and not the greatest force we have as an intelligent species. But hey, just my two cents.",

I\u2019m studying chemistry because I legitimately love the subject and hope to do something in it later\n\nI could read a book about organic chemistry on OpenStax for free, but that wouldn\u2019t give me access to a lab to perform experiments or individual attention at a tutoring center (that also wouldn\u2019t give me access to the non-educational benefits of college such as networking)\n\nThere are definitely a lot of students who don\u2019t care about anything other than a grade, but I think you\u2019re assuming your experience applies a lot more broadly than it actually does",

Especially with the price tags on colleges nowadays, I just don\u2019t see how that ends up being worthwhile or good for society. If you\u2019re gonna put up a paywall, make it more than just a paywall.",

Making people go that much in to debt to not only take unrelated courses (like the one I mentioned in the post), but also to do what they love. Barring intelligent people simply for profits for a product is truly bizarre.",
