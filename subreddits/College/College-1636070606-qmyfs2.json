  "text": "Next semester for my general Ed I want to focus on one of my math credit. Don't get me wrong I liked algebra in High School. I did struggle with geometry. Well of course I struggled with both. I would choose algebra  But have there option of choosing other Math classes of course. One I was thinking about is intro to statistics. So what I'm trying to ask is has anyone took statistics class? What is like? (All math classes at my community college are all online)",
