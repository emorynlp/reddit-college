  "text": " I moved out my Mom\u2019s house because I realized how abusive and toxic she was But I don't have the money or resources to keep staying so I am applying for different jobs I\u2019m taking online classes at my university but my grades are really low this semester and I\u2019m considering dropping out.  But I want to go to school later.  \n\nI am job hunting right now and everything is so stressful. I saw that I can do grade forgiveness for two classes once this semester is over. I don\u2019t know if I should bring my grades up as much as possible  while working or quit school and work full time. I found a place this is around $750 a month and comes with internet and TV.",

      "text": "As to dropping out, I wouldn\u2019t. Why? Because (I have no evidence and this is a hypothesis) the probability of you returning and graduating is much lower than if keep going. \n\nAs to the money situation. It\u2019s not ideal but perhaps try finding a room in a larger house. It\u2019ll be cheaper, and if you can be a good roommate then you might find it enjoyable. \n\nMaybe consider taking a semester off. Which isn\u2019t the end of the world. Find a job that gives you the flexibility you need to continue school. Find a room to rent. Then walk across the stage and shove your degree in your mother\u2019s abusive fucking face.",

      "text": "What's your chosen career path/major? If you don't know what you want to do, or your field isn't something that will let you pay off debt quickly, it might be better to get your feet under you first. If you're going into something where you can handle extra debt for a year while you're adjusting, maybe that's okay. 10k in debt is about an extra $100 per month when it comes to you student loan payments once you graduate, fyi.",

      "text": "Definitely focus on getting on your feet first. If you fail some classes, fine, just come back when you can. I left home because of my insane dad so this is coming from experience. Find a solid enough job (I went UPS supervisor route)(warehouses are solid) and get that apartment. 750$ with included internet is such a good deal. \n\nYou can try to work full-time and do school, its doable, but if you have to choose pick work and just come back to school later. Going to school while you're still in a state of turmoil and change usually leads to subpar grades. If you get comfy in your new life and then come back to class, you'll be in a way better place to do well.\n\nI'd also suggest not thinking of it as \"dropping out\" but as \"putting it on hold\". \n \nAnd finally, try to pull at the heartstrings of your college administration. Really ham up your dire situation to them, theres no shame in it.",
