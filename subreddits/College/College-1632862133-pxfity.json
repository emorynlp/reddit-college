I'm not sure if I want to pursue graduate school or not, but I think this professor could give me some valuable insight, as I may want to become a professor one day too. Also I think he's a cool guy, and I also am very interested in the specific field he specializes in. The only thing is, I don't know what a \"mentor\" relationship actually looks like let alone how to get there or even if that's what I would want. How should I approach him? he has office hours that I sometimes go to.

It's also fine to ask him about his own career, but I wouldn't jump into that at your very first discussion, as questions about one's career can sometimes seem a bit personal if the professor doesn't really know you that well.  \n\nAfterward, assess how the first meeting went.  Did the professor seem attentive and fully engaged when answering your questions, or did it seem like he wasn't that interested and was just answering your questions to be polite or to pass the time?  If the latter, then he might not be interested in any kind of mentoring relationship, so you'd probably just need to look elsewhere.  If the former (he seemed eager to discuss things and answer your questions), then it would probably be fine to keep speaking with the professor about the field and his work.  As you get to know him a bit, you could ask about the possibility of doing undergraduate research or a self-study course, etc., under his direction.\n\nJust go with your gut as to whether he seems interested.  Although professors generally want to help students as much as we can, it just isn't possible for us to get academically involved outside of normal class lectures with every student who walks into the office.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1632865857, "upvotes": 4}}}
