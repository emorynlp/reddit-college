  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nSeriously hoping this is okay on this sub. I'm in my first year of college, but all of my classes are online. For the most part, writing the day-to-day is fine. But when it comes to parties, I'm drawing a blank. \n\nIs it too unrealistic to have students play games like truth or dare/never have I ever, or did most campuses leave that behind in high school? My only exposure to games other than the traditional drinking games was in the movie After. For those of you who don't know what that is, I'd recommend keeping it that way.\n\nBut anyways, I just want to know what goes on at bigger parties in terms of entertainment. I'm already familiar with the social dynamics and such, but am looking to use the tod/nhie type games for some easy character development. \n\nAny insight helps!",

      "text": "My friends and I would play the drinking game Kings with a bunch of playing cards, and one of the card rules is never have I ever so I've played that at a couple parties but I don't think they're playing that at the larger house parties. Beer pong and flip cup are also fairly common. Cornhole is a big thing as well, at least where I went to school.",
