  "text": "I really need some advice, Reddit, on whether to keep living in my dorm or move back home. But I need to tell the whole story first!\n\nIn August of 2020 I moved out, into my dorm. My parents' houses are both 20 minutes away from campus so at first I was just going to stay at home anyways - when a friend from high school approached me and asked if I wanted to room with them along with two other people. I said yes for two reasons: number one was my parents are divorced, and I thought a dorm would be a nice, \"neutral\" place where I wouldn't have to feel like I was picking sides... I didn't want to move from house to house each week anymore. Reason number two was I actually enjoyed the idea of being independent, living my own life away from my parents.\n\nAnd then I actually moved out. My freshman year it was really fun, I made a lot of fun memories and met new people. I didn't go to many dorm events at all which I really regret. The dorm itself though was apartment style - and very small and very messy, in my opinion. Crumbs everywhere in the kitchen, dusty living room, dishes in the sink for a long time (although I also left dishes in the sink myself, so I have a part in some of this). There were a lot of nights where I was just by myself in that little apartment and I began to feel very lonely and isolated. Mostly though I just missed my parents. I had been feeling like this since I moved out. I wondered how they were doing and what they were up to, and being by myself in my dorm just made it worse. So I went home a lot, because after all it was only 20 minutes away. Most times I would actually pack a bag and stay for weeks at a time. Or at the very least visit for dinner every Friday. This was how my freshman year went and I renewed my lease for sophomore year.\n\nIn the summer of this year something changed. My 20-21 lease extended into the summer, but I packed my bag (like I usually do) and went back home again to dog sit for my mom while she went on vacation. I ended up staying for the entire summer (save for a week in June) and went back a few days before the new school year started in August this year. In the days leading up to my return I was actually really excited! My mom helped me decorate my dorm and move the furniture around to make it a lot more inviting. But on my first week back I cried for days. My homesickness was always there but now it was like it increased tenfold. I missed my dog and my parents so bad I couldn't focus. I was miserable.\n\nBut slowly that feeling passed and even though I still missed them a lot, even though I was bothered by being alone (especially at night) it got a little better. But by this time I was seriously considering moving back home. So I went back for another week, to test out how it would feel staying at home and going to school.... and I ended up staying for another month again. It was during this time that I reached out to my landlord and said I wanted to cancel my lease and move out in December.\n\nFlash forward to now: I went home for semester break and have yet again stayed for another month. But now I'm reconsidering it. I felt lonely and isolated and homesick at my dorm, so I would go back home. But now at home I'm feeling lonely and isolated and missing my roommates. I feel disconnected from my campus and other students at home. Most of all I miss the independence and and I just feel like even though I'm comfortable at home, I'm stagnating. I don't wanna spend all four years just in my room playing video games. My mom and I also butt heads about our different political opinions too, even though I love her (and we don't usually talk about politics, anyways).\n\nBut at the same time when I'm in my dorm it feels so confining I just feel like I can't relax and let loose ever. There's zero privacy. There's crumbs everywhere and dishes in the sink and I love my roommates but it's disappointing to come back after a while and see there's been hardly any cleaning. EDIT: Ok, I gotta give them some more credit than that. They clean and I understand just saying \"oh I'll do it later\" or being so busy it feels like you can't stop even to clean.\n\nWhenever I'm alone there I always end up thinking about my family and wish I could just go see them even if it's 12am or something. There's good times, too, though. Like anime binges with one of my roomies, or talking about homework or professors or even just ranting to them about an annoying co-worker I have at my part-time job. I miss all of that when I'm at home.\n\nAdditionally, I feel awful paying money for a dorm I'm hardly ever at, with roommates I never really see much of anymore. It feels like I'm throwing it all away (the experience, my friendships) while other people would love to be able to do that. I don't know what's wrong with me. Even while I'm writing this I can't help but cry.\n\nI'm lonely everywhere, I think. I don't know what to do anymore. I just need some help. Sorry for the long post.\n\nTL;DR: I have a dorm, and I like the independence, but I feel lonely and isolated there - I miss my family so much I go home and stay for weeks at a time. Lately, though, I've been missing living on my own and I feel like I'm stagnating at home even though I'm comfortable. I feel like I'm throwing away the experience and my friendships with my roommates. I'm lonely and isolated at home, too. I was planning on moving back home in December, but now I don't know what to do anymore.",

      "text": "I'm sorry that you're going through this, and I understand your confusion. Would it be possible for you to keep your apartment and visit home once/twice a week? That way you can experience the best of both worlds. I'm going through the same thing, and I have found that this method works for me. I still feel isolated and like I'm missing out on things sometimes but you have to do what is right for you! I hope it all works out, and don't listen to the people that are telling you to suck it up. They don't know your life.",

          "text": "Thank you for the kind message! It's very comforting to hear someone else is going through the same situation. For a long time it felt like due to my specific circumstances I was the only one. Yeah, going home a few days a week would work for me. I think my most favorite time at the dorm was during spring this year when I was mainly living there but going home every Friday night for dinner and a movie at home! I also go home for a couple hours on the weekend to hang out and do laundry. I plan on not renewing my lease next year anyways but it's just the matter of finding a balance during these next few weeks or the next semester so I can be happy.",
