My dorms sucked, the people on my dorm were cliquey and extremely noisy at all hours of the day and night( i still wonder about how they managed to find time to sleep). I did however find ways around it. The library is usually always quiet and is rather relaxing. I also started waking up earlier to go for walks or just sit on the benches outside before everyone woke up. It was relaxing and felt like a quiet getaway without having to get away. also reminder that you\u2019re an adult and free now, try seeing if there are public parks or areas around your school if they\u2019re close to you go hang out there when the weather is nice. you can even bring your laptop and finish some homework in peace. Towards the end of my freshman year i used my dorm only to crash and sleep and i was out of there as quickly as possible.", "author": "Fluffy-Mechanic-7052", "created": 1632715335, "upvotes": 1}}}
