So to start, for all of my assignments I\u2019ve received positive feedback but they\u2019re asking me to go more in depth which cuts me off from getting A\u2019s at times and I get a B+ instead. This is my first semester and I was shocked that my assignments were ranging from 500-1500 word limits when in high school I wrote 3000-4000 word essays. I always got high marks because I could elaborate.\n\nFor my last assignment, which was 800 words, I had to write about 5 seperate sections with approximately equal length which means I only had 160 words per section. The biggest thing they highlighted in the feedback was that \u201cYou provide excellent arguments but don\u2019t always unpack them.\u201d Similar feedback for my previous assignment.\n\nMy issue is that I write a lot but then have to go back and delete significant passages that explain my points and instead hope to summarise in like barely 50 word sentences. Everything written after the word limit is deleted so I\u2019m forced to shorten it to get to a conclusion because, without a conclusion, I get a worse grade obviously. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not using empty/meaningless words and sentences either. Also, I have a lot of shit to say because I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m writing.\n\nThe next assignment I have is a research essay that includes the reference list as part of the word count which is only 1250 words. I\u2019m confused on how I could possibly explain complex ideas within that limit.\n\nI\u2019m asking for either validation that these word counts are ridiculous\ud83d\ude2d or help on how to explain my thinking within short word counts so that I can get the grades I want.\n\nSeeing the irony in this post being really long.

We can't see your writing, but they can, so they may have some thoughts on ways to communicate your ideas within those word limits. \n\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is different paper lengths have different goals. With 3000 words, the expectation is that you can write about something in detail. With 500-1000, what you want is a *tight* argument. Everything in your paper should be focused on strengthening your argument, and while you could make other points, you want to use your strongest points of evidence. If you don't focus that and go on to make more points, rather than focusing in on things to strengthen your arguments, they will just hang there. You can also make sure that in your clean up process, you take out anything excessively wordy (seeing if you can restate in Morgan's ways, taking out modifier words, making sure you aren't overusing quotes if you used those) 800 words, so you want to make sure that every word is being used efficiently to articulate your point.", "author": "torgoboi", "created": 1632744508, "upvotes": 7}, "heglhtg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pweukb/not_getting_desired_grades_because_of_word_count/heglhtg/", "text": "I would advise meeting with your school's writing center after you've written the long version.
