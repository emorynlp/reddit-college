  "title:": "Not getting desired grades because of word count limits",
  "text": "Hi! So to start, for all of my assignments I\u2019ve received positive feedback but they\u2019re asking me to go more in depth which cuts me off from getting A\u2019s at times and I get a B+ instead. This is my first semester and I was shocked that my assignments were ranging from 500-1500 word limits when in high school I wrote 3000-4000 word essays. I always got high marks because I could elaborate.\n\nFor my last assignment, which was 800 words, I had to write about 5 seperate sections with approximately equal length which means I only had 160 words per section. The biggest thing they highlighted in the feedback was that \u201cYou provide excellent arguments but don\u2019t always unpack them.\u201d Similar feedback for my previous assignment.\n\nMy issue is that I write a lot but then have to go back and delete significant passages that explain my points and instead hope to summarise in like barely 50 word sentences. Everything written after the word limit is deleted so I\u2019m forced to shorten it to get to a conclusion because, without a conclusion, I get a worse grade obviously. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not using empty/meaningless words and sentences either. Also, I have a lot of shit to say because I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m writing.\n\nThe next assignment I have is a research essay that includes the reference list as part of the word count which is only 1250 words. I\u2019m confused on how I could possibly explain complex ideas within that limit.\n\nI\u2019m asking for either validation that these word counts are ridiculous\ud83d\ude2d or help on how to explain my thinking within short word counts so that I can get the grades I want.\n\nSeeing the irony in this post being really long. Sorry lol!",

Read some academic papers for examples. Also a thesaurus is a valuable tool to figure out if your 6 word explanation could actually be encompassed with one word. \n\nI totally feel for you because I've had similar experiences, but I promise it's doable. \n\nAnd, while this won't help now, I was also a very detailed writer in high school, and taking a technical writing course helped me a lot.",

I've also written 700 more words than was asked because I felt deeply passionate about the subject.\n\nWord counts are more a guideline than a hard and fast rule, unless it's a business writing class - then those counts really mean something. I've been in 50 classes in my career and in none of them have I ever been marked down on length. Take as much time as you need to say the thing you need to say.",

I feel you -- I always hate seeing shorter word counts, since there's so little to work with. \n\n\nI don't know if this is helpful, but it could help to go to office hours to get input on how to improve. We can't see your writing, but they can, so they may have some thoughts on ways to communicate your ideas within those word limits. \n\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is different paper lengths have different goals. With 3000 words, the expectation is that you can write about something in detail. With 500-1000, what you want is a *tight* argument. Everything in your paper should be focused on strengthening your argument, and while you could make other points, you want to use your strongest points of evidence. If you don't focus that and go on to make more points, rather than focusing in on things to strengthen your arguments, they will just hang there. You can also make sure that in your clean up process, you take out anything excessively wordy (seeing if you can restate in Morgan's ways, taking out modifier words, making sure you aren't overusing quotes if you used those) 800 words, so you want to make sure that every word is being used efficiently to articulate your point.",

In the job world, word count is usually limited and in non writing jobs you will still need to send emails that are concise. So it's actually an important skill to build. \n\nIt sounds like you're deleting portions. You may also want to try going through sentence by sentence and getting rid of extra words. Every sentence, read out loud and ask yourself how it can be shortened. If you need an example, you can reply with your writing and I'll try to shorten it.",
