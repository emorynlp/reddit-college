  "text": "I just finished crying my eyes out. Professor has been horrible since day one (ratemyprof warned me but he was the only one available to teach the course) and everything I studied for (Physics) wasn\u2019t even on the exam. I stared at the exam for two hours not even knowing what I was looking at or what I was doing. This is hands down the worst I have ever felt in my academic career. Thanks for reading.",

However my family told me to take the reviews on rate my professor with a grain of salt. I tried to be optimistic about it, but I kid you not, after the first lab, I dropped the course immediately. The professor was terrible and the lab literally made me cry. But I felt so much better after dropping that class. Is there a possibility for you to take the course again but with a different professor next semester?",

I feel so low, like I literally just walked out of this exam and the professor called me on my way out and I just ignored him. He actually sucks. I kept the exam though. I hope one day when I have all my degrees I can frame this stupid fucking test and flip it off everytime I see it to remind myself that I did it. I\u2019m trying to stay optimistic and it\u2019s really comforting to hear that I\u2019m not the only one. Thank you so much.",

I understand that your gpa is important, but I'm guessing you were already passed the point of no return in regards to taking a 'W'. I bet your class was like many of mine; the teacher sucks, the exams are insanely hard, and most of the class feels the same as you. And they probably failed the test as well. Which generally results in a curve. Unfortunately I've passed many classes like this. Sometimes with a grade as high as a B+. Next time try to chat with your classmates and pay attention to the average grades of the tests and see if you are still in the upper half of the grading scale. These teachers depend on you and your classmates passing!",

He also gives us weekly discussions to do online where he breaks them up into 3 parts and has super strict expectations, plus we have to read long articles, explicitly state examples from them and watch a video that we have to talk about all in one discussion every week. Its like writing a paper and we only get 3 days to do it for full credit then we have to reply to 4 other people about what they said. The issue with the replying part is that everyone basically says the same stuff and multiple people have complained about it but he won't change anything at all. Some professors are just assholes to be assholes which sucks and can make college horrible for some people.",
