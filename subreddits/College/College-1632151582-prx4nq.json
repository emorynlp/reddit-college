  "text": "So for some context I'm from the UK and for whatever reason there weren't enough places for everyone to live on campus this year at the college I'm going to. This means I have to get the train to and from my parents house every day and it's making it quite difficult to make friends.\n\nNot only do I not have roommates that I could hang out with and talk to but everyone goes to the bar in the evenings and if I wanted to go too and try to meet some people I'd have to either:\na) Find some way to fill the time between when classes end and the bar opens because most people just go back to their dorms in that time.\nb) Go home and try to justify getting the train all the way back just to sit by myself at the bar for an hour before I have to hurry to get the last train home again at 11pm.\n\nClubs start in a couple of weeks from now so I'm hopeful I might meet some people there. In the meantime I've been trying to find somewhere a bit closer to the college where I could stay but so far everywhere in the city seems to already be full.\n\nIt's a really terrible situation and I'm not sure what I should do. All my old friends have moved away for college so I'm really on my own here. If anyone has any advice or suggestions I'd really appreciate hearing them. Thanks.",

      "text": "It can take time to settle in and meet people. Joining clubs will help. Until then, you need to find other ways to spend your time on campus. You could study in the library or student center. Some schools have specific lounges for commuter students. The building where classes are for your major may have seating areas where you can hang out. If you like to excercise, there might be a fitness center, or open gym or pool hours. Even if your not a big sports fan, it might be fun to go and sit in the student section.  Eat-in the dining halls or coffee shops. You could even consider a part time job on campus with minimal hours that would work around your class schedule. It's hard that you weren't able to get housing on campus, so you in this middle ground between your parents house and being on your own. Hopefully it will start to feel like someplace you are a part of soon.",

          "text": "My big fear, which I know is going to sound a little stupid, is that if I don't get my foot in the door now and make some friends soon everyone else is going to form these groups or cliques and it's going to be even harder for me to find people people to hang with. It's kind of already happening with people who came from the same high school, they're they're content with their old friends they don't want to make any new ones.\n\nThere are plenty of spaces I can sit and get some work done around the place, including a lounge area, so I was planning on going there to get assignments done and such.\n\nBut a part time job near the campus! That's a great idea! I was planning on getting a job to make a little extra money after classes but I hadn't considered using it to kill time between classes and the nightlife. Honestly thank you so much for that idea :)",

              "text": "It would making a little money would be useful, you might make friends with people you are working with. Depending on the job, you also become a familiar face to the other students who come there. I think your fear is reasonable, especially on a smaller campus. If clubs haven't started yet though there's still a lot of time to meet people with similar interests. Even going from fall into spring semester, you will have different people in your classes. I went to a large state school, and I had new people in my classes each semester. That also meant that it took planning to have lunch because with cafeterias all over campus, we might not just run into each other. A smaller school might just have one main place where everybody eats.",
