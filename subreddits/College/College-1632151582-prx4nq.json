This means I have to get the train to and from my parents house every day and it's making it quite difficult to make friends.\n\nNot only do I not have roommates that I could hang out with and talk to but everyone goes to the bar in the evenings and if I wanted to go too and try to meet some people I'd have to either:\na) Find some way to fill the time between when classes end and the bar opens because most people just go back to their dorms in that time.\nb) Go home and try to justify getting the train all the way back just to sit by myself at the bar for an hour before I have to hurry to get the last train home again at 11pm.\n\nClubs start in a couple of weeks from now so I'm hopeful I might meet some people there. In the meantime I've been trying to find somewhere a bit closer to the college where I could stay but so far everywhere in the city seems to already be full.\n\nIt's a really terrible situation and I'm not sure what I should do. All my old friends have moved away for college so I'm really on my own here. If anyone has any advice or suggestions I'd really appreciate hearing them.

Joining clubs will help. Until then, you need to find other ways to spend your time on campus. You could study in the library or student center. Some schools have specific lounges for commuter students. The building where classes are for your major may have seating areas where you can hang out. If you like to excercise, there might be a fitness center, or open gym or pool hours. Even if your not a big sports fan, it might be fun to go and sit in the student section.  Eat-in the dining halls or coffee shops. You could even consider a part time job on campus with minimal hours that would work around your class schedule. It's hard that you weren't able to get housing on campus, so you in this middle ground between your parents house and being on your own. Hopefully it will start to feel like someplace you are a part of soon.", "author": "fawkes_fiesta", "created": 1632153032, "upvotes": 1}}}
