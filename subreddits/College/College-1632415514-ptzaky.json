  "text": "The people that were supposed to help me withdraw literally left the school. I cannot withdraw until next Tuesday. I hate it here.\n\nMy anger is unimaginable. I will call the school tomorrow and tell them I will not go to school physically ever again. They must send me my withdraw forms online because I don\u2019t want to see them ever again. Huge waste of money and time. This school sucks.",
