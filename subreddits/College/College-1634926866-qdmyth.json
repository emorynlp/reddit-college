  "text": "hey everyone, hope you guys are doing well, i\u2019m here because i\u2019m unsure of my decision of college. not where im going ofc just whether i should for my life. i am senior and throughout high school i had a plan to just go to any college for computer science, or cybersecurity, and ofc i\u2019ve changed that outcome plentiful of times. now im undecided whether i should still go for various reasons i\u2019ll list, but im only requesting advice and such, any information that can aid me.\n\nfirst, my plan for what to do once im 18 is to -\n\n1. go to school (community college / university / trade school)\n\u202218 yrs - 25 yrs\n2. work in the chosen career for a while, along with saving money for future investments\n\u202225 yrs - 30/35 yrs\n3. spread out in said investments (ownership in buildings / real estate / stocks / owning a career-involved business, etc.)\n\u202230 yrs \u2014>\n\ni can understand if it seems too unrealistic, but im looking forward to sticking to these phases no matter what i pursue in.\n\nthis is getting mad long so im gonna put my questions down -\n\nQ1. Before going to uni, im going to go into community college first to see whether i want to continue to university, or something else, either way would this be worthy of my time/money?\n\nQ2. Should i go to trade school?\n\nQ3. What are the worst things i should know about each school?\n\nQ4. What would you do if you were in my position?\n\n\nthank you <3",

      "text": "community college is a fantastic option to save a ton of money the first two years, then transfer to a university with your cc associates. if you know for a fact that you would want to major in computer science or anything else in the engineering field if you went to college, community college for the first two years isnt the best option. engineering colleges (where the cs major is) within universities are typically the hardest to get into, and your best shot is to apply into the university\u2019s engineering college straight out of high school. this is because engineering colleges tend to be ridiculously picky about allowing transfer students, even if they\u2019re transferring within the university. that subject is a whole conversation on its own so pm me if you want me to explain better. you should only go to trade school if there\u2019s a trade you\u2019re certain you want to go into that will become your career, or play heavily into it, otherwise it\u2019s not worth it. a trade school certificate is certainly less expensive than a bachelors degree but it\u2019s still tens of thousands of dollars, which is way too much money for something you don\u2019t even know if you want to/should do. i\u2019m at a university right now and i love it a lot, and it\u2019s a state school so i pay less, plus a ton of scholarships and i\u2019m paying almost the same price as for a community college. if you play your cards right a university is almost always a great choice. pm me if you wanna talk more about it!",

              "text": ">  i am senior and throughout high school i had a plan to just go to any college for computer science, or cybersecurity  \n\nThis is a valid plan.  \nYou can also work in Cybersecurity with an IT/IS/MIS/CIS degree.  \n\nYou do not have to complete a degree with the words \"cybersecurity\" in the degree title to work in Cybersecurity.  \n\n> go to school (community college / university / trade school) \u202218 yrs - 25 yrs  \n\nIt is not mandatory to complete a 4-year degree to work in Cybersecurity.  \nBut a 4-year university enables you to access internships, and internships are *probably* the best, or strongest path of entry into the Cybersecurity field.  \n\n> work in the chosen career for a while, along with saving money for future investments \u202225 yrs - 30/35 yrs  \n\nWell, everyone dreams of retiring as early as possible.\nHaving a clear and focused plan for personal spending & investments along the way is critical to this plan.  \nIf you want to retire early, maybe don't buy a Tesla, and invest in repairs on your Honda instead.  \n\n\n> spread out in said investments (ownership in buildings / real estate / stocks / owning a career-involved business, etc.) \u202230 yrs  \n\n\nMost people who are good at working with technology, are not great at managing a business.  \nThey are good at fixing things and solving problems, but are not good at charging people what their time is worth.  \n\n> Before going to uni, im going to go into community college first to see whether i want to continue to university, or something else, either way would this be worthy of my time/money?  \n\nYour state community college system is generally a GREAT cost/benefit option.  \nWalmart, Target and Starbucks all have tuition-assistance programs for their employees.  \nSo you might be able to spend someone else's money to pay for it.  \n\nMinor down-side to Community College: Internship opportunities for CC students are uncommon.  \n\nI cannot overstate the importance of internships on your ability to enter the Cybersecurity or IT fields in a stronger position than without an internship. \n\nSo, if you do go the CC path, make sure you attack internship opportunities with a vengeance once you enroll @ University.  \n\n> Should i go to trade school?  \n\nMost IT/Cyber trade schools a steaming piles of dogshit.  \nThe ones that aren't hot-garbage are generally more expensive, for less educational content than 2 years @ CC.  \n\n> What are the worst things i should know about each school?  \n\nPlease pay attention to this. Please. Pretty-Please.  \n\nIf you choose the Community College path, you are doing so to save money.  \nFocus on saving as much money as possible.  \n\nThat means enrolling at CC in the degree program that provides you with the highest number of college credits that can be accepted to your targeted 4-year school AND align with the degree requirements there.  \n\nYou want to knock out as many General Education classes as you can, so when you go to the expensive university you can focus on nothing but nerd-classes and not pay top-dollar for Calculus or English Literature.  \n\nHere comes the part that irritates a whole lot of young people:  \n\nTo game the system and accomplish those objectives, it MIGHT be better to enroll at Community College in an AS of Mathematics or an AS of Generic Engineering and NOT their Associated of Applied Science in Information Security.  \n\nWhy, you ask.  \n\nAn \"AS\" degree is designed to transfer.  \nAn \"AAS\" degree is designed to provide career skills so you can get into the workforce.  \n\nYou don't have to believe me.  \nYou don't have to agree with me right this second.  \n\nJust **PLEASE** have the conversation with your student advisor discuss and compare the number of transferrable credits towards the 4-year degree you want from each of their 2-year degree programs.  \n\n\n> What would you do if you were in my position?  \n\nJoin the Navy in a Cyber Transport MOS/Rating and let them pay you to learn nerd-stuff and Cybersecurity.  \n\nMake sure you like the work. Learn how to be an adult and manage your own money, etc.  \n\nGo to a 4-year university for free (including room & board).  \n\nLeverage your veteran status as a Prioritized applicant for every internship and Co-Op work program you can find.  \n\nLeverage your veteran status as a Prioritized applicant for every job opportunity or Career Development Program you can find.  \n\nLeverage your veteran home loan benefit to buy a home 5-10 years before your peers can afford to do so.  \n\n\n...But that's just my opinion.",

                      "text": "> OR in the general business field (business management/accounting)  \n\nGeneric, non-specific, non-specialized \"Business Administration\" degrees are not in demand by most employers.  \nI'm not saying they are unemployable. That's too strong of a sentiment.  \nBut most employers prefer to hear that you went deeper into the world of business-skills in one discipline or another.  \n\n> also with mechanical engineering  \n\nPretty much always employable. So long as you enjoy the work.  \n\n> however by some slim chance would i be able to put my trade into a business aspect idea?  \n\nI can't answer this. I don't know you. It's certainly not impossible to possess both technical and business/marketing skills.  \n\nBill Gates had them.  \nZuckerberg has them.  \nBut the list kinda slows down at that point.  \n\nGreat nerds who also ran businesses....  \nIt won't be a huge list, but I'm sure it's longer than just those two.  \n\n\nBut the list of solid, reliable nerds who started a business that failed specifically due to poor business skills? Yeah, that will be a really long list.",
