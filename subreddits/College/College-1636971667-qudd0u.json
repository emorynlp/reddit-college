  "text": "I\u2019m majoring in bioengineering and I\u2019m in my first semester of my sophomore year. My freshman year was alright grade wise. I only got a few Bs and all As. This year however, I\u2019m failing all of my classes. \n\nI\u2019m taking organic chemistry, physics, clac 3, bioe and comp sci. I\u2019m doing fine with cs but everything else is looking bad. I\u2019m trying my best to study but in all of my tests I\u2019ve been getting only a 60. My grades seem like they are really low and might end up with Cs and perhaps Ds. \n\nIn my bioe class, I missed two hw due to personal reasons and it took away 8% of my total grade. Which brought my grade down immensely. And depending on how I do on my next exam and project, I will end up with a C or a D.\n\nThe exams feel extremely hard compared to the practice exam and stuff we learn in class. The class average is always around 70s and 60s. \n\n\nI\u2019m feeling terrible about myself and for my gpa. Is having a few Cs alright? Is it alright to do pass/no pass my major class? What do I have to tell myself to keep going? I might end up with 4 Cs.",
