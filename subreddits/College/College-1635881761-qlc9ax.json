  "text": "Hi everyone, currently coming onto here looking for some support regarding this issue.\n\nI'm currently taking a language course, and everyday I go, I feel so stupid in the class. The professor's learning environment is extremely hostile, such as cold calling on people to ask them questions. It gives me so much anxiety being in this situation, and what makes it worse is that the professor is extremely condescending and makes me feel so stupid for getting a question wrong. He would say things such as, \"that sentence structure you just came up with is not Vietnamese. We're speaking Vietnamese right now, not English.\" I would say things like, \"I'm a bit confused right now\" or ask clarifying questions to try to help myself, only to have him say things like \"Did you come late to class?\" or \"Did you hear what the other person before you answered?\" \n\nI feel like nothing I'm doing is right. I was so excited to learn a new language, but the professor makes me absolutely dread coming to class. I'm afraid of asking questions or go to office hours because he usually responds in an incredibly condescending way. I have so much anxiety coming to class now, that sometimes I'll sit in front of my computer, heart racing, and just not attend class because I am too afraid of going into this stressful situation. The anxiety has began to carry with me after I close my laptop, gnawing at me when I'm doing my daily activities. I feel like crying after class sometimes because I feel so humiliated and invalidated by him.\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel hopeless, and I want to get help. I'm currently looking for a therapist to help me with the anxiety, but most therapists are booked right now. Thankfully, I have a psychiatrist who I am able to check-in with and my psychiatrist is very supportive. However, tackling the professor alone is really tough and despite my check-ins with my psychiatrist, I still am so fearful of this class and the professor. \n\nAny insight/advice would help so much. Thank you.",

      "text": "Right now, if you can, I would either go to the prof for help or withdraw/drop. Language classes do cold calling especially those that are not similar to English. This is because to a certain extent you can't just study alone. You need the oral practice of speaking and class is the best way. There could also just be a cultural barrier if he's Vietnamese. My Chinese prof is the same, but she doesn't mean to be mean. She's just very blunt, which is something I've come to see many of my Asian profs are. If you could maybe form a study group with your classmates and practice Vietnamese that could help. Go to his office hours if you feel comfortable and ask I didn't understand x sentence structure or y word in this sentence. For my Chinese we have lecture and recitation. In recitation we are expected to mostly speak in Chinese. They have high requirements, but thats because it's not at all similar to English and they want to nip things in the bud so they do not become a habit for us.",
