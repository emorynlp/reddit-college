  "text": "So my roommate recently dropped out. We shared a suite style dorm where we had separate rooms and shared a common area and bathroom. After she moved out my RA told me she may be moving in next semester due to her bosses orders.  Is there any way I could avoid this? Anyone I could talk to? I understand college is business and and any available rooms can be offered to anyone at anytime regardless if I\u2019d like my roommate. I wouldn\u2019t stress about it if my RA was chill, but she\u2019s not. Like at all. Any info would be useful!!!!",
