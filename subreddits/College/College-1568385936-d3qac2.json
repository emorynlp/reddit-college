That way you'd be in touch with it and won't be forgetting things.\n\nThough you don't quite remember the information right now, practicing those problems have given you a type of skill set which has altered the structure of your brain. That's why it'd be easier for you to re-learn a skill or subject than learning it the first time.",

When you learn something new, if you dont repeat that information in the next 24hours that data wont pass to the stage 2. Then in order to acces stage 3 you have to repeat that information in the next 3-4 days and then you have to repeat it again. But even this doesnt secure that that data will remain in your permanent memory. You see memory is not one place in brain. All emotions and senses have their own memory, using other memory types to learn something makes easier to recall an information and helps you learn better. \n\nThe reason I explained this in a long way instead of saying 'just repeat' is because you learn better if you know the causes. Now, you know and understand why repeating is important. Good luck with your lessons.",

Those were the same thing for me, but because of the way you put it, I now know they are not. This was kind of important to me because I am going to start my second year in college and this year I will be having subjects that are actually very important in my career of choice (not saying calculus is not important, but I won't be applying that knowledge that much in my field). \n\nKnowing that i forgot courses that I took just a while back so soon got me to thinking that I am not studying right. I am going through college to actually learn things that are going to help me in my future. It's obviously a waste of time if i forget those things right after I take my diploma, even if I graduate with high results.\n\nI am going to take a different approach this year. Every new lesson that I take on each subject, I will try to understand it first before I learn it to prepare for my assignments. I am hoping this will make my college years more worthwhile than they already are.",

Compared to someone like me who has never taken Calculus, who would need to take that class before being able to do that.\n\nReal life isn't like a college exam. On an exam, they limit your tools to make sure you actually absorbed something. In real life, you have access to calculators, dictionaries, etc. Anyone can just look up the textbook. But not everyone can look it up and understand how to use that information.",

There's \"superficial\" learning to pass a test, which unfortunately most learning in school ends up being, and then there is \"deep\" learning where you are still able to use and apply the knowledge you have learned even years after you have first learned it. The thing is, I think forgetting has to be a part of the learning process in order to turn superficial learning into deep learning, and I don't think enough people talk about it. If you go through a syllabus for the class, how much do you remember, and how much did you forget? The stuff you remember well is the stuff you learned deeply, and you can use that as a context for the stuff you learned superficially to relearn the material.",

Some more others less.\n\nAround seven years ago, the son of a major partner at the law firm where my daughters and son in laws were working asked my youngest son in law if he could figure out why his very bright son was failing several classes in his first semester at one of our state's flagship universities. He asked son in law because son in law is very adroit at school and learning issues. The son had graduated from a very high end private prep school with $40,000 a year tuition. (Son in law graduated from local public high school.) Long story short, the kid had finished all the AP calculus classes, got a 5 on the AP tests, by end of junior year and took no math classes until university. The solution was dropping two classes, going back and retaking two calculus classes, going to summer school to catch back up, etcetera. \n\nGoogle up the name Kathleen Sullivan bar exam failure. Kathleen graduated from Harvard law school, was a professor at Harvard law school, was a professor and Dean at Stanford law school. (Yale, Harvard, and Stanford are always ranked in the top 3 of the 203 ABA approved law schools and Dean is the top person at a law school.) Kathleen decided to join a very high end law firm and needed to pass the California bar exam,  which is widely understood to be the hardest bar exam in the nation. For good reasons. The pass rate for first time test takers who graduated from ABA approved law schools is 60% in California. Most states the pass rate is 80% or higher. Kathleen flunked the California bar exam  and passed it five months later. Her problem was probably the same as Hilary Clinton and Michelle Obama who both failed their first bar exams. All three probably figured they could wing it and not do the prep work of studying all those subjects from first year of law school that they had forgotten parts of.",

However, requiring subjects that are not relevant to a person's goals can end up a waste of that person's time and money. Also the public high school and public university's money because providing it costs more than tuition.\n\nThere are some academics that believe that large amounts of education should be eliminated. Failing Law Schools by a former law school dean of several law schools suggests that law school should be reduced from three years to two years with the possibility that the third year should be spent working as an inturn under a practicing attorney, much like becoming a CPA requires a year of work experience under a CPA.  The case against education: why the education system is a waste of time and money by Bryan Caplan makes the point that much of college and graduate school should be eliminated, along with portions of high school. The son in law that I mentioned on this thread made that calculation in 7th grade. However, after university and law school, son in law did lead his pal and our daughters on to get LLM and MBA degrees, so essentially he used those three years of high school study that they escaped from to get the LLM and MBA degrees that they think have more value to them than forgotten Spanish and calculus would have for them.",

Seems like if one isn't consistently keeping themselves up to speed on formulas every day of the week for their entire life, it's gone. Almost like they never learned it all. Sounds like a question for the \"tell me like I'm five\", but it seems like the brain just automatically rewrites itself like a hard drive.",

              "text": "I don't know the why, but I know that most people suffer from such. Some few people have something like \"perfect autobiographical memory\" where they can remember what they were doing everyday of their life. Like what TV shows they watched on a particular day. What they were thinking about a particular person on a date in high school or college. Things like where they parked and what they did while parked, etcetera. Things that most of us would like to not remember! LOL\n\nMost of us have phone numbers that were very much in our memory, but no longer are. Names of people that we no longer recall. Hubby recalls being on a college trip for two weeks and every evening some guy would ask him what some girl did that day. Hubby remembers the girls name but not the guys name. Lol\n\nI suspect that part of the not  remembering a foreign language problem is that most people don't think in the second language, rather they are translating into that second language, which is earlier to forget, but I have no clue.",

But was forced to wait a semester to take it after the Spring class was canceled due to low enrollment. Some material I remember from the past two decades of \"fail/repeats\", the rest of it just gets wiped from my memory after little use.\n\nKhan Academy and other sites are quite good. I just wonder if there's an actual, free site that allows you to work out random problems from any level as often as you need. Kind of like that feature of the Pearson math site where you click for a similar problem to the one you just finished.",

One just has to kind of thumb through the lessons they need and follow up with some random, practice questions to get them through. Of course I could only do much of this at home and the time I could get in the tutoring center at the local CC. \n\nI'm just trying to get past college algebra and maybe calculus 1. This engineering pursuit I've been stuck on since 18(36 now) has been mentally and pocketbook draining. Decided to just aim for a less math intensive degree just to have one.",

Add to the fact that I truly have no idea what to pursue as a \"final career\", and the drive is even lower.\n\nThis isn't intended as a rant. If anything it's a personal observation.
