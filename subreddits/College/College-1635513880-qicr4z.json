  "text": "I have a 75 soon to be low 70s after my exam score is added in cuz I didn\u2019t score well. It\u2019s been 10 weeks now and I\u2019m struggling in my biology class. It\u2019s worth 4 credits though which is kinda making me hesitate from withdrawing. The quiz I took today was terrible cuz there were just too much info for me to shove into my head so I didn\u2019t do well. And I\u2019ll definitely do bad on the final and I don\u2019t want my gpa to be affected since I\u2019m considering getting my masters. \n\nShould I withdraw or keep going with a C\nIm a freshman btw",

      "text": "I would say it depends on a couple things. One, do you foresee yourself passing this class with a C- or above? If you don't think you will, I think withdrawing would be best. \n\nNext, are you planning on majoring in biology? You'll need a good understanding of this class for future courses you would take. Even if you pass this class, you may struggle later on so you could withdraw now and retake it next semester. \n\nLastly since you think you'll want to get a masters, a good GPA would be best. Another option you could do is take the class pass/fail if your institution offers that. This takes the pressure out of having it tank your GPA and you still have a chance at receiving credit for the class if you pass. I only recommend this however if you plan on putting a lot of time and effort into trying to get whatever your college deems as passing. Otherwise you could have just withdrew and saved yourself the trouble and the worrying over this class. \n\nBest of luck! And just a reminder if you withdraw/take it pass/fail and don't pass, you won't get credit so you'll have to plan on making those 4 credits up in the future (assuming your college has a minimum number of credits that need to be taken to graduate.)",
