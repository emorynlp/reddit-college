  "text": "I'm telling them because they pay for my college and wouldn't they want to know?\n\nI'm just scared of how they will react. They will probably yell at me and ask me why I missed that one test and cry and I don't want to hear them cry.",

However, I will say, as someone who has been in a position of not even getting a credit for a class: if your parents are good parents, they\u2019ll probably be more disappointed *for* you than *at* you. It\u2019s okay; you\u2019ll make it through this.",

Even now I'm taking an extra two years and as much as that hurts finances they realize its the best for my mental health. It's ok, sit down with an advisor if you have to and plan how to do better both mentally and educationally. I took a step back not worrying about what my parents will think and it was the best decision I made.",

Idk what class you got a C in and whether you need that class for advanced programs after undergrad. \n\nI\u2019m applying to programs rn and some of the requirements is earning at least a B or better in the prerequisites courses to get into the program. Not trying to scare you, but at the end of the day, you\u2019ll be the one dealing with it. \n\nA grade of a C isn\u2019t the end of the world. You\u2019ll get to move on with the more advanced courses if that course is a series and you need it for your degree. If not a series, then you\u2019re done with the class!\n\nAnd yes, Cs get Degrees! \n\nI got a couple in undergrad and I got my degree \ud83d\ude05",
