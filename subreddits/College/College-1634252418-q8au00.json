      "text": "Yes. Dental school is a graduate school that furthers your knowledge and allows you to learn to become a licensed dentist by preparing you for national exams, providing clinical experience, and specific coursework in the field. A dental undergrad is a bachelors that helps you prepare for dental school but does not make you a dentist by graduation. People can get their bachelors in anything and still go to dental school but people with a dental undergrad degree may be more familiar with the content.",
