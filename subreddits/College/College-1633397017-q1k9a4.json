  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in my first semester of college. I\u2019m currently majored in English with a minor in teaching so I can be an English teacher, but I\u2019m really having second thoughts. Going into college I knew I wanted to find a career where I can help people on a personal level. I love interacting and listening to people and helping them with their problems, and I also have a love for stories and analyzing them, so figured English would be a good path to take. When I actually got to college and started my education course, however, I quickly started to second guess the whole teacher gig. Maybe it just has to do with being so burnt out from college, but teaching seems so overwhelming and while I think I\u2019d love the actual teaching part, there just looks like too much time, effort, and red tape with too little payoff. Any suggestions on majors/careers where I can still help people and get that fulfillment? Preferably within 4 years of education, I really don\u2019t know if it\u2019s financially feasible for my family and I to send me to go to grad school, but I\u2019m open to suggestions!",

      "text": "most helping careers are a lot more stressful than teaching\u2026because you\u2019re usually dealing with very ill people. lots of paperwork, and especially healthcare is being taken over by big businesses-it\u2019s a shit show. if you don\u2019t think you can handle teaching, you won\u2019t be able to handle anything else.\n\nalso there\u2019s not many options that you can get done with simply a bachelors. but there may be some bachelors nursing programs. or social work.\n\nbut please don\u2019t go into healthcare if you think you\u2019ll get burnt out. i promise the pay doesn\u2019t match up the work, you need to be really passionate about it.",

          "text": "I\u2019ll definitely take that into account. If my finances change in the next few years, which they may if I decide to just commute to my college for the next 3 years or if I happen to get some decent scholarships, I may be able to get a masters after my BA. I\u2019ve just always been really insecure about finances because of how my childhood was, but in recent times my family is decently well-off, so it may be possible to go farther with my education than I thought. I really want to help people, so I\u2019m willing to try and deal with the shit that comes with it. I\u2019ll really try and mull over what I wanna do with my life though and do some more research. I appreciate the comment, I would prefer a bit of forewarning than to get into a job that I end up hating :)",

      "text": "I went into college feeling exactly the same way! I really wanted to help people on a deeper, more personal level, I wanted my future career to be really hands-on and in-depth. *But* I knew that I didn't want to do psychology/psychiatry or social work (I grew up with a family friend who did social work for a few years and it broke her; she just never felt like she could help enough and she burned out).\n\nMy current major is American Sign Language, with a concentration in ASL/English Interpretation. Being an ASL interpreter will enable me to help people every single day: I'm breaking language and cultural barriers, enabling people to get the care and services they need, and giving myself the satisfaction of connecting with people on an interpersonal level. I am incredibly happy in this major and I'm really looking forward to graduating with my BA. I would only need a Masters if I want to teach ASL (and I don't; that's a job better-suited to a native signer), so I just need a BA and some certifications through the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf and I'm good to go!\n\nNow, I'm not telling you to do exactly what I'm doing (though the field can always use more interpreters), but I do recommend that if you want to help people, get creative with your choices. There are a ridiculous amount of possibilities when you look into disadvantaged communities and the resources and services they need to operate in this world.",

          "text": "I hadn\u2019t thought of that. I like stability, so I tend to have blinders on when it comes to big life decisions and just and go with a secure option that I think I might enjoy. Teaching fit the criteria, so I started out with it. I\u2019ll try and expand my horizons and see if there\u2019s something more unconventional that may catch my eye. I really appreciate the comment though, I tend to feel like I\u2019m super far behind everyone in life and end up freaking myself out. Always nice to be reminded that people went through what Im going through right now and made it out just fine (glad you did btw! :D)",

There's nothing wrong with seeking stability, just know that stability can be or look like a lot of different things. :)",
