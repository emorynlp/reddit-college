  "text": "I just wrote a paper and I felt super anxious. Went to a few websites and got my paper checked. Long story short, was telling my friend this and he told me that messes the paper up. The plagiarism checker saves my paper and when my professor checks it\u2019ll be 100% plagiarized. Yall due date is in a few hours. I can\u2019t write the paper again",
