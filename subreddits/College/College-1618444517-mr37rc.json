Lots of questions for this course, but that's not surprising given the level of information. The professor prefers emails and it is laid out in the syllabus that emailing him is best, and that he will respond within 24 hours. He also encourages emails with questions often so I feel no shame for emailing him once a week or so with specific questions. Of the seven emails I've sent over the last 12 weeks, he has responded to 2.\n\nHis past students and current have complained that he does not respond in a timely manner, if at all. I only noticed this AFTER I decided to take the class. \n\nWe ended up having a test due on a Sunday over a section we had not covered yet and wouldn't open until the following day. I emailed him Saturday to confirm (it opened Friday, so Saturday was not short notice) and he didn't respond. Sunday, no response either. I ended up reaching out individually to my classmates and they confirmed that they couldn't see the new module open for the test either. I even had one say he never responds to her emails and she emailed him, too.\n\nEveryone kind of bombed that test. And on Monday I decided to email him and tag the dept head. I asked what the best way to communicate with him would be, what I can do to get him to respond to me in at least 48 hours, and what exactly we should have done about the test.\n\nHe responded very angrily with \"you should check your junk email box, because I've responded to EVERY email you've sent me\".\n\nOkay, buddy. Now that I've lit a fire under your ass, this is the response?\n\nOf course my junk email box was not full. I even have this professor in my contacts for this reason alone because I thought that was a possibility at one point. So I decided to play an idiot and tag the IT desk on the thread. \n\nI asked IT to check my mailbox and settings, and they gave me the all-clear. They reached out to him and tagged me in the emails for a week straight until he responded:\n\n\"Yes I have been receiving her emails. In fact, I'll be emailing her later tonight.\"\n\nIT responded with, \"We need to see screenshots of the sent emails to confirm there isn't an issue with your mailbox, because we have had other complaints.\"\n\nIn between the week that it took him to respond to the email with IT, his department head got ahold of me and gave me a sob story about how overworked and underpaid and how budget cuts are causing issues with response times, and that he encourages me to continue asking questions but with patience. \n\nOhhhhhhh, so it IS an issue of \"I'm too busy.\" Okay. Why did he have to lie about my junk email? I would have rather just been told to keep trying/I'm busy and I'm sorry. But no.\n\nAt this point, I'm waiting for the dreaded email he alluded to sending tonight. I feel threatened. I feel like I cornered someone and called their bluff and now it's about to explode in my face.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEdit: I ended up contacting the dean again and sent the screenshot of his \"threatening\" email. I never received an email last night from him. At this point I expressed how I feel threatened and how I have \"poked the bear\" and just don't want to pursue this issue any longer. Clearly this guy has bit off more than he could chew if he can't respond to any emails from any of his students. For those of you actually defending this guy, I suspect you're overworked and underpaid professors as well. Just know that it is your job to teach and you are failing miserably as an educator AND as an adult in this modern age if you can't sit down for 3 minutes and respond to an email within 72 hours.

This \"professor,\" who sounds like a contract instructor, is not doing very well at their job. That's for sure. You're definitely a thorn in his side, but I doubt they'll retaliate in any meaningful way. If they're truly that strapped for time they don't have time to engage in petty games with students who are simply trying to complete course requirements.\n\nThat said, at the end of term I get about a dozen emails a day from students with some of the most fucking asinine questions, and they just aren't a priority. I had one student email me last week asking me to \"confirm\" that the official exam schedule was correct, and that our exam is in fact when it says it is. I had other students email me about needing an abstract, when I've said, in class, *twice*, and on the course syllabus, that it's not necessary. \n\nSo your statement depends in large part on the nature of the emails. What you're talking about is very valid and the prof should have done a better job at figuring this shit out. That's on him. But from our perspective, there are shit students alongside shit teachers.
