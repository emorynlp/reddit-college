  "title:": "Called a professor's bluff about him not responding to my questions through email and now I think I've poked the bear too much...",
  "text": "Essentially I'm in an online course in upper level science. Lots of questions for this course, but that's not surprising given the level of information. The professor prefers emails and it is laid out in the syllabus that emailing him is best, and that he will respond within 24 hours. He also encourages emails with questions often so I feel no shame for emailing him once a week or so with specific questions. Of the seven emails I've sent over the last 12 weeks, he has responded to 2.\n\nHis past students and current have complained that he does not respond in a timely manner, if at all. I only noticed this AFTER I decided to take the class. \n\nWe ended up having a test due on a Sunday over a section we had not covered yet and wouldn't open until the following day. I emailed him Saturday to confirm (it opened Friday, so Saturday was not short notice) and he didn't respond. Sunday, no response either. I ended up reaching out individually to my classmates and they confirmed that they couldn't see the new module open for the test either. I even had one say he never responds to her emails and she emailed him, too.\n\nEveryone kind of bombed that test. And on Monday I decided to email him and tag the dept head. I asked what the best way to communicate with him would be, what I can do to get him to respond to me in at least 48 hours, and what exactly we should have done about the test.\n\nHe responded very angrily with \"you should check your junk email box, because I've responded to EVERY email you've sent me\".\n\nOkay, buddy. Now that I've lit a fire under your ass, this is the response?\n\nOf course my junk email box was not full. I even have this professor in my contacts for this reason alone because I thought that was a possibility at one point. So I decided to play an idiot and tag the IT desk on the thread. \n\nI asked IT to check my mailbox and settings, and they gave me the all-clear. They reached out to him and tagged me in the emails for a week straight until he responded:\n\n\"Yes I have been receiving her emails. In fact, I'll be emailing her later tonight.\"\n\nIT responded with, \"We need to see screenshots of the sent emails to confirm there isn't an issue with your mailbox, because we have had other complaints.\"\n\nIn between the week that it took him to respond to the email with IT, his department head got ahold of me and gave me a sob story about how overworked and underpaid and how budget cuts are causing issues with response times, and that he encourages me to continue asking questions but with patience. \n\nOhhhhhhh, so it IS an issue of \"I'm too busy.\" Okay. Why did he have to lie about my junk email? I would have rather just been told to keep trying/I'm busy and I'm sorry. But no.\n\nAt this point, I'm waiting for the dreaded email he alluded to sending tonight. I feel threatened. I feel like I cornered someone and called their bluff and now it's about to explode in my face.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nEdit: I ended up contacting the dean again and sent the screenshot of his \"threatening\" email. I never received an email last night from him. At this point I expressed how I feel threatened and how I have \"poked the bear\" and just don't want to pursue this issue any longer. Clearly this guy has bit off more than he could chew if he can't respond to any emails from any of his students. For those of you actually defending this guy, I suspect you're overworked and underpaid professors as well. Just know that it is your job to teach and you are failing miserably as an educator AND as an adult in this modern age if you can't sit down for 3 minutes and respond to an email within 72 hours. Ever wonder why your students keep emailing you and your inbox is so full? It's because you're a shit teacher.",

This \"professor,\" who sounds like a contract instructor, is not doing very well at their job. That's for sure. You're definitely a thorn in his side, but I doubt they'll retaliate in any meaningful way. If they're truly that strapped for time they don't have time to engage in petty games with students who are simply trying to complete course requirements.\n\nThat said, at the end of term I get about a dozen emails a day from students with some of the most fucking asinine questions, and they just aren't a priority. I had one student email me last week asking me to \"confirm\" that the official exam schedule was correct, and that our exam is in fact when it says it is. I had other students email me about needing an abstract, when I've said, in class, *twice*, and on the course syllabus, that it's not necessary. \n\nSo your statement depends in large part on the nature of the emails. What you're talking about is very valid and the prof should have done a better job at figuring this shit out. That's on him. But from our perspective, there are shit students alongside shit teachers. And they outnumber them 50 to 1.",

Other classmates also had the same problem. His solution was to just chat block and mute everyone on Zoom.\n\nWithout going too much further, it ended up turning into a giant shit storm by the end of the semester that involved most of the class which forced him to just curve the entire grade (due to his negligence and department oversight).

Having an assignment due on a Sunday is not the best, but responding to emails on the weekend should never be the expectation regardless. If your professor isn\u2019t responding to email, rather than escalating to the dept chair, why not go to office hours talk, talk to him after class, or talk to the TA (this is the first place you should be going for content questions anyway). This is so entitled. God. I am so glad that I will be done with my TAing responsibilities this semester. \n\nI also want to say that it is not that I think there is never a case for escalating. I had an instructor in under grad who was a senior PhD student teaching their own class. They regularly did not show up to class without emailing. Students in the class decided to report the issue after they did not show up the day of the exam.",

You don\u2019t meet or communicate with the professor regularly. These were what online only students took at my university and they were online before the pandemic.

I unfortunately have a  professor who kind of vanished near the start of the term until our first exam came around and none of us could reach him either lmao... and he's done the same a few weeks at a time since. He had set certain things to unlock on blackboard on their own and we just had to do everything in each new section weekly so I guess he thought he could chill and we'd be fine on our own. He's a cool dude though just terrible in staying in touch. It's probably the same situation on your end. He probably set up for certain things to unlock on certain dates and something messed up for a section. The sucky part is that he's not attempting to make things right and gaslighting you over it. It's happened a few times for us when things went wrong, but when we finally got a response my professor usually extended those assignments to give us a chance to redo them.",

This would be the point in which you involve the department head/chair. Then they can objectively look at the details of the course and the emails you sent as well as that faculty members response and make a decision. \n\nLastly, i will also say- did any of your questions include things like: i looked here and here for the answer to the question and this is what i found, i am still confused about this xyz aspect? That type of effort on a students part is what i will generally prioritize in responding to b/c it shows me they engaged with the material FIRST and then came to me when there were still issues.",

It reads more like, I didn\u2019t study this bc you said it wasn\u2019t an important issue but I got it wrong so now explain why I got it wrong.  I totally agree it\u2019s annoying to say this isn\u2019t important and then write a question on it. That\u2019s misleading as a teacher to some degree, but what you are asking for is not a clarification of content but a justification of why they asked a question which they don\u2019t really owe you. To be fair, if it was covered in the material in any way then it\u2019s important to some degree. Often adding questions like that helps differentiate between the A+ student who studies it regardless and the B+ student who\u2019s focuses on the important material, but not All the material. I know that\u2019s a super annoying answer, but I can say I add questions to exams I on,y expect about 5% of students to get right because that\u2019s how you differentiate between performance in the class. I also to be fair ensure that 70% of the questions about 90% of students should get right because that sets my internal threshold of whether you understand the content or not. If a student is scoring below a 70 and most everyon is getting those questions right then clearly it\u2019s likely they shouldnt pass the class bc they can\u2019t demonstrate mastery of the material. \nTLDR your questions come off as nit picky and don\u2019t ask to clarify a concept they are asking for justification.",

The question seems perfectly clear to me - if something isn't important and you're getting it wrong on a test and losing points for it, the clearly it actually IS important. A professor should never really say something they're teaching is \"not important\" anyway - if not, why are they even teaching it? The correct answer would be to clarify \"Yes, you're right. When I said X isn't important what I mean is that it's not as important as Y but it is a consideration and you should know how to find it so maybe I phrased that wrong. For more information on how to find X properly, go to Z resource or look at section ABC in the book\" etc.",

So, it\u2019s easy to make a small mistake like that, you know, being human and all. I also know my admin would be very forgiving of that mistake and understand it was an oversight on my part after it had been graciously brought to my attention. My admin would not, however, be very forgiving of me ignoring all of my emails for days on end, ESPECIALLY if said emails contained important information which could include the simple solution to not failing an entire class on a test, by the click of a button.

He might be chairing a panel, or giving an invited talk, or he simply needs to go to help advertise our work and drum up interest in hiring us (his students who are soon to graduate)\n\n - Teaching a group of academics/postgrads QFT\n\n - Preparing papers for discussion in journal clubs\n\n - Other tidbits, like organising talks for weekly seminars, giving talks at other universities/departments, organising visiting scholars who have expertise to help our group, advertising and hiring for postdoctoral positions, securing funding for all members of the group, managing our data storage needs (100's of TB), helping potential students apply and reviewing the research proposals, and answering emails (of which he gets 100's-1000's per day)\n\n - And I haven't even mentioned: doing his own research, writing his own papers, and completing the review process for them\n\nI honestly don't know how he's even alive. I would self-combust if I had that much work to do and that many people relying on me completely. If he fails at nearly any part of his job then there are serious repercussions for the people below him. Sometimes I cancel our weekly meetings because he looks like he's going to die. But if I have a serious issue and need his input ASAP, he'll drop whatever he can to help out.\n\nHe takes teaching very seriously, so a big workload is not an excuse to be a shitty lecturer.

Usually, they are in that order in terms of priority.\n\nResearch is our biggest responsibility, and that means either running a lab, doing fieldwork, or archival research. We spend a lot of our time writing articles for journals, publishing books, or presenting at conferences. Importantly, this is our main criterion for promotion and securing tenure.\n\nTeaching is teaching a couple of classes each quarter, designing classes, and holding office hours.\n\nThe third component is service which is essentially serving on committees, university governance, and in administrative roles.",

It's not just \"ah shucks, I forgot\", it's \"I totally tanked the grade of everyone in that class, stunting their opportunities\".\n\nUsually what I do if my peers and I are getting screwed, is post all of my notes, practice questions I've written, and all of the strategies I'll be using on exams. After that, I encourage everyone who didn't get decent resources to complain. It's not much, and it probably doesn't even make a difference, but if I can just make their life just a little bit harder, that's a victory. I have no patience for profs letting their students down and sabotaging their success.

With a flipped classroom, they are forced to work in class, and then the lectures are more easily watched at home.\n\nBut there is a huge issue: students hate it. 90% of students absolutely despise being made to work in class. Everyone knows it produces better outcomes but students are their own worst enemies. They will drop the class when they learn its flipped classroom and join another \"easier\" course.\n\nThere's also a growing trend for students to avoid doing the work in class because it makes them \"nervous,\" of they have other accommodations through the disability office. In these cases, the students do neither the work in class nor watch the lectures at home. \n\nI'm heading out for dinner now, so I can't continue this conversation further, but believe me when I tell you that teaching is vastly more complicated than you are making it out to be.",

Our intense discomfort **every single day of the year** was much more immediate and impactful. The stress, the illness, students crying in the professor's office, even suicide attempts. Flipped classrooms are generally discriminatory against students will illness or disability because you can't adapt in-class material much. Doesn't feel like much of a gift horse when you have to pay for it.",

My class covered a large volume of material very quickly, but at no point did it ever feel unmanageable. It felt like I was improving as a student at the same rate that the material got harder, even as a working student. I loved my flipped classroom, it was stressful sometimes, but always within reason. Speaking with my cohort, this was the common perception. I'd do it again for sure. I'm snickering at my upper division courses right now because of how tame they are by comparison, the content is scaled down as if they expect that the entire class is incapable of studying well (I don't really know if that's true because of COVID, maybe they aren't, I don't know). I can accept that we're outliers, or that there is some difference in the presentation of material or literal course content that changed our perception. That's unfortunate to hear though, I didn't know they had that sort of reputation. I don't think it has to be miserable.",

ADHD folks only really ever asked for extra exam time, and felt they could keep up well with small group assignments or clicker questions. People with test anxiety could take their exams in the testing center earlier or later in the day by a few hours, and got extra time. The clicker questions were so low risk that there was basically nothing to lose (most of the points were participation). Never was anyone singled out during class. Those with physical disabilities got accommodations like someone to write for them if needed, to take notes, work through problems verbally, etc.. There was an open, variable credit problem session for extra help, and people could use it as a financial aid gap filler by increasing their credit count. It was supportive in a lot of ways, definitely more than I'm mentioning here.",

It's normal for lecture courses to give practice exams and practice quizzes, except they do them outside of class time. How are you going to give a disabled student extra time on a quiz without disrupting other students **or** outing them for having disability accommodations? They can't go sit the quiz in another room because they'll miss out on stuff after the rest of the class finishes. And it's just not right for you to say that there is nothing to lose for low-point quizzes. Those are points. They matter to people. Just because it adds up to 5% doesn't make it \"nothing\", especially when some people are forced to lose almost all of that. You're capping disabled students' grades and physically preventing them from achieving >95%.\n\nPlus, extra time doesn't even work for quizzes. 1.5 time on a 5 minute quiz is still impossible for someone with schizophrenia. All you're doing is punishing the student for being ill. Even if you made the quizzes worth nothing, you're forcing that student to fail at a task and there is absolutely nothing they can ever do to succeed. That's cruel and wrong. I'm talking from personal experience of being the disabled person - don't tell me that it works for disabled students, because it just doesn't.",

That's what people commonly understand to be a regular lecture course. Freeman is way off-base on that one.

Your average professor defines flipped classroom as *flipping the classroom structure 180deg*.\n\nWhat you've described is a stock-standard lecture course, not a flipped classroom. Nearly 100% of classes in Australia already run like that, it's not special, it's not new, it's not rare or uncommon. It's the standard.",

I don't really know what to do with that. Examinations are much more biased, this way at least people can learn from their peers and be forced to collaborate and make study groups. If the argument is that all of academia is biased against those with disabilities, I absolutely agree. If the argument is that this model is worse for disabled students, I strongly disagree. I don't know that clicker questions are a source of shame for anyone. I'm not certain of the requirements for those with disabilities, but I'm aware that these clickers could be done at home (usually for partial credit, but I see no reason that they could not be provided to disabled students at home for full credit). We had a few assignments given to us that way. These are flexible circumstances, I don't think the fact that I don't have immediate answers for you is any cause for alarm, I'm not the pioneer of this model, just a product of it.",

I get that you don't like flipped classrooms, but I really think this is something else you haven't been exposed to. I can't fix your experiences retroactively or make them better, what I'm telling you is that this model is flexible and helps people to succeed. This is a very dramatic response to the exploration of ideas for DEI, ideas that are working to promote student success. This model exists because teachers want to help students, for that reason, disability barriers are a welcome challenge to it. In pursuit of equity, this is the best we got right now, and it will be iterated to help as many people as possible. I think it's a difficult decision to make to sacrifice the success of low SES students, women, first generation, and minority students, just so that all vulnerable populations can be screwed in the same way. What we have now is a step-forward with many steps to go. At very least, this addresses many disparities in stem, which is a laudable goal",

Do you think time and a half magically fixes anything? You know it doesn't. Learning better is the best thing you can do for people. Becoming more competent is an empowering force that increases confidence and ability, even if it's a \"time crunch\" of only having 5 or so minutes to answer one of 400 questions in a quarter (1/8th of a point). If your disability is so severe that bombing a few clicker questions will crush you, then the whole examination structure of academia will destroy you. Clickers provide immediate feedback and a mechanism by which competence can be measured and confidence can be established. If you fail, well, it looks like you need to study. If you fail, and you have a learning disability, now you know exactly how hard you need to work to keep up with your class. You can bomb now or on the exam.

I have seen people that have to use devices to type with their mouths or or voice activated because they cannot use their hands. This doesn't make them less capable, but it does make clicker quizzes basically impossible. \n\nI have seen individuals with dyslexia take clicker quizzes without extended time and fail just because they couldn't process the question in time.\n\nIndividuals with visual impairment and hearing impairment are also hugely impacted. If visually impaired they have to wait for the professor to verbalize the question and answers which is automatically going to give them less time than anyone else in class. For hearing impaired students in a music class I had to deal with, they had to wait for it to be translated by their ASL interpreter.\n\nThis isn't about studying and not trying hard enough. Yes, there are individual accommodations that can happen to help these stduents... they all basically amount to extra time. I fail to see how clickers help with anything other than attendance.\n\nUniversal Design means designing a course in which the above scenarios are taken into account at the beginning. That means no clickers in my book. They are at this point old technology and expensive for students. I think we can do better.",

There is no replacement for practice exam or study questions. Like I said, I don't care how hard you're working, it takes a 40 minutes MAX to construct a practice exam. Volume doesn't matter.

You mean terminology -- as in knowing the discipline specific words for things? Yeah, that matters. \n\nPart of evaluation is determining whether students can creatively apply knowledge to new problem sets. I can tell that what you want are practice tests that provide similar or identical problems to the exam. I imagine that if the exam didn't match the practice, you would likely be one to complain.  \n\nThe textbooks I use are full of practice problems for students, but I don't reproduce the test for them as rehearsal. Part of the evaluation is the ability to think critically and apply knowledge to new problems.\n\nAnd that is current with trends in scientific pedagogy, by the way, so you don't need to tell me to follow the data.",

Biased language in examination is what I'm talking about, and I'm sure you're aware of it.\n\nPractice problems in books are great, what's even better is study questions and practice exams. The trends in pedagogy are that study questions and practice exams are effective ways of reducing class divide and will raise the capability of all students. Rehearsal from practice exams is excellent, every med school uses NBME test banks. Every LSAT, MCAT, PMAT, DAT test taker takes a practice exam. Everyone one of them likely scores higher for having done so. Practice exams do not reduce their ability to think critically, but raised their base level of capability. This is the zone of proximal development. Frankly, we are not using more effective techniques in undergraduate courses for synthesis, than we are in our graduate programs. The way you think is dated, it is the idea that learning should be painful, but this is simply not the case. Being pro-student is not anti-learning, you're just giving students the resources to help themselves.",
