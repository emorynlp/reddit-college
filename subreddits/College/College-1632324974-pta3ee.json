Very recently I've had some serious doubts about what I want to do with my college career and I felt like at least some unbiased opinions could be helpful.\n\nContext: I originally attended Georgia Tech for CS for two semesters, fall 2018 and spring 2019. Coming from a very small Connecticut high school to a massive southern public university, I experienced some serious culture shock and was fairly depressed. My grades floundered for it and by the time my second year was to start I had decided it may be wise to look into transferring. After some searching, I had decided on RIT and the game design/dev program. In Spring 2020 I took some classes at a local community college, and from Fall 2020 to Spring 2021 I attended RIT virtually, and am now on campus.\n\nBut recently, I've had a nagging feeling I cannot ignore. While I am undeniably happy here-- I have friends, I like the program-- I can't be sure if I'm wholly \\*satisfied\\*. While I enjoy the game design program, I've recently read a lot of anecdotes implying you really would be better off just pursuing computer science or software engineering. And while I have no qualms about changing my major, I really did come to RIT for the game design program. I don't mean to knock RIT at all, but I also can't pretend there aren't other institutions where I might want to do CS/SE. At this point, I have three realistic options: \n\n1) Stay at RIT and change majors to CS/SE. If I must, I certainly don't think I would be in any position to complain about having a degree from RIT.\n\n2) Readmission to Georgia Tech. All things considered I left Tech in good standing and could absolutely see myself returning. I feel like a much more mature person than I was a few years ago and admittedly do have some nostalgia for the place.\n\n3) Transfer again. I am not sure how good or bad of an idea this is and if this makes me looks undesirable as an employment candidate going forwards. I've been performing well academically here and I don't think it would be unreasonably difficult to find another school that would take me.\n\nAny advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated. \n\nTL;DR: Transferred to RIT, not 100% sure if it's the right fit, not sure if I should change my major, return to Georgia Tech, or transfer somewhere else.", "author": "HeirToTurnabout", "created": 1632324974, "retrieved": 1632946560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
