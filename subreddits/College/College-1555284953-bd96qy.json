  "title:": "Professor lowered my grade from a C to an F after the semester ended",
  "text": "As the title says. I took a Financial Literacy course last semester and completed it with a 76. That was the number on my transcript when the semester was fully over (finals were graded and entered). I checked my transcript again today, more than halfway into the next semester, and found that my grade for the course was now a big fat F. I asked the professor why they would go back and change it and they claimed that \"they didn't feel I knew the material well enough.\" Is there anything I can do about this? Should I bring it up with the dean?",

Like, would give you a 80.7% on homework assignments.  He explicitly stated in the syllabus that 70.0 through 79.9 would receive a C as a final grade.  \n\nI went to him after grades posted and gave him the math that I calculated to receive a C.  He even agreed, but said that he felt that too many students scored \"too low\" and that he failed those in \"that category\" (undefined).  \n\nI went to the Econ Chair and after a few interactions, I had the grade changed to a C.  Like many have suggested in the thread,  and considering my case, I'd go above his head.  Good luck,",

      "text": "Ok first off there is always a chain of command (sorry I used to be in the army) or in this instance a chain of authority.  Start of by going to the head of the department then go from there if they do not assist, but never accept that F, and here is why. \n\nA professor is not supposed to change a grade after the fact, there is a reason even THEY have a deadline to have grades in.  So that they can\u2019t go in later and change them for things like, personal reasons, like if they get a bad review from a class and they perceived that it came from a certain student. There are checks and balances to both protect not just the professors but students as well, so that you can feel safe to report bad professors. \n\nThen that brings us to this point, a CLEAR violation of school policies, changing a grade after the fact. You have the proof. So bring the actual proof of the before and after to the head of the department and explain the situation, as unbiased as possible. If they do not assist, go to the next in line in the chain.  But never go straight to the top.   Remember, everyone is human, and we are all flawed and make mistakes. Maybe there is something going on? Idk, but that\u2019s your job to figure it out since it is your grade on the line. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d",

During the recession more people went to school, and when the economy improved those students dried up. Couple that with low birth rates across the country at the end of the 90's during the tech boom, and we are all competing for a smaller groups of students than we did 10 years ago (this has been teaches with high school graduation numbers). The solution to make up the gap in enrollment is to decrease standards so more people can get in. At my University, we have started admitting more students on a provisional basis who had lower than 18 on the ACT. They generally don't make it past their first term.",
