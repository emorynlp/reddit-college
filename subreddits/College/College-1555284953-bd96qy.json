I took a Financial Literacy course last semester and completed it with a 76. That was the number on my transcript when the semester was fully over (finals were graded and entered). I checked my transcript again today, more than halfway into the next semester, and found that my grade for the course was now a big fat F. I asked the professor why they would go back and change it and they claimed that \"they didn't feel I knew the material well enough.\" Is there anything I can do about this?

Start of by going to the head of the department then go from there if they do not assist, but never accept that F, and here is why. \n\nA professor is not supposed to change a grade after the fact, there is a reason even THEY have a deadline to have grades in.  So that they can\u2019t go in later and change them for things like, personal reasons, like if they get a bad review from a class and they perceived that it came from a certain student. There are checks and balances to both protect not just the professors but students as well, so that you can feel safe to report bad professors. \n\nThen that brings us to this point, a CLEAR violation of school policies, changing a grade after the fact. You have the proof. So bring the actual proof of the before and after to the head of the department and explain the situation, as unbiased as possible. If they do not assist, go to the next in line in the chain.  But never go straight to the top.   Remember, everyone is human, and we are all flawed and make mistakes. Maybe there is something going on? Idk, but that\u2019s your job to figure it out since it is your grade on the line.
