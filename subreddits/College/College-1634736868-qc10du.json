  "title:": "Broke my ankle and can\u2019t get to class and my professor is being an asshole about it ????",
  "text": "This is blowing my mind I broke my ankle on the 6th of this month ( super shitty) and I\u2019m in a full cast to my knee totally unable to drive. I live in a town with no family and my boyfriend works 9-5 in another town and is unable to drive me to class. I emailed my professor explaining the circumstances and apologizing for it being an inconvenience and I get an email back asking why I still can\u2019t come to class? I don\u2019t understand what he thinks I\u2019m suppose to be doing ??? In the age of covid you\u2019d think he\u2019d just let me zoom but since I\u2019m not technically sick he won\u2019t. Any advice ? It\u2019s a discussion based class and that\u2019s his argument as if I can\u2019t speak through zoom?? Anyone dealt with a professor like this before? should I contact campus disability? Someone please help",

They can provide formal documentation and help advocate for you (assuming you have a good DoS office).\n\n*edit: the dean of students is someone different from the academic deans. Do not contact the academic dean of the particular college/unit until you first contact the department chair if you decide to go that route. In any case, without formal documentation, no one in academic affairs will be able to do anything.",
