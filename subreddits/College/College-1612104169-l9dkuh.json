Just go to the website you\u2019ll be using for you homework", "text": "Access codes for webassign, Pearson and other sites professors what you to use really shouldn\u2019t cost as much as a textbook if your only purchasing the access  code. So instead, just login to webassign( or whatever site you\u2019ll be using) and just enter your class code and buy access through them. It\u2019s called an online access code. If you purchase access online, it is automatically applied to your account and it\u2019s normally a fraction of what you pay in the book store. [I\u2019ll even link the support ](https://webassign.com/support/student-support/access-codes/) for doing so explaining each one. Same goes for Pearson. You still get the same resources as everyone else, but you\u2019ll be paying much less. Just think about. Why pay, on average, $150 for a code though your bookstore, when you can go directly to the site and pay less. An access code for my algebra class was $190 but paid $90 after setting up my account and buying it on Pearson.                                  \n\nSay it\u2019s a scam for me to explain to you that you can go through the homework site with class key in hand. Access codes can expire or be recycled without you knowing. So instead of going to your school\u2019s bookstore, go onto the site, select purchase online accesss purchase, and you\u2019ll be saving money on top of the fact it\u2019s faster than waiting in line for it. It\u2019s one of the many things the bookstore will never tell you, because access codes sell quick.", "author": "LittleHaitian", "created": 1612104169, "retrieved": 1632947183, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1523, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"glmf2ju": {"link": "/r/college/comments/l9dkuh/paying_150_for_an_access_code_is_a_scam_just_go/glmf2ju/", "text": "Lol people actually buy the physical book with a code??\n\nI just buy online and get access to the book online anyway.

This is probably true for a lot of colleges, but not all of them. \n\nSome colleges/courses (like mine and OP) only list one or two options for purchasing course material. For example, there are two main ways to getting the access code: buying the access code separately and buying a textbook with the access codes. It's possible that OP's college only provided the textbook option. Getting the ebook version or buying a used textbook is usually a much cheaper option than buying a new physical textbook, so it's usually better to buy the access code separately.\n\nFurthermore, some college bookstores only list access codes/subscription prices for maybe one semester. Sometimes for classes with multi-semester sequences like Calc and Chem, it can be advantageous to purchase multi-term access codes/subscriptions since that's usually cheaper. \n\nAgain, colleges can have the opposite problem as above: they only offer multi-term access codes when you might only need a one-semester access code.\n\nFinally, sometimes.colleges have prices that are actually cheaper than the normal publisher price. For example, my prof was able to talk to the college's publisher rep and get discounted prices for multi-term access codes so that the difference between 1 semester's worth and 4 semesters was like $14.\n\ntldr: College bookstores often don't give you the full range of options that publishers offer, so it might be better for students to go see what option best suites their needs.
