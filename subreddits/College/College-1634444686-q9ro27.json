      "text": "Once a lawyer told me that if you\u2019re ever at a party that gets busted for underage drinking and the cops are arresting everyone, but you personally were not drinking, tell the cops that you were not drinking and you want an Alco-Sensor test to prove it. It\u2019s not illegal to be at a party where other people are drinking if you are underage so this will get you out of trouble. \n\nIf you are drinking at said parties and you\u2019re underage, idk, run fast? Don\u2019t go to dorm parties? Go to parties off campus? Why do people have dorm parties anyways that\u2019s just like asking to be busted.",

Even if a party gets shut down it\u2019s highly unlikely they will persecute every single college aged kid at a college aged party. Most likely tell everyone to get out and go home. Go have fun and make memories but with eyes in the back of your head.",

      "text": "Assuming the US:\n\nJust go. Simply attending a party is not illegal. The police must have reason to believe that you were personally involved in criminal activity in order to arrest you.\n\nIf you DO end up meeting the police:\n\n\\- Say, \"I am invoking my right to remain silent,\" and mean it. If the police threaten you, then talk (in that case, make a mental note that the police threatened you. Your speech is then \"coerced\" and the police can't legally use it as evidence against you.)\n\n\\- Do NOT give the police permission to search anything you have (your clothes, your car, your house, your dorm, etc.) but don't resist if they do so without your consent. A non-consensual search is subjected to strict legal scrutiny - for example, the police must now have, at minimum, reason to believe that the search will result in the discovery of evidence to prove you're a criminal. If those standards aren't met, the potential court may throw out the evidence AND any evidence they collect because of that evidence.\n\n\\- Lawyer up.",

Campus police in general are pretty chill. I\u2019ve been to some off campus parties that were busted by non-campus police and even then there weren\u2019t any arrests; they just wanted to make sure everyone was ok and could get home safe. Go out there and have fun!",
