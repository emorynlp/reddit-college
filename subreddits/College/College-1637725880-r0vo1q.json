  "text": "I LOVE college. I engage in lecture and take copious notes. I enjoy discussion section. I love thinking about all the things I've learned and the ways they intertwine, complement, contrast, and complete each other. I kid you not, literally every day of high school and now college feels like an adventure. My subconscious daily thought is: \"what marvelous new things will I learn today?\" Sounds cheesy, but it's just my personality. (And I'm smart, lol.) I love learning. Always have. But....\n\nI find no joy in completing assignments. ZERO. I don't feel pride in doing them. They don't make me feel like I'm progressing towards my goals, or becoming a better academic. Despite investing hours of work into them, I feel like I've not enhanced my learning journey. Obviously, this is disconnected from reality. I've rationally seen myself get better at assigned tasks over my scholastic journey, but somehow, I'm emotionally disconnected from this.  As an example, I finished a very, very difficult assignment the other day, and did NOT care. I'm a very emotional person, which makes this problematic. Because my emotional brain doesn't value homework, I don't care if assignments get done or not. Rationally, I know this is a problem, because homework is critical to deeply understanding a subject and passing the course.  \n\nAny advice on healing this disconnect? I know that well-done assignments are some of the most concrete tools I have as a student to show my skill and work. Why can't I take pride in them?? Why can't I see how they're making me better at learning, which I love to do?\n\nH",

Instructors know and have a reason for assigning them. I'm not sure what you expect telling your instructors \"I don't feel anything doing your assignments\" will accomplish.",
