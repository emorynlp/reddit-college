I\u2019m not familiar with any biotech stuff because most my classes were microbio/biochem. Also, this is my first work experience (don\u2019t even have any research experience). \n\nWhat should I do or prepare for this internship? Should I review my previous class materials such as organic chemistry?", "author": "hannah_gg", "created": 1591023263, "retrieved": 1632947990, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 597, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fsmyl0d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gum1aa/dealing_with_extreme_anxiety_my_first_internship/fsmyl0d/", "text": "You'll probably laugh at this post once you are a few weeks in.

I spent a lot of my internship running back and forth from different people asking all sorts of questions. They will take the time to teach you if need be and really won\u2019t be too hard on you. So even if you feel anxious just know that the people there WILL help you if you need it. And dont be afraid to ask questions either. Its an internship not a full-time career. So go in with the mindset to learn all you can (even if its not really something you\u2019re interested in) because its not a bad thing to learn all you can. And who knows maybe you will fall in love with biotech and maybe not but the important thing is to have the mindset that you are there to learn not take on the full workload of someone with a degree to be there. \n\nAnother thing is if its your anxiety thats taking control, find something that will calm you down that you can routinely do before something that could set your anxiety off. For me if its big things like an important interview, I will take a few minutes before heading out and just walk around with a sword in my hands to hear the little clinks it makes against the ground. For smaller things, like anxiety to talk to a cashier or something, Ill repeatedly sing a line to one of my favorite songs. \nAnxiety is a bitch and the only cure is to distract it with something else.", "author": "Durkeslurpee", "created": 1591073817, "upvotes": 2}, "fslhj1q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gum1aa/dealing_with_extreme_anxiety_my_first_internship/fslhj1q/", "text": "Come in with a positive attitude, a willingness to learn, and get prepared to roll up your sleeves. \n\nI\u2019ve managed lots of interns and the bar for success is shockingly low.

So you don\u2019t really have to prepare or anything.
