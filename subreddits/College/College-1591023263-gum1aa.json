  "text": "Hi guys, Im an upcoming junior in biochem/microbio and got an internship offer from biotech company (this summer). \n\nBiotech is not something that I\u2019m interested in but I decided to take this offer because its kind of related to my major and its hard to find any good internship that is not virtual. \n\nThey told me that I\u2019ll be doing some lab work but.. I\u2019m not familiar with any biotech stuff because most my classes were microbio/biochem. Also, this is my first work experience (don\u2019t even have any research experience). \n\nWhat should I do or prepare for this internship? Should I review my previous class materials such as organic chemistry?",

      "text": "I did my first internship about a year ago through my school (they have a built in co-op system) and one of the things that I have learned is that everyone there will not judge you because you are an intern trying to get experience. I spent a lot of my internship running back and forth from different people asking all sorts of questions. They will take the time to teach you if need be and really won\u2019t be too hard on you. So even if you feel anxious just know that the people there WILL help you if you need it. And dont be afraid to ask questions either. Its an internship not a full-time career. So go in with the mindset to learn all you can (even if its not really something you\u2019re interested in) because its not a bad thing to learn all you can. And who knows maybe you will fall in love with biotech and maybe not but the important thing is to have the mindset that you are there to learn not take on the full workload of someone with a degree to be there. \n\nAnother thing is if its your anxiety thats taking control, find something that will calm you down that you can routinely do before something that could set your anxiety off. For me if its big things like an important interview, I will take a few minutes before heading out and just walk around with a sword in my hands to hear the little clinks it makes against the ground. For smaller things, like anxiety to talk to a cashier or something, Ill repeatedly sing a line to one of my favorite songs. \nAnxiety is a bitch and the only cure is to distract it with something else.",

In terms of what to expect it depends on what team you join, size of company, whats going on etc. But normally it starts with orientation and training so its somewhat chill at first.  So you don\u2019t really have to prepare or anything. Just be eager to learn and open to anything (and at least by the end of the internship you will know if biotech or lab work is right for you lol ) Being a good team player and being able to follow instructions will help a lot too . PM if you have more specific things you wanna ask!",

I was in your shoes a year ago about to start my first internship doing something that was kind of related to my major, but not exactly what I wanted to do. What I took away was that they didn't expect me to come in knowing everything, but rather be able to learn quickly.\n\nNothing from my classes was really relevant (I'm an Industrial Engineering student and I worked in Pharmaceutical Serialization in supply chain), but I just made sure to focus on learning for the first few weeks, and that made all the difference. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do great!",

Interns are expected to pick up new skills and to work hard, but they aren't typically expected to have a lot of job skills right away.  \n\nIt's possible some of your work will be related to prior classes, but it's also entirely possible that you'll be doing something specialized and unlike any kind of lab work you've done for school. I think reviewing old class material before you find out what kind of work you'll be doing is probably a waste of time. \n\nI suggest you reach out to the hiring manager or internship coordinator and ask them if there's anything you can do to prepare, or anything you should bring with you on your first day. On your first day (and really, throughout your internship), I suggest you take a lot of notes and ask clarifying questions when you don't understand something.",

Since it is an internship, there might be opportunities to go out in the field to work/collect samples (again, not sure exactly what BT/BC does), or perhaps even travel to conventions/conferences.",
