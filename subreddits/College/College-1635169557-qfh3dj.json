  "title:": "Should I withdraw from a class I will get a D in?",
  "text": "Preface: I am in community college, so the cost is bad but not impossible to make up. \n\nSo I am doing poorly in several classes for several reasons, (I had very little motivation to move forward with school until maybe a week ago and not a lot of free time) and today is the last day to withdraw without academic penalty. I won't get a refund, but I won't get a failure either. I did a quick calculation of two of my classes and with more effort and realistic good grades I can easily score a D. Is that even worth it? Should I drop one or both of these classes anyway and try again next semester or should I try and stick it through for a D? (I don't think my GPA will fare well with D's, but I also don't know how much they will hurt). I would talk to my academic advisor about this but they have been unavailable for the past several days and so I need to make this decision without them.",

I got a D+ in an elective course, which is considered passing at my CC for elective courses. Now if you're going to get a D in a core class, I doubt there's really anywhere out there that will offer credit for a D in a core class. Usually it has to be at least a C-. I still have a 3.66 GPA which isn't that bad, all things considered. I just really didn't want to have to take another class to fill it or waste the money I spent on the course, so I stuck with the grade.\n\n2 classes at a D is pretty rough, but again, I suppose it depends on your situation. Past *maybe* your first job, GPA isn't going to matter. If those will be passing grades for you and you aren't looking to transfer into a competitive major or go to grad school, then you could get by with 2 Ds.",
