I did lots of practice to get an A\\* in further mathematics and found that solving problems that have weak relation to real life is not funny at all.\n\nThe only reason that pushes me to major in math is the job opportunities you can have with a mathematics degree, but I'm afraid whether I can do well--college math seems to be the next level. I read some BSc dissertations and that makes me so anxious--I cannot even understand a word, and that's what I'm going to finish four years later.\n\nShould I choose other majors like biology(not planning to enter medical school)?

My advice is to one of these things:\n\n1) Major in something you enjoy and find a way to make a decent living with it. For example, I am a history major and plan to become an archivist. I won\u2019t make tons of money, but it\u2019s a solid career and I love history. If you like biology, you could look into a career as a lab technician.\n\n2) If money is your goal, find something that you don\u2019t mind doing as a job. For example, perhaps business school  or actuarial science is more bearable than applied math. You might not love it, but if you don\u2019t mind it you can make enough money to do what you love in your spare time.\n\n3) Go to a trade school. It won\u2019t cost as much, and careers such as welding and plumbing can make you good money.\n\n4) If you still want to try to get an applied mathematics degree, try taking a few courses your first year and see how it goes. There will be plenty of time to change your major to something else if you don\u2019t like it.", "author": "Snoo-68096", "created": 1632624020, "upvotes": 7}, "heanwel": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvkf18/can_i_get_an_applied_mathematics_degree_with_no/heanwel/", "text": "Plus, I have to repay lots of money so my career future is also important...", "author": "washthegoldenbottle", "created": 1632622275, "upvotes": 0}}}
