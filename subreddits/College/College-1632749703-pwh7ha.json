While a tablet can be great, if you want to handwrite your notes but have them available digitally, a rocketbook is a much cheaper option. You write on it like a normal notebook, with a special pen, and then can scan it with your phone and send it to your choice of clouds or other destinations. Then you can wipe the pages clean with a cloth to reuse.
