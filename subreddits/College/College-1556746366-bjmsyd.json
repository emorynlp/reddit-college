While there are exceptions, many high schools do not encourage creativity and self expression. Among students, there could be antipathy toward many of the ideas that truly make us human. Acceptance of identity is much different. Maturity gaps between students often create conflict.  In high school, the things that are often viewed as \u201ccool\u201d are false pretenses of how people should behave. The apathetic attitude that is often reinforced amongst high school peers causes huge issues. People sometimes pretend not to care about what\u2019s important. This then leads to them actually not caring... which leaks into a group culture of apathy. It\u2019s actually an interesting case for psychology and sociology that could be quite fruitful to study more in depth. The bulk of educational systems focus on memorization and uniform learning objectives when true learning requires specification for every student\u2019s unique affinities. While general education can scratch the surface of many subjects to lend useful information for life and further education, many students study to memorize and never truly learn or retain information. High schools can also tend to veer away from critical thinking. There are various levels of knowledge, but if students are not guided to understand and then encouraged apply what they are learning, they will likely retain very little. All the hard work or high school can seem wasted, but it could also be an opportunity to excel and go above and beyond what the education system expects. Challenge yourself. Dive deeper. Ask teachers to make work less busy and more applicable. Challenge your teachers! Set an example of learning.

It depends what you consider.\n\nAcademically? Hell, no. I coasted through high school (mine was supposed to be one of the hardest in the area, as well) and uni is kicking my ass so much my semester died in endgame. Sure, I studied a lot even in high school, but failure was something I considered an exception and I got my diploma absolutely on time, may have failed some tests but I never failed a class at the end of the year, never had to take summer courses to make up, etc. Can't say the same for university, which really isn't going all that well despite me putting in hours of raw studying daily... which taught me sitting on my laptop studying for hours simply does not cut it anymore, it's a lot more complex than that. You're going to change a lot - how you study, when you study, get smart about your time, track your days, decide what is the perfect combination of place - hour - workload to get the most work done possible and go from there.\n\nMainly, academically, the main difference is the approach. Generally, in high school, if something wasn't in the lecture it won't be in the test. In college? A lecture is a broad overview of a topic, you are **expected** to study the rest on your own, not only on the textbook, but also on the internet. Something doesn't have to be in the textbook and in the notes to be tested. Nobody understands the first time during the lecture. Nobody coasts with just attending and never putting work in at home. Lectures are a study guide, not the material.\n\nSocially? Absolutely, it's so much better in uni. Turns out, being in a group of relatively mature 19 or 20 year olds who share the same interests as you do and are not there just for a matter of geographical convenience and care enough about education to be delaying their entrance in the workforce and spending thousands of dollars to further it will result in a better experience of being with a group of unvetted immature 16 year olds who are all completely different people with completely different interests and are still not mature enough to realize those \"high school social norms\" are bullshit and they're living in a bubble that does not reflect the real world at all.", "author": "chic_luke", "created": 1556785629, "upvotes": 1}, "emas48v": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bjmsyd/why_was_high_school_so_awful/emas48v/", "text": "In college you're meant to spent as many hours in independent study as you are in class.\n\nIn high school not so much.", "author": "Third_Chelonaut", "created": 1556784218, "upvotes": 1}, "emaq9v6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bjmsyd/why_was_high_school_so_awful/emaq9v6/", "text": "Deep down I know High School was awful especially for me, but for some bizarre reason I always look back at it through rose tinted glasses thinking \"it was such a simpler time\" and then go into guilt tripping myself for missing out on \"pivotal\" moments in a persons life that happen at high school.

It's not that I took easier classes as a senior; it's just that I was better at managing my time and understood how things worked.\n\nThe same thing happens in college. I maintain that the most challenging class I took as an undergrad, maybe with the exception of modern algebra, was my second quarter of freshman physics. I mean that class was *fucking impossible*. I stayed up all night trying to finish impossible problem sets, felt like I had no clue what I was doing on the exams, etc. That class sucked so much compared to my other classes because it was my first taste of what classes are like when you're a physics major \u2013\u2013\u00a0problem sets that *might* have *some* solutions which can be Googled, exams where 30% of the points gets you a B, etc. But, the exception of those two classes, I feel like my junior year of HS was harder than any quarter of college. That's obviously not objectively true, but it sure feels that way to me.\n\nAnyway, what I described above is unique to the kind of classes that I took, but you see the same thing in other disciplines.
