  "text": "Looking back on high school, I spent 6 hours a day, 5 days a week at school. That's equivalent to 30 units in college. Full time in college is 12. You spend way less time in college and honestly it's easier at least for me. There are way more unspoken social norms at high school, and everyone was so much more judgemental. Anyone else feel college is easier for them and so much less of a hassle than high school? I feel like so many complain about college but don't remember how terrible high school was.",

      "text": "High school is a time period when people don\u2019t fully understand themselves or their capabilities as human beings. While there are exceptions, many high schools do not encourage creativity and self expression. Among students, there could be antipathy toward many of the ideas that truly make us human. Acceptance of identity is much different. Maturity gaps between students often create conflict.  In high school, the things that are often viewed as \u201ccool\u201d are false pretenses of how people should behave. The apathetic attitude that is often reinforced amongst high school peers causes huge issues. People sometimes pretend not to care about what\u2019s important. This then leads to them actually not caring... which leaks into a group culture of apathy. It\u2019s actually an interesting case for psychology and sociology that could be quite fruitful to study more in depth. The bulk of educational systems focus on memorization and uniform learning objectives when true learning requires specification for every student\u2019s unique affinities. While general education can scratch the surface of many subjects to lend useful information for life and further education, many students study to memorize and never truly learn or retain information. High schools can also tend to veer away from critical thinking. There are various levels of knowledge, but if students are not guided to understand and then encouraged apply what they are learning, they will likely retain very little. All the hard work or high school can seem wasted, but it could also be an opportunity to excel and go above and beyond what the education system expects. Challenge yourself. Dive deeper. Ask teachers to make work less busy and more applicable. Challenge your teachers! Set an example of learning. Seek knowledge and encourage others to do the same.",

I coasted through high school (mine was supposed to be one of the hardest in the area, as well) and uni is kicking my ass so much my semester died in endgame. Sure, I studied a lot even in high school, but failure was something I considered an exception and I got my diploma absolutely on time, may have failed some tests but I never failed a class at the end of the year, never had to take summer courses to make up, etc. Can't say the same for university, which really isn't going all that well despite me putting in hours of raw studying daily... which taught me sitting on my laptop studying for hours simply does not cut it anymore, it's a lot more complex than that. You're going to change a lot - how you study, when you study, get smart about your time, track your days, decide what is the perfect combination of place - hour - workload to get the most work done possible and go from there.\n\nMainly, academically, the main difference is the approach. Generally, in high school, if something wasn't in the lecture it won't be in the test. In college? A lecture is a broad overview of a topic, you are **expected** to study the rest on your own, not only on the textbook, but also on the internet. Something doesn't have to be in the textbook and in the notes to be tested. Nobody understands the first time during the lecture. Nobody coasts with just attending and never putting work in at home. Lectures are a study guide, not the material.\n\nSocially? Absolutely, it's so much better in uni. Turns out, being in a group of relatively mature 19 or 20 year olds who share the same interests as you do and are not there just for a matter of geographical convenience and care enough about education to be delaying their entrance in the workforce and spending thousands of dollars to further it will result in a better experience of being with a group of unvetted immature 16 year olds who are all completely different people with completely different interests and are still not mature enough to realize those \"high school social norms\" are bullshit and they're living in a bubble that does not reflect the real world at all.",

In college you're lumped together by majors so you at least have common interests, you study fields that interest you (mostly), and most everybody is there to learn.  Another difference is that one time in the second grade when you stepped in dog poop and someone called you 'poop-foot' and it stuck through high school.  In college your social past is the past and you get a fresh start.",

A big part of high school is learning your place in a social circle and figuring out what you like and dislike. When you take that away you're usually left with an overly coddled child that has to figure out how to socialize later and are shocked when they actually get out into the real world. I hated HS and I'm the OP, but there's no way I would trade it out for being homeschooled. Again, if the kid has a solid social group already or has to be homeschooled because they're an actor, or on a travel sports team or whatnot, that's totally different. I know kids though who were homeschooled and turned out really weird. I knew this girl that would literally become hypnotized by looking at a TV and if you tried talking to her she wouldn't respond until you turned off the TV. Normal people don't do that lmao.",

      "text": "One thing that I think this forgets is that with each successive year you're getting better at school, or at least the kind of school you're currently doing.\n\nI remember thinking that AP World (the single AP that sophomores took at my school) was hard, and then taking APUSH, AP Lang, and AP Stats as a junior felt *literally impossible,* and then senior year I took five AP's, plus Honors physics, plus college apps, and felt like I had *way more* free time than I did junior year. It's not that I took easier classes as a senior; it's just that I was better at managing my time and understood how things worked.\n\nThe same thing happens in college. I maintain that the most challenging class I took as an undergrad, maybe with the exception of modern algebra, was my second quarter of freshman physics. I mean that class was *fucking impossible*. I stayed up all night trying to finish impossible problem sets, felt like I had no clue what I was doing on the exams, etc. That class sucked so much compared to my other classes because it was my first taste of what classes are like when you're a physics major \u2013\u2013\u00a0problem sets that *might* have *some* solutions which can be Googled, exams where 30% of the points gets you a B, etc. But, the exception of those two classes, I feel like my junior year of HS was harder than any quarter of college. That's obviously not objectively true, but it sure feels that way to me.\n\nAnyway, what I described above is unique to the kind of classes that I took, but you see the same thing in other disciplines. A friend of mine studies foreign policy, and this dude has gotten *so fucking good* at reading that he can casually point to a stack of 5 books and say \"yeah, this is my reading for the next four days\". \n\n**TL;DR Learning how to do things \u2013\u2013\u00a0like how to take lots of classes that demand the intake of lots of information \u2013\u2013 is hard, but the more practice you get, the easier it seems. Things that used to take lots of conscious effort become second nature, and you focus that energy on learning new skills/concepts.**",

Lectures go fast and you learn a huge amount on difficult subjects in just 3 months. High school you had the same classes everyday for the whole year.\n\n8 hours of high school was fine because you basically got to chill most the time, you didnt have to pay for classes or get a job or worry about where your food comes from so there was much less stress.\n\n8 hours of college classes every day could make someone go insane.",

My motivation for academics significantly increased in college so I'm getting better grades. I was also surrounded by a lot of toxic people in high school and it's the total opposite now. I was also quite depressed back then but my mental health is so much better now. High school was the worst 4 years of my life. I know everyone's experiences are different and that it is possible for some to enjoy high school but I think people who say high school was the best 4 years for them really need to reevaluate their lives.",

Whenever people in High School ask me what college is like I just say that the work is not harder but it\u2019s not easier, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s a different kind of work because in High School, the majority of what made it so hard was how long you were in class and having homework every night. In college, the coursework is much harder, but it only really comes every once in a while (Essays/Tests). You have to completely manage everything by yourself, which is a good thing for some people and a bad thing for others. \n\nPersonally, I think that High School is the way it is because without it, at least for public schools, a lot of the kids would just be out getting in trouble. Once you are mature enough to care about your own life/studies you get a whole lot of freedom.",

I don\u2019t see the point of going to school for seven hours a day 180 days a year when probably less than 50% of that time is spent learning something new. I don\u2019t need class time to do homework, I could just leave and do it at home. I don\u2019t need class time to ask questions, my peers and I are almost adults and if at this point we really can\u2019t figure something out on our own we can come into school five minutes early or stay five minutes later to talk to the teacher.",

Got off at 12PM, teachers loved us, and actually knew what they were teaching, and put in effort to make sure we understood. To this day I go to my school and they feed us good food themselves, and look after us and our families, and invite us for functions. I guess I was lucky to study in that environment.",

That's my point, is that while some majors have more or less time investment, much of the \"difficulty\" and workload some experience comes from outside of your basics required for your degree. It's from internships, TAships, practicums, research projects and conference presentations, jobs, volunteer work, club leadership, etc. I sat next to a girl in one of my classes who had four cell phones, one for each of the jobs she was constantly on-call for, all of which were related to her future career. Still impressed to this day.\n\nCollege has a massive spectrum of \"difficulty\" and work requirement, and it's typically not a direct result of your major, but what you choose to do with the time you're not in courses.",
