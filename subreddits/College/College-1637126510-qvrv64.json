  "text": "My friend had fun all weekend, did cool stuff, but I was so stressed about this paper that I devoted most of my weekend to writing it. I\u2019m proud of how much work I\u2019ve done and I\u2019m so so close to finishing it. It\u2019s not great but I can still edit it after I turn in the draft. \n\nBut my friend came by where I was working at the library and was like \u201cI\u2019m off to bed\u201d. They saw I was working on the paper and then mentioned that they asked for an extension. Argh. I wish this didn\u2019t irritate me but it does.",

      "text": "Faculty here.  You're doing the right thing.  Do you work on time when it's due, and don't worry about how other people are managing or mismanaging their own time.  You're responsible for you, and they're responsible for them.\n\nYeah, your friend got to have fun all weekend, but even with an extension the friend still has to do the work at some point.  And, furthermore, let me assure you from years of experience that the people who ask for extensions at the last minute because they put things off too long generally end up getting what they deserve most of the time.  More than likely, regardless of when your friend turns in the paper, it's not going to be receiving any awards for brilliance and clarity.  That is, most people (but not all, of course) who ask for extensions don't do so because they honestly need time to make their paper \\*better\\*, they do it because, after wasting a large amount of time, they need additional time just to get something, anything down on the paper at all.  And in most cases like that, that \"something\" turns out to be poorly researched, poorly reasoned, poorly written gibberish.  Cases like that really irritate professors.  You give a student an extension, and even then you get some half-assed nonsense that's a waste of time to even attempt to grade.\n\nSo keep doing what you're doing and don't worry about other people wasting their own time and then having to play catch-up.  You're on the right path.\n\nGood luck.",
