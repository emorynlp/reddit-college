  "text": "Hi Everyone (\u25cf\u2019\u25e1\u2019\u25cf)\uff89\n\nCurrently, I (19) am going to a state University that is costing me around $30k a year. I thought I had chosen a college that was on the cheaper side but with the cost of loans, that idea quickly diminished. I have been searching online for community colleges. They are way more affordable but many of them don't offer my specific degree program. \n\nI have been thinking about changing my degree anyway so that isn't a problem. My question is, is state University worth the money? And how is going to a community college different? I really need some help. Thank you!!! \ud83c\udf44",

A CC should have the prerequisites required later for your major, especially if its a feeder school for your University.",

      "text": "Even if a community college doesn\u2019t have your specific major, you can still take classes there undecided. Just look at the state school you\u2019d like to finish at and find their academic plan and graduation requirements for your major, and take classes that transfer at your CC. If done right, CC is 10000000% worth it IMO. The \u201ccollege experience\u201d is a total sham, and just an excuse for people to get fucked up on drugs and alc. I loved my time at my CC more than my 4 year",
