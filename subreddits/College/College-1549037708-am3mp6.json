Jane is in her 60s and is attending classes at my university through a program that allows seniors to take courses for free, basically for fun (they can\u2019t earn a degree through this program). It has been my experience that these students tend to be more talkative and less aware of classroom etiquette, which is understandable because they haven\u2019t been in school in a long time. It has never been a problem for me in any other classes. \n\nJane is different. She interrupts constantly. Our professor is laid back, he tells lots of jokes and anecdotes and allows open discussion. But she cuts into literally almost every sentence he says, she interrupts other students when they are talking, she completely derails conversations with her own unrelated stories or questions. She makes inappropriate jokes while the professor is trying to teach. She \u201cwhispers\u201d very loudly to the students around her during lectures. She\u2019s not being malicious, she just doesn\u2019t seem to understand when it\u2019s not appropriate for her to be talking - she thinks she\u2019s the class clown making everyone laugh with her outbursts and jokes but they usually just make everyone annoyed and uncomfortable (for example, she makes many jokes about finding the young black men in our class to be really hot every time they talk - she\u2019s an old white woman). She\u2019s very disruptive and the class is moving at a snail\u2019s pace mainly due to her interruptions, but shockingly the professor has done nothing other than shoot her annoyed looks from time to time. \n\nSorry for the long background, but my question is, would it be wrong for me to ask him to talk to her? She\u2019s not just annoying me, she\u2019s actually hurting our ability to learn in this class. Other students have been complaining about the same things. I\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to join discussions or ask questions, I just want him to ask her to tone it down or be more considerate about how much class time she takes up/allowing other students to talk. But I don\u2019t know if that is inappropriate or if it would make me an asshole. I don\u2019t want to form a bad reputation with this professor. Should I talk to him or just suck it up?
