But asynchronous online classes have got to be the worst...\n\nI did miss in person classes but with covid and the dark atmosphere it does not feel the same. The social energy is very low.",

I've noticed a lot of professors have certain topics they'll let us do online instead of physically coming to class, but overall we're in person for the majority and it feels great.",
