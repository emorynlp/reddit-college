I'm lucky enough to go to a school that I can take classes online which means most of my classmates are adults. I have been forgetting that my in-person classmates are actually 90% guys who have ego issues bc they can't get girlfriends lmao. \n\n(This coming from a married female engineering student, my husband works at a pizza place with no plans for school, apparently the fact that I won't leave him to go out with one of the other engineering students is baffling to them. Idk maybe it's because he has a nice personality and I love him? He treats me like a capable person?)",

That's an arbitrary metric that's based on how your particular school does things rather than an objective measurement of difficulty. You could easily have an English major where all classes are curved around a C, in which case getting something like a 4.0 would be exceptionally difficult. You could also have an engineering department where all classes are curved around an A-. That would make it very easy to do well in. \n\nAt my school, the business students have the second lowest GPA vs. any of the other schools (engineering is first.) Nursing is higher, and Nursing actually has a higher GPA than the arts/film students. By using GPA as a metric, we would conclude that the difficulty of the majors goes Nursing -> Arts/Film -> Business -> Engineering which I think just about everyone would have issues with.",

Also they take more advanced physics classes. \n\nCS majors have to take math classes like discrete math, set theory, group theory, higher level linear algebra, (and often other algebra classes), and focus a lot on graph theory in their studies. They also have to take courses on complexity, and I found them needing to write more proofs than engineering classes.\n\nOne type of engineer will see other types of engineers taking the same basic classes as them for quite a while, but CS majors diverge from engineers fairly quickly, so I really can't think of cs as engineering. An end of second year engineer will be able to transfer to other engineering majors with a few extra courses, but to CS they would find it much more difficult, and a CS major would similarly find it very difficult to switch to any engineering major.",

It is now a lot more common to have cs programs in engineering departments though, since academia have responded to the demands of indsutry. CS at its core is very theoretical, algorithms, data structures, discrete math, theory of computation, ML, DS, are all just math. But with the maturation of the field of software engineering, I feel as though there has been a shift in pedagogy. In some ways, I feel as though engineering majors understand computer science more than their math counterparts. But at it's core, I'd like to see cs stay in math/natural sciences departments.

Meaning, it should be really easy to get a high GPA, even if you're partially illiterate.\n\nIn STEM, there's almost always an objectively correct answer, so if you haven't arrived at it yet, you know to just keep poking at the problem until you arrive at it.

A lot of kids actually switch their majors from BS to BA just to graduate because advanced inorganic is kicking their ass and BA's are not required to take advanced inorganic. Pchem is always kicking everyone's ass. The amount of stress, pain, and rage in lab is unmeasurable. Organic experiments are slave labor for clear and colorless crystals. Inorganic experiments take 10 years to complete before you're out of lab. Folding proteins is not very exciting. Imagine reading squiggly lines (all with specific orientations, heights, signal strengths, etc.) on a paper to confirm that you have your desired product because you can't actually see it. Now, imagine doing this for the rest of your life. Computational chem is also math, quantum mechanics, and everything terrible you can imagine jumbled into one class, just so you can see molecules jiggle their way into a collision. The good thing about computational chem is that if you're bad with bench work, the most dangerous chemical you will have to work with is water (most likely getting on your keyboard). Pepega.\n\nJokes aside, the field is quite rewarding and fascinating, but be prepared to cut 20 years out of your total lifespan going into this field. \n\nFor me, chemistry just makes me mad.",

I would say the pre med courses are heavy on memorization and light on problem solving while the math major is heavy on problem solving and very light on memorization (most tests are take home and open note so they're purely problem solving).  I totally agree that actual medicine is very heavy on problem solving, just not necessarily the coursework that leads up to it. \n\nYour right that orgo has a lot of content, but how hard it is depends on how you go about learning it. Math people often do very well in orgo without having to work as hard because instead of brute forcing the memorization, they recognize patterns and generalize. Instead of memorizing each reaction individually, they memorize a few key ideas and use those to derive the reactions. Now, I'm not saying this is unique to math at all, plenty of pre-med students and chem majors do this too, but it's a skill that is exercised a bit more in the math major imo. \n\nOften, pre-med students' first instincts are to just cram with anki flashcards and stuff, which is very understandable because a lot of pre med courses require that. Anatomy and physiology, memorizing amino acids in biochem, etc all require a lot of pure grinding. Orgo is a bit different in that it asks students to think about the material in a slightly different way.",

This \"skill\" is actually a trap many fall into while learning chem which ends up negatively impacting their understanding in applied chem subjects (for example buffers, synthesis, and most computational labs) \n\nAs an example, a student who \"generalizes\" and doesn't learn the differences between various ether synthesis, or reduction mechanisms, will greatly struggle on exams. \n\nI also don't think orgo is the hardest, imo that title goes to physics",

I'm not some math person here to try to dunk on people, I'm just a cardiologist (see my flair as a mod on /r/science for verification) who's taken some math courses.\n\nI don't think orgo is hard purely for the amount of content. Anatomy and physiology definitely has more memorization. But A&P is easier than Orgo because it doesn't require as much conceptual depth (at the undergrad level at least). \n\n>I also don't think orgo is the hardest, imo that title goes to physics\n\nAre you talking about individual courses or the majors? I agree that they physics major is quite hard, but the pre med physics course is not that hard imo.",

E.g. if it\u2019s a hard synthesis problem using only reactions from three chapters, it was relatively easy for me to solve, but as soon as it was a hard synthesis problem pulling from all the chapters, I couldn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t have the time to learn every single reaction and all it\u2019s nuances and variations.",

The shit some of these teachers said and did  to me and fellow students and even to my college professors, is absolutely insane. I can imagine it being the same for nurses, they get treated like shit too during internships. Where i come from, it is also a very small department in college which means your professor knows you inside out and they will burn you to the ground in public way more than you'd ever have in uni (i also did a masters). They'll literally tell you that you look like a shallow bitch (my prof said that to me the very first class because i quickly looked in the mirror after class was over because i thought i smudged my mascara) and rip you to shreds when you have to \"pretend teach\" in front of the class ( i honestly was one of the favourites but a lot of my classmates got absolutely bullied by some of our 'professors'.\nBut yeah other than that i def agree with everyone who's saying physics/philosophy/pre-med...",

I'm currently in my 5th year of my early childhood ed degree, and while our course workload isn't always as heavy as math/Chem heavy majors, the amount of field hours we need and hoops we have to jump through is insane (at least where I am). Not to mention all of the things we need to keep an eye out for surrounding child abuse, neglect, etc. And it varies a lot based on university and what area of education you go into, but anytime someone asks if I have a coloring sheet due for homework I almost rupture an artery lmao\n\nI can rock with the students all day, even on their more energetic and rowdy days. It's dealing with literally any adult in education where most problems arise. The emotional and mental energy and effort required for education is where all the heavy lifting is in those majors, whereas engineers for example are considered highly academic bc of all the math they need to do",

Don't get caught up on what is the \"hardest\" major though, just do what interest you and it'll make it easier since you'll feel more motivated. \n\nOne of the challenges of doing electrical engineering is that it is a very broad major. I've taken classes ranging from computer science to mechanical engineering and all sorts of stuff in between. Most of my mechanical engineering friends have never touched code outside of MATLAB, just as my computer science friends never had to work with mechanical engineering stuff. However, electrical engineering majors do both!",

Dislike or not, won\u2019t change it.] I\u2019d say that (most) engineering courses, in general, are probably up there, but compete for difficulty rankings with other STEM fields like molecular and cellular biology, virology, chemistry, physics, etc. But it\u2019s not necessarily the title or degree, in general, but the university taken at that makes a degree difficult. I\u2019m not sure about where everything else should fall, but I sure as fuck know that general business and most other business majors (*excluding business economics and maybe accounting*) ranks at the absolute bottom tier. Considering those students are the lowest scoring of all majors on the GMAT exam, and also spend the least time studying, writing, or reading.",

For example, you can get a psychology/humanities degree and spread out all of your \u201cdifficult\u201d premed classes while the engineering/STEM premed will be taking all of those at once at once. When I took ochem (generally seen as a more difficult premed prereq) it was my easiest class both semesters. It was nothing compared to my mass&enegy balances, diffeq, and material science, and thermo coursework. But of course, the psych premed next to me spent every session complaining about having to learn basic mechanisms. Similarly, when I took intro physics I also was taking chem, calc, and bio on top of it- while the psych premeds took a dumbed down non-calc based version and spread it out over their junior year. (It was a requirement to take right away for chemE) So yea- the difficulty is pretty relative in premed, but it\u2019s *very* consistent in engineering.\n\nEither way, I find this question to be kinda stupid. Any degree can be intense if you choose to make it that way- hell, if you wanted to basketweaving could be intense. It\u2019s all about what path you choose- sure some degrees require more dedication to do the minimum, but that doesn\u2019t mean that just because someone\u2019s in business or psychology they\u2019re \u201clazy,\u201d it\u2019s all up to what they choose.",

The work you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t necessarily hard but it\u2019s more of the quantity of the work that makes it hard. People literally live in studio 24/7 designing their projects while still taking equally as challenging engineering courses if they\u2019re doing a dual major (some of my friends are and I feel for them so much). You also have to essentially teach yourself some pretty complex building systems too along with complicated BIM software and it\u2019s just so much to juggle at once. If you\u2019re going to become a licensed architect then you REALLY and I mean REALLY gotta love architecture.",

Still in the Animal Science field, but I'd rather do research than stress over vet school and doing clinicals). It's like Pre-Med, but MORE because you're not just learning about the human body anymore. You have to learn about several different species--And trust me, they're different all right. It's a lot of commitment, a lot of money, and there are a limited amount of vet schools in the country with very few seats in each of them so it's very competitive (aka, you have to try your damndest to be on top because you're competing with hundreds thousands of others to get into vet school)",

Which is fine, but we really ought to try to let both halves of our brain intermingle, create more pathways between both sides, and use the most of our brain if we have the choice to (we totally have the choice to). I don't think I'm the best example of this, but I think I have at least tried to experiment using both sides of my brain in college. I started out in journalism and loving the chase of finding and writing a good story, and then after some time started to gravitate towards statistics, and now math as a whole. Totally opposite camps honestly, but I didn't plan this out at all, it kind of just happened that way. I'll take like 3 years longer to graduate, but I'm thankful I was able to exercise my brain and perform a little trial by fire in hopes that it will positively impact my thinking processes for years to come",
