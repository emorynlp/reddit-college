  "text": "My college experience has been rather messy between transferring and then covid and I was wondering if anyone else can relate to this weird mess that has left my ready to just move on from college?\n\nFor me, I had transferred into my college sophomore year and then everything went online mid-way through that spring. Junior year was essentially all online with campus very empty. This year, my senior year, it is mostly in-person with a vaccine mandate, mask mandate, and some capacity restrictions and a surprising amount of zoom still.  Anyways, its been rather frustrating experience for me because every year of college has been extremely different with minimal continuity year to year. I struggled a lot socially with the transition from transferring colleges and hadn't quite \"found my people\" and was struggling to find my things to get involved in. Unfortunately for me, a lot of my friends from sophomore year were really friends because of proximity and convenience, so once things went online they disappeared. So my online junior year ended up being academically dreadful, deeply lonely, and also the \"third times the charm\" of me trying to make friendships, get involved, find my community, which is a ridiculous endeavor when all of my life was trapped in zoom. Junior year ended up being super demoralizing and really took a lot out of me.\n\nEnter senior year, which to be honest is a lot better academically and sort of socially compared to junior year, but I entered the year trying to get involved, make some friends, get familiar with campus, while also figuring out career things, and honestly its been frustrating trying to make it happen for the fourth time. It hasn't gone super well, since a lot of campus orgs don't want brand new members who are seniors and while I have some new acquittances, I know from freshmen and sophomore year that it takes awhile for someone to go from being an acquittance to an actual friend, but at that point I'll be graduating in a few months, so it feels a bit pointless to really try now. I feel like I haven't been able to break out of the \"nervous, restless, seeking friends and purpose\" freshmen mood  because of how its been impossible to really settle in except at this point I have major senioritis from this whole convoluted experience, which is just dragging me down more. \n\nWhat's probably the most frustrating part is that my favorite year of college is probably freshmen year at my original college. I really wasn't happy at that college and never wanted to go to it, but that seems to be the only year of college that felt like a coherent experience were I had been able to settle in, make some friends, be sort of involved and connected to campus culture, which is probably because it was the only year of college that was really just normal, even if I didn't like that place. Between adjusting to the new college from transferring and then covid crap from sophomore year to now, I still haven't been able to get to the same level of familiarity and connection, which has left me feeling rather bitter that I worked hard to transfer to this better university and just get this crummy experience out of it. At this point I'm pretty ready to just accept college was a miserable experience for me and move on with my life.",

      "text": "I have wanted to move on from college since day 1, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t like school lol. If it makes you feel better, I\u2019m on my 8th year of college and I still haven\u2019t made a single friend (keep in mind that 5 of those years was before the pandemic). It\u2019s not a big deal. If you ask me, the whole \u201ccollege experience\u201d thing is overrated. You hear so often that college will be the best years of your life. It may be true for some people, but not for most people. It\u2019s probably just a marketing scheme to get people to enroll lol. College has actually been the worst years of my life. I\u2019m super excited to finally be graduating soon, and so should you. Once you graduate, you will have a whole new world of opportunities. You can go any route you want and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make friends then.",
