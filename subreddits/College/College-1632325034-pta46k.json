      "text": "I wish I'd spent time thinking about what I REALLY want to do during my undergraduate. I was just too busy doing what I was told to do: finish HW on time, do well on the exam, and get a good job. I was able to achieve all these, but I soon lost direction since I've never lived a self-driven life. A life that's driven by my intrinsic motivation.  \nSo I quit my full-time job as a software engineer and founded a startup to help students unlock their potential, find their genuine interests, and live a self-motivated life. It's been a fulfilling, stressful, challenging, and rewarding journey! This is something that I would've done if I had enough money to retire and do something for free, so I am glad that I started this journey earlier than later.  \nHope this helps and doesn't sound too serious!",
