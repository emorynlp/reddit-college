  "text": "I'm a freshman student at uni and i find really hard and daunting to focus on reading academic articles. What are tips to improve my reading? How to read them correctly?\n\nI'm new to uni and i feel overwhelmed and don't know how to find quality sources. My lecturer told my class that to find what you need is to type the precise keywords. But whenever i type what i need in Google scholar, it doesn't show what i need.\n\nI have to study online so i don't have much chances to meet friends or the supporters from school to ask. Please help/ guide me :<",

If it is, keep reading. If not, move on to next one. If you haven't seen what you want in about 8 articles, vary your search parameters/keywords.\n\nYou don't need to read the whole article. Just find what you need from it.",

      "text": "Practice!! I would choose a subject you're interested in and then see what articles you can come up with on a database like NCBI (and maybe learning some more about search commands could help you navigate Scholar a bit easier?). Try reading those slowly, section by section, with a lot of breaks and definitely search the meanings of any terms you don't understand. You might benefit from taking short notes while you read! \n\nSometimes reading articles in a subject you're not so familiar with can feel like you're reading something in a different language, so the best thing to do is approach it like you're \"translating\" the article into everyday vocabulary!\n\nI haven't seen [this video](https://youtu.be/t8_CW6FV8Ac), but a friend of mine really loves the channel that posted it so it might have some good tips to add!!",
