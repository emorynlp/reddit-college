  "text": " \n\nHello guys, I am just finishing my economics degree in Europe and have already had 2 years of work in my own field primarily in accounting and some banking in accordance to some internships that we have here in Europe.  \nNeedless to say, I despise every moment of my job. I dread the fact that I'll have to do this for the rest of my life since I feel it a soul-crushing and if anything boring job.  \nIf anything the lack of creativity and the formality that I have to go through is killing me. And I can't really handle it anymore.  \nDo you guys think it's weird to have 23+ students in engineering schools? Will my professors look at me differently and will I be discriminated against for my age when applying for some scholarships or internships?  \nany advice would be really appreciated and if anybody has a similar story Id really like to hear you out since no one in my family has done the same thing and career change is kinda a taboo where I come from...",
