  "title:": "Would a professor accuse a student of cheating for this?",
  "text": "I have a class where there are lots of online quizzes. I did good on most of them (perfect score) but on the last few I did bad on them. These weren\u2019t on lecture content but they were based on papers and activities we had to refer to and answer questions. \n\nFor this I\u2019m just stressed that the professor or TA will see that I got so many straight 100s from the beginning and then just got a few bad scores in a row. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m just wayyy overthinking this but I\u2019m still very stressed out. I get anxious about this kind of stuff often and meet regularly with a therapist about it.\n\nDoes this look weird? Would a professor accuse a student of academic dishonesty for this or am I just being completely paranoid?",
