  "title:": "Dropped for \u2018non-payment\u2019 11 weeks into semester despite having a full scholarship",
  "text": "I tried logging into Canvas yesterday only to find that none of the classes I was registered in were there. I went to check my email (to see if there were any system outages), and instead found an email saying that I was dropped from all of my classes due to non-payment. However I have an academic scholarship that covers all of my tuition/books for the semester. It\u2019s 11 weeks in, and there are just 4 weeks until I graduate. I called the bursar\u2019s office, financial aid, and emailed all of my professors. I was told that they are not sure what is going on, but it seems that there isn\u2019t a record of the scholarship on my account. I have all of the emails and records/documents relating to the scholarship, and I sent them to the student specialist that is in charge of my case. All I was essentially told was that they are looking into it and it may take up to 3 days to get a response. Why did they wait for 75% of the semester to go by before dropping me for non payment? Has anyone else had this problem? What did you do? I\u2019m supposed to graduate in a month and a I\u2019m terrified I won\u2019t be able to.\n\nUpdate: It turns out that it was sent to the wrong office at the college. I have contacted all of my professors and the party that issued that scholarship, and it seems to be getting in the process of being fixed. \n\nTLDR: Dropped from classes due to non-payment despite that I have an academic scholarship that covers everything. I graduate in a month. Contacted people, waiting for a response. What do I do?",

      "text": "As long as you have records then you should be good, but it can be nerve-wracking. I also have an academic scholarship and right before the start of this semester I got an e-mail saying I no longer qualified for it due to academic standing. I only needed a 3.2 and I had a 3.9, so I was definitely confused. I messaged them and they replied 2 days later that a system error had flagged my account but they corrected it. Still almost gave me a heart attack as that is how I pay for college.\n\nIf you can, I'd still attend class. I remember at my community college we had a few students having issues with the financial aid office and our professor just told them to continue coming to class if they could. It's easier to drop a class once it is confirmed the aid isn't available than it is to catch up on all the material you miss while not attending over office issues.",
