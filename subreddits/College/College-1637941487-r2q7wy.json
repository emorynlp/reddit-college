  "title:": "A girl from my old school committed suicide this year, I find it pretty bad that my college never spread awareness and didn't acknowledge it",
  "text": "She also went to my Sixth Form College (16-19 year olds), I'm not too sure whether she dropped out or not, but even so I found it pretty disgraceful how the college never held an assembly or anything like that, just reminding everyone about suicide awareness, things like that, and that there are people there for them. They're more bothered about grades students get than how they feel mentally. One thing i remember is that I admitted to teachers that I was struggling after my dad's death, they did nothing about it to help or support me, just reminded me that I had coursework due. Is it just me who feels this way or is it just the fact that life goes on and nobody really cares?",

I remember there was a school where a young woman jumped off the parking garage on campus and the university tried to distance themselves as much as they could. She was doing some kind of internship for one of the medical school departments but she technically wasn't an employee or a student, and they kept bringing that up. \n\nOther student suicides at mine and others are covered up altogether. I remember a school got in trouble recently for not including a student who had died by suicide in a memorial the school was doing and it made his family very upset.",

If it's a large college, where most people didn't know the person, there isn't really a reason to upset so many people. Announcing it would call attention to something really stressful that would burden students who are already just trying to make it through. This is a separate issue than your unkind teachers. I'm sure the people who knew this student are grieving.",

If this were to happen at someone's work, I'm sure only the close co workers would be offered some support, but the rest of the company just carries on as usual.\n\nBut I have seen individual departments of a college or the college's health center send out reminders of where to seek help, mental health reminders, and coping tips quiet frequently. I'm sure that will vary by university though.",

Students who were in her class this semester were told, obviously, and our replacement prof told us about the memorial service being held on campus (though it was mostly for her family and friends, not students).  I actually went, and I think it helped me process things and move on.  \n\nIt bothered me that there was never an announcement to the rest of the students.  I\u2019m at a small community college, and we get all sorts of messages about events all the time, but there wasn\u2019t one announcing her death or telling people about the service.  I can definitely see someone who had her say, last semester would want to know what happened and have the opportunity to attend the service, but they didn\u2019t get that.  I actually asked another professor why they weren\u2019t doing that and got a really lame answer which was basically \u201cWell they\u2019ve never done it before, so doing it now would show favoritism\u201d",

If done incorrectly, spreading awareness of a real event that happened locally can actually *increase* the number of people who commit suicide.  They probably could be doing more to give students access to mental health support, but if they just talked openly about the event it might actually be worse than them doing nothing at all.  If I was in the administration, I'd have been trying to keep it as quiet as possible while stepping up the availability of mental health support.  It's the best way to prevent a second case.",

      "text": "I'm sorry for the loss of your father, and I'm sorry that your teachers didn't help you more when you told them you were struggling.\n\nUnfortunately, it is true that life usually just goes on and nobody cares. Those of us who have lost someone close to us are the ones who will think about it often and live the rest of our lives with that pain. People who were not close to the person will say their \"I'm sorry's\", but then move on with their lives.  I do think it would be up to the family if they decided to disclose how their daughter passed away. But it is disheartening when the school doesn't do anything to support current students, especially when the people close to her would now have a higher risk of suicide. There is this attitude of \"your struggle, your responsibility\" so essentially if you need help you can find it yourself. It's ridiculous. \n\nThis mental health gap is a flaw within the education system. The system doesn't take into account the emotional/mental aspect of life. Admins/teachers etc., expect students to show up, learn and get good grades without considering how life situations impact students' ability to focus and learn which then impacts their academic performance. Educators are so afraid to talk about mental health that many students suffer in silence, and it costs lives. The education system is designed for people who can cope with life stressors, and whose mental health issues don't impact their daily lives in any way, but if you struggle to cope, or if your mental health issues impact you, then you are pushed aside. Only when something happens, like a student taking their own life, do people question \"what could we have done differently?\" But it's a question that fades quickly because, in reality, we think that it would cost too much, or take too much time just to help students learn about mental health. I think most people struggle with mental health issues - you can have situational mental health issues,  you can have a clinical diagnosis, or you can struggle but not fit a formal diagnosis. Severe symptoms or illnesses would require professional intervention (e.g., illnesses like schizophrenia). But some issues might not fit a clinical diagnosis (e.g., mild/moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression), so intervention through school (mental health education) is plausible. Teaching students how to regulate their emotions is something that can be incorporated into classrooms because it doesn't take a lot of effort, nor is it something that requires professional intervention. Teaching students how to reframe their thoughts, or how to stay in the present also don't need to be taught by professionals, they can be utilized in classrooms by educators.",

I think the annoying thing is that my 3 teachers have both their parents alive and healthy so I get jealous that my dad won't watch me succeed like theirs have. It's not their faults I know, and it's wrong of me to get jealous or envious. But also, I've seen a few comments about \"cluster suicides\" that I didn't know existed, but as you said, it is a huge flaw, especially because at my age, college in the UK is required until the age of 18/19, whereas in other countries such as the USA, college is optional",

There is a difference in presentation of awareness/prevention programs and media reports on suicides. The media tends to do a terrible job in reporting on this sensitive topic, so it can lead to people having increased thoughts of suicide. When people lose someone to suicide it can be complicated and confusing, and societal stigma can make grieving very alienating, which increases the risk of a suicide attempt.\n\nSuicide prevention, when done carefully and properly can reduce suicide risk- there is research that shows that prevention programs are effective. Similarly, research shows that asking people directly if they have thoughts of suicide does not increase their risk, but how the question is phrased is important - It's just a matter of presentation. A university or college that employs counsellors or even has a psychology department should be able to address this sensitive issue in an appropriate way that supports students. The individualistic attitude of if you are struggling you can find your own help is what leads to a lack of an appropriate response by institutions.",

      "text": "At the risk of sounding uncaring it's not really the university/college job to say when someone died from suicide. There are several of factors as well, such as the campus preventing copycat suicides, suicide contagion, or even the family not wanting the university to disclose it.\n\nThe campus is also not a high school, most campuses have thousands of students (excluding small liberal art campuses) the logistics of this would be impossible. Also people on campus die at a much higher frequency then you might think, mostly off campus (I've worked in admission and records and you would be surprised). To hold small assemblies for all these deceased individuals can be impractical. Most universities operate on providing direct help to students directly affected such as close friends and colleagues. It also comes down to budget and cost as well. Mental health services are often stretched thin or non-existent on campuses.\n\nLastly, is your teachers/professors are just that: Teachers and Professors. Some are amazing and work with students to inspire and support them educationally but the buck stops there. They are not your therapist or main emotional support . It's firstly not their job, but also something they are not really trained to do. At more responsible universities, many have QPR training to see signs of impending suicide, and training about campus support services.\n\nUnfortunately that is how life sort of is, one death doesn't really stop life from going on for the world in general. It affects people on individual levels. It's not that nobody cares but when someone tells you an individual died, you may feel a flicker of sadness for them and their loved ones, but that is it. It passes  because you don't know them, their stories or life. Some people are more callous than others but that's just life.",
