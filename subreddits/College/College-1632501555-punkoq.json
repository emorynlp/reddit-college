However, I am not emotionally tied to it at all nor have I made many friends because I am a commuter (and introvert). I just picked my current college because it accepted my dual enrollment credits easily.\n\nWith that being said, I am thinking about transferring and also living on campus come either the spring 2022 semester or the fall 2022 semester. I have a small cat and she is absolutely my favorite thing in the world. She helps so much with my mental health and I refuse to go anywhere without her. \n\nI need some suggestions for cat friendly colleges. I know there are some out there. Location wise, I prefer the north eastern region of the United States. My major is English and my high school weighted gpa was 3.65. \n\nAny help is appreciated! \n\ntl;dr Looking for cat friendly colleges!!", "author": "Wonderful_Dot3338", "created": 1632501555, "retrieved": 1632946030, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "comments": {"he4a61j": {"link": "/r/college/comments/punkoq/cat_friendly_colleges/he4a61j/", "text": "If you\u2019re transferring you should look for schools that allow students to live in off campus housing.
