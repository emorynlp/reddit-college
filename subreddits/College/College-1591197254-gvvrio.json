  "text": "I go to an out of state school where I have made tons of really good friends. I really love being there and I always feel like I have something to do.\n \n Now that I\u2019m home from school for the summer, I\u2019ve run out of things to do. I have a few friends from high-school who I see occasionally, but not all the time. I kinda feel disconnected from them, and it feels like a force to hangout with them. My parents are both working, and my brother is a social butterfly who still has tons of friends here. I usually would work everyday over breaks at home to make money and pass time, but i recently lost my job due to covid. I\u2019ve always struggled with anxiety and depression, but when I\u2019m at college the environment that I\u2019m in is healthy for me. Now that I have no set plans or anything to do for the next 3 months I feel lost. I\u2019ve been taking this time to relax, watch netflix and try to get myself in shape but it seems like its not enough. \n\n Has anyone else feel like this? What are things that you have done to shake this feeling?",

      "text": "I'm also a person who thrives off having set plans well in advance, and you taking time to relax while also exercising is a really great start and good habits to make. My advice, try to do things academic. Watch videos online/read articles about things you're interested in or your major. I actually bought a textbook for a class I'll be taking in the fall, just so I can get a head start on the subject and I'm just really interested. \n\nI'm also super introverted, so I don't really talk to anyone outside my family and boyfriend. Quarantine has been really hard for me in this way. I think having a structured day that you plan out each morning/each week really helps. Also, don't feel down on yourself for having these feelings! Everyone's experiencing it in some ways.",

I\u2018m a person who lives by routine, dies by routine, and now that that\u2019s been thrown into the abyss, I\u2019m not doing very well at the moment. I should be studying for the MCAT, but I just can\u2019t seem to find the motivation, which in turn is only freaking me out even more. Add in worrying about my immunocompromised parents contracting COVID with current events in the U.S, and I\u2019m just so freaking mentally and physically tired. I miss college, seeing my friends and sorority sisters, and so forth. I swear, over the last 2.5 months I feel like my social anxiety has regressed by being at home and not interacting with people on a daily basis. It\u2019s like Groundhog Day over and over and over.",

I actually just started volunteering today at a local cemetery and I am really enjoying it so far. I would definitely suggest looking into volunteering while you\u2019re home!",

If there is anything that you can do to create external structure (like deadlines or projects that you'd like to do given by someone else) that might help.

I go to college in NYC with and had a solid group of people and activities there... and now I\u2019m back in a town with a population of 2,400 and zero things to do. \nHere\u2019s my recs for staying sane, especially as someone with anxiety/depression:\n1. Sleep schedule! It\u2019s difficult to follow through if you\u2019ve got it off track, but try to make sure you\u2019re not staying up too late or sleeping in every day.\n2. If you can, try taking a walk or spending time outside each day. Even if it\u2019s just ten minutes, fresh air is good.\n3. Hobbies! Revisit something you used to love doing before college, or pick up something new! I\u2019m painting more, writing poetry, playing guitar, learning how to cook, and running a music blog with interviews; but not consistently! Just when the moment strikes me.\n4. catch up on your reading list and watch list! Doing non-active things and chilling out is good too!\n5. Take care of your space and keep things clean to keep your environment positive. I find it much easier to not get distracted and stressed when my room isn\u2019t a wreck. Also making sure you\u2019re doing laundry, dishes, showering, all of that helps keep your environment *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n6. Stay connected with others, we\u2019re social beings that need social interaction to be healthy. Zoom call your friends, snail mail letters to one another, do movie watch parties and games with House Party. If you want a pen pal, I\u2019d be happy to send a letter :)\nPlanning dinners, movies, game nights, anything with your family or people you\u2019re quarantining keeps your social engagement active and gives you something to look forward too.\n\nI hope these helped!",

I would suggest video calling your college friends as much as possible. Talking to my friends, even if we couldn't actually do things together, was always helpful. Something else I always used to do over the summer too was look up restaurants/activities etc in my college town and plan what things I wanted to do first when I got back that I really missed over the summer.",

I\u2019m doing some summer classes, seeing some HS friends occasionally, and workout out almost everyday but my boyfriend of 2.5 years dumped me out of nowhere for reasons that don\u2019t make sense to me so it\u2019s been a whole struggle and a half thinking about spending the next 3 months at home. Before he dumped me I was doing better but now it\u2019s excruciating being so bored and unmotivated",

Covid has made things worse, as I\u2019ve been home since march and will stay here until August. I\u2019ve started to go outside more and enjoy nature, and I\u2019m thinking of inviting a couple of college bros on an early August road trip. But right now, especially after not being able to attend a gathering back in my college\u2019s town to see people, I\u2019ve been kinda in a rut. Work\u2019s been helping to distract me, but it can only do so much. Social media and zoom and ft are also not replacements for physical interaction, and there\u2019s not really a way to meet new people right now, what with the pandemic. Honestly, it may just be a case where i just wait until august to see people again, who knows. But I\u2019m definitely feeling it too.",

Maybe an instagram theme page. Remote volunteering. I\u2019m thinking out loud. \n\nI think the most important part of college is the schedule. There\u2019s always so much to do. The friends help a lot so I guess actively try to go on video calls with them. But yeah if you give yourself a schedule you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wasting your time/ feel lonely all the time.",

What I've done is take a few summer classes to help knock out credits for easy classes over the summer. It helps with keeping active. If you aren't doing that, maybe try dating apps, social apps to meet new people. Or, the best thing that my friends and I do is have Skype calls and play games together like cards against humanity online. I'd recommend that alot since it sounds like you really miss them.",
