  "text": "Thanksgiving break\u2019s coming up soon, and I was thinking about visiting my high school to say hi to my old teachers. However, I\u2019m already aware of how it\u2019s considered clingy to visit your high school the year after you graduated. At the same time though, I didn\u2019t exactly get to see it since March last year   b/c of COVID. What do you all think?",
