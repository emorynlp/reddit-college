This alone is the best part. So much more time\n- being able to rewatch material. This has been so invaluable, you can always go back and ensure understanding without the need to book office hours or bother profs with another email. \n- this is minor and dumb but i get distracted by peoples shuffling, talking during lectures, dropping items, clicking pens or laptops with loud clicking sounds etc. I like not having hundreds of peoples fidgeting in my ears\n- i can be comfortable in my own home, its never too hot or cold, it doesnt rain on my way to the desk etc. \n\nDisadvantages: \n- professor and student burnout, i can see its not for everyone and I empathize\n- in-class group work can be a nightmare\n- test questions are often much harder in an attempt to mitigate cheating\n- ive noticed students can be much ruder in a zoom chat than I\u2019ve ever seen them be in person towards the prof\n- although this is not a struggle for me personally, I know many people struggle to stay on top of assignments and stay self-motivated throughout an online term. Its easy to miss something, too.\n\nEdit: i didn\u2019t add any social things because I think they speaks for themselves. Some students are socially thriving off of being able to stay home and some are really suffering from it.", "author": "InsulinBlue", "created": 1632062586, "upvotes": 2}}}
