  "title:": "Transferring from CC to CSU then to UC",
  "text": "So I finished my first two years of college at my local CC and I'm ready to transfer to either a CSU or UC but preferably a UC. I have already been accepted at my preferred CSU for the Spring semester but I won't hear back from any UC's until around March for the fall semester as I just sent in my application. Since I started attending CC at the beginning of the pandemic, the majority of my classes have been online and I would like to transfer and begin in-person classes as soon as possible. I was wondering if it would be logical for me to attend a CSU in spring then transfer after the spring semester to a UC for the fall if I'm accepted. My reasoning here is that since I only have a 3.3 GPA and there's a possibility of me not being accepted. I could attend a CSU now and not waste any time in the case that I'm rejected five months from now when I hear back from the UC's. I'm torn and can't decide if I should just wait to hear back from the UC's or attend a CSU now as a failsafe in case I get rejected.",
