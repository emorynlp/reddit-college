  "text": "So I want to sleep over at my boyfriend\u2019s house this Saturday but I don\u2019t know what to tell my super conservative roommate. We share a dorm so she\u2019ll know if I\u2019m not there and she\u2019ll probably freak out if I just don\u2019t come back for the night. A big problem here is that my family is also conservative and she\u2019s also in contact with them. We go out together, I see her conservative parents too. I\u2019m definitely the odd one out here. \n\nWhat do I tell her? I have to say something",

The student then has to ask themselves if the financial benefit is worth the tether if it is not they can do whatever they want with no worry. Additionally cutting family off while sometimes the right decision is rarely an easy one",
