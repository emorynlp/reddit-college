  "title:": "Is it weird to show up to an open-invite college party alone?",
  "text": "There's a party tonight, everyone posted the info on their snap stories. My friend group and I (f18) are currently really distant*, and although we used to party a lot together, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be thrilled if I invited myself to go with them. I know that I will be acquaintances with the people at the party though, and I really miss going out and socializing. \n\nIt's not off campus and I will be walking to my destination (its close), I also do not drink and I carry pepper spray, so I'm not extremely worried about my safety, but the concern is there. \n\nWould it be weird if I walked in alone? Should I bite the bullet and reach out to my distant friends? Or should I stay home and have a \"me\" night? \n\nSide note: I am considered \"low needs\" autistic (previously referred to as high functioning, you wouldn't really know I'm autistic just by interacting with me) so I don't really get the hang out a lot of social situations, im sorry if this question is kind of common sense)\n\n*we are distant because I fell into kind of a depression, its a long story, but I think they felt like I pushed them away and are the type of people to hold a grudge",

That is a strong gesture for these sort of parties. I have done it to be kind and also don't drink.\n\nI had difficulty with resocialization into the college environment my first semester as someone with high functioning asd. It got a *lot* better for me and I had a strong social life. Two tips for you: put effort into dressing for the event (I copied others styles) and realize that most freshman are probably in the same boat as you (new and wanting to socialize).",
