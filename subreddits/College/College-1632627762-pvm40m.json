I\u2019m so depressed and I hate school so much. I\u2019m thinking of transferring to another 4 year next fall or maybe transferring to community college next semester. I just feel so depressed and lost here and I\u2019m thinking maybe I should transfer but I\u2019m scared about the process and making friends as a transfer.

Idk you be the judge. I was going to a private 4 year college for my freshman year, first time really away from home. I went and made amazing friends that helped me get through the year. But I had that same emptiness, I hated all my classes, everything was online, professors sucked, I was in psychology and I hated every minute of it so I just started slowly giving up on the work, advisor was no help. So I decided to go back home because I felt I was happier there with my family, and I wasn\u2019t burning a hole in my wallet. So I transferred, the process of transferring is pretty tame honestly, just apply to the school you want, drop out from the other school, it\u2019s a pretty smooth transition. As for the friends part\u2026switching from dorming to commuting is rough, it was so easy to make friends in my dorm area, but now that I\u2019m commuting it\u2019s a lot harder, simply because I\u2019m not on campus as often as before. But being a transfer literally has nothing to do with how easy it is to make friends, in fact I found it to be helpful because a lot of people are willing to help you find the way around campus. So this is my transfer year, I feel happier because I got good professors because my advisor was super helpful in registration, I\u2019m with my family, and I still don\u2019t really know what I want to do so I just picked a general major like business, I can go into pretty much anything with a business major so I\u2019m still trying to figure that part out. The only part that stinks a little is I miss my friends and I\u2019m struggling a little to make new ones, I\u2019m too introverted, but I go home to my family everyday which is nice. Oh and I transferred into a state college, not a community. Good luck, this is my story, sorry I can\u2019t offer much more insight, but I say go for it and transfer, if you\u2019re not happy why suffer another 3 years? something like 40% of students transfer so you\u2019ll be in good company.", "author": "Kenkxb", "created": 1632632393, "upvotes": 3}}}
