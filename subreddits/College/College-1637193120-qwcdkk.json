  "title:": "I sometimes feel like I am too stupid for college",
  "text": "I am on my way of getting a political science degree. Currently in fifth semester. I have decent grades I guess, but I honestly feel like a failure. I struggle way more than my peers to get things done on time. Like, many of my assignments involve writting essays and doing research projects and I've noticed that I always take too much time to complete them.\n\nLike, for example, today I am gonna be turning in an exam that's basically a bunch of essay questions and it has taken me 20+ hours to complete it (I am not even done, just taking a quick break), when most of the people I've talked to finished it in like 6-10 hours,\n\nI think this may be because I obssess over the tiniest details. When I do research, I will often end up going on a tangent for hours because I think something may be relevant for the project. Or, in order to properly understand a concept/theory, I waste way too much time trying looking at examples when I know most people just get it on their first reading.\n\nWhile I've been told I am good at writing (and I actually was selected to help out students who are having issues in that area as a tutor), sometimes I end up working on *one* paragraph for a full hour because I want to perfectly translate my ideas on paper, avoid repeating words, and so on. Like, I edit as I write and that's not useful for getting things done fast.\n\nMy mental health issues make everything worse, because I have days in which I will just be unable to get up from bed. I have very little energy. It gets to the point in which I will go without eating for 16+ hours at a time pretty regularly. All of this make me wonder if I will even get to graduation day. Up until now, I haven't failed any subject and in some classes I've been very successful. But I am still afraid I will mess it all up.\n\nI want to do graduate courses too, maybe even get a PhD if I ever get a good scholarship. However, there's this voice in my brain saying \"lmao look, you're already struggling so badly, do you really think you're smart or capable enough to get a PhD?\"\n\nI guess I am posting this to ask for advice. If you feel or have felt the same way I do, what have you done to deal with this?",

      "text": "The point of college is to gain the knowledge you need for a successful career. If you feel \u201cstupid\u201d it\u2019s not because you are, it\u2019s because you\u2019re overwhelmed with new information that will give you the knowledge you need *not* to be \u201cstupid\u201d (or your idea of stupid). The fact that you\u2019re in college says a lot. If you\u2019re smart enough to recognize your own areas of growth that you could work on in how you handle overwhelming and new information, you\u2019re strong enough to get through. It\u2019s not supposed to be easy. \n\nDon\u2019t compare yourself to others, also. Everyone learns differently. You\u2019re here for yourself. If it\u2019s the right path to be the person you want to be, take it. If you feel college won\u2019t be worth it for you, then drop it. You\u2019re the one paying after all, and it\u2019s your life to decide what to do with. \n\nJust don\u2019t underestimate yourself, give yourself grace and room to grow and learn. I don\u2019t mean learn as in \u201clearn the material\u201d I mean it as in \u201clearn yourself.\u201d Learn how you personally handle things, and how you study, and how you unwind after being overwhelmed, and roll with that. You got this.",

      "text": "This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you being stupid at all. This just sounds like perfectionism. The difference between you and your peers is not about them getting it quicker or being smarter. It\u2019s that they know what\u2019s worth their time, and what isn\u2019t. Sometimes things need to be turned in, even if we feel we can edit it for another couple of hours. I think this gets easier over time. I hate to say that you need to be okay with things being \u201cgood enough\u201d but unfortunately that\u2019s what it might come down to. The amount of research and editing you\u2019re doing has limited return on investment, especially if you turn things in late. It takes practice but eventually you will learn what is worth your time and what is not",
