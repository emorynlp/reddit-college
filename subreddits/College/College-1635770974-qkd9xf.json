  "text": "So I\u2019m taking a biology class, plant physiology, and it\u2019s like no other biology class I\u2019ve ever taken . Every other one has practice assignments, homework, PowerPoints that directly tell you what you need to know.\nBut this class is different . No practice material given at all. No quizzes , no homework, no online programs to help you remember.\nAll we have is 45 lectures and a test after every 15 of them. I do not understand how I\u2019m supposed to practice/remember everything the powerpoints say. I feel like I\u2019m going to fail this class and it sucks! I don\u2019t understand it at all! Why is biology such a well organized subject that knows exactly how to teach nurses and doctors, but when it comes to plant science we have literally none of that. It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a class from 1850 or something , and the test is to see if you have a high enough IQ to teach yourself everything .",

      "text": "So my experience with these classes is to take in as much information as possible for the first test and then learn what/how to study based off my grade on that exam. So if I know a lot of information and how to explain it then I'll be able to see if it's broad or specific types of questions on the test. If they're broad you'll do better if it's specifics then you'll be able to see what the professor finds important based on lecture\nI recommend taking GOOD notes. Write down as much as possible and even possibly compare it to your textbook information.\n\nThese classs were either a breeze or fucking painful. More often than not thought they weren't too bad once hou learn how the professors test",

So frustrating, expecially when they know biology is all about memorizing, and that\u2019s why all the \u201cmore important\u201d biology classes have Pearson and such , becuase it\u2019s extremely hard to remember 6 things about 30 separate topics all for one test \ud83d\ude14",

      "text": "You just have to be more on top of studying it yourself rather than having extra tools to learn the information. Some professors just don\u2019t add in a bunch of extra stuff and they just want to lecture and test you. You\u2019re in charge of making your own practice assignments if that\u2019s what helps you learn the material. \n\nMake flash cards, make practice quizzes with a study group, look online for similar courses and use their materials. Use a white board to draw diagrams or mechanisms you have to memorize. \n\nTake good notes, read the textbook, study from your notes and from the textbook. Write down questions you have and ask in class or during office hours. Write down the answers in as much detail as you can.",

Like literally underwear popping out of his skinny jeans and his fat belly popping out of a very small, hipster collared shirt sleeve shirt . All the dude said was uhm the entire class period in a monotone voice. You better believe I\u2019m reporting that! I couldn\u2019t even go to class it was so aweful",
