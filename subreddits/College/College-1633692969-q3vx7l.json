  "text": "All the way back when the poloroid started, my HS Calc class got cut short. Then in fall of 2020 I did a semester at Penn State which was a complete waste of money. The vast majority of class time was on zoom and I can't learn that way, especially my calc 1 class. I barely passed. I didn't go back for the spring 2021 semester because I wasn't about to pay for classes that would be held on zoom again. \n\nNow that I'm in calc 2 I'm really struggling. There wasn't an in-person option because if conflicted with another class. I don't remember any of the basics of calc 1 and the Prof has a tone when they say \"these are the basics you should already know\" which has been a massive crush on my will to ask questions. It's hard enough to ask a question when we do 2 sections a lecture and move at mach 7. Not to mention I completely bombed the first exam (20%) and I have another one this Thursday. \"I made the first exam easy to boost your grades. It only gets harder from here\". I don't know if I can recover my grade and I'm concidering dropping the class and rethinking my career path. (Currently meteorology)",

      "text": "Lol I totally misinterpreted your title because I'm a grad level biostatistics student who is constantly bombarded with research related to covid that I have to sift through. Quite literally, I have to work on math problems related to the pandemic. \n\nBut yeah, with regards to your situation, know that many, many students are in the same situation as you. Please don't be afraid to ask questions. Yeah, you probably \"should\" know the info, but your professor hasn't been living under a rock and they should know that students have a reason to be struggling after last year. If your professor is annoyed that students are behind after last year, that's his problem, not yours.",

      "text": "If it were any other subject I\u2019d say you better drop it and start over with Calc 1 next year so you can actually learn it.  But math is special, which means you have another option\u2026\n\nWhat makes math special, you ask?  The fact that you can learn it from a book just as well (and usually MUCH better) than by listening to a lecturer.  Everything you learn in basic calc 1 & 2 was invented at least 300 years ago, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any current research that you\u2019ll miss out on by not going to lecture. Also, learning is not discussion-based like an English class would be. If you can solve the problems, that\u2019s all that matters.  So your other option is to keep at it, do your own reading, brush up on topics you didn\u2019t learn in Calc 1, and make sure to use your office hours when you get stuck on homework.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ll also mention that the Prof\u2019s remarks indicate that he might be treating it as a weed-out class.  \u201cYou should already know this\u201d and \u201cit\u2019ll only get harder from here\u201d sounds like intimidation tactics to me.  Which is why learning it straight from the book might not be a bad option.",
