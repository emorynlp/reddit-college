  "text": "I have been really struggling with social anxiety and homesickness. Today marks the 3rd month I've been here at college and I'm thinking about dropping out. I want to be an author but I don't know how to get there. I don't want to be a disappointment, I don't want to drop out but I am so tired of feeling anxious. To make matters worse, my dog had a seizure and there's a possibility he'll die. I don't know what I'm meant to do. I guess I'm looking for encouragement. Tips. Anything.",
