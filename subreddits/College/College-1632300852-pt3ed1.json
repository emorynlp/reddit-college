I nor my parents don't have much money to spare so obviously, I didn't go and decided to work over the summer. The downside is that I'm given the bottom of the barrel classes. which basically means all the shitty GEs and zero classes that count towards any major. What's even worse is that I was planning to switch into an engineering major but i probably won't even be able to graduate on time if i switch, since i'm behind everyone else in curriculum. Switching into engineering is a pain in the ass at my school and graduating on time is an even bigger pain in the ass. I wish college wouldn't kick us poor students even further into the ground, this whole freshman orientation situation is basically fucking extortion. Also, I have no clue wtf I was smoking when I applied as an environmental science major... I want to be able to find a job with a good salary after I graduate, not continue being poor with shitty jobs. i might as well drop out already and go to community college for a useful major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you're an environmental science major, don't take my words to seriously. I'm just venting my frustrations towards my school.
