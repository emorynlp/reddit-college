Of course if you are studying stem there might be more flexibility with grades with internships and grad schools. I would just say try your best while maintaining your balanced life and whatever you get be happy with. Then adapt your life to whatever you earned. If you can\u2019t get certain internships or you get denied for certain grad schools it\u2019s okay. There\u2019s more than one path in life.",

A 2:1 (2.85-3.49 GPA) means that you are at least a bit above average for most courses, and a 1st means you are very far above average in all of your courses.",

In college, around a C+/B- is average (at least for my university). Bottom line is: Bs will not sink you, and you can still be a very successful student and have Bs on your transcript.",

Not straight B\u2019s, but if you have mostly A\u2019s and a couple B\u2019s, then you\u2019re good. However, if you have an A, a couple B\u2019s and a couple C\u2019s, it may not look too good.",

They just didn\u2019t understand the material as much as an A student. Effort wasn\u2019t the issue. Everyone has different learning abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Some classes are harder than others I think I have earned a few bs here and there it\u2019s rare but it happened. It might not even be the topic but life was harder during that time and you had a hard time managing learning and whatever was happening in life. I had one term I was in a car accident and barely survived ended up disabled and I joined the next class right away, to stay in my cohort.  That was a huge event and had a huge impact on my daily life. I think it\u2019s forgivable if I got a B my first term back. I checked I got an A but the point still stands.",
