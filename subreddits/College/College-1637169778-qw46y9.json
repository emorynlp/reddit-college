  "text": "At the end of this semester, I\u2019ll be graduating from community college with a degree in liberal arts and sciences. To be honest, I don\u2019t know if college is my thing. I\u2019ve been in school for just shy of 3 years and still have no idea what to major in/ if I want to continue on in my education. I\u2019m not a bad student, but college makes me feel like I am because I lack motivation to do homework and study. \n\nBasically, I have no plan and no clue what I want to do. If anyone has any ideas/ experiences that may help me decide, I would love to hear them.",
