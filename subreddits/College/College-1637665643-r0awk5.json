  "text": "Bit of context. I'm from Australia and have been invited to join Prokick Australia (basically an academy that produces punters). They basically train us to become college punters and 92% of the men graduated from there have gotten a full ride. \n\nI am 22 about to turn 23 in Feb. So if I get a full ride, I will be 27 when my degree finishes. After that, I am planning on returning to Australia. My questions are this:\n\nCan students on full ride scholarships work and get an income? I don't know much about the college system just that student athletes don't get paid. Am I going to be 27 and have barely any money built in my account because of the inability to work during college? I do not want to be coming back to Australia with no money and a degree, I will have just put myself 4 years behind. \n\nWhat is in a full ride scholarship? I know that tuition, books, accommodation and food are all paid for, but are there other benefits? Where would I get money to go out for dinner, drinks, party etc etc.\n\nCan my girlfriend come and stay with me if I get a full ride scholarship? I would want to stay of campus, if that makes a difference. \n\nMy main fear is completing my four years, coming back to Australia with no money and a degree and starting from scratch at age 27.\n\nAny information would be amazing!",

Largely, the answers to these questions depend on how good you get and who you end up playing for, but I\u2019ll do my best. \n\nNo, there\u2019s no time to work. Your job is your sport and that is what you are receiving $50k a year in tuition, fees, room and board for. If your program is not top tier, you may be able to work during breaks. \n\nIf you are very good and highly recruited, there may be money available in stipend form to help cover additional expenses outside of room and board. It very much depends on the program and their budget and how good you are. \n\nAthletes in the Us are now permitted to earn money from use of their personal image. I don\u2019t know anyone who is currently making real money this way but I know plenty of people who are trying to be social media sports influencers now. \n\nAbout your girlfriend, it\u2019s possible. My program had me on campus two years and then I was allowed off with a stipend and could have lived with my boyfriend. The football program exerts a lot of control over their athletes lives though because young men tend to be self-sabotaging idiots so this depends on your coach and team policies. \n\nHow do you get money in Australia without a degree? In the US, having a degree is really the only way you get started. And you\u2019d have yours debt-free!!",
