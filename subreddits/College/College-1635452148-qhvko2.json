  "title:": "Why do isolated schools not allow freshmen to have cars?",
  "text": "I\u2019m at a private university which has recently put up 10, yes ten new buildings however hasn\u2019t added parking at all. As a result, freshmen cannot have cars here. I am a first semester freshman and don\u2019t understand how they can do This while offering a shuttle service that doesn\u2019t bring you anywhere except for off-campus campus owned housing. \n\nThe town it is located in has no sidewalks, and there are no stores within a mile and a half of campus. \n\nPublic transportation is patchy and sketchy here to say the least, and growing up in a major city I did not even factor in the things like this. While you can walk everywhere you need to on-campus, you are practically stranded. \n\nGoing to a restaurant off campus entails paying for Uber, Lyft, and there are 3 dining halls here, all of which are closed by 10pm. \n\nHow did others in this situation manage at schools that prohibited cars for freshmen students?",

      "text": "Your school doesn't prohibit cars. You are just saying they don't have good parking.\n\nI didn't experience the same but my gut reaction would be finding a private lot to pay to park or a friend with an apartment/house I could make a deal with. That's if I was living in the dorms. Outside of that I would just rent somewhere with better parking.\n\nI would just consider street parking too but that is more dependent on where the college is.",
