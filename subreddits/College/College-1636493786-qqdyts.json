  "text": "Hi! I'm in my first quarter (started Fall) in De Anza and I'm currently not doing well in one course. I took up exactly 12 credits this\u00a0semester and my professor is asking me to withdraw from his course worth 5 credits to avoid\u00a0a non-passing grade and I was wondering how this could affect my grant (Promise Grant). Which is the best option to go with, withdrawing or getting a non-passing grade?",
