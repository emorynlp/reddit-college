I\u2019m just wondering if I should take it during the summer or the semester if I don\u2019t technically need to. It would put me ahead a little.",

      "text": "One advantage of summer classes is there\u2019s often less going on. Most student groups aren\u2019t very active. There\u2019s no major sports going on unless your school is known for college baseball. \n\nI liked summer classes, yes there was a lot of work but having class every day or 4 days a week also helped me stay focused. You\u2019ll also probably need to do schoolwork on weekends. Your entire weekend won\u2019t be gone, but you probably will need to carve out some time on most weekends for school",
