My dad has cancer and he developed an opioid dependency because he's supposed to take them as needed, and he needed pin meds. He didn't take them today so he got withdraw.\n\nHe wasn't hungry for dinner. This is the first time in a long time he didn't gorge himself and devour multiple plates of food. He just had a few bites and left because he didn't feel well. It was honestly heartbreaking af and he's probably just going to get worse from here. He probably has a max of 3 more years and I don't want this to be his last \"decent\" Thanksgiving.",
