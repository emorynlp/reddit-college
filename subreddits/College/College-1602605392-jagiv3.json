Not long into the semester I started feeling trapped and claustrophobic from being in my apartment all the time so I started taking short 10 minutes walks around the apartment complex. It stops me from going stir crazy plus gets me some sun. \n\nI\u2019m guessing most people here, being engineers, already didn\u2019t get much sun. Now you don\u2019t even get sun from walking on campus. Vitamin D deficiency can make it hard to focus.",

Everything is an distraction, time seems to be moving in hyper speed, classes seem to be getting less interesting, and it is so difficult even remembering you have a lecture. \n\nAlso it's super awkward when no one is on camera and no one talks either, like the awkwardness penetrates deep into my soul. Thankfully, some kind soul talks and the teacher moves on and I can finally stop holding me breath lol.",

The only downside of that is that I can\u2019t ask questions like during the live lecture, but so far I\u2019ve managed with doing a little bit of research on google about the parts I don\u2019t understand or watching YouTube videos with explanations",

If I have questions, that\u2019s literally what google is for. \n\nIn-class lessons are a misery. I always tune out no matter how hard I try to stay focused.  I\u2019ll put my phone away to eliminate distractions only to end up in daydream land. Or drawing. \n\nRecorded lectures solve two crucial issues for me: 1) I can speed through the bits that aren\u2019t important or I already know and 2) I can repeat/slow down the important bits, or pause to take better notes. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I have ADD, but I find recorded lectures such a better method for learning.",

A friend of mine messaged me and was like how did you manage to fall asleep, to which I replied \"What are you talking about?\". After about 15 minutes she just sent me two videos of me snoring loudly while the teacher was trying to mute and thought I was joking around. At first I felt really bad about what happened as it was my first impression in front of the whole class and the teacher, then I just laughed it off. Wrote an email to teacher saying I was sorry and she replied something like \"No worries. It happens, I'll just make a few jokes about you in the next lecture.\".",

We have cohort A and B, for example I am A and my partner is B. We alternate going online and irl each Wednesday. The online person typically does the math and answers questions. The irl person takes measurements and does the experiments, facing a camera (the school provided) towards the experiment so the online person can watch.\n\nThe one class I am doing horrible in is Chemistry, fully lecture fully online. No homework or anything, only three tests. BS. Don't know any of my classmates, hate my teacher, don't know what's going on.",

I have found, however, on the weeks that I am online there is limited content. I either get stuck and have nobody to ask for help or I finish early and watch my partner take measurements for an hour. \n\nFor calc, I like the in person class. Online is a little hard. Primarily, I find myself missing information on Wednesdays class. I like to take notes on paper, especially for math classes, but when I have to get to chem lab 10 mins after calc and the chem building is 17 mins away from my dorm, I end up having to do calc outside so I don't have a desk to take notes on.\n\nAt my school the students sanitize the classroom. We have to grab a sanitizing wipe and wipe down the desk and chair before class starts, and again when class ends. \n\nMy first year seminar (quantum physics, so it's content heavy) has the issue that you have. There are some people who are in isolation still, and they are only attending online. I went to the online class one time because I didn't want to be IRL, and it was a struggle. I could hardly participate. The only solution we have is having zoom students submit any questions they have on canvas and the professor follows up later. \n\nWe don't have any face to face assignments. My school told the professors that they can't hand out paper or anything physical. They said we are paperless this year. Only online assignments for every class, which is pretty manageable (they are all on canvas, so it's easy to follow). I don't know how it is for professors, though :(",
