  "text": "So quick recap. Finished my computer science degree including senior final capstone a few years ago. But couldn't pass the math classes. I got into the job force so kinda didn't care at that point because I got the job. But now looking for online options that maybe can take one class here or there online better if there is a at my own pace option. Just wanted to get suggestions so I can check with the school to see about if they will transfer from the different places.",
