Cost~100k\n\nOption 2- Accounting major at a mid 100 business school. Cost~50k\n\nOption 3- General Business major at top 50 business school. Cost= free \n\nI know there are a lot of factors to consider but based on this alone I\u2019d like to get some opinions",

What sorts of supports do they have, like tutoring or academic clubs? Which area do you like? I picked the free option myself, but the other things all aligned with it too, so those confirmed I made the right choice.",

      "text": "General business at a top 50 b school. Free is a significant factor, but the big4 also don\u2019t give a crap whether your BS is in accounting or business admin. They will hire you regardless. I am from a school that awards BS in business admin degrees, with students able to concentrate in different areas. You don\u2019t need to be an accounting concentration to get a good B4 internship, because they literally don\u2019t care. The accounting concentration just helps you prepare for CPA and be more qualified for audit/tax. I\u2019m not an accounting concentration, I\u2019m business concentrating in analysis, and I have an internship lined up that pays $41 an hour/85k a year.\n\nPicking accounting at a T50 is not worth $100k over a business degree from a T50. However, the title \u201cT50\u201d doesn't just matter. What matters more is that big4 recruits from your school. Check out those student outcomes, see salaries, check most employed companies post-graduation, etc.",

Then, strike out option 3 and go for option 2, unless I feel like doing a master's in accounting after option 3 (but that means spending $, which means option 3 is less attractive)\n\nDo I want to do literally anything else?
