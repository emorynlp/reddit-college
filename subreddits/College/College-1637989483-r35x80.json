  "title:": "Is an iPad good for online college students?",
  "text": "First off, I have no clue why my posts keep getting removed on r/iPad for asking this question. It\u2019s not a tech support question. \n\nMy girlfriends laptop sucks, I\u2019ve tried fixing it and it\u2019s no good. It\u2019s slow and loud. So I\u2019m looking to replace it for Christmas. Either with a new laptop or an iPad. She will be going to ASU for online classes and I wanted to get her something simple and easy to use. An iPad would work great I feel like. Now, I myself am a blue collar slave so I\u2019m not sure how school is now, especially online classes. So I\u2019m wondering how well an iPad would work for school. \n\nNote taking sounds like a breeze, especially with the pencil. Which also works well with her passion for drawing. She will be going into business management for her major so I\u2019m unsure what programs she would have to use, if any. If she does need to use a program she will still have her laptop which sucks and my tower PC which doesn\u2019t. So it\u2019s not necessarily the end of the world as it is an inconvenience. But I\u2019m general, does anyone use an iPad for school? How do they like it? What are the pros and cons?",

However they all have laptops for the bulk of their assignments. iPad capabilities while increasing are still limited. I\u2019m not a business student so I\u2019m not sure about softwares needed. But as an engineering student I have thousands of apps I need to download per semester, so a computer is better in my case. There\u2019s really no way you can go wrong if you purchase it.

But for the most part, I\u2019ve tried everything. \n\nIt\u2019s not unusable, but it\u2019s annoying to use. If it makes her note taking easier, especially being online only classes which I assume means slides and notes are going to be prevalent to download, she can download them on her iPad and take notes directly on the slides with the Apple Pencil. I also know that PDFs and Word and things like that are available on the iPad as well. And being a business major, I doubt she would have millions of programs to download. I took a CS semester and my god I am still deleting shit off my tower. I might text my sister who did buisiness and see what she thinks",

I have classmates that have to borrow computers because their MacBooks can't do one specific thing. This has nothing to do with interoperability and everything to do with the fact that our professors are dinosaurs operating in 1997.",

I have a friend who uses just an ipad pro and got the keyboard accessory and he loves it (accounting major)\n\nAll in all, an ipad with the accessories (keyboard, apple pencil, case, screen protector) will probably cost you as much as a full laptop, unless you can get a sweet deal or buy it refurbished. So take this into consideration as well. Some computer programs depending upon the major aren\u2019t compatible with apple products. So drop a hint about getting it (if you can) to make sure it would work.",

It would probably be the best option for her if I were to get her an iPad. I\u2019m generally thinking about ease of use. She\u2019s not exactly tech savvy and has asked me several times to fix things on her laptop and now just her entire laptop needs fixing. \n\nI also feel the iPad would benefit her outside of school because she loves art and having that available would e super nice for her to express herself. \n\nI also dropped 10k on my PC so if she needs an actual computer for some of her work I\u2019d be more than happy to lend it to her. Her laptop also works, it\u2019s just hot and loud and honestly a real big inconvenience. I\u2019ve tried everything I can to fix it",

      "text": "Most of my classes require heavier programs as part of it, but it is *great* for note taking and organization. I can easily scroll through my notes, put them into folders, access syllabi/textbook pdfs/lecture slides, use scratch \"paper\". It is super convenient. It's also helped with my productivity once the sun sets, because I don't need an extra source of lighting to do my work and it's really portable. I have a laptop for any necessary writing, but many people get a keyboard, mouse and stand for their iPads. Not sure which one you're looking at but I have the iPad Air 4 and it's what I need. If she is very into drawing or may need some better/faster graphics, the iPad Pro is probably best. The people I know with Pro's turn it into an entire computer with the accessories, which makes sense once you see it's size. Pro's are huge! (for a tablet- which is good if it will be your main device).\n\nLittle side note, it's GREAT for math classes. The amount of messy work I have has gone way down with the ability to organize my notes by resizing and moving them around. All of my lecturers move super fast so I initially switched to iPad because it helped me keep up a lot more without worrying about readable notes. I also love how fast you can switch pen colors (it may seem small but I always color code sections of notes and it's impossible to do in a fast lecture.) \n\nIt's definitely a good alternative. I watched a ton of youtube reviews before getting mine and found the best price as well. I recommend doing that. Only con I can think of is the price of the iPad and the Apple Pencil + accessories, but those are one-time fees. Can you find cheaper? Yes. But the quality, convenience and accessibility of an iPad is worth the cost.\n\nedit: Looked at previous replies and it can definitely be a concern if she isn't tech savvy and wants things to be simple to use. I am very into tech but even I am taking a while to adjust to digital note-taking and work.",
