  "text": "I heard about this summer program allowing you to get college credit from Harvard in High school. To me, I think it'll be a great experience for me. You're able to get financial aid and I'm able to use scholarships too. Do you think this will be a great idea for me? I plan on doing Economics.",

It's usually cheaper, CC generally has passionate professors and students. And is a good alternative if you don't live close to Harvard",

My school never told me I could do AP and Dual Enrollment until 11th grade. From what I heard some people say it's not worth doing summer programs. The closest community college for dual enrollment doesn't offer my major.",

              "text": "It doesn't need to offer your major. You're basically looking to eliminate the Filler Classes a 4 year university would force you to take. So this would be like math classes leading up to and past Calc 1. Basic humanities courses. Basic chemistry and bio courses. Basic stats courses. And basic writing courses. \n\nMost universities force you to take a bunch of Gen Ed courses your Freshman, Sophomore, and sometimes even Junior year of college. So getting a lot of these credits done early can literally shave years off of your degree. \n\nEven if they don't off your Major, I am 100% sure they offer courses you'll be forced to take at whatever university you end up at.",

It's a brand new way of solving problems, you have to get accustomed to that and you have to be willing and ready to fail. \n\nOften failure is one of the best ways for us to grow. Don't hate Calculus, embrace the challenge! Watch videos online, research the types of problems you're struggling with, and do the practice problems you're given! \n\nYou don't get better at Mario Sunshine by staring at the pit in front of you. You take a leap of faith, die, and try again until you make it across the gap. \n\nSave your hate for the things that deserve it, Calculus is just a new skill you haven't mastered.",

I did an econ related course as well and it was a great experience and a lot of fun. Just don't expect that doing it will automatically mean you get into Harvard College or anything, and that your doing it for the right reasons (i.e. for fun / to learn).",
