  "text": "does anyone else dislike the college they attend, especially the location? I live in the southern region and was planning on transferring to a school in the northeast, but was not given much financial aid (even though I\u2019m from a low-income family), so I\u2019m stuck in my mundane hometown. many of my friends attend college out-of-state and I\u2019m happy for them because they love it, but I can\u2019t help feeling sad. I want to \u201cmake the most of it\u201d, but it\u2019s hard because I commute and live only 8 min away from campus and it\u2019s a religious school, so nightlife is very restricted. idk how to make the most of my time here ..",

      "text": "A major reason for my depression right now. I\u2019m in my first semester at my local CC in a town and state I loathe. I\u2019d give anything to transfer now, but that would be a dumb move because I\u2019m able to attend for free. I\u2019m planning on transferring out of state once I graduate, but it\u2019s still difficult. \n\nA good reminder to tell yourself is that you\u2019re in it to leave in the long run. Your friends who attended out-of-state schools are going to be stuck at home for a few years due to little money and a huge amount of debt. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll be in a better position financially that will allow you to move wherever you please.",
