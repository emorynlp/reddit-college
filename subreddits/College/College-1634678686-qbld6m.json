      "text": "Well a C- is still considered a passing grade most places, and that\u2019s just 70% (the scores you listed average to around 72). Also, lots of hard stem classes have problem sets or labs that are like 30% of your grade, so as long as you do better on those than your exams you can pull up your average a little. Finally, some courses get curved at the end.",

      "text": "Some of it is the grade distribution for each class, but in my experience, each test was usually 10-15% and the final was another 20%. There are also occasional curves, the hardest course in Chem Eng, I got curved to an A (93) from like an 86 in the class. I had one other class where I got curved from a B+ to an A-, but that was a matter of 1 or 2% was all. Mostly it's a combination of C's get degrees mentality, and squeaky wheel gets the grease. Don't get me wrong, it was a lot of work and parts were hard, but it was manageable as long as you were diligent you could at least get Bs.",

      "text": "A lot of the times theres final grade curves at the end of the class. So as long as you do close to the mean on the tests (usually around 70ish for those harder classes) your final grade ends up around the 80 range, or at the very least around the C necessary to pass.\n\nMy thermo class had a really aggressive curve since peoples scores were so bad overall.",
