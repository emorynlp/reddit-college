  "text": "Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. Posting from a throwaway on the off chance my roommates use reddit. \n\nSo I (F19) recently began attending a four year university and moved in on campus. I was supposed to have an accommodation and be placed with one person, but something fell through on their end and I got placed with two girls who are dating. \n\nAt first it was little things like not cleaning up hair in the shower. That was annoying but I dealt with it because hey, we\u2019re all girls and we all shed hair like crazy. But then it slowly spiraled into bigger sources of frustration for me: packing the trash can so full of garbage that it overflows, not rinsing the dishes before putting them in the sink so then everything hardens on and is impossible to wash (and they never do dishes so it\u2019s usually me who gets stuck with it). I\u2019ve also every single month so far that I\u2019ve been here had to ask them to PLEASE not leave their period blood on the toilet seat, and it continues to happen each time. Also inviting people over for multiple nights at a time without consulting me first. \n\nI might just stick it out, but I\u2019m considering trying to switch suites next semester. The problem is, I brought most of the stuff we use in the suite because they told me they couldn\u2019t afford anything so now I\u2019m worried if I leave that it will cause an issue. My anxiety has worsened since I\u2019ve gotten here because of their habits, and I feel like I\u2019m not asking for too much here. But I don\u2019t want to cause drama or grief. I wanted an outside opinion here, on what to maybe say if I decided to leave the suite or advice on what I could do should I end up trying to just deal with it. Thanks in advance",

      "text": "First things first. Did you base \"Long time lurker, first time poster\" from a line a comedian once said? I heard something similar from a comedian \"Long time\\_\\_\\_\\_, first time\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\", I cant remember exactly what he said tho.\n\nAnyways. I take it you have sat down and spoken with them and set some rules. If you leave the suite id just take everything that you payed for, its technically your stuff and should go with you since you payed for it or brought it with you. Especially if or because they are not treating you well or are not doing the simple things you may of asked them to do like take the trash out more often or maybe do their own dishes and such.\n\nIf you stay really try to set boundaries and talk to them both at the same time one night if you have not already. If they keep it up maybe get the RA involved if you live in a suite in a dorm building.",

          "text": "Haha no I actually didn\u2019t get it from anything, just something I\u2019ve seen other people say on here.\n\nAnyway yes I\u2019ve set boundaries and we had to sign a roommate contract that discussed what we could and couldn\u2019t do in the dorm. This was within three days of move in. It\u2019s just so frustrating because I feel like I\u2019m not asking a lot, but I\u2019ve had to ask them so many times to stop doing these things. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not, but at this point it simply feels like disrespect. I\u2019m also kinda tired of coming out of my room to find them in their thongs. \n\nOn the one hand I\u2019m like \u201chm, is it worth the hassle\u201d but on the other I feel like I\u2019m gonna go nuts. I really don\u2019t want to have to move but if anyone is going to leave it\u2019ll probably end up having to be me which sucks",

              "text": "I do not think you are asking to much for people to do simple tasks like maybe doing their own dishes or take the trash out more often. If you feel disrespected by them or are getting tired of their crap after talking to them multiple times you could bring this up with an RA or try to switch rooms. Honestly I would leave if my roommate or roommates are not respecting me or are just not making my experience good or are just overall messy and careless. If you think you would have a better experience in a different room its probably best to switch and go through the hassle.",

Id probably tell them you know around the time im moving out. If you are interacting with them well beside these issues you could tell them that you are thinking about it. Hopefully that wont make things worse, it shouldn't but idk how good your relationship is with them.",
