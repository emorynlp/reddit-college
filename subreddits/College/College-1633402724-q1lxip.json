  "text": "No one talks about the part where you have people but you\u2019re also so lonely. Also coming off from quarantine where I was confined with my cats and mom everyday, this is just a part I didn\u2019t think about. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love where I am, I just didn\u2019t stop to think that this was a part of the process. When you don\u2019t have anyone you can truly be yourself around- it\u2019s hard. I also feel like I have to learn who I am all over again now that I\u2019m in an entirely new location with strangers all around me",

      "text": "This is part of college early on, and it is tough. My advice would be to try to find about 2-3 groups of people to spend time with and focus on creating shared experiences. Go to campus activities, play board games, watch sporting events, whatever you like doing. As you share experiences, you'll grow closer to people and get less lonely. It does take time, but it's worth it.",

There is so much anxiety and stress with school then having to worry about life after school and finding a job. Add to that being in a strange place with strange people. It's just really tough. Hang in there and as other posters have said go to campus activities, join groups (there should be groups for sports to video games to book clubs.) It will get better, stay positive and you will have friends around you before you know it.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in the same boat. I commute, and I spend everyday basically silent for hours at a time in class and I don\u2019t really socialize with anyone else because it\u2019s not simple to go out and make friends. We all had the chance to fall into groups and whatnot in high school because we all got put into a melting pot with the same people for 14 years. You got to fully understand everyone around you and almost scout out good friends that fit you. In college, that experience is completely not there. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult, but I try to just think about how there\u2019s a lot of value in silence too. We don\u2019t have to have a lot of friends to feel validated. Try your best to succeed in classes and people will notice your wit. I think it\u2019s a good way to garner respect that can open some friendships. Even if not, it opens doors for you to spend time with other scholarly individuals like yourself in the context of honors programs or internships. \n\nHope things work out",
