  "text": "I\u2019m currently a dual enrolled senior in high school working to graduate w an associates. this year will be my second year of college. my community college has both 8-week and 16-week classes offered. i\u2019m scheduled to take 19 credit hours in the spring, however most of the classes are only 8-weeks, leaving me w taking 5 classes in the first 8, and 3 in the second 8. two of the classes in the first 8 are labs that are worth 2 credit hours which is why it\u2019s so much. bc i\u2019m still in high school and still live w my mom, i\u2019m in a position where i can work less hours at my job if needed without too much consequence, and i don\u2019t have much of a social life that i would be sacrificing. 19 is the max amount of hours one can take in a semester, and i guess i\u2019m just looking for reassurance that it\u2019s possible given the circumstances. i\u2019m also very interested in the content of the courses i\u2019ll be taking, and it\u2019s much easier for me to stay motivated to do work for 8 weeks straight as opposed to 16 weeks. some of the courses are also taught by professors i had this semester, who i was able to form good relationships w, which im hoping will help if i hit a rough patch.",

          "text": "to be fair, i\u2019m taking 16 currently. i took 5 the first 8, and these next 8 i\u2019ll be taking three. the only different that makes the spring semester more credits is the fact that this semester i have 2 16-week classes, where as next semester i\u2019ll only have 1. i also have no classes at the high school that\u2019ll add to any extra work. I\u2019ve been handling this semester and the set up really well, and the quarter scheduling helps me a lot to handle more of a workload",
