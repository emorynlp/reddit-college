I was pretty excited going in and I\u2019m still pretty stoked to be here. Course there have been hard times, but that isn\u2019t my focus.\n\nIt\u2019s all in your mind, man. You are lucky, you are special, you are blessed. Find out how to realize that.\n\nMaybe try some psychedelic drugs. Not casually, but look into it because they have some serious potential for curing/treating depression. \n\nI had a lot of social anxiety up until a few months ago. I still have a bit, but holy cow it\u2019s like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. DMT taught me how to handle it. It has taught me a lot more, too. Let me rephrase that- DMT allowed me to teach myself what I needed to learn. \n\nIt\u2019s all your perspective. See, if you need to go to school to get a job to grind a 9-5 and then die, of course you will be depressed, that\u2019s an incredibly depressive outlook. If instead you have an opportunity to gain knowledge and wisdom, surround yourself with like-minded people, learn how to make friends and talk to people and have conversations and just generally be more social, while doing things you love like biking, snowboarding, rock climbing- and you\u2019re actually here doing it, it isn\u2019t some sort of fantasy, and it\u2019s going to lead you to a wealthy future... well hot damn, you are probably one of the top 10% luckiest people on the planet right now. Perspective is everything.\n\nIf you\u2019re miserable in college, why tf are you doing it? Life isn\u2019t about being happy in 20 years, life is about enjoying the eternal moment we exist in. That moment has no past or future, it is only, always, now. There will never be a point where you will be fulfilled and satisfied completely. You will die worn and incomplete. Accept this, and move on. Not telling you to quit college, telling you to seriously question why you\u2019re here. Because you want money? Well why do you want money? To be secure and comfortable? Why do you want that? Just keep questioning until you know that you are where you should be.\n\nI might get some flack for this- but fuck hope. Hope is one of the emptiest feelings, it is less than worthless. Quit hoping that you\u2019ll get better and make it happen. If you keep hoping, you\u2019re subscribing to the notion that things will just fix themselves by some stroke of luck. Do you really want to rely on luck? you don\u2019t need to squander hope, but definitely don\u2019t rely on it. \n\nAccept the fact that you will be depressed until you change that. Nobody else can do it for you. I\u2019m not telling you to go find a therapist or medicate to try to fix yourself, I am telling you to accept yourself as you are. Think of it like an addiction. You can hope that eventually it will go away, but it won\u2019t until you change things yourself. Much like addiction, emotions are cyclic. If you\u2019re feeling negative, it is a lot easier for you to perceive things negatively, which will lead to more negative feelings. Compound your happiness and love, not your depression.\n\nQuit struggling. Stop the resistance. You are rhythmic, use that to your advantage. We are creatures of routine, create positive routines for yourself that emphasize self-compassion and cessation of struggle. Do things that make you feel good, and then you will want to do more things that make you feel good. Start somewhere small and easy, work your way up. \n\nYou are not a human trying. You are not a human doing. You are a human BEING. Just be. The rest, will fall into place. \n\nI recognize this monster of a comment is very abstract, so in case you didn\u2019t gain much I\u2019ll give you a few jumping off points that will allow you to form your life however the fuck you want it to be formed. Seriously, you do have that power, you have only yet to realize it. The only issue here is that your toolbox is vastly limited. If all you have is a hammer, everything is a nail. Good luck building a house like that. \n\n- Learn how to meditate. Download the Headspace app and try a 5 minute session. You don\u2019t need to meditate all the time, you just need to know how to do it, and how it affects you. This will put another tool in your toolbox, in case you want to use it.\n\n- Research psychedelic drugs and their effect on depression. This is one of (if not) the most powerful tools known to man kind, it\u2019s kept like a secret because government is literally terrified of humans having this much power. I\u2019m not joking. For a college student, DMT is probably best as the trip doesn\u2019t last more than an hour. But, it\u2019s also the most intense so starting elsewhere is generally advised.\n\n- Look up actualized.org and watch his video about mastering emotions, as well as the one titled \u201cwhat is god? A no bullshit explanation for smart people\u201d. Yeah it might take four hours to watch these both, but what is four hours to the rest of your life? Don\u2019t be greedy with your time, you have plenty of it. Don\u2019t worry about wasting it, all time is wasted in the grand scheme of things. \n\nIf you have any questions, message me or comment. Regardless of my faults, you can learn a lot from me. I\u2019m very expressive, and I\u2019ve put a lot of thought into existence. I feel that I\u2019ve all but mastered this stage of my life; I can help you do the same. It isn\u2019t about relentless self-improvement or cultish productivity, it is about something that can never be put into words. Regardless of what anybody thinks about me after this post, my life is filled with love and joy- not only for me either, I share it with those who engage with me.
