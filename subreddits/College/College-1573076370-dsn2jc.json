  "title:": "Professor being unprofessional like talking about my exam grade in class?",
  "text": "My class only counts 3 out of 4 exams so I bombed the first one. Now when I'm taking the second exam, the professor literally asks me if I know what I got on the previous rhetorically, and then tells me that he doesn't want to have to fail me. I mean, this was within earshot of people sitting around me so that's not embarassing at all...\n\nLater, when I ask him a question on the exam, he says \"im gonna shoot myself...\" and then explains it, which i kinda took that as \"youre so stupid i wanna kms.\" And as Im walking back to my seat, he pretty much yelled across the room how I couldnt possibly know that and actually fucking asks me when Im graduating. Like oh, how could be you graduating this may and be so fucking stupid???\n\nI feel really embarassed/hurt and angry, is this something worth emailing the a higher up about or should I just suck it up.",

If it makes you want to study harder, it's probably worth casting it aside.",

If that method proves to be unfruitful,  then go to the higher ups.

In my opinion you should get in touch with the Deans of Students and submit a formal complaint. My experience was that I submitted a complaint to the Dean and about two weeks later he was fired, I don\u2019t know if that was the reason, I know he was fired...\n\nGood Luck!",

This was too the extent of only being able to give grades out in person or on blackboard this also included not leaving students A# (Our ID system) out for others to see because you can access another student confidential information from it. It is possible that my school err on the side of too sensitive but it is also possible that this is a violation as FERPA itself is highly sensitive and ID numbers might even be considered protected information if they are generated by the school.",

                  "text": "Be careful with the attitude. \"snapping back\" can get you kicked out of a class or program. Also remember that professors are who have to recommend you for grad school and often jobs. \"snapping back\" will label you as a trouble maker. If you have an issue in the classroom, start with a talk with the department 's chairperson. If you don' t get anywhere, go to the dean. Don't \"snap back\". You may think it makes you seem cool or something but it's stupid to risk your reputation.",

I go back at her (jokingly) when she makes bitchy remarks to us, but it\u2019s clear she does not like me at this point which is kind of whatever because I\u2019m still at CC and she will have literally no impact on my life in 1 month, but I\u2019ve made this class a bitch for myself at the same time unfortunately. basically just avoid unnecessary conflict, the people around you likely realize the prof is a dick too so just leave it alone unless it escalates.",
