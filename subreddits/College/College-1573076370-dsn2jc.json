Now when I'm taking the second exam, the professor literally asks me if I know what I got on the previous rhetorically, and then tells me that he doesn't want to have to fail me. I mean, this was within earshot of people sitting around me so that's not embarassing at all...\n\nLater, when I ask him a question on the exam, he says \"im gonna shoot myself...\" and then explains it, which i kinda took that as \"youre so stupid i wanna kms.\" And as Im walking back to my seat, he pretty much yelled across the room how I couldnt possibly know that and actually fucking asks me when Im graduating. Like oh, how could be you graduating this may and be so fucking stupid???\n\nI feel really embarassed/hurt and angry, is this something worth emailing the a higher up about or should I just suck it up.", "author": "MartianJesus", "created": 1573076370, "retrieved": 1632802773, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 600, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f6vh1bs": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dsn2jc/professor_being_unprofessional_like_talking_about/f6vh1bs/", "text": "Email definitely- this person shouldn\u2019t be entrusted to teach the next generation!", "author": null, "created": 1573185996, "upvotes": 1}, "f6uv7t8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dsn2jc/professor_being_unprofessional_like_talking_about/f6uv7t8/", "text": "This is why you go to rate my Professor before making your schedule.", "author": "Abyz963", "created": 1573169518, "upvotes": 1}, "f6td75r": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dsn2jc/professor_being_unprofessional_like_talking_about/f6td75r/", "text": "Sounds like a jerk. \n\nHow you respond is up to you.
