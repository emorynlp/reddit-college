  "text": "Hey there, I\u2019m not exactly from America but I live here now with my partner in Oregon.\nWe both make minimum wage and realistically cannot pay for college let alone, have him not work and go to school while we struggle to pay rent.\nWe both don\u2019t really have parents/ money or anything most people have as a gateway into financial aid since it\u2019s hard to even apply and qualify unless you are on the border of poverty in this state.\n\nI worry from what most have told us that going to college will only cripple our finances with overwhelming debt and the worry of jobs with this overpriced degree will be even less easier to obtain after the fact. Since job scarcity has been a factor.\n\nIf anything it sickens me to see that prices for schooling has only inflated this year..\nIt seems like the options are either live paycheck to paycheck on minimum wage or be thrown with crippling debt for your future with the possibility of a higher paying job.\n\nMost advice I\u2019ve been given is just save money, but that alone would take years if you acknowledge rent and day to day living.",

      "text": "Well, multiple things. Assuming you guys are legally independent, that should put you in low income brackets that would allow for government based aids/fafsa. Other than that, save whatever cash you have left without using up your emergency fund. If you can qualify for any scholarships, apply to those as well.\n\nAlso, after all of this, make sure you\u2019re not overspending. Go to a college you can afford, and don\u2019t stretch your finances too thin to go to \u2018that\u2019 school. As someone that graduated in a high in demand degree (comp sci) at a top 20 US school, what honestly matters more than anything is your work ethic, not the school you go to. You\u2019re probably thinking \u2018easy for you to say\u2019, but honestly, a smart student at a less smart school will do far more than the other way around. I know plenty of people from no name schools get good jobs. I also had 70k in debt after I left college, but was fortunate enough to get a job that allowed me to pay it off in a year. If anything, go to a cheap community college for 2 years, get that GPA up, and transfer out. It\u2019ll save you tons of money. \n\nLast but not least, go to college knowing what you want. When finances are tight, I would strongly urge against going to college when you have \u2018no idea\u2019 what you want to do. It\u2019ll save time and money. Also, as much as following a passion is strong, you want to go to college not only to find something you enjoy, but because you want to set yourself up for potentially a better life and income. I.e. Don\u2019t spend 100k going college only to major in gender studies and expect a good job. Research high paying fields that would align with your passions! Nonetheless best of luck, you got this!",

It\u2019s also worth looking to see if a community college would be cheaper for two years and then transferring! keep looking though, there may be local programs to help pay! and student loans may be a good option if it\u2019s available to you, but do be careful, they can make things worse once payments start.",

      "text": "It depends where you go to school, and for what.\n\nCollege is not the only way to improve your financial situation; there are skilled trades, for example, and people with a strong sales personality can do well in sales. In fact, it's only in recent decades that college has been seen as some kind of vocational training; for most of history, it was about inculcating a common culture that helps you debate ideas with other members of the elite.\n\nThat said, I think a college degree is a worthy goal, and there are ways to go about it that are affordable.\n\n* One of the most common paths is through military service. If you serve for three years in the U.S. military and are honorably discharged, the government will pay your educational expenses plus a stipend for room and board through the GI Bill. On the officer track there is the ROTC, which pays for your education, and you are commissioned as an officer after graduation and typically do four years of service after school. Of course, it's been argued that if you have military experience, you can often get a decent job without completing additional school, depending on how ambitious you are.\n* Depending on your income and savings, you probably qualify for financial aid from the federal or state government or from the institution itself. The calculation for this includes not only tuition, but living expenses like food and rent. Some of this will be grants, some will be loans, and some will be in other programs like work-study (where the government subsidizes your wages, to make it easier to get a campus job).\n* Most federal loans can be repaid under an \"income-based repayment\" plan, so your loan payments are based on your income. You can also discharge federal loans after making steady payments on them [if you work for the government or a nonprofit](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service).\n* In many states, community college credit is accepted for transfer to a state university, so if you can attend community college for a couple of years (which tends to be cheaper and to have more evening/weekend classes for working people), you can save a lot.\n* Ironically, many wealthy schools have \"need-blind\" admissions; being wealthy schools, they make up for shortfalls in government aid through private scholarships or other financial aid. My school does not offer any athletic or music or other merit scholarships, but they will work to give you direct grants and loans, so attending a $75,000/year school comes out to be cheaper than attending a $20,000/year school.\n* There is lots of money in private scholarships that you can apply for. This is a lot of work, as usually the scholarship is only $1000 here and $1000 there. But there are millions and millions of dollars that go unclaimed every year.",

If you're worried about debt, do your research and pick a good major and you won't have to worry about finding a job or paying back your loans. \n\nA lot of what makes college scary is that most people do not do their research as to what majors are worth it and what steps they need to take in order to secure jobs before graduation.",
