  "text": "So I am in the cybersecurity field and I was told at the beginning of the semester not to underage drink because government agencies will not hire you for internships or jobs if you underage drink. I guess I feel like I am missing out of the college experience and I don't know if not underage drinking is worth the possibility of not getting a job in a government agency. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for all your help!",

At the end of the day I think there are very few people who go their entire underage experience without a drink here or there. Just making sure that you don\u2019t post about it anywhere will keep you safe from stuff like that!",

In my opinion, I personally would not move on with a job if they were that interested in such topics that don\u2019t have any effect on you or your job performance. It would be fine if they were just asking about it, but if you getting the job really boils down to if you were an underage drinker or not, then that is very odd to me. But if that\u2019s the job that you have been working really hard for, I understand how that would be really scary! Although a lot of college parties that I\u2019ve been too haven\u2019t been all that anyways so if it helps, you aren\u2019t missing out on a lot! Finding a close group of friends has helped me stray away from the party life.",

They don't care so much about drinking or drug use itself, and in recent years especially have really relaxed the rules around drug use, so even illegal drug use doesn't necessarily disqualify you. I mean if you are a heroin addict that's another story, but drinking now and then is not likely to be a problem (even if it's underage). But don't get black-out drunk regularly and do things you might regret that end up on Instagram.",
