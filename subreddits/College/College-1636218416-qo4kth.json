  "text": "\nWhat would you suggest, and what you\u2019ve been able to accomplish aside uni academics/grades.\n\nContext:\nI\u2019m in engineering. Currently considering ECE or CS as I would like to work on both hardware and software. I\u2019d love CS but sad about the prospect of only working in software as I\u2019d like to build and invent with it. And ECE (Computer Engineering specialty) at some schools  doesn\u2019t seem like it incorporates enoughw CS for me. (I\u2019m also interested in Machine Learning) \n\nAnd the entrepreneurial aspect is to be more well-rounded and to be able to gain something for if I ever do invent something and create my own company. \n\nReally the hardware part for me is the ability to program onto the hardware to make it work. What would this be described as? Embedded systems? Robotics? Mechatronics?\n\nWhat should I study? I\u2019m thinking of these combinations:\n\nCS Major + Engineering Design minor\n\nECE (computer engineering) + CS minor (if possible)\n\nOr just ECE with Comp Electives + Engineering Design/ Business minors cuz it\u2019s possible to learn a lot of the CS alone.\n\nOr what would you suggest?\n\nThank you !!",

      "text": "That's interesting, at least at my school computer engineering majors take a good amount of \"pure\" computer science classes - operating systems, compilers, data structures, etc. and they can take a lot of computer science electives. Seems like that would be the best option for you, just research the curriculum for different schools before you apply.",
