  "text": "I\u2019m 26 and on disability due to a kidney transplant. I\u2019m wanting to go to the local university for Bachelors in Business Admin with a emphasis on Accounting while I can without the stress of balancing a job and the stress of school, However looking at Careers in the field for after I graduate, those careers being district manager, Credit Analyst, Risk management, it seems they require a Bachelors with 2-5 years experience as well. If I graduate I\u2019d be about 30-31yrs old and then I\u2019d have to work an additional 4-5years, so I\u2019d be 34-36yrs old before even being able to get the job I went to school for. So I was thinking is it better if someone my age works while going for the experience and just suck up the stress, or should I focus on school for now then work?",
