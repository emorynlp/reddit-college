  "text": "Like the title states, I just can\u2019t motivate myself to do anything. Prep for big projects, do homework, anything. If it wasn\u2019t for baseball, I would\u2019ve been gone by now, but I have to perform in school to be eligible to play. Just feels like I\u2019ve lost myself and don\u2019t care to do anything here. Would much rather do anything else but school. I despise school and don\u2019t know what to approach from here.",

I hope that you start feeling better with everything soon as feeling like this truly sucks. \ud83e\udec2",

      "text": "Could be depression, could be burnout, or could be too much a of workload(too many classes or units).\n\nWere you like this before, like did you feel this same way in previous semesters? I would go see a doctor if thats the case. If not then maybe you really are just disinterested in school as of now.\n\nI would definitely go see a doctor first to see if theres anything wrong mentally or depression and whatnot. Idk, its hard for me to say anything else besides that, really sorry",
