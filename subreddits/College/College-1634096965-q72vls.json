  "text": "Like the title states, I just can\u2019t motivate myself to do anything. Prep for big projects, do homework, anything. If it wasn\u2019t for baseball, I would\u2019ve been gone by now, but I have to perform in school to be eligible to play. Just feels like I\u2019ve lost myself and don\u2019t care to do anything here. Would much rather do anything else but school. I despise school and don\u2019t know what to approach from here.",

I hope that you start feeling better with everything soon as feeling like this truly sucks. \ud83e\udec2",

I would go see a doctor if thats the case. If not then maybe you really are just disinterested in school as of now.\n\nI would definitely go see a doctor first to see if theres anything wrong mentally or depression and whatnot. Idk, its hard for me to say anything else besides that, really sorry",

If you dont care about graduating in 4 years take a break or lower the amount of credits but if you want to graduate in 4 years then I would puah through it somehow because its no fun playing catch up and having to take max credits .",

      "text": "Take it from a PhD student, don't wait for motivation. If you can't get motivated, set yourself a timer. 40 minutes intense work. It doesn't matter if you're sleepy, tired, bored, etc. Turn off your phone and do the work regardless of motivation. (Apps such as Forest and Toggl can be beneficial)\n\nThere can be lots of reasons for a lack of motivation and these are worth exploring, too. But, it's important to learn how to work even when there's little motivation pushing you.",

      "text": "What i did when i got in this position was make time during your day, lets say 5pm for example and have a corner of your room or an area on your desk dedicated to reminding yourself of your short term goals and long term goals to justify the short ones and basically just reminders to how far you have come and or how much you've accomplished before to motivate you and spend like an hour there maybe writing down your thoughts or more short term goals or appointments or something. Then maybe some sort of relaxing hobby afterwards like single player non stressful video games or a good book to get lost in for a while or even some small wood working with hand tools (worked for me).",
