  "text": "Currently rocking a XPS 13 9310 but need something to complement it in terms of notetaking for subjects such as math and physics (and hopefully for M.D courses further on). What are your experiences? \n\nMy budget is 650 USD tops and I\u00b4ll be happy as long as I manage to secure an IPad and an apple pencil (V.1 is totally fine).",

      "text": "im gonna sound like a shill, but getting an ipad for notetaking changed everything for me. i can't imagine going back to pen and paper.\n\nbeing able to search for specific words/titles in your notes quickly (godsend for open book tests); copy/pasting & resizing in the blink of an eye instead of fumbling around with an eraser; the ease of drawing neat, colorful graphs/diagrams; no more dealing with 20 notebooks; the pros are endless.\n\ni have a 2017 pro. the size is a little unwieldy if you're using it for entertainment, but I got one for dirt cheap for the sole purpose of taking notes, and it's the best size for that imo. i feel like it's not a great idea to go down to screen sizes smaller than a normal sheet of paper, but to each their own.\n\napp i use is Goodnotes btw",

Not sure I should've dropped all my \"fun\" money on it, but I've been enjoying it a ton so far.",
