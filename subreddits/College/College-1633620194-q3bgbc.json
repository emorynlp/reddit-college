      "text": "I think your plan is correct.  If you were the one who posted the test answers, then unfortunately you (and the person who posted the test questions in an attempt to get free answers) are guilty of academic misconduct.\n\nGo to the Zoom meeting, calmly listen to what your professor has to say, and then admit your wrongdoing in a direct and straightforward way.  Don't provide any excuses or try to weasel your way out of things; that just makes faculty angry in cases like this when the evidence of guilt is obvious.  Depending on your university's policies, the professor might be obligated to report this up the chain for further discipline, or he might be able to use his own judgement to give you a lesser penalty, there's no way to know before the meeting.\n\nSo, you made a mistake.  The only thing to do now is accept the consequences and move forward resolved to put this issue behind you by not making the same bad choice again.\n\nGood luck.",

It really depends *how bad* it is, so he might be lenient because it was just two questions (and you plan on straight up taking full responsibility), but it\u2019s really up to the Prof and how they usually go about these things.\n\nI don\u2019t see this going much higher than an F on the exam, but if it does, failing the course is entirely possible. I\u2019m not saying it will happen, just to prepare for that possibility.",
