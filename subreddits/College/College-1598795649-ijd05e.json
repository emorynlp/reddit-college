I truthfully don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m here anymore. I started college way back in 2014, and it has been nothing but a battle since. Through the last 6 years, it has been a constant struggle financially and family problems have been abundant. I have had constant swings of anxiety and depression, and I\u2019ve neared a full mental breakdown on several occasions at this point. Withdrawals, failures, and college major changes have happened in near cycles at this point, and I don\u2019t have any motivation left in me to even open up a textbook at all anymore. I feel I can barely even look at a course syllabus anymore. I am presently a dual statistics and economics major, and even through all this time, I still have 2 years left just to finish undergrad. That\u2019s with attending full time. \n\nLast winter, I partnered with a good friend of mine who went on to do his own thing in life and became a developer with IBM. We are now developing 4 different platforms, and we are less than 5 months away from a marketable MVP on our primary platform. In January, I plan to begin traveling all over to take our mission to stage 2. \n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m in college anymore. I believe I\u2019ve found what I want to do after all of this struggle, and I don\u2019t know anymore if my desire to finish college is just because I was told I needed it all my life or if I truly want that piece of paper. I\u2019m 30k in debt with nothing to show for it, and I\u2019ve reached the point where I believe I want to just say f*** it and go all in on my business endeavors.\n\n*edit: I\u2019ll be replying to people throughout the day. Thank you to everyone talking with me on this.*\n\n*edit 2: I didn\u2019t expect this post to actually blow up like it has.

Some people are convinced that the one right way is: Graduate high school, immediately start a college degree, take as many credits as you can to get out \"on time\", then graduate and land a job in your major (OR sign up for a grad degree).  \n\nThis actually ISN'T the only path to adulthood and it's not the best one for everyone, not by a long stretch.  Yet to do something else seems so *unthinkable* to people in that mindset.  There might be little attention paid to the people who do other things, but they are out there! \n\nIf you're not feeling it, it's fine to stop.

When the time is right.  That day may never come which is also okay.\n\nMy advice is to leave your instutition on good terms.  I don't mean you have to go to some tribunal to argue why you're departing.  Just make sure you are aware of your campus' policies for disenrolling or taking a leave of absence, make sure your student account doesn't have outstanding fees or fines, and let your advisor know if you have a relationship with them--same with any professors you are close to, if any.  If you want to return at some point (to this school, or a different one), you don't want to have some weird thing holding up your transcript.  And you might have need of your contacts sometime, if you need a reference or something.", "author": "FeatofClay", "created": 1598900941, "upvotes": 1}, "g3gkq4q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ijd05e/considering_dropping_out_of_college_want_to_hear/g3gkq4q/", "text": "I've felt the exact same way. I'm sorry to hear that your experience is not ideal. I'm 27 and I should be graduating in 2021, and I have been in college since 2015. I am a marketing major with a technical writing minor. I've felt the same way as you, and I've been back and forth a lot on what to do. I even nailed an awesome career which I loved, then hated, and went back to school full time.\n\nHere's a thought pathway that you can go through (you may not find it all relevant, but thanks for reading):\n\nIt gets harder as you get closer to the end of school, that is to be expected. I noticed that you didn't mention anything about why you were taking a dual major, but obviously the first thing I would do before dropping out of both is consider dropping one of your majors. It is important to look at your career pathway and ask yourself why you are getting the education for it. Do you need all the classes you are taking? Can you go without any? Look through your entire career pathway and check on how many unnecessary burdens you are choosing to carry.\n\nNow there's the question of finances which is difficult to answer. I told myself I wouldn't go a single dollar in debt for college, and I haven't. I have done payment plans and worked while I was in school because I wasn't willing to go into debt. I'm sure you have looked at scholarships and financial aid from the government. If you have been in school for 6 years then I would assume that you are at least 24 years old. At 24 years old you are considered financially independent from your parents and by 25 years old you should be clear on your financial Independence and qualify for government aid. You may still be living at home with your parents (which is fine). At my school, they have a non-traditional student center. A non-traditional student is a student that is married, single parent, or over the age of 24. Nearly 85% of my tuition is paid by a single scholarship from the non-traditional student center. Make sure you check that out.\n\nI would consider part-time college next. Can a single major give you a close enough graduation time that it would be worth it?\n\nAnother question to ask yourself, did you select a college that is too expensive?\n\nLastly, as I presume you are younger and you have a lot of life left in you. You can get by without college, but life hits you hard if you don't have an education. Look at what you want to do in life and look at what the bare minimum is that you need to go and do it. Can you get a certificate for anything that you have studied? Is that enough to start working anywhere? If it certificate isn't enough look at a technical program somewhere. If the technical programs aren't enough to get you on your career path then look at a minor or associates that you could probably take in college now. Companies are starting to offer education programs to give you equivalent experience and knowledge required to work in their company. Google is starting a program like this right now, have you checked those out? There's probably something with similar to your prior experience already in this program. The big benefit is that it basically has a direct track into a career.\n\nI hope you find these comments helpful, I know I may have repeated others, but I actually haven't read any other comments yet. Good luck on your journey, and keep us updated.\n\nEdit: I've seen that a lot of people have urged you to simply drop out. This simple option has negatives, just as staying in college has negatives. I would say that you should consider the minimum viable options first. What is the least you can possibly do to make the last 6 years worth it? Try to at least take a token of value from the experience. Take your associate's degree, finish a certification, find a bachelor's you could finish in less than a year. The world as we know it is changing, and having no college is becoming acceptable, that doesn't mean you don't salvage what you can. I reckon you could take an associate degree right now, or you'd have it in one semester. Why wouldn't you take it? Should you ever return to school later, that degree will be a great benefit to you. I've known millionaires who pursued board positions at companies only to find out they were not considered over someone else because they did not have a degree. People could say, \"that's not fair!\" Oh, that's just the world, buddy. Just because we don't agree with a degree doesn't mean that our success is not hinged on it by degrees. It can keep your doors open. Now if all the above seems like too much, then finally consider dropping out. Operating a successful business is no easier than finishing college. Both tracks have a lot of challenges, and that hasn't stopped you, yet.", "author": "tryonpantss", "created": 1598878302, "upvotes": 1}, "g3f5bhc": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ijd05e/considering_dropping_out_of_college_want_to_hear/g3f5bhc/", "text": "Do it! \nAt minimum take a break for a year or two.

Education is not NEEDED to make money if you are doing your own thing. If you plan on working for others than by all means get a education on paper because you will need it. College is just going to get worse and worse I started back in 2018 and it has been absolute hell this year. Professors are expecting us to perform like terminators when we are in the middle of a pandemic. Education funding has went down like crazy, I mean for God sakes the first two weeks this semester the only thing most of my professors talked about was their home life. The cost of textbooks is going up, and professors are trying to capitalize on students. For example my professors expects us to do a Geology lab worksheet at home when we need to be in a lab to actually do it, it's stupid as fuck.", "author": null, "created": 1598805982, "upvotes": 3}, "g3dcz72": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ijd05e/considering_dropping_out_of_college_want_to_hear/g3dcz72/", "text": "One thing I\u2019d like to say, is to not shy away from the fact that you discontinued your studies, if that\u2019s what you ultimately do.

In a lot of ways, yes, degrees are massive gate keepers, but when you talk to people that are in careers, you\u2019ll learn how much of it is just being able to effectively network yourself and apply your skills.

I\u2019m also not particularly wise, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt.\n\nThat being said, it REALLY sounds like you do want to drop out of college. If that\u2019s the case, you should do it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019ll kick yourself down the road is things don\u2019t pan out, but I prefer possible regret for what could have been rather than certain regret of what currently is. \n\nIf you are really unsure, and I don\u2019t mean just worried, I mean truly lost on what to do, you can always make a pro and con list. Yeah, it feels kind of dumb to make a really simple list as a way to help make a big decision, but it does work.\n\n\nIn either case, in my subjective opinion, knowing almost nothing about you and your situation, I think you should drop out. You only get one life, you need to enjoy it. If you don\u2019t enjoy it now, look for something else. If you still don\u2019t enjoy it then, keep looking. Don\u2019t stop until you\u2019re happy. Don\u2019t settle for anything else. No matter how long your road is, there\u2019s always an end.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s important to look towards your future and try to get yourself to a point where you can be proud of where you find yourself. However, it\u2019s equally important, if not more so, to build yourself up into a person you can be proud of. \n\nI know it must be scary to try to follow the path less traveled. It\u2019s hard and confusing and dangerous and can easily lead to failure. Failure is scary. But it\u2019s not like your life is over after you fail. It\u2019s just different, and that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n\nI guess the question to me is: would you be more proud of yourself suffering though college or trying to do something different, something you\u2019re passionate about.\n\n\nLet me frame this one more way. Let\u2019s say whatever you do after you leave college fails. Where does that leave you? Maybe you\u2019re poorer, maybe you\u2019re somewhere different, and you are definitely unhappy. \n\nYou\u2019re unhappy now. Everything else you lose is meaningless. What we own is only important in how to impacts our personally happiness. At the end of the day, you\u2019ve lost nothing. Nothing important at least. You\u2019ve ended up back at square one. \n\nSo where\u2019s the risk? Are you worried that if you drop out you\u2019ll miss out on what could\u2019ve been? If you want to think like that, play the lottery instead. No one has time to lament about other realities. There\u2019s one, this one. There are no \u201cwhat if\u201ds, there are no alternate futures, and there is no correct path. So where\u2019s the risk?\n\n\nI guess I should summarize: I don\u2019t really know you or your situation, but I trust that you can make the decision yourself, you\u2019re just worried. That\u2019s normal. However, just from the information given, I (a random college student) believe that you should drop out. You\u2019re unhappy. There\u2019s only one path to happiness; change. So follow it. You may find yourself unhappy again, but change again. Keep going and evolving until you find the end. You may worry of future regrets, but regrets are all lies. No matter which decision to make, there is and always been only one option; yours. That\u2019s it. There is no better reality we missed. Your life is predetermined by yourself.\n\nGood luck.
