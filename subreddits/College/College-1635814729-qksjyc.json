  "text": "I\u2019m in a biomedical engineering program that is really tough for me. I did amazing as a freshmen which in hindsight was to be expected but my gpa now at best is just average. I\u2019m just trying to pass my classes. I don\u2019t live on campus and commute whenever I do go to classes and work full time and have been since my sophomore second semester. Couldn\u2019t work the first bc I wasn\u2019t allowed. Not to mention I come from a very strict household and so I\u2019ve been plagued with personal issues prior to college but in college as well. I feel a little behind than my peers bc of this as they are able to regularly go to class, socialize, and make groups to study for exams whereas I don\u2019t have that ability. I\u2019m stuck figuring most of the things out by myself which further limits me. They\u2019re able to help each other out on assignments and other things whereas im alone and only have the internet to help me. I\u2019ve been getting a lot of anxiety about this as im in the bottom quarter of my class and I feel as if im not going to be able to find a job after college bc of this as im planning on going into industry. To be fair im not a genius it takes me a long time to figure things out but I feel like I would be in a different place if I were able to do the above. I also don\u2019t know about most people\u2019s lives but I don\u2019t think any of them are working to support themselves but idk I just feel behind",
