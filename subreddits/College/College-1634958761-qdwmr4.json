  "title:": "Do I have to major in psychology for undergrad if I want to become a psychologist? What are some alternative majors?",
  "text": "I'm getting ready to transfer with AA in psychology to a UC or CSU pretty soon. I'm thinking of alternative majors that I switch to or double major in once I get into a university. I'm actually in between getting a Ph.D. in neuroscience or neuropsychology. Either way, I'm interested in pursuing a scientific career focusing on the brain and cognition. I'm trying to figure a degree I can utilize to get some income and also get me into grad school :/. Does anyone have the same issue or can offer some ideas?",

      "text": "In many cases you don't. However, there are often requirements along the lines of intro psych, psychological statistics and specific courses on the brain, lifespan, etc. I'd look into the program's websites and speak to their admission team. Although professors admit you in graduate school, the admissions team can tell you exactly what you would need if you can't find it on the website. Remember programs are competitive, try to get into some sort of research early on! I'm not super familiar with it, but I've heard of people who majored in neuroscience getting into the neuroscience areas of pscyhology and sociology majors getting PhDs as well. I also came from a community college and hope to get into grad school.",
