      "text": "For what it's worth, many students get into top schools but choose to go to lower tier schools, so they're not necessarily \"rejects.\" There are a number of benefits that can come from attending choosing certain \"lower tier\" schools over Ivies, so you shouldn't be so sure that the honors students at your school were rejected.\n\nGenerally speaking, *way* more students are qualified for Ivies than are accepted, so pretty much every school is going to have a set of \"cream of the crop\" students who would be totally capable of hacking it at an Ivy tier school. Anecdotally, as someone who has been a top student at a mid-tier school, I think it set me up for more opportunities than if I went to a top school because being a top student means you get more opportunities. If I were at an Ivy, I'd be an \"average\" student among my peers and wouldn't have been able to stand out enough to get the limited amount of opportunities that exist for students.\n\nLastly, not all competitive students join the honors program. Honors programs often make you do extra worth for practically nothing in return. At some schools it's tied to scholarship money in which case it's worth it, but at others you work your ass off for what is the equivalent of a \"gold sticker\" on your transcript. Nice to have, sure, but no one cares.",
