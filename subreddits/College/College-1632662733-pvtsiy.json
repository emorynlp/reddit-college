I started back the semester after.\n\nI'm now in my second semester after her birth and it's... Rough.  I got used to online classes where I could learn at my own pace, but online classes and my degree don't mesh very well haha (lotta lab classes).  I don't have time except for when I'm on campus to fully focus on school work, which on Mondays and Fridays is great (last class on those days end at 11:50 and I have until 3:20 to work on stuff) but other days like Tuesday I'll have ~2 hours maximum to work on stuff.\n\nThe only thing holding me back from stopping pre-cal 2 rn is money.  Thankfully though if I fail I can retake it either at the cc I used to go to *or* try again here.\n\nBut the time we all get home, it's time for dinner, a bath, and nighttime routine.  I could *theoretically* stay up longer but I barely can function with the sleep I have now lol.\n\nI think a lot of it has to do with the support you get from others in your life and having daycare available.", "author": "BenignRaccoon", "created": 1632936142, "upvotes": 1}, "hef126n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvtsiy/does_anyone_ever_get_pregnant_in_college_and/hef126n/", "text": "Eh I got pregnant towards the end of my associates degree. I got pregnant mid-fall semester finished it but had really bad morning sickness and would have to leave class frequently to be sick. I could barely drive. The Spring semester was better, I was very pregnant. I finished that semester in May and had my baby in June. I needed one more class (4 credit) for the associate's so I went back in the fall while baby was very little. \n\nI took a year and a half off. I returned in the summer right before my baby turned 2. I am now almost a senior and she is 2. It's doable but very hard if you have a young child.\n\nWould like to add that going back full time, involved having to enroll my daughter in daycare. I take her to and from school each day and do all my classes while she is there. I pick her up and spend several hours on our dinner/nighttime routine and once she is asleep, I do homework, chores, shower ect.
