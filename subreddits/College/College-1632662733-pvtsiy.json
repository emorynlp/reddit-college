I got pregnant mid-fall semester finished it but had really bad morning sickness and would have to leave class frequently to be sick. I could barely drive. The Spring semester was better, I was very pregnant. I finished that semester in May and had my baby in June. I needed one more class (4 credit) for the associate's so I went back in the fall while baby was very little. \n\nI took a year and a half off. I returned in the summer right before my baby turned 2. I am now almost a senior and she is 2. It's doable but very hard if you have a young child.\n\nWould like to add that going back full time, involved having to enroll my daughter in daycare. I take her to and from school each day and do all my classes while she is there. I pick her up and spend several hours on our dinner/nighttime routine and once she is asleep, I do homework, chores, shower ect. Her dad takes her for most of the weekends too.", "author": "Victorian_Era2", "created": 1632703996, "upvotes": 1}, "hecogpw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvtsiy/does_anyone_ever_get_pregnant_in_college_and/hecogpw/", "text": "I have had students get pregnant while in college. \n\nLike anything else related to student success it is a mixed bag.\n\nSome life experiences change your mind about where you want to go and why (or when).  \n\nSome people who are borderline functioning or just keeping it together can't handle the added issues.\n\nSome thrive .\n\n\nIt also depends on the pregnancy and the health of the baby and mother after.", "author": "TheRightSideOfDumb", "created": 1632667629, "upvotes": 3}, "hecjmim": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvtsiy/does_anyone_ever_get_pregnant_in_college_and/hecjmim/", "text": "I know someone who did this.
