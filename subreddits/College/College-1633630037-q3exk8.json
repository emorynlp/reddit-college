  "title:": "Planning on going to community college, first time going to school since graduating HS in 2017. Is my transcript okay or should I retake the placement test?",
  "text": "I didn\u2019t have the best GPA in high school, I just didn\u2019t take a lot of classes as seriously as I should have unless I enjoyed the work we were doing. I never took the SAT or ACT, but I know I placed pretty well on the placement test I took back in high school. However, I would now need to retake that as it\u2019s been too long. Is it a hassle to do all of that or should I just get my transcript? How much does it really matter when determining classes i\u2019ll be placed in? I think my GPA was around 2.6 or so by the end of school. Any help is so greatly appreciated, thanks",
