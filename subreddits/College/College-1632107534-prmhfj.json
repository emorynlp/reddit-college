  "text": "Well tonight was my deadline for final papers. I can save 1 class. But it's too late for the others. Between evacuation from the wildfires, and then myself and my kids getting covid, and i started a new job. All within 5 weeks, I'm exhausted. And sad, and stressed af. I think i need to apply for a hardship or something, any suggestions? I'm looking for validation or something. Have any of you had to just let go of school for a bit and just accepted an \"F\" because well, you're just sick of all of it?",

Should i just ask for an incomplete? I start a training seminar tomorrow and i won't have time to do finals. One week to fix this and I don't think I have the motivation to force myself to even try.",

              "text": "You can ask the professors directly, but your probable best first step is to speak to the Dean of Students about advocating for the incompletes you may need (this is a different office from the academic dean of the particular college). Then, they can help reach out to professors to validate your situation and indicate that you\u2019ll be reaching out to them if you haven\u2019t already. The sooner you do this, the better.\n\nThe department chair and/or academic dean most likely won\u2019t get involved as this is an issue between you and your professors. You can try escalating if one or more won\u2019t work with you, but it\u2019s ultimately up to each professor as to how it\u2019s handled for each course.\n\nSo, to recap, contact the office of the Dean of Students immediately to discuss your situation and attempt to get formal advocacy from them. Then, you will be better situated to work things out with each professor.\n\nGood luck!",
