  "text": "Hello! I (19F) am looking for options on what to do my undergraduate major here in Spain. I am currently attending a public university and ran into the problem that a prerequisite for the major I am studying (edificaci\u00f3n aka architectural engineering) was to have graduated with a technical high school diploma. This made my first semester extremely difficult for me seeing I am from America and own a science and letters high school diploma. \n\nApparently there are other prerequisites for other majors like physical therapy or medicine (health science HS diploma), and I am running out of options on what I should study.\n\nI feel like barbie at the moment, i like lots of stuff, but the things i like the most have barriers for me to study. \n\nWhat majors fit best my diploma and what jobs can I work in those areas?",
