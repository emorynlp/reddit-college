  "text": "So I\u2019ve fucked up (procrastinated) and I have a midterm tomorrow for proctorio. Professor has a practice quiz, I decide to do it jsut to see what the program is like since I\u2019ve never used it. \n\nMicrophone not detected\n\nOkay that\u2019s fine I\u2019ll try to fix it. Nothing works. My MacBook Air is from 2015 and it\u2019s Bluetooth is already broken but the microphone Does work on it, but proctorio does not recognize it I guess? I tried ear buds with those shitty little mics in them and no dice. Took a chance and tried my Xbox headset (Xbox brand too) and it didn\u2019t work.\n\nObviously I\u2019m a bit screwed on timing as the exam is at 1pm pacific time on Monday. I guess I\u2019m just going to have to buy a microphone but ?? Which kind ?? I\u2019m trying to spend as little money as possible, could I just get another shitty headset with a mic? Something [like this?](https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/desktops-laptops/pc-headsets/products/gabbagoods-aux-computer-headset-with-microphone/11152349.html)\n\nReally feeling like a successful third year college student rn lmao. Thanks for any help",
