  "text": "I feel like I\u2019m losing motivation at college. I\u2019m currently a junior and I just am not motivated to read books/study material/learn. I just would rather hop on social media or maybe sleep. I really don\u2019t find most of my classes interesting. I should be more excited to study because I won a full ride & will have no student debt. I\u2019m also having trouble with sleep because my roommates like to stay up super late when I have early classes in the mornings. Any strategies to overcome this? Do you think I\u2019m depressed?",

      "text": "Find a passion and stay committed to doing it every day no matter what other commitments you have (parties, exams, family, friends etc.) Whether it be a morning run, meditation, a side hustle to earn some money, art, music, training, whatever. You are possibly in a funk where you feel like you\u2019re stuck in an endless routine like a hamster spinning on a wheel. Block everybody and everything out during that time of the day you give to yourself and what you like to do. Screw the tests, stress and commitments, life can wait.",
