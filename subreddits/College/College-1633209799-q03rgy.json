  "text": "For some reason, I can\u2019t create FSD for my parent. Whenever I hit the create account button, it gives \u201cunknown error\u201d and says my parent\u2019s SDN is associated with the account. But my parent never created FSD. When I try it again, it then gives bland \u201cunknown error\u201d. I searched for username with my parent\u2019s SDN but it\u2019s no use. There\u2019s no account associated with my parent\u2019s SDN. I tried resetting cookies and closed the browser and everything. Still doesn\u2019t work.\n\nCan anyone tell me TF I should do to create FSD for my parent?",
