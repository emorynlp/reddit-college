  "text": "One of my friends is a transfer student from another school and is technically a sophomore taking both freshman and sophomore level classes. Our major randomly announced last week that they want to add a requirement that you have a minor along with your major. This won\u2019t affect me as I\u2019m about to graduate, but doesn\u2019t this seem wrong?",

      "text": "That will depend whether your institution does catalog rights* (I think most do), and then how those apply. For example it might matter whether she had officially declared the major, or was just intending to complete it.\n\n* Typically colleges only hold you to the requirements in the catalog (of degree requirements) that was current when you enrolled and/or when you declared the major or were accepted into a particular program. Things are changed for incoming students all the time, but aren't applied to existing students because obviously that can make graduation impossible. There are also cases that need to be decided on an individual basis, such as if you have catalog rights to complete the degree with a course that is no longer offered.",

          "text": "That\u2019s what I thought. She\u2019s declared her major. And I know the school follows that cause it\u2019s stopped them from changing things in the past. The major is only like 5 years old so they are constantly coming up with new requirements. But they at least wait to make those changes with the new freshman. I just can\u2019t see them actually following through with this.",
