  "text": "During my last test the professor told the class to put their cameras on, but some didn't, while some claimed their computer don't have a camera.\n\nThe professor then said (it was either Zoom or Blackboard) can tell him if your computer has a camera.\n\nI'm majoring in Information Technology so I can't really underestimate his ability with this stuff, though I'm curious if it's true.\n\nAny ideas?",
