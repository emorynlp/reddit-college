  "text": "I\u2019m currently deciding on a schedule for my Spring semester and am looking for some opinions. I\u2019ve got it narrowed down to two schedules. The first is a M,W,F schedule with 15 credits and mostly general studies courses. The 2nd schedule is a T, Th schedule with 12 credits and has mostly major related courses. I can only really have 12 because I just can\u2019t find a course that fits nicely. The 2nd schedule also consists of 2 courses that have only 1 session in the the spring. It looks as though I would have to wait a full year to have the options for these two again. I also have a vast majority of gen studies done from dual credit and this Spring be my 2nd semester in college and will have 58ish credits.\n\nSo my question is which would you choose? I was thinking of doing my 2nd option as the gen studies classes will be easier to get into with more availability but I wouldn\u2019t be able to drop a course if something happens as I have 12 credits.\nAny insight is much appreciated.",
