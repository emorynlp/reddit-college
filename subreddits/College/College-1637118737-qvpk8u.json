  "text": "So while tipsy and trying to find new cocktails to try I stumbled upon this article [https://www.buzzfeed.com/clegbuzz/pick-your-fall-aesthetic-and-weall-give-you-a-co-e8v2ttzica](https://www.buzzfeed.com/clegbuzz/pick-your-fall-aesthetic-and-weall-give-you-a-co-e8v2ttzica) Yes I know its a buzzfeed article but I found an actually good recipe, pomegranate rum sangria. Granted I don't have pomegranate in my apartment so I substituted with oranges instead, came out PERFECT. So if you're bored and wanna try new cocktails I just wanted to share this article for a quick and easy way to find a new drink.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s73dsl5xo2081.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f535dba46e6353f470a93ca8c840422b367e3045",
