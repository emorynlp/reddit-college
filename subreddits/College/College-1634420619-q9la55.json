  "text": "Hello!\n\nI'm starting the process for my third paper of the semester (College Writing course). This paper will be our research paper and we'll need 4 scholarly sources and 1 \"other\" source. \n\nI don't have any practice in academic research and my topic is legalization of marijuana. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not asking for you to find sources for me, but rather what helped you when doing this type of research and preparation for this kind of paper. \n\nTIA!",
