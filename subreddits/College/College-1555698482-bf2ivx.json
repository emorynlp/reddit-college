But this subreddit is so much more information-filled than any other that could apply to my learning situation.\n\nThe complete name of my subjects is \"Mediadesign/Technology of Design\" as well as \"Design of/with color/Interior Design/Material Design\" as a combinatory Bachelor of Arts. My Master's degree is going to be \"Master of Education\" for design-specific schools.\n\n(This might need clarification: Here in Germany, we have to become licensed professionals in a ton of jobs like media designers, nurses, office workers,... and because of that, for the first three to five years, beginners in jobs have to train their craft: simplyfied, they stay about three or four days a week at the workplace and one or two days per week at school. At the workplace, they get the hands-on training. At school, they get training in a broad range of subjects corresponding for their chosen line of work. Such, a media designer in a print company will be trained in designing for web/apps/... at school. Plus: obligatory theoretical knowledge like history of the craft and how businesses/companies work. This is all going to be stuff I am going to teach future painters, designers, woodworkers, IT-people,... :) )\n\nOh, and yeah, the combination is amazing =D! It spans everything from Architecture, historical book printing, over basic job-related stuff like painting, modern-day printing and designing everything from brochures to apps, films and animations, learning how to restorate paint and gilding objects up to looking into the future of education with virtual and augmented reality (this is what I focus on during my Master's degree).",

I\u2019ve had professors who would make it so there is 100 total points in the class, so each assignment would be worth very little \u201cpoints\u201d but when added up they worked out to be like 25-30 points total, or 25%-30% of the total grade. So while it may seem like each assignment isn\u2019t worth the work you put in, your professor may intentionally make them worth a small amount of points to make grading easier on themselves in the end.",

      "text": "I had a professor for a 2 credit class assign 20+ hours a week of homework and each amounted to like 5% of our grade, not insignificant, but compared to the work load just insane. When I came to talk to him about how outrageous his work load was he told me that apparently my midwestern college isn't cut out for the workload his Ivy League school provided and told me that it wasn't his fault I was lazy. This was a grad school class and I had taken the exact same class at my undergraduate school and gotten an A because the homework was challenging but clear and certainly didn't take 20 hours, so I knew the problem wasn't me.\n\nHe told me he bet he could do the assignment in the span of 40 minutes and that'd show the entire class and that if he could do it in 40 minutes we couldn't possibly be taking more than 3 hours to complete it. In an hour 30 minute class he completed step 1 of 5 and he only completed it by skipping over some sub steps that he said were easy, yet when we quizzed him on it he couldn't explain how they were done.\n\nWe complained to the faculty because on top of this he couldn't teach to save his life because I honestly think he had no prior knowledge of the subject. He was just a really good schmoozer and talked his way into the job.\n\nAfter I complained I noticed that my grades dropped significantly in the course and I was being downgraded for absolutely insane things like I showed too much work or he didn't like how I labeled things despite being industry standard. I ended up with a C- in the class which was the absolute lowest grade you could get and still move on. I protested my grade to the administration and they reviewed my homework and changed my grade to a B+.\n\nThey ended up not rehiring the professor for the next semester. He told everyone that he hated the midwest and was moving back to a coast where his talents were recognized. He said he got a job at a really well known firm in New York and even posted a photo on social media in front of the office saying it was his first day. He never worked there, I don't know if it fell through or if he just lied but 6 months later he was back in our city, trying to get work but he also couldn't seem to pass his exams to actually be licensed in the field.\n\nThe university ended up rehiring him as a professor despite wide knowledge this guy is incompetent, spiteful, and not even proficient in the field. I wish it ended as some prorevenge story where I saved my school from a terrible professor, but its more like a I can hold my head high knowing that I can get a job in my field and get licensed and all this guy has is demanding people take him seriously because he schmoozed his way into an ivy league school once and is now an adjunct professor at a school he despises kind of story.",
