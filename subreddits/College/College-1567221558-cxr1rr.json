The first weekend after I moved in and started college I went back home and cried to my parents that I hadn\u2019t met anyone I truly connected with and felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. I spent most of my first semester in my room alone, hardly ever going out, and not talking to anyone. Being a first-semester freshman is a lonely, lonely thing. Don\u2019t let everyone around you fool you\u2014though it may look like they\u2019re having the time of their lives and they\u2019ve found their crew, I guarantee that the vast majority of their friend groups will fall apart by sophomore/junior year. Inside, they feel just as lost and lonely as you do; they\u2019re probably just more extroverted, so they\u2019re better at socializing and thus at hiding it. \n\nHere\u2019s a reassuring fact, though: you WILL meet people, no matter how hopeless it feels now. As your first year goes by, you\u2019ll meet people in your classes, you\u2019ll encounter people on campus. Every freshman is in the same boat as you, more or less. College is a new experience for them, too!\n\nI know this is overstated advice, but JOIN CLUBS. And force yourself to go to their meetings, no matter how scary it is at first. My freshman year, I decided to join Ultimate Frisbee despite having no athletic abilities and zero social skills. I almost didn\u2019t go to the first meetup, but I forced myself out of my dorm and onto that field. And guess what? I met my first group of friends through there. I\u2019m still in touch with some of them today, even though they weren\u2019t the people who ended up being my crowd. But joining that club and meeting the people there gave me the confidence to go out and join other clubs and meet more people and be more social. \n\nYou can do this. I know how tough this first semester is. But don\u2019t despair. Force yourself to go to on campus events.

It's a completely different environment and students have very different lives from high school students in the span of just a few months. So the hard truth many times is that you won't make friends for a while if at all in school (maybe outside you might) and if you do, at some point in the near future (around graduation time) your friend circle will dwindle to next to nil because people have \"adult\" lives with their own priorities that don't include hanging out or having fun with someone that isn't worth their time, since they don't have as much of it to spare anymore, so it becomes more valuable and you have to be more selective about how you spend it.\n\nPoint is, it's not like on TV or even how \"everyone\" around you seems to be.. it took me until my sophomore year of college to make friends, and they never last longer than a semester usually (once the course ends we just move on with our lives), and that's honestly pretty normal.\n\nAlso pretty much most adults go through this stage at some point in their late teens or  20s of feeling alone and like they don't have friends because many of us are used to the kind of social life children have (since we are all children before we become adults). Becoming an adult is also going through the realization that we aren't kids anymore, that includes how many friends we have, and what kind of friendships we have as well. High schoolers are in the mindset they aren't children, when they might be at the last stage of childhood sure, but they're still children and that's why socializing is still laid out for them just by going to school, routines are set *for* them instead of making their own schedules.. so many things are done for them that they have much more time to even have friends. College changes that simple routine that's made and done for you, moves you to a new place with new people and almost no pre-set structure, and you're now in charge of setting up your life as practice for after you graduate and there is NO ONE to tell you what to do.\n\nIt is liberating, but also stressful in its own way, as you're finding out right now with social anxiety as a start.\n\nWelcome to the next stage of life :)\nI swear it's better than it seems right now, you'll see!", "author": "yoursleepyfriend", "created": 1567234567, "upvotes": 20}, "eyn712r": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cxr1rr/its_been_over_two_weeks_and_i_still_dont_know/eyn712r/", "text": "Feel free to pm me.

With high school there\u2019s always the social hierarchy, popularity, etc. and everyone, in some ways, feels like they have to put on a mask. In college, that largely goes away. As people grow and mature, they start to care less about the actions of others, and therefore become more tolerant. Trust me, no one is judging you for sitting alone in the dining hall because there are so many other people who sit in the dining hall alone throughout the day. Some people like to sit alone, others don\u2019t but they don\u2019t have anyone to sit with, but in college, no one is pointing at you and laughing for sitting alone. They\u2019re absorbed in their own life, so they\u2019re more accepting of others. I know some people, especially other freshmen, try to keep the high school hierarchy and stuff alive even in college, but honestly? Fuck em. That\u2019s such a small number of the people you\u2019ll encounter it\u2019s not even worth thinking about. Also, people will be more friendly in general in college. To many people, it\u2019s no big deal at all if you go up to them, introduce yourself, and ask to join them. They\u2019d be happy to let you join them. If they aren\u2019t, you just got unlucky that one time. Try another table. That\u2019s how friendships are made & strengthened. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s important to remember that two weeks isn\u2019t that long in the grand scheme of things. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s first two weeks of college predicted the next four years.\nYou\u2019ve got this. We\u2019ve all got this.

I'm really sorry bc I def felt that way a lot throughout my school experience (I skipped a grade & lost all my friends.  Then moved 3 hours South a year later.  Then had to switch high schools bc of bullying.) I played soccer then ran cross country in college, and despite being on a team,  I didn't feel like I connected with anyone either.  Tbh, what helped me a lot was video games,  reading and writing.  I also ended up working for my school's international dept & tutored 2nd language students then also went to French club meetings (foreign language elective I took). I ended up finding a nice little group of people from my classes that way.  One good way is to try to find people in your classes that are obviously interested in doing well,  then study together and work together.  You make friends and it helps the grades. Go to your teacher's offices and speak w them too. They're usually awesome and sometimes want to just have a chat too. I also joined a small gaming team that competed online.  It was awesome. I get the desire to wanna party and be social,  but it's not the only way to meet people.  Be smart and safe with partying if you do. There's a lot of people willing to take advantage of nice people & you sound like a genuine person.
