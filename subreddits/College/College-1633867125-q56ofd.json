      "text": "I'm a Yank, but I do three readings, separated by hours or days, on every text or paper assigned. The first is a deep reading of the introduction and conclusion. The second is a browse through the topic sentences in every paragraph. The third is reading the material cover to cover. I take notes in Word, with the assignment rubric pasted to the top of the page, during each one of these phases. It has served me well.\n\nAlso, be prepared to write your ass off.",
