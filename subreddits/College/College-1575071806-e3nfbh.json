  "text": "Math has always been my weak spot and I've been avoiding Calculus because I know my foundations are weak- but this semester I took it since its required for my major. \n\nI got a 57 on my first test, a 75 on my second test, and today I got my exam grade back for my third test and I got an 83! I'm so stinking happy, like I know an 83 isn't super high or anything I feel really proud of myself rn. Hopefully I can do well on the final, thE LAST STRETCH before break!\n\nAlso gl on finals everyone",
