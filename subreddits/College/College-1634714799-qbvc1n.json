  "text": "Maybe I am overthinking but why would my friend wants me to shift in another course? Does she want me to leave for selfish reasons?   \n\n\nI'm in BS Forensic Science, which may not be a common premed, so I always expressed my desire to shift in Nursing or Premed Physics, but it seems my friend wants me to shift more than I wanted to. She will always asked when will I shift, and that I'm wasting my time in this course. I said to her I will shift once I lose my dean lister status, but she insist that is not a good basis and said that I should shift as soon as possible.  \nThis topic always pop in our conversation out of nowhere. Is she pushing me or just concerned?",
