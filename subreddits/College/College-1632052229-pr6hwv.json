I don't like being in crowded areas, I also like spending my time efficiently. It's really exhausting to cook my own food, clean my house, walk my dogs, work out and on top of that go to school daily. Online education is such a time saver plus I don't like socializing all that much anyway. I have a few close friends and that's more than enough for me. My school is doing a hybrid system this semester. Some courses will be online and some on campus. I'm genuinely considering only taking online courses. Wearing masks during lectures sounds like a pain in the ass. I'd rather join via Zoom.

There's something about being in a classroom environment that helps me to focus and learn more efficiently. Also I am a huge hands on learner and its very difficult to do that while doing online learning. I just can't focus while at my own house, I think if I had to go back to online school, I'd have to bring my laptop to the library or something.
