  "title:": "Online vs On-Campus Education",
  "text": "Is it bad that I prefer online education over on-campus ed? I don't like being in crowded areas, I also like spending my time efficiently. It's really exhausting to cook my own food, clean my house, walk my dogs, work out and on top of that go to school daily. Online education is such a time saver plus I don't like socializing all that much anyway. I have a few close friends and that's more than enough for me. My school is doing a hybrid system this semester. Some courses will be online and some on campus. I'm genuinely considering only taking online courses. Wearing masks during lectures sounds like a pain in the ass. I'd rather join via Zoom. What do you think?",

I never ended up making friends through classes, but I think it was good to be in those environments. I also got quite bored when I started doing online classes at the beginning of covid. Now I graduated and have a fully online job and would kill to be in a damn office and not alone all the time lol",

Also I am a huge hands on learner and its very difficult to do that while doing online learning. I just can't focus while at my own house, I think if I had to go back to online school, I'd have to bring my laptop to the library or something. But I'm very glad you prefer it, it's awesome that your life can be made easier because of it!",
