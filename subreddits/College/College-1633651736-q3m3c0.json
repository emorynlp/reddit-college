  "title:": "Freshman this is a message on behalf of the other Of all upper classroom please for the love of Academia",
  "text": "Please understand you will not be getting a formal invitation to most parties just take a deep breath. Look on Snapchat Facebook or Instagram for the open invite to whatever's going on that night on that night and just go. If it's a big house party just pay the cover if there is one at the door it usually like 5 bucks most girls get in free in some places particularly frat parties. And just go have fun\n\nPlease stop asking but what if I'm not invited to parties. No one gets a formal invite to parties unless you know the guy who is throwing it directly like they are 1 of your best friends and then it usually attacks saying Hey come help me set up tables at up tables we're having a party tonight in which case you go because they're supplying any beverages or refreshments available if you are doing manual labor.\n\nSo just chill it's college no one gets a formal invitation unless it's a kickback rather than a house party.\n\nSo freshman Just breathe find a house party that's opening That's open invite online or whatever online. And just have some fun and stop worrying about it so much.\n\nAnd just on a side note if anyone creepy asks you if you're a freshman you're a sophomore doesn't matter you're automatically a sophomore. So just please stop worrying about getting a formal invitation and just have fun it's College . \n\nSincerely,\n\nA 4th year that would really like all the freshmen to just have  Fun there 1st year on campus",
