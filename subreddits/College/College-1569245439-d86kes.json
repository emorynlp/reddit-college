  "text": "For me, it's either the useless required courses that are not related to our majors or the lack of focus on teaching by professors.\n\n\n\nAt my school, a lot of teaching is done by part-time adjunct professors.  They are not industry professionals looking to teach the next generation of engineers, but mostly people working this job and applying for tenured track positions.  \n\n\n\n\nA lot of the teaching is pretty generic, from information you can easily google, and read right off the powerpoint.  My largest criticism is that none of the professors try connecting the material to modern research, so the entire course feels like reading a bunch of wikipedia articles.  It makes it hard to network with tenured professors for research opportunities since they don't teach that many classes except for less than a handful of upper level electives.",

      "text": "How professors act like it's absolutely nothing to write a paper. The process is anxiety inducing for me because there's so much emphasis on what can happen to you if you don't cite properly/plagerize even if it's an accident. That and you're forced to create a topic you don't even know you'll be able to research so you might spend who knows how long trying to research and before you know it, you're halfway through the time given to write the paper and you have hardly anything to work with. There's hardly any room for flexibility with writing papers and if you do try to be flexible it's a major inconvenience having to start from scratch. \n\nI have three papers to write right now.",

I feel like they make me a more well-rounded individual. I\u2019m going into business, but history, biology, and government WILL be useful to me because 1) history repeats itself, 2) there is no business without an earth, and 3) the effectiveness of our government affects us all. About the only class that is on my roster that isn\u2019t directly useful to some part of my life is Music Appreciation and I still think it\u2019s making me a better individual. \n\nI know that the prevailing theory is that it\u2019s a way to get more money out of you. And maybe that\u2019s true. But I still think that making our educated sector more well rounded is better for society as a whole. It\u2019s been better for me!",

I spoke with enough faculty; the title 9 office, the disability office, the vp of student affairs, the vp of student-teacher relations, other professors, etc, that everyone's asses were starting to sweat cuz if I was that open about it all over campus, with DIRECT evidence, who knew when I was going to approach the court or the media?\n\nTLDR: teacher finds out I'm legally a lesbian (same sex marriage) cuz I wrote an email apologizing that my work quality may suffer due to my wife being diagnosed with cancer. I fail the next essay outright, despite being an English major in my final year. Other professors said they'd have given me a B- for that quality. It takes a month to get a straight answer, emailing professor bitch every day, that I was failed because the work wasn't \"formatted appropriately\".... And that the teacher hadn't actually included in her instructions or syllabus any kind of reference to what format she wanted. \n\nIt is a valid complaint, according to the student affairs office, that an assignment was poorly graded based upon unsaid standards. Which could already cause an investigation and force the school to change my grade higher. \n\nBut after that every fucking assignment that passive-aggressive old woman bitch baby would include some shit on the classwide email to throw shade like, \"since ONE OF YOU couldn't tell last time, I want (format)\" or \"I expect all of you to use my definition of normal for this argument essay. Which means you're not allowed to write about gay rights, communism, or organizational skills you think other people should already know\" (she's been a teacher for longer than my mother has been alive, and working at that university since my mother was born. She has no excuse, as an English teacher, to not understand English course documents as required by the institution).\n\nAfter I spoke to the English dean, he basically realized that though he had initially taken the professor's side that I was actually right. He expected a 19 yr old with actually-shit-tier work, not a 26 yr old with a flawless-theory analytical essay (where the only problem was formatting errors), and a history of 90%+ grades in other courses for the last 2 years. He was genuinely embarrassed that the situation did totally look like intentionally using a mistake on her own part to excuse descrimination against me, especially since noone else in the class got a failing grade even if they also did the wrong format.",

And reminded him more then once of this.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t advertise why I was traveling but that was again because I know our school can really buckle down on this attitude and I\u2019m never sure who it\u2019s safe to talk about my hobbies outside of school unless I\u2019ve had them before. And I cant lie to save my life. So if your asking if it\u2019s excused or not I\u2019m going to say not since I\u2019m pretty sure me running a marathon wouldn\u2019t be school sponsored excuse. \n\nAlso ya know I\u2019m a junior whose been around the block a few times at age 30 and knows how to catch up on her work. And heck I would have already started it if you hadn\u2019t been at the conference last week and not wanting to be the kid who poked the bull so to speak. \n\nTo try and appease the dude I tried to see if there was anything educational I could do that wasn\u2019t history related (going to Berlin for the record). Only thing I could find was a climate change conference and while I definitely have some money to spare compared to the average college student, what I don\u2019t have is 500 euros to toss around for a single day of a conference to appease a prof who seems to think students should operate on two settings. \n\nOur school notorious for this by the way. To the point us older students can be notoriously clammy about what we\u2019re doing away from campus since we know some profs can be extremely abrasive about us missing class for somethings that\u2019s not school sanctioned. Thing is even if I hadn\u2019t said something my department is TINY and good chance word would have got back to him from my other professor in the same department (I got asked about missing class there last week and as said I\u2019m a bad liar, prefer to just leave details out then say I\u2019m doing something else entirely, so I told them, my female prof in that class actually got excited at the whole thing. As said it\u2019s a freaking range and you never know what reaction your going to get). \n\nI\u2019m already going to miss another couple of classes. One for a different race that\u2019s not international. One for a doctors. And then one for Thanksgiving since it\u2019s a review day anyway. And I\u2019m dreading based on today those conversations already.\n\nETA: i had to email him anyway so I ended up asking him if he wanted me doing something educational on the trip outside of classwork. Did not bring up the expensive conference and if he tries to pull that I will put my foot down",

      "text": "I'm not talking about basic math skills. I'm talking about Calculus where hand written techniques only work with perfect numbers that you will never find in any field that requires the use of the content in the real world. There are two types of students in these classes. Ones who can blindly memorize the technique and get the answer but have no idea what they actually achieved, and those who understand the concepts being taught but are unable to memorize the process because they realize it's so mind numbingly useless and know it's not something anyone remembers unless you literally end up teaching it.\n\nThen the kids are taking STEM classes where the hand written techniques don't work and can't be used. They have zero calculator skills and have been taught nothing about how to apply math to actual problems. We're not teaching critical thinking skills or concepts that will actually stick with you, we're teaching useless processes that no one is going to remember a year after they graduate. The worst part is these classes are destroying students, Calc 2 often goes from 30 students to 12 and half of them have to repeat it, that's insane! These kids aren't stupid either, I've talked to many sharp minds that are forced to give up their dreams because they can't do something they'll never use. We should be focused on teaching students how to effectively solve real problems, and in complex real problems hand written techniques invite human error if they can be used at all.\n\nPeople are so fast to talk about how cool it is that all this complex stuff just works, well of course it does, math is a human construct, if it didn't make sense it wouldn't be part of the construction. Eventually all math boils down to a house of infinite mirrors, you couldn't ever hope to complete it. I'm not saying don't teach math, I'm saying focus a lot more on the concepts, real work processing, and solving REAL problems with it.",

When you're in a major that requires a STEM class, such as Physics or Calculus, there's literally like what about 3 sections per course? On top of that, a lot of these STEM professors are really poorly rated ( < 3.5). To make matters worse, some of these sections could create time conflicts with other sections you're already registered for, or it just has an inconvenient time (like evening classes).\n\nI don't know if this is a global complaint or if this is just my college, but it certainly is a problem here.",

They were 7th graders. They've been learning to add and subtract since 1st and 2nd grade.

I'm talking about Calculus where hand written techniques only work with perfect numbers that you will never find in any field that requires the use of the content in the real world. There are two types of students in these classes. Ones who can blindly memorize the technique and get the answer but have no idea what they actually achieved, and those who understand the concepts being taught but are unable to memorize the process because they realize it's so mind numbingly useless and know it's not something anyone remembers unless you literally end up teaching it.\n\nThen the kids are taking STEM classes where the hand written techniques don't work and can't be used. They have zero calculator skills and have been taught nothing about how to apply math to actual problems. We're not teaching critical thinking skills or concepts that will actually stick with you, we're teaching useless processes that no one is going to remember a year after they graduate. The worst part is these classes are destroying students, Calc 2 often goes from 30 students to 12 and half of them have to repeat it, that's insane! These kids aren't stupid either, I've talked to many sharp minds that are forced to give up their dreams because they can't do something they'll never use. We should be focused on teaching students how to effectively solve real problems, and in complex real problems hand written techniques invite human error if they can be used at all.\n\nPeople are so fast to talk about how cool it is that all this complex stuff just works, well of course it does, math is a human construct, if it didn't make sense it wouldn't be part of the construction. Eventually all math boils down to a house of infinite mirrors, you couldn't ever hope to complete it. I'm not saying don't teach math, I'm saying focus a lot more on the concepts, real work processing, and solving REAL problems with it.",

I saw my family twice a year during approved blocks of leave and spent 9 months dicking around in the mud in South Korea.\n\n\nI have less free time now in college than I did in the Army.

At the time, I thought he was just bitter and didn't know what he was talking about. I did a stint at community college, and the people who tried the most and got the most out of it were the non-traditional students. They wanted to be in college, and more often than not, were paying for it themselves so they knew what it was worth. I find that college is just full of people who are immature and still fully being supported by their parents, which means that they live a certain life. I am a traditional student, went to college at 17, and am working my way through so I certainly understand that their are behaviors that are expected as kids gain more independence and whatnot. \n\nBut what I really find is that college attracts kids who can afford it more than it attracts people who deserve to be there. There's a sense of entitlement that comes with just being on a college campus and I get why our neighbors (I go to school in a big city) hate the university.",

Most of the work is manually checking the thousands of results produced by the code of higher ups in the labs to make sure the results are correct (cannot be automated, must be checked by people).\n\nThe professor I TA for needs to put more effort into his classes. His syllabus is less than 100 words and half a page and for recitations he does not give me anything to do other than saying \u201cdo problems from Chapter 1.\u201d Which it turns out he did not fully teach Chapter 1 so I taught it to the class. He does not tell us TAs what he teaches in class so we do not know what to teach during recitation. Everything about his class is winged and done last minute and it really upsets me because as a student too the students in his class are paying thousands of dollars for this quality of education.",

I\u2019m now living in an apartment that is $2500 a semester and has free printing, a free to use pool, free parking, a free coffee bar, an arcade, a gym, etc. Living on campus in a dorm is a joke, a scam. That\u2019s why they make freshmen stay on campus for a year, to take their money before they realize how ridiculously expensive everything is. \n\nMy advice: Move off campus ASAP",

This might not be super relatable to others but: discussion-based classes where no one has any thoughts, and the people who do tend to speak up get off-topic with personal shit. I go to a really small all-female school where the curriculum is designed to make you think for yourself, and be confident in your perspective and ability to communicate that. If you're not willing to speak or have an original thought, this isn't the right place for you. I'm also in my late twenties, and went back for my degree and I'm annoyed that I'm paying so much and so much of my class time is the professor staring at us with a blank face waiting for someone to speak, or I'm listening to some girl go off on a tangent about Instagram or some shit. College is supposed to be for adults, who have adult thoughts and discussions.\n\n2. Group projects. Fuck that. They say, ohhh you're gonna need to know how to work with people in your career fields. Yeah maybe but a) it's not gonna be a damn power point about Woodrow Wilson and b) in a job you're held accountable to your boss if you don't participate. Group projects don't prepare you for dick in the real world.",

Going through my undergrad and learning more about the professors, you realize a lot of them started off with no experience in the industry and their passion lies in something vaguely similar to what they're teaching. Their research is focused 100% on what their passionate about and their half-assing their course. I'm paying thousands to be here, but being taught the material by a $100-200 access code.",

It's introduction to microeconomics, it doesn't need to be that difficult. It's one thing not to be cut out for an econ major; it's another to struggle to meet a course requirement because you need a foundation in economics that requires a weed-out class to keep only the best students in upper-level economics. \n\nThey also made the course extremely difficult to get help in. You were not allowed to email the professor directly, and he couldn't really help with anything but strict content (not even homework questions, because he didn't grade it or see the questions). Because it is a large course, there was a course administrator you had to go through first, who is well-known, even amongst other professors and advisors, for being terrible to interact with, and not great at her job. My advisor made it clear to me that I did not want to take the course with her. Everything is graded by a team of graders who you never see, meaning if you have questions about feedback, good luck getting clarification that doesn't start with \"I think maybe they meant...\" and doesn't make sense or tie back to the actual comment.\n\nTo add another layer on it, my school has separate physics courses for physics majors, engineering majors, and science majors; same with some other science-type classes. But it only has one economics sequence, which is a \"weed-out\" course. The whole thing was quite frustrating, and it's the only time I experienced anything like it, and I don't think it was necessary to make it both bureaucratically difficult and a weed-out.",

College does cost a \"shitload of money.\" I do not think everyone should be required to take courses that have little to nothing to do with their future major. For example: A medical doctor should not have to take a class in Gender Studies (this is my personal example.) I could, not only use that time to study my other subjects in even more depth and detail, but also be able to focus my time on my future and how to become the best possible doctor for you and your family. This class (for me) really just diverts my attention away from learning how to become the best possible medical doctor and rather puts me in position where I am paying for a class and learning about something I will never use. Though, I am not targeting that class for everyone or every major. It could be really useful in business. But for a doctor? Probably not. \n\nSo to your questions. I agree that we should reduce college costs in general, but these electives really do not help people who know for sure they want to do something. I'd say two resources get taken up, money and time. And if you're a business major, you should not be required a science course! Medical doctors should be taking medical courses. I should not have to pay or use my time on courses that are unrelated to my subject.\n\nHowever, if some electives interest you, research from your local public library or watch informational ted talks. You'll get the same education (debatably moreso) and you won't pay a dime. You will also be doing what YOU want to do. And it's for free.",

They whine about taking a couple wimpy math classes (the algebra normally taken in 7th, 8th, or 9th grade) and some watered-down \"science\" that no normal major would give you credit for, then tell the rest of us to be \"well rounded\" and \"grow as a person\" by taking 60 credits of useless indoctrination.\n\nThey can't see the problem because the classes are sort of related to their major, they don't expect employment directly in that field, and they still have plenty of free electives left to screw around with. Meanwhile the serious students, not even with a minor or double major, don't have room for electives after squeezing in all the legitimately required courses. Typically there is **one** slot for an elective. For an engineering student, you can almost say that electives are not a thing.",

I do understand it's frusterating, you also need to realize most of these are kids. They are told from 5-18 that they must go to college, they aren't given highschool classes or taught by the parents about getting good returns on investments. So I get your frusteration, but there are too many kids that simply either A. Are not educated in this manner. And B. Haven't really questioned why they are doing whay they are doing. \n\nIt's a very controversial subject and if we want people to make better financial decisions, we should encourage them to learn more about the career they are going to college to invest in.",

Either because they aren't competitive enough, or because nobody is hiring in their specific area (usually a bit of both, but the job market in academia right now is disgusting). These are people who often teach multiple courses, often at multiple universities or colleges, trying to cobble together a living while simultaneously trying not to burn out. There are people who do this for a decade, or decades, trying desperately to hang onto the dream of \"being a professor\" or \"being an academic\" who should have cashed out long, long ago. After a while, their ability to care about students dies out. As does their passion for effective teaching and meeting learning outcomes.\n\nSome of us do care very much about effective teaching--I'm sorry if you got a bunch of duds this semester.

This is a multifactored answer. The one I'll give is that because of austerity measures at all levels of government, universities (like other institutions) have to do more with less. These aren't scientific figures, but it's now icloser to that for every three professors that retire, one TT replaces them while the others' courses are taught by contract/adjunct people who get paid shit with no benefits.",
