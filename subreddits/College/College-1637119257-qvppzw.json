How many credit hours do you recommend taking and what schedule do you recommend following with work and school to work 35-40 hours a week while in college? I know it\u2019s different for everyone, but Id like to hear your experiences. \n\nThanks",

I\u2019m able to do some work during the day when the kids are gone, but I also have other household responsibilities that come first so it\u2019s not always possible. Most nights I end up coming home and am up until 10-11:30pm doing work. And usually one whole weekend day is dedicated to schoolwork. \n\nTime blocking has really helped me, but as I mentioned, i\u2019m a nanny and a lot of my day can be unpredictable so it\u2019s hard to always plan ahead.",

      "text": "Hi! I worked 40 hours a week while taking 12-15 credits a semester for two years until i graduated. It doable but it does suck. You have to be dedicated and focused and have great time management. I managed to have time for a social life as well but it\u2019s all dependent on how well you manage your time. I\u2019m currently in grad school and working 20-30 hours a week and i\u2019m managing. Don\u2019t let other people in this thread scare you. If you think you are driven and mature enough to do it, its doable. I know all too well the struggle of trying to get through college while having to afford to be able to live.\n\nedit: I saw you were asking this. I tried to schedule either all of my classes before noon or all of my classes in the evening. I was a science major so i also tried to schedule all of my labs on the same day. One semester I went to class from 8-8 on tuesdays just to get all of my labs done on the same day. Thankfully i had a manager at the time who was willing to work with my school schedule.So some semesters i worked first shift and others i worked second shift depending on how i scheduled my classes. I also worked every weekend so that I was able to have more days off during the week.",

I missed out on a lot of important assignments that I ended up getting 0's on.\n\nThat extra day off didn't pay off for me anyways, since I started to lose interest in my college classes and been skipping all of them, ignoring attendance, classwork, and homework altogether.",

I know it\u2019s difficult to do that but it\u2019s honestly your best hope. I do my homework in the mornings and work in the evenings. I take off days I have classes and one extra day to play catch up. I also make sure I have one day a week to myself. My hours are typically long (9-12) but I\u2019m able to do that because I worked a lot of overtime as a first year. Also, apply for food stamps! I have food stamps and they are an honest to god life saver. I promise you\u2019re eligible.",

She does not sleep a whole lot studies like crazy and I don't know how she does it.\n\nThe information I can provide is as follows for at least what she does. Her 2 jobs 1 is at the library which is very low stress but only pays about $11 an hour but it let her study during work she works the front desk and maybe deals with 5 different people during a 4 hour shift but she's working about 20 hours a week there which is the maximum in some cases she can work for a campus job.\n\nThe other 20 to 25 hours she works she has a virtual online like call center job that she works from her dorm room she uses her computer logged in to whatever system she has to log in to her schedule is kind of flexible but she's basically working from home in an outbound call service kind of customer service capacity it's not great but it pays her about $15 an hour so so combined she's making enough money to cover her food and survive basically and come out and party with us periodically.\n\nShe works a lot she studies a lot her roommate does something similar so they basically coordinate that 1 of them has their room dorm to workin uninterrupted and then the other one like leaves and the other roommate can work from that door it's very very stressful on her but she manages it. She is like a straight a student and works her ass off I don't know how she does it but that's what she does to afford school I don't know if that's what you want to do or well I think it would be a little bit easier if you aren't a stem major So if you're not a stem major it might be a little bit more manageable",

All of my classes are in person. I don\u2019t have to worry about travel time as I live close to my college and work\n\nOverall, you gotta do what you gotta do! I\u2019m taking four classes for financial aid reasons though if there was a way to work less I\u2019d lean more in that direction. \nI still feel I have time to relax and occasionally socialize like once or twice a week (depending of course on how hectic things are with college). If anything, the thing I\u2019m personally risking is not having the most perfect grades or as much time as I\u2019d like to create some stellar projects\n\nOn top of all that, I spend a lot of time working on a club though I actually work on it during work, classes, and my free time. It doesn\u2019t feel exhaustive to me as it\u2019s more of a passion project but basically I\u2019m still finding time for that as well\n-\nHere\u2019s my schedule\nMon: 4 hour shift | 2 classes\nTue: 4 hour shift | 2 classes | 2 hour shift\nWed: 4 hour shift | 2 classes\nThur: 5 hour shift | 2 classes | 2 hour shift\nFri: 4 hour shift \nSat: (sometimes I work Saturdays for 4 hours)\nSun: 7 hour shift\n\nI\u2019m able to do homework in one of my jobs and I schedule in 1-2 hour breaks during my day to socialize/relax/work in club stuff. In addition to that, lots of other smaller breaks as well. I can have longer days where I stay in the library to finish homework though sometimes I take the rest of the evening to relax, saving hw for the daytime.\n\n\nAll in all, I don\u2019t think any of this would work if I didn\u2019t have 3 jobs that are flexible with hours and if they didn\u2019t offer space to work on other things. Every single day can be pretty full at times but it\u2019s about making sure you can recover during smaller breaks and have other support systems in place. It\u2019s def not the most sustainable but it can be done  so long as you don\u2019t slip and fall in some way (which can happen! Have something to catch you when those times come)",

Take the L and take out a federal student loan.

      "text": "I would only do 6 credit hours, maybe 9 at the most when you're at full time hours. However, a lot of this stuff comes down to things like what's your major, who the professor is (some are chill and easy, other's not so much), what the classes are (easy gen eds or do you need 20 hours a week to do the projects and understand this material class), do you want to learn the material or just get the grade, what is your job, can you do school work at your job, how exhausting is your job, how is your time management, how much stress can you handle, etc.\n\nWorking full time and doing school full time is essentially an 80 hour work week. If you do full time credits you'll probably have to prioritize classes as well. This means one class you might want an A, another a B, and another you're like anything above passing is good. Time management can help you stay organized on what to do for a day, but it's fundamentally not a cure all. I also wouldn't underestimate burnout as well.\n\nFor me as someone working and doing school, not full time. I find myself underestimating the amount of work I can get done in a day and burn out as well. On work days, due to the shift and structure of my job, I can only really get maybe an hour maybe two if I'm lucky of school work done. However, most of the time I just want to relax. This also relates to burn out as well because you don't want to be busy 24/7 because that makes you miserable and stressed out. Also research shows, the last I looked at it, that it's pretty much the more you work the worse you do in school.",

Just make sure to take care of yourself and if possible take time off from work on breaks from school. This way you have mini vacations throughout the year. not always realistic to do so but it's an option for some.",

You need to be super dedicated and be ok with saying goodbye to a social life for the semester and gym, etc\n\nI work 50-55 hours a week and go to school full time. I\u2019m always sleeping late, waking up early, always last minute turning things in, I have a schedule that I can\u2019t break because then my whole timeline will be in shambles, and I\u2019m an engineering major. If you can deal with basically running like a chicken without a head on for 3 months at a time, without a break, this will work for you. If not, take your time. As long as you get your degree you\u2019re good!",
