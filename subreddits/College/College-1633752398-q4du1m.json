  "text": "my biology class is entirely online. we have a 50 minute meeting only once a week on Zoom. The rest of the material is in the textbook. We have quizzes once a week. I do ask my prof for help and her help is very vague.\n\ni fucked up on my last two quizzes and got Ds on them. I also failed my first exam since i was only given 45 mins to do it (the max time is suppose to be 1 hour and 45 mins). They are proctored. i studied my ass off and wrote good notes to make sure that i understood the material. i put in hours of work. I guess these quizzes and exams arent based on memorization but primarily on applying the concepts. I knew everything but the questions were so unlike the material. \n\nMy problem is that i have no motivation or desire to study anymore. I put in hours studying for these last two quizzes and one exam only to fuck up on them. So now idc and will most likely resort to cheating on my nexts tests. How can i get through this mental block on studying? i literally stopped to write this. I just dont care anymore for this class lol. I am planning on cheating on my next quiz and exam, its that bad. at the same time i dont want to since I am pre-med and i need to develop good study habits for medical school",
