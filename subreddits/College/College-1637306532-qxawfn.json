  "text": "I felt lonely myself back in September thinking about how while students at 4 year schools met in person and having social lives, I'm a 2nd year CC student with all online classes. A few weeks later, I realized that I don't know if I would like, and can't imagine my current self, spending lots of time with people. I can only figure it out how much of a social like I want once I transfer to a 4 year school. I'm also gonna see how I could spent 3 years (and graduate as a 5th year student) at colleges I look at, if I find that the college experience really is worthwhile.",
