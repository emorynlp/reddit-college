  "text": "Hi!\n\nI go to a school that is known for it's research in health sciences so you would think that it'll be easier for me to find research/volunteer opportunities as a premed student but that's literally the opposite of what is happening. So many people are also premed and there are so many people that want the same opportunities that I want so it is very hard finding research. How can I find places for research/volunteering? How Do I even start.\n\nBTW: I'm a sophomore in college and I barely have an EC's",

Just let them know you\u2019re more than willing to help out with their research and to keep you in mind the next time they\u2019re looking for participants.",
