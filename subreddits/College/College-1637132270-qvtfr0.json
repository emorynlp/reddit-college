  "text": "I live in a house with 4 other girls (all F 20). This is my second year in this house with them, I only knew the one girl coming in and didn't know the other 3... (BIG mistake BTW)\n\nAnyways long story short I'm not very close with them, never really clicked with them so lately, I've just been keeping to myself and avoiding them. \n\nI live in the basement and the girl that has a room above me (who also openly doesn't like me, and I don't like her we just keep it lowkey around each other bc we live tg) her floor creaks SO much and I don't know if I can stand another semester of it. I can literally hear everything she does in her room, when she drops shit on the floor, drags her chair across her floor... she stays up late most nights like 1am-2am. \n\nIve been woken up in the middle of the night from her being loud as shit. I get the worst sleep and her floor creaking is now an anxiety trigger for me (literally). Ive told her about 3 times (twice last year, once this year) that her floor is really loud and to try and minimize walking in her room late at night. But she still continues to make noise, but she is aware her floor is loud. I don't know what to do, but I'm about fed up with it. I have one more semester but its almost impossible to find a place (money wise) plus my rent now is super affordable for me and my family and id have to find someone to fill my spot before I move out. tips?",

      "text": "Did you tell her that her floor is annoying and that she needs to stop staying up so late, or did you ask her to help minimize noise by getting a rug or do something else to make it easier for you to sleep? \n\nShe has a right to walk around her room\u2026 it\u2019s not like she\u2019s blasting music or something. Have you tried earplugs? They can be a life changer in shared living situations.",
