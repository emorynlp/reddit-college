      "text": "(long read sorry!!!) Hi! It\u2019s completely understandable to feel all of these emotions right now. When I first went to college I was a nervous wreck, granted it was fall 2020 meaning little to no contact. Now I\u2019ve been thrusted into the full college experience. It\u2019s not as bad as I thought it was going to be, as a person with anxiety. Applying to college can be stressful, to knock that down a bit gather resources before taking to counselors. They\u2019ll be more than accommodating for you! As for living on your own, are you moving to a dorm, apartment, etc? I currently live in a dorm. I\u2019ve made pretty okay friends with my dorm mate, just sit down for an hour and get to know each other. Now if you\u2019re living in an apartment, that\u2019s okay too! Talk to your classmates after class, they\u2019ll be happy to have study groups. I hate to say this, but high school friends come and go. Some are a phase and some are not. It\u2019s life. You might find yourself at the end of your first year with less contact because of how busy everyone is, but try to make one day a month that you all contact each other.",
