  "text": "Maybe I'm just getting pissy in my old age but I feel like I see variations of this at least once a day at this point. Hopefully this'll help anyone who wanders in to ask this question for the billionth time, because the answer is always exactly the same:\n\n**It doesn't matter how old you are.** You can be 17, you can be 27, hell, you could be 67, you're always exactly the right age to start college for the first time or the first time in a while! What matters is how badass it is that you're thinking about taking a huge step that could have a big impact on your life, because that in itself is a difficult choice. It's a major life decision and that's scary - believe me, I know. I started at 18, dropped out at 20, and was 28 when I finally went back to finish my first degree.\n\nI won't lie, at first it felt pretty weird (and a bit lonely) to be the oldest person in the room who wasn't a professor 99% of the time, but once you've gotten through the first semester you won't even think about it anymore. Going back to school was the best decision I've ever made and I have absolutely no regrets, so if you know that's what you want to do, go for it. Don't let anyone tell you you're too old.",

It\u2019s not like it\u2019s all paid for by the government and it\u2019s normal for students to go deep into debt just to go to college. I think people who ask this question a lot of the times just need someone\u2019s guidance , even if it is a stranger online. But overall I think older people can appreciate the underlying message behind you post :)",

I met my wife when I was 23 and when things got serious I said I need a degree if I\u2019m gonna start a family. \n\nFirst semester was hard, I felt judged. But I wasn\u2019t, no one really cared how old you were. After the first year it was an after thought to me. I now have a stable job and steady income and baby number 2 on the way. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever thought about going to college regardless of your age, just do it. Take one summer class to get your feet wet and take it from there. \n\nI would sometimes say, \u201c I\u2019m gonna be 30 when I get my degree\u201d my wife would say \u201cyou can either be 30 with a degree or you can be 30 with no degree.\u201d Doesn\u2019t matter the age all that matters is the end result. Also doesn\u2019t matter how many years it take either, everyone has a life weather you have kids or a job. Be proud for going to college and trying make yourself even better.",

      "text": "I get your point, I really do, but I think there's a reason some people post these types of questions (And this is only addressing people who are much older than what some of these age ranges have been recently). For me personally, it was just a reassurance having people talk to me through MY own current situation. I read tons of things online and everyone also said it was fine, but for some reason it still just didn't hit the same. I still had so many questions and just didn't feel like these posts were being answered honestly. \n\nFor some reason it just feels better when you have someone telling you directly that it's fine. It took a whole lot of effort for me to suck it up and enroll at my community college. Being ten years older than everyone felt weird as HELL, I missed a lot of class because of it. I suffer from anxiety after getting out of the service so my mind over thinks thinks like fucking hell. I always felt self conscious about being the oldest one in the room so a little re-assurance directly to you can go a long way.  So I 100% understand why some people might read some posts saying \"Yeah, you're old but still enroll\" but STILL needing to post something for added reassurance. \n\nBut at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter how old you are. You're there for a degree so go and get it done. Yes these posts are repetitive but in my mind, if it'll help someone make that final leap to just go ahead and enroll, then I feel like I'm helping them in a way. Even if there's a shit ton of posts. If it bugs you THAT much, then just keep on scrolling, friend. An online message can go a long way for some people. All it'll take is a minute.",

In your CV you will not write your birthday / age anyway, so age won't matter during recruitment. In the end it's down to your skills / experiences to get the job. I have been working for almost a decade now, and workplaces are filled with people with various age range, nobody will know / cares about your age (because how they even know your age ?), so competition is always based on skills / achivements. Age doesn't matter here.  \n\nMaybe mention your countries so people don't get the wrong idea and generalize Southeast Asia.",
