Hopefully this'll help anyone who wanders in to ask this question for the billionth time, because the answer is always exactly the same:\n\n**It doesn't matter how old you are.** You can be 17, you can be 27, hell, you could be 67, you're always exactly the right age to start college for the first time or the first time in a while! What matters is how badass it is that you're thinking about taking a huge step that could have a big impact on your life, because that in itself is a difficult choice. It's a major life decision and that's scary - believe me, I know. I started at 18, dropped out at 20, and was 28 when I finally went back to finish my first degree.\n\nI won't lie, at first it felt pretty weird (and a bit lonely) to be the oldest person in the room who wasn't a professor 99% of the time, but once you've gotten through the first semester you won't even think about it anymore. Going back to school was the best decision I've ever made and I have absolutely no regrets, so if you know that's what you want to do, go for it.

For me personally, it was just a reassurance having people talk to me through MY own current situation. I read tons of things online and everyone also said it was fine, but for some reason it still just didn't hit the same. I still had so many questions and just didn't feel like these posts were being answered honestly. \n\nFor some reason it just feels better when you have someone telling you directly that it's fine. It took a whole lot of effort for me to suck it up and enroll at my community college. Being ten years older than everyone felt weird as HELL, I missed a lot of class because of it. I suffer from anxiety after getting out of the service so my mind over thinks thinks like fucking hell. I always felt self conscious about being the oldest one in the room so a little re-assurance directly to you can go a long way.  So I 100% understand why some people might read some posts saying \"Yeah, you're old but still enroll\" but STILL needing to post something for added reassurance. \n\nBut at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter how old you are. You're there for a degree so go and get it done. Yes these posts are repetitive but in my mind, if it'll help someone make that final leap to just go ahead and enroll, then I feel like I'm helping them in a way. Even if there's a shit ton of posts.
