      "text": "If it makes you feel any better, I was convinced that I had failed one of my midterms two weeks ago and was upset about it for the rest of the day (it was worth so much of my grade that I even considered withdrawing from the class). We got our graded tests back in class on Friday and I ended up getting 80%!\n\nTry to be kind to yourself. If you did the best you could, then try to be happy with that fact. Hopefully you will have passed the midterm- hey, maybe other classmates didn't do so well and they'll end up curving the grades. However, as of now the end result is out of your hands. When you see the actual grade, if it's not to your satisfaction you can still talk to the professor or TA and see if there's anything you can do.",
