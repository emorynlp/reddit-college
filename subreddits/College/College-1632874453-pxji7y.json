  "text": "Hey guys so our campus at my CC has been closed for the past 2 semesters but now it has re opened and started offering in person classes as well. I only go there once a week (only have one class on campus-rest on zoom) but have noticed just how calm the area is when I go through there for my class. I noticed recently that at home I am more often looking at reddit and YouTube videos whenever I get bored of doing homework after an hour or so. \n\nAnyone else kind of get distracted at home when doing work? Has going to the library helped?",

What happened to me last friday explains why, I was doing this very abstract reading and I was falling sleep, I was grabbing the concepts and taking notes but still felt my eyes were so heavy, so it took me a long time to finish the reading. At home, I would've probably gotten easily distracted, layed down to sleep, and probably would've ended up procrastinating. I finished it. Once I got home I knew I got to sleep and not think about that anymore, Its nice getting to divide spaces, specially after a year and a half doing every single thing in my life in the same room, this is something I'm only valuing now as the pandemic is slowly fading away, because before I would've said I prefered home.",

      "text": "I found that setting aside actual time to study helped. Before the pandemic I would have absolutely said the library, but now that I\u2019m back on campus I can\u2019t focus because I need to pee or need to eat and I\u2019d rather go home to study (and there are less study spaces now). \n\nSo instead, I set tasks by the day they need to be done and pick a time frame I will probably do that. I take breaks whenever I see fit but I also frame my studying (at home) when my husband is not home. If he is home and I have to study, I set another time barrier (until dinner is ready, until I have to move the laundry, until the dog needs to pee). So I guess it really depends on what your distractions at home are. \n\nI think you can navigate either space but I prefer to be home so I can take breaks more often. Particularly with masks, I really want to be home instead of the library, and I just make a point to stop studying before bed, but also allow time in the week to study. \n\nIf you\u2019re at home with your parents or roommates I\u2019d suggest letting them know that they cannot interrupt you at a certain time.",

I always get interrupted once or twice within a 6 hour period to go run errands, do a chore, watch younger siblings, etc. I also get interrupted by myself when I lay down in bed for a while in between classes I can fall asleep or get stuck on my phone.\n\nOn campus I get so much done so much faster without any distractions. I always get snacks to bring with me to study/ work on assignments personally.",
