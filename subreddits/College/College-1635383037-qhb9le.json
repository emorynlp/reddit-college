  "text": "I\u2019m not sure how to deal with this. I recently transferred into a 4 year college and my grades have been good but not good enough. My effort into the time I study & do assignments should land me in the A+ range yet my grades span from B- to B. And I don\u2019t settle for Bs. Anyone else going through this?",

      "text": "Effort doesn't necessarily translate into grades. It may be that the study habits you're employing aren't efficient or effective; you should do some quick research on good study habits and see where you can improve or try new things. Also, the transition from a CC to a 4-year is a big one, so it may well be that what was enough effort at a CC just isn'tt enough anymore.",

      "text": "You need to learn that your expectations from high school no longer apply here. A+ does not mean \"completed all requirements\", but rather \"Exceptional work far exceeding expectations\". Expecting to get A+'s consistently is a mindset that will only drag you down, and you need to lose it yesterday.",
