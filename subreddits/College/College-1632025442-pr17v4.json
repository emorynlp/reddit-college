In high school I got straight A\u2019s, actually my whole life I\u2019ve had good grades except senior year. I stopped showing up to presentations bc I was tired of having to go through the anxiety and do a poor job. I skipped class too. Anyway it\u2019s kind of late right now, my point is, do any of you have any tips? I just don\u2019t want to deal with that anxiety of teachers calling on me and doing presentations.
