  "text": "Finals week is nothing compared to THAT week. I\u2019m going through THAT week now, and every single professor that I have has coincidentally made a huge project due this week. It\u2019s like the culmination of everything that is unholy in college has decided to all coincide on this one fateful span of 5 days. I\u2019m starting to think there\u2019s some inter-professor conspiracy where they all pick a week around the start of thanksgiving break to royally fuck over their students with projects and work. Screw you in particular professor Thomson, screw you and your huge eyebrows.",

      "text": "Yeah, it\u2019s a normal thing. I always had that happen to me, even in high school. During the year or semester, the course load is steady, until the holidays or the end of the semester. Then they all want to assign countless assignments and never consider that their students have lives to live and are ON BREAK. Need to mention over the years, colleges has taken away the official standard of a week long thanksgiving break. Now, most schools\u2019 thanksgiving break is only 3-4 days long, so most out-of-state students cannot come home and make it back in time when classes begin again. I never have gotten an actual break since last Christmas and summer. Everything else in between is sucky. You just have to get used to it. It\u2019s how it goes.",
