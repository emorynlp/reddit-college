  "title:": "Can you transfer to a university after only 1 year at community college?",
  "text": "So I got a 1.7 GPA in high school due to my living circumstances which are allowing me to attend all 4 years old college for free.\n\nI\u2019m currently at a community college and have all As, I\u2019m going to crush this year. My only issue is that I really want to attend university, a big part of that is being in a dorm because currently my living situation isn\u2019t too great..\n\nIn my state, having a Pell Grant allows me to go to our state university for free. But with my high school GPA being a 1.7, I seriously doubt I\u2019d be accepted. That\u2019s why I\u2019m attending CC to get my grades up, so that when I do apply to university, they only pay attention to my college grades.\n\nSo if I was to crush this year, all As, 4.0, would I be able to transfer to my state university going into my sophomore year if I added an explanation as to why my high school grades were so awful?\n\nOr do I have to get my associates degree here first, and only then they\u2019ll consider my college grades above my high school grades?",

      "text": "Once you enter college, honestly most experiences from high school like GPAs are meaningless. Know that you\u2019re starting new at community and are killing it! I got an associates myself before I transferred to my state school that I\u2019m in now. Think about it as building your tool box and getting certification and experiences to help build yourself a more marketable person for your future.\n\nNot sure if this is the case for everyone\u2019s campus, but in order to transfer for me, I had to reach a certain amount of credits. Some campus\u2019s only allow a cap number of units you can take per semester. But see if your community college offers intercessions like school during Winter Break and Summer. It\u2019s a great way to get ahead but know it can be overwhelming because it\u2019s essentially a 16 week long course condensed in half. And I would just as a regular counseling advisor for some advice too.\n\nKeep it up though, you\u2019re definitely on your way!(:",
