  "text": "Throwaway account. This might be a bit lengthy so please bear with me.\n\nI\u2019m a freshman at an academically rigorous university. I went to an extremely competitive and rigorous High School that was #1 in the state. We were pretty much #1 in everything (test scores, graduation rates, etc).\n\nI made straight As all throughout High School. I took two honors classes, one AP, and one dual enrolment.\n\nI have struggled with math for a good portion of my life, but in High School I never failed a test. I always made As. The lowest grade I made was a 83%. Last year, I did pre-calculus online and I got a 100% both semesters (and no, I did not cheat).\n\nNow that I\u2019m in college, I feel like I\u2019m drowning. My professor is just spouting out advanced mathematical equations and formulas that aren\u2019t getting to me. It\u2019s when you know a language and you understand the surface structure, but not the deep structure/latent meaning. \n\nEveryone in my calc I class has taken calculus in high school, so this is just a review for them. Some of them do struggle, but they manage to get through it. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m at a disadvantage. My schools placement test said I was ready for calc I, but I failed my midterm (got a 50%) and I don\u2019t do very well on quizzes. \n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know what to do. This class makes me fearful and hopeless, and makes me extremely depressed. I don\u2019t want to give up, but I don\u2019t want to be driven to wanting to end my life either (that\u2019s how it  makes me feel). I feel like an archer who knows how to shoot, but is shooting aimlessly. \n\nI have to take this class for my major because it\u2019s a prerequisite for all of the classes in my major. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Any help please?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Hi there! So I heard praise for my smartness throughout my life but it took a good chunk of my lifetime to figure out that without hard-work I was not going to end up anywhere. The issue feels more about your internal crisis and reception of 'failure' than about not being able to understand mathematics. \n\nI was crap at maths ( I still am and I was FORCED to take calculus after getting average grades in maths ). I had to teach myself maths too for my teacher just dumped the formulas on us and I had to learn the science behind them ( hope I make sense ). If a noob like me can get fair at maths YOU DEFINITELY CAN. My H. School grades are sh\\*\\*, I have no money, I barely stand a chance to get into college but I want to live life or die trying.\n\n Some years ago only, I tried to end my life. What entailed was a series of dramatic events: father refused to believe I had the guts to poison myself, sister rained slaps on me and tried her best to make me gag ( but I had been fasting all day so it was to no avail ), mother kept dragging me down the stairs to get me to the hospital. My father was and still is emotionally ignorant. Our neighbor rushed me to the hospital on his bike. During the commute, I begged God to live. \n\nThe doctors washed my stomach, I vomited all over myself. I was cold and drenched, shivering and crying silently. My neighbor was God sent, he cleaned my face, he covered me up with his jacket and called on my mother. Mama cried so much, and I realized the pain I would cause my parents and family if I killed myself. That day I thought this question: is it worth killing myself over my troubles? Boy did my troubles change, even worsen. Heck I am stronger now! I am so resilient and happier. \n\nMy bad grades will never define me, but my efforts to reverse them do. I am the struggle I put up. My value lies in not quitting even if I am not 'successful' in life. Imagine missing out on being able to experience more, more art, literature, trivialities, romance and tragedies because college level calculus makes you hate life. This is the time of your life, this is your test my dear and I wish I could look you in your eyes and affirm that YOU WILL MAKE IT. I PROMISE.",

      "text": "Does your school offer SI ( supplemental instruction) or math labs?  And, is there a counseling center on campus to help with coping skills for the stress?  This sounds like a hard situation and I hope you get the resources you need.  Most schools offer these services for free ( well, covered by your tuition and fees)- might as well take advantage of them",

      "text": "Check Nancy pi in YouTube that's how I conquered and ended up loving calculus. My favorite class of the pre reqs next to geology. \n\nYou're w freshman and youre comparing highs school at with college. People who are rh best ok high school don't necessarily do well in college. You need to learn to study as college is a challenge all around. You need to learn to fail as well. I failed psychology on my sophomore year because I didn't know how to study yet because I was so good in high school that u didn't study much and in college that came to bite me.\n\nWhatever school throws at you shouldn't cause you suicidal thoughts. If you do then call the suicide help line. this is the number in the US 800-273-8255. Fortunately, you were born in a generation where failing is accepted and you should not deal with these feelings alone and in the US colleges have departments that will help you cope with your feelings.\n\nReach out to help as you are struggling alone and there tons of people who will help you.\n\nFailing is not the end of the world you can do this. You might fail this try in calculus but you will do better the second round around. Go ask for help learn to study better and you will do better in your college life.\n\nIf you wanna study together you can DM me I already passed calculus but I remember some parts of it and if not I can tell you how to understand the concept behind it.",

      "text": "Firstly, if you are having suicidal thoughts, you MUST seek therapeutic help. Things like this should not be dealt with alone; there are counselors on-campus who specialize on these cases.\n\nSecondly, there is no rule that you have to finish college in 4 years. You can take a gap year or you can take the easier classes and save this class for the following year. If you are struggling and getting less-than-average grades, there is no point in casting your line without any bait. \n\nAll in all, my advice is to consider dropping the course but coming back at it later, either in another quarter, semester, or year once you have a firm basis of calculus.",
