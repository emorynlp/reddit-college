  "title:": "How beneficial is it to graduate with honors?",
  "text": "Long story short, I barely missed the cutoff GPA to graduate with honors in my major and I\u2019ve been mentally suffering a lot over it ever since. It feels like I missed out on what could have been an extremely huge achievement that would\u2019ve made a massive difference to my career. Just constant overwhelming regret over what could have been.\n\nI plan on going to grad school soon, so maybe it\u2019s not that big of a deal, but I can\u2019t help but think that even after getting an MS this could come back to haunt me. Am I over-exaggerating the benefits of graduating with honors? And if not, how do I get over it / make up for this?",

      "text": "It really doesn't matter whatsoever.\n\nI graduated well short of honors for my undergrad whereas almost all of my current cohort graduated either magna or summa. I barely graduated high school.\n\nSuffice it to say, I am doing well in grad school right now. I took my high school performance as a wake up call to do better, and did. My grades in undergrad weren't bad by any means, just slightly above average, they are a lot better now. I felt a bit similar upon graduation, but what I did was to take that feeling as a challenge to do better in the next step of my journey instead of lamenting something that I can no longer change.",

      "text": "It's not as big of a deal as you are making it out to be. Two of my friends graduated with honors, and I didn't. I've had much more career success than they have. The way you make up for it is by getting experience that makes you interesting and unique. Also, if you get an MS, whether you graduated with honors or not will be moot. They'll look at your MS grades and the reputation of the program and institution from which you got it. You'll be fine! Good luck.",

      "text": "You\u2019re over thinking it! Honors don\u2019t make or break anything. You can have a perfectly strong graduate school application without this tiny special little designation,\n\nAlso, I think you mean Latin honors? Because you can get honors in a department by doing an honors thesis. And then there are honor societies like Phi Beta Kappa. Yeah none of these things will stop you from getting into a graduate program.\n\nFrom someone who sat on grad admissions panels: honestly, it\u2019s really weak letters of recommendation that do students in. That an mentioning red flags in your personal statement :-)",
