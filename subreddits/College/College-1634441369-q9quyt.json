  "text": "Hi! So I have general anxiety when it comes to socialization however I also thrive off of interaction with others which seems contradictory but I\u2019m just a naturally extroverted anxious person lol. So for someone like me who tends to be awkward with others but prefers to work with others, which class would be better? Which is easier in your opinion? Was it hard to ensure everyone did their part in group comm? What do you do in interpersonal comm? I\u2019m taking either during the winter, but only one. Which should I choose?",
