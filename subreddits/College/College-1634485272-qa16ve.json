  "text": "hi guys srry but I was wondering if anyone can give me tips on how to stay motivated for the rest of the semester. Midterms have passed, at least I think every one of my profs r diff so idk yet. \n\nI have a difficult time to get motivated but I managed to make it to the middle part of this semester. I\u2019m just starting to feel burnt out and discouraged. I commute everyday by train and bus so that\u2019s trash( learning how to drive) I really don\u2019t look forward to mondays or I just feel miserable in campus \n\nSrry I don\u2019t wanna give up, I wanna try and end this fall semester on a good standing \n\nSophomore btw",

Just put on some music and go by your studies on a daily basis. If you look ahead too much you'll feel anxiety and that only worsens it. Take each task at its own pace and you'll make it through. Don't worry.",

Just hang in there, friend.  \nI reside in the Indian sub-continent and I gotta say, it's no bueno how student rights here are abused. PhD professors can practically get away with murder here. They can insult your whole entire family to your face and you can't do a single thing about it. So, what I'm trying to say is, at least you've got professors who aren't utter and total shitheads.",
