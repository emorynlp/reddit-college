I\u2019ll admit, I got lazy over the past year and a half. Does anyone else think that it is harder now to get the same grades as before the corona. In highschool, before the pandemic I had a 97.7 gpa and now in college I feel like a 90 in a class is a victory. I think we got used to no consequences and easy grades for too long and now getting back is going to be hell.", "author": "ScaredQuote5263", "created": 1632236667, "retrieved": 1632800979, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdqta5m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pskl7o/anyone_else_feel_like_virtual_classes_made_life/hdqta5m/", "text": "Virtual Classes are easier to a point.

If I had to bet on it, I\u2019d say it mainly has to do with being a freshman and adjusting to the transition. In fact, this is the year that makes or breaks incoming students. Freshman either adjust to their new responsibilities or get left behind.  You have all the time in the world to be social and no teacher/ parent there to make sure you\u2019re keeping up with your workload. \n\nMy wife and would speak all the time about this while we were in college together. We would say to each other all the time, \u201chigh school did not prepare us for college.\u201d You\u2019re right, It was too easy. \n\nStay disciplined!! know that each time you get that A, that feeling of victory you get is 10x more satisfying than that A in high school. Celebrate when you do get it, but know that you are not the only one feeling like this.", "author": "Majestic-Spite-5455", "created": 1632237481, "upvotes": 1}}}
