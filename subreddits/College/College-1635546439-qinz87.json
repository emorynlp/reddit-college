      "text": "You can get it in California as a college student.\n\nThe real question is if you made enough wages to qualify and if you qualify under this specific quit/fire situation.\n\nYou have to qualify based on a firing or layoff event. You definitely won't qualify under the previous job because you quit it. You would probably qualify under the second job but only if they fired you without you doing something bad. Them re-thinking the hiring decision before you became an employee would not qualify you.",
