  "text": "Hi all,\n\nRecently I was hired for my \u201cdream\u201d job at a very competitive job as a Hospital 911 EMT in the city. I had to work a lot to get the job and have a mandatory job orientation tomorrow which means I need to miss 2 classes. So far I\u2019ve had perfect attendance and any missed were excused. The reason I am conflicted is that if I don\u2019t go to orientation I lose the job (it\u2019s the best EMS job you can get and has the best pay I\u2019ll ever get in undergrad tbh ($24.50/hr) so I don\u2019t want to give it up as well as I am super passionate about helping others. I emailed my professors out of curiosity to tell them I won\u2019t be in class cause of orientation. One Professor sent a harsh email stating I can\u2019t miss and need to tell my job I can\u2019t go. Issue is, this is a very different job from normal ones and since it\u2019s EMS, we do orientation at once; it\u2019s not like they walk you around rather they go over procedures, scope of practice, EMS laws exclusive to the city, operations etc that takes multiple hours and they can\u2019t cater it. After the email my professor sent, I felt kinda down and now am wondering if I should give up the job and go to class even though all the time I sacrificed applying to the job and dozens hours of government courses I had to take to apply. Should I still go to the orientation and miss class? Will it sour my relationship with my professors? \n\nThanks for reading",

This would mean doing what you need to do to get caught up on your own.\n\nGiven your situation, it sounds better to skip class for orientation and be sure not to miss any more classes. Your professor may not excuse the absence, but what is one absence and associated lost points compared to a great job opportunity that you\u2019ll lose if you don\u2019t go to orientation?",

      "text": "First you need to carefully read your syllabus and see what the professor already said about missing class. If they said that you will lose points then email them back and explain that you must miss for this job opportunity for your own financial well-being and you understand that you will lose the points, but you would appreciate an opportunity to earn them back if it is possible. \nMake him be the bad guy that says you need to lose points for the opportunity of a good job. Some professors are too full of themselves to admit that their class is not the most important thing in the world so just accept the outcome and do your best moving forward. If you hadn\u2019t told him and just made an excuse like being sick, he would have never been able to tell you that you can\u2019t miss. It sucks that professors power trip like this when given a chance. Just be nice about it and hope he will relish the chance to be benevolent.",
