I\u2019m planning on switching to a degree in biology, but I haven\u2019t dropped my nursing classes yet. I have to meet with the head of the bio department on Monday evening, but I have 2 nursing classes scheduled before that. Do I just let my professors know that I\u2019m planning on changing majors and won\u2019t be attending class that day? I talked to my advisor, and she said to wait to drop my classes until after I\u2019ve spoken with the head of the bio department and to go to my classes on Monday just in case I want to stay in nursing. At this point, my mind is made up about switching. Maybe someone else has been through something similar and can give me some advice?", "author": "NashvillePreds9", "created": 1632015579, "retrieved": 1632801518, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdeu1of": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqyvek/should_i_go_to_classes_for_a_major_that_im/hdeu1of/", "text": "Don\u2019t drop your classes until you have in writing that you have been enrolled in the new program and have expressed instructions to do so.
