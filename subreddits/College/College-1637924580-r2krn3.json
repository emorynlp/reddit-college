      "text": "I'm not familiar with the education system in the Netherlands, so I'm not sure whether \"Calculus 1\" refers to what Americans call \"Calculus 1\" or what some Europeans call \"Calculus\" (which is what Americans call \"Real Analysis\"). \n\nRegardless of which it is, in both cases a 50% fail rate is not uncommon in the US, particularly if it's taught to first semester freshman. Here in the US, many schools wait until students have been at the university for a year or two before they have students take Analysis and/or offer an intro to proofs course or intro analysis course beforehand, which cuts down fail rates significantly, but schools that don't do that have high fail rates.\n\nMeanwhile, if you're talking about what Americans call \"Calculus 1,\" it's almost always taken by freshman and fail rates are almost always high.\n\nSo, regardless of what you mean by \"Calculus 1,\" my answer is yes, high fail rates are pretty normal at most schools, at least in the US, in my experience.",
