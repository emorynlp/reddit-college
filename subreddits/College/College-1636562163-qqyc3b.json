It would be different if you just skipped the Zoom class and didn't look at the recordings, but you're still getting the content. \n\nThe only thing you'd have to adjust is not being able to digest the information at your own pace like you can a recorded lesson, but it shouldn't take long to get used to. You'll be fine.",

Even more than before, so I suggest you try to focus during classes to save time, and be as much present as u can. Good luck",
