I'm an arts major and I usually just take notes with a pen and paper and do my essays and coursework on my laptop.  Would getting an iPad make a difference? What are the pros and cons from your experiences?

I\u2019m a math and health science major and I find it pretty useful. I have a lot of rental ebooks though so that\u2019s where a lot of my use comes from. But it is super portable and I can get a few days worth of work out of it if I\u2019m being careful about the use. The pencil charges super quickly and I got the screen cover that makes it feel more like writing on paper. I use it to quickly write assignments or write my essays but I will retype them later on my computer. Digital notes are really nice and sync to my laptop and phone. Super easy note taking during class as some apps have features to write on powerpoints if you have access to them prior to coming to class. I love that it\u2019s lightweight\n\nHowever, you can\u2019t as easily \u201cflip to page x\u201d or go through your notes as quickly because it doesn\u2019t just all lay out in front of you. You will still use paper and pencil sometimes (like for math it can be easier with paper and pencil). some books aren\u2019t available as ebooks. Textbook notes can be hard if you have an ebook but take digital notes in a separate app. You\u2019ll still write your essays and submit your work from your laptop too.\n\nI bought my ipad when i wasn\u2019t in school and I\u2019ve found ways to use it. Overall, definitely worth it to me for school and I think you would find ways to use it in all areas of your life :)", "author": "shoelaceys7373", "created": 1632796043, "upvotes": 1}, "hei3z45": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwb005/is_getting_an_ipad_worth_it/hei3z45/", "text": "I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite.
