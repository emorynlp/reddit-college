I kind of knew this would happen, but ah well. goodbye world",

Traditionally, I only back things up at the end of the semester/year (depends on how depressing the semester is)...my Google Drive now feels very big (70+ GB) after five years (we have recorded lectures here). During semester backups have been incidental when I attach them in emails for the purposes of working on other computers. My original email account is now basically only used by me to send attachments of work to. It's possible I have sent these emails at the end of a day's work before but I can't recall.\n\nThis last semester I did have some trouble as I was using a data stick due to doing a lot of work in a wifi free environment on the computer. As a result, for a few weeks I wasn't sending my emails as usual in all circumstance because, hey, I had the data stick. Some of the files got corrupted and turned into y's. This was fun as one such file was an assignment due that same day (in the end, I just didn't do the last question... it was fortuitously the sort of assignment which isn't massively time consuming). \n\n",
