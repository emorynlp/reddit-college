  "text": "I had a group lab report due yesterday and I didn\u2019t exactly pull my weight. Out of the 5 sections I only did 1, and it was an easy one at that. I would\u2019ve done more but I didn\u2019t really understand the lab at all. \n\nI am getting a vibe from my lab partners that they\u2019re annoyed with me. Additionally, the TA that runs our lab section and said she noticed the work wasn\u2019t evenly spread amongst the group (there\u2019s a section of the report where you write which parts you did). \n\nI feel bad for being a shitty lab partner, and wanna know how to best make up for slacking. We have another report due next week, and I\u2019ve considered doing the whole thing and telling them they can put there names on some of the parts to make it even. Would that be weird?",

      "text": "Group work is such a bitch, definitely the worst part of lab courses imo. I would just be honest with your partners. Apologize for not pulling your load on the last report and offer to pick up any extra work that needs to be done on your next one. If you start offering to do the whole thing they might take advantage of that (hopefully they\u2019re not that shitty of people tho). And if you aren\u2019t understanding the content in the labs, talk to your TA or lab group to see if they can help you. Nobody\u2019s perfect, so acknowledge your mistake and focus on doing what you can (within reason pls don\u2019t waste all your time on this lab) to improve your understanding of concepts and contribution to the reports. And don\u2019t worry too much if your lab partners seem irritated with you, all you gotta do is survive this course with them and you\u2019ll (hopefully) never have to deal with them again",
