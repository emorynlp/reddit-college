You can reduce that by placing your laptop on a stand so the screen is ~eye level. That also means you'll need a separate keyboard and mouse though, and at that point you may as well get a second monitor to put alongside.\n\n2. You can't fit very much on a small laptop screen, and if you try to make things smaller, you'll be straining your eyes. A second screen means you have more space.

It's easier to set up a work/play divide. I use my second screen *only* for work and even have a different desktop background for it.\n\n4.
