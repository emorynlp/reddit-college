  "text": "does anyone else find that they have trouble taking notes now that classes are in person again? I got so used to just watching video lectures over the last year that I've found that I have to train myself to take notes in class basically from scratch, like my notes are completely pathetic this semester and I'm finding that I have to read my textbooks more and more just to keep up",

      "text": "Personally I\u2019ve never taken notes in class, I always find reading the textbook helps way more. I read the textbook and take notes on my own pace before class. Then, when I go to class, I pay attention to the professor and solidify the knowledge I already got from the book. Obviously everyone learns differently and I know a lot of people hate the textbooks, that\u2019s just the method that works for me.",
