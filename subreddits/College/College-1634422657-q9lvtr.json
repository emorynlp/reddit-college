  "text": "I live like 40 mins away from home, and so far I've been going home every 3 weeks for the weekends. If it were up to me, I'd go home every weekend.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love college. My classes are great. I love the library. It's just I'm an only child and sharing a space with someone 24/7 is killing me. Plus the library is closed on the weekends, and I don't have anything to do. Plus my dog is getting old, and i wanna spend time with her.\n\nIt's just my parents \"have lives now\" (their words) and can't always have me home every weekend.\n\nAlso, would it be weird to have my dorm room door open when I'm studying or whatever? Everyone on my floor is super extraverted, but I'm not and don't know many people.",

      "text": "I find it odd that you aren\u2019t welcome to go home whenever you want. I never chose to move into the dorms, but I\u2019m pretty sure if I did my parents would still let me keep my key to the house and have my bedroom and I could just come and go whenever I wanted. Living in a dorm isn\u2019t exactly the same thing as moving out. You still need a place to stay in between semesters. In my opinion there is no such thing as coming home too often, but if your parents aren\u2019t letting you than that\u2019s out of your control. Also, yes you can leave your dorm door open. I\u2019ve seen lots of people on here say they do that to make it easier to meet people.",
