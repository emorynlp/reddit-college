Before I left, I made sure this wouldn't hurt my scholarship because it was for a disability related reason. When I returned I had special permission to take less classes and still be considered full time status to get the benefits of a full time student and also specifically so my scholarship would require less credits per semester to be completed. Well, the next semester began and I lost my scholarship. They told me that having less credits required for disability reasons does actually hurt my scholarship and that they had no clue who told me that, and said to appeal it. I went through the appeal process, filling out forms and writing an essay and getting a doctor's note, and it was approved! For a week. The scholarship committee emailed me a week later saying they made a mistake and it wasn't approved after all because I took time off the previous semester. I fucking hate universities and I cannot wait to graduate and move on from this stage of life. Fuck you, Stephanie, you wasted my time and now I'm paying for stuff out of pocket.",

If I had done a traditional 10k school semester I would\u2019ve owed like 3k and been fucked :/ best case is probably to finish each semester and plan a gap semester instead of dropping partway, I think that prevents a lot of consequences.  At least at my school, they\u2019re really good with non traditional students",

Working on your mental state requires full devotion, no jobs no stress just focusing on changing your behaviors.  This is called DBT therapy and it\u2019s developed for people with BPD but works for everyone to help understand your struggles and how to solve them basically.  That is worthwhile of a break in my opinion\n\nOther than that do some freelancing/independent projects or learning related to your career goals and no one will question the value of your break",

Im glad the semester is over but I did myself a disservice by pushing through, it was a rough semester.\n\nI ended up going because this is my second round trying to get my bachelor's and I didn't want to fall into the pattern in the first paragraph above. I know way too many people who didn't finish their degree because of one thing or another and they never went back and that's a huge regret of theirs.\n\nI agree with you 100%, but there is a risk involved.",
