I am a 20yo currently about to start my junior year of college. My work load is very low, and I work a full time job to pay rent, save, pay school payments, etc. I have a dog back at home (4 hours from my college) and I often get upset that my family doesn\u2019t seem to be taking care of him the way he should be. He\u2019s a small yorkie, and actually doesn\u2019t have too much energy, but they lock him in his cage most of the day and don\u2019t actually play with him or take him on walks. I live in a pet-friendly apartment, so my boyfriend suggested me bringing my yorkie here. I\u2019ve made plans to get him from home at the end of the month, but the nerves are definitely starting to kick in.\n\nI\u2019m extremely anxious about this. I do work Monday-Friday and have a boyfriend and social life that I enjoy, so it definitely overwhelms me a little thinking of how to maintain everything and adding my dog into the mix. My boyfriend lives at a different complex, but reassured me that he\u2019d be more than willing to help and that our close friends would pitch in if I ever needed it. I guess I\u2019m just asking if anyone has brought their dog to college and regretted it?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: thanks everyone for being so kind and helpful! (: I know I\u2019m anxious for a reason and I know I have genuine concerns. BUT it\u2019s very clear to me that I have no other choice than to bring my little buddy!", "author": "vividbrew", "created": 1596713081, "retrieved": 1632802586, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 799, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g0madze": {"link": "/r/college/comments/i4q0u4/did_you_bring_a_dog_to_college_and_regret_it/g0madze/", "text": "do you have roommates? be mindful of them. they may say it\u2019s fine out of not waning to stir the pot. also don\u2019t expect them to take care of the dog if you do", "author": "iphone69plus", "created": 1596756155, "upvotes": 1}, "g0m6dv5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/i4q0u4/did_you_bring_a_dog_to_college_and_regret_it/g0m6dv5/", "text": "I had to re-home my dog a few months ago because he just didn't adjust well. It wasn't fair to him. He was a high energy breed, I wasn't home as often as I used to be. I ended up rehoming him with a great rescue. Last I heard he was training to be a drug dog or a k9. \n\nI definitely regretted bringing him, but no one else would have been able to take care of him for me if I left him at home. I'm just happy he's getting the attention and time he needs and deserves.  \n\nYour dog is small and if he isn't super high energy like you said, I think he will adjust well. If you have people willing to give him company and take care of him while you're not home, totally take them up on the offer. I think you'll be fine as long as you're able to walk your dog a couple times a day and spend time with him. Little dogs usually adjust better to the apartment/college lifestyle.\n\nIf you're worried maybe look into getting one of those treat dispensers that has a two-way camera. That way you can say hi to him between classes and toss him a treat.
