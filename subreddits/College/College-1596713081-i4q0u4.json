  "title:": "Did you bring a dog to college and regret it?",
  "text": "Hi! I am a 20yo currently about to start my junior year of college. My work load is very low, and I work a full time job to pay rent, save, pay school payments, etc. I have a dog back at home (4 hours from my college) and I often get upset that my family doesn\u2019t seem to be taking care of him the way he should be. He\u2019s a small yorkie, and actually doesn\u2019t have too much energy, but they lock him in his cage most of the day and don\u2019t actually play with him or take him on walks. I live in a pet-friendly apartment, so my boyfriend suggested me bringing my yorkie here. I\u2019ve made plans to get him from home at the end of the month, but the nerves are definitely starting to kick in.\n\nI\u2019m extremely anxious about this. I do work Monday-Friday and have a boyfriend and social life that I enjoy, so it definitely overwhelms me a little thinking of how to maintain everything and adding my dog into the mix. My boyfriend lives at a different complex, but reassured me that he\u2019d be more than willing to help and that our close friends would pitch in if I ever needed it. I guess I\u2019m just asking if anyone has brought their dog to college and regretted it?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: thanks everyone for being so kind and helpful! (: I know I\u2019m anxious for a reason and I know I have genuine concerns. BUT it\u2019s very clear to me that I have no other choice than to bring my little buddy!",

      "text": "I had to re-home my dog a few months ago because he just didn't adjust well. It wasn't fair to him. He was a high energy breed, I wasn't home as often as I used to be. I ended up rehoming him with a great rescue. Last I heard he was training to be a drug dog or a k9. \n\nI definitely regretted bringing him, but no one else would have been able to take care of him for me if I left him at home. I'm just happy he's getting the attention and time he needs and deserves.  \n\nYour dog is small and if he isn't super high energy like you said, I think he will adjust well. If you have people willing to give him company and take care of him while you're not home, totally take them up on the offer. I think you'll be fine as long as you're able to walk your dog a couple times a day and spend time with him. Little dogs usually adjust better to the apartment/college lifestyle.\n\nIf you're worried maybe look into getting one of those treat dispensers that has a two-way camera. That way you can say hi to him between classes and toss him a treat. I think with your situation you will benefit from taking your dog with you and your dog will benefit too.",

I would come over and help take care of her when I could, but the distance and college/job made it difficult to go over there every day. He left her in the garage every day until she pooped in there. There was a piles of shoveled out poop when I went back. She was skinnier and more lethargic. She just looked so sad. I wish I had noticed and gotten there sooner, but I did finally bring her back when I realized he was letting her shit herself. If you feel your dog is being neglected, Take her with you.",

You seem to be doing much better than I financially, so I would suggest keeping a few hundred dollars aside in case anything happens. My first semester of college, a few weeks in, my cat had to have surgery for pyometra which cost me about $700 in the end, but they only needed $250 up front. She also needed dental work for gingivitis at a later point, it was also $250. You don't need anything crazy like $1000, but keeping something may ease your mind. Otherwise, I moved her across the country with me twice and she seems to be happy and healthy. I would definitely go for it, I couldn't leave her behind either.",

Sometimes I\u2019d be out with friends or studying and realize that I had to go back to my dorm because I had to walk my dog.  He was anxious and barky, resulting in noise complaints from other students which I felt horrible about.  The weeks that I didn\u2019t have him were freeing because I could spend hours and days outside of the dorm without having to go back to walk him every few hours.  Ultimately, college is one of the only times that you have complete independence, and by having a dog I lost some of that independence.  But, it was definitely worth a try and helped me get used to college.  It\u2019s also good that you have people that can help out.  Not trying to discourage you, because it seems like a great option for you, but personally it didn\u2019t work out.",

She's just an inherently social dog and it was hard for her to live alone with me in an apartment where I had to be gone a lot of the time. Not great for a young dog to have to spend lots of time by themselves. He's retired and she got on better with more people around and a yard to run around in.\n\nIf you won't be on your own, you think you can handle it, and the dog won't be happy at home, bring him.",
