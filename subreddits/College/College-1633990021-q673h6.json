  "text": "Everything time I try to eat I can\u2019t because everything has over an hour wait. The bus is short staffed and it\u2019s always full. All my classes are a 20+ minute walk from my dorm. I can\u2019t get privacy anywhere because all the quiet rooms are full. I can\u2019t find a place to study because every seat is always taken. I have to wait for the shower because it\u2019s always full and they take forever. And it doesn\u2019t help that my roommate never leaves the room. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve had the room alone",

      "text": "Yeah, currently dealing with a professor who literally doesn\u2019t teach. Just tells us \u201cWatch the video from last Fall!\u201d then uses the entire lecture period to tell us to watch the videos from the Fall. Thing is, the videos are recorded and in them he tells us to watch the videos from the Spring semester before that prior Fall semester. The standard deviation for the quizzes show everyone getting 55% on average, while the highest would be between 70-75 with only one student. Luckily I get good homework scores, because this class is a waste of my damn money.",
