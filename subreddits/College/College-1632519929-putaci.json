So this is my third year of college (technically a sophomore because I have less than 60 credit hours), and I've decided that I want to change majors. I currently study computer science and I absolutely loathe it now. Maybe it's the fact that I work 60 hour weeks, pay bills and have so much going on, but I hate coding and now I don't want anything to do with it. I have no motivation for it. I'm really interesting in linguistics (according to Oxford:  the scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of morphology, syntax, phonetics, and semantics). It doesn't seem to be a popular degree, so I was wondering if there was a similar name/study that is more common? I would like to learn multiple languages and be able to be a translator, or possibly teach English in another country. I love traveling, so anything going hand to hand with that would make me happy.
