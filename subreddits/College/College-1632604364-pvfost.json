My dream is to become a professional football/soccer player, although I play at a quite low level I consider myself good and train very hard. So college already started here and I need to apply for a bachelor asap. Should I take the risk to choose something that can benefit me during I play football and hope that I will become professional within 3 years? Or should I choose job wise? Thank you for your advice in advance.", "author": "magwazaaa", "created": 1632604364, "retrieved": 1632800306, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "comments": {"heborop": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvfost/i_need_some_college_advice/heborop/", "text": "Choose job wise, even if you aren't going to do job right out of college.

If you can train hard on basketball it doesn't really matter if your average today as long as your serious meaning you train like it's your job. College is just like basketball except you don't have to work you arms and legs as much and instead you use your brain more while on a computer. I'm in college and basically considering everything I have the same chances going into being a basketball player as in college.

I'm going to start with the bad news, but it does get around to good news in the end.  To begin, in college you need to concentrate on a non-playing career.\n\nMillions of people can perform the same actions as professional athletes.  There are only a relative handful of people in the world, however, who can perform those actions as fast as the pros can.  Professional athletes are among the fastest and quickest people on the planet.  Only those with blazing speed and lightning reflexes can make a career as professional athletes.  Unless you have that kind of speed and reflexes now, your chances of a career as a player are very low.  Speed can be honed and sharpened, but not created, by training.\n\nIn Europe, the career path for a professional footballer is to get a trial with a professional team.  If you pass the trial, you will be admitted to the team's organization.  If you are playing at a low level now, you most likely will not be able to pass a trial.  Generally, only the best players on elite youth teams have a decent chance.  \n\nFor the good news, none of that means you should give up on football (or any other sport you might like). You can keep your sports enjoyment going as a hobby.  I played in the local adult amateur league for a time, and I coached and refereed in the youth leagues for years.  Don't allow not making it as a pro to taint your enthusiasm for sports.", "author": "taxref", "created": 1632619978, "upvotes": 3}}}
