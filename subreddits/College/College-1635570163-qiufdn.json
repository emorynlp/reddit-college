  "title:": "People in college who cut off/dropped their hs friends, why, how, and do you ever regret this decision?",
  "text": "I feel like I\u2019ve seen a huge mix of opinions from people who keep in contact and people who dropped all their old hs friends. So this question is for people who have dropped friends \n1. Why did u choose to drop them?\n2. What exactly did u do to cut them off?\n3. Do you ever look back and regret it or are 100% happy with it?\n4. Did the old friends ever notice or call u out on it or cut u off back?\n5. Are your college friends better/more genuine than the hs ones?\n6. What advice would you give someone who can\u2019t decide to drop their old friends or not?\n7. Do you think dropping old friends makes you more mature or opens up new friends?\nFeel free to add more info!",
