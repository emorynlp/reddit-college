  "text": "Recently, I have been feeling pretty lonely lately.  I only have like two real friends on campus since freshman year.  Due to Covid, we weren't able to room with each other and my friends and I were separated.  We still would hang out but only to get lunch or dinner at the dining hall, that's it.  Lately, it seems as if my friends have been having more fun with their new suitemates and going off to parties without me.  I kinda feel dissed and left out of the picture.  I'm happy they are enjoying their college experience but it feels like I'm being forgotten.  Any tips",
