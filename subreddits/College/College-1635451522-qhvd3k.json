  "title:": "Broke a leg, can't attend classes, can't get a respond fron professors",
  "text": "I broke my leg (on the university-stairs, funnily) last Tuesday (19th of October) and spent a day in the ER having it plastered. Since then I ve been panick e-mailing my teachers (have 6 of them this semester) for a chance to attend their classes online. 3 of them responded instantly granting me a chance to go online. 2 of them havent responded to 3 e-mails each. I could arrange exams from one seminar without attending the class but the last 2 teacher's case remained a mistery. \nThey don't respond to e-mails that they admitted to attending students to have seen and only say there is no way for them to give hybrid classes (online to me and in-person to everyone else). Which is ridiculous since they have been doing that for 2 fucken years now. \n What can I do about those 2 teachers who don't reply and are apparently unreachable on phone too? Those classes are also seminars which I am gonna fail without them consenting to online learning. Are there any steps im general I can take? Or would going above the teachers head probably make me fail those courses out of professor-ego anyway after this dust have settled?",

Depending on how badly your leg is broken they may just ask if you can get crutches.",

What did you use to email them? And did you follow the guidelines with emailing professors? Some professors really will not even open the emails if the subject line isn\u2019t written appropriately (how they want it written like SUBJECT-# QUESTION NAME).",
