  "title:": "Broke a leg, can't attend classes, can't get a respond fron professors",
  "text": "I broke my leg (on the university-stairs, funnily) last Tuesday (19th of October) and spent a day in the ER having it plastered. Since then I ve been panick e-mailing my teachers (have 6 of them this semester) for a chance to attend their classes online. 3 of them responded instantly granting me a chance to go online. 2 of them havent responded to 3 e-mails each. I could arrange exams from one seminar without attending the class but the last 2 teacher's case remained a mistery. \nThey don't respond to e-mails that they admitted to attending students to have seen and only say there is no way for them to give hybrid classes (online to me and in-person to everyone else). Which is ridiculous since they have been doing that for 2 fucken years now. \n What can I do about those 2 teachers who don't reply and are apparently unreachable on phone too? Those classes are also seminars which I am gonna fail without them consenting to online learning. Are there any steps im general I can take? Or would going above the teachers head probably make me fail those courses out of professor-ego anyway after this dust have settled?",

I know at my uni all the online equipment was trashed. Profs aren't working with the same equipment they had the past 2 years and if they want to it would come out if their pocket. Depending on how badly your leg is broken they may just ask if you can get crutches.",

It\u2019s one thing to do that in an emergency year like last year, but another to do it for a single student. And with no advance warning to set up the needed equipment.
