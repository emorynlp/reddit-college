  "text": "I am currently a freshman in my first semester at college and am majoring in business currently with a minor in administration and management. I have found business far less interesting than I thought it would be and have started looking at other majors.\n\nI am pretty average at mathematics but am really good with logical thinking and problem solving, and computers have always interested me. I just want to know how difficult computer science is if I were to switch and how math intensive it is.",

I got As in all my math courses and I barely, barely, barely got a B in this one (was almost a C) by the absolute skin of my teeth because I managed to do well on the final. So if math is actually hard for you or if you're the kind of person to have a catastrophic meltdown if you get anything less than an A, you're going to be miserable in the major. Don't confuse it with being unable to do it though.\n\nThe algorithms class is also heavily math and logic based.\n\nComputer Science is essentially a math degree that teaches you programming. If there is a Computer Programming or a Software Development degree at your school, you'll probably be happier with that one.",

Computer Science itself is very broad, so if your school offers a specialization of CS that requires fewer math courses then that may be a better fit.",
