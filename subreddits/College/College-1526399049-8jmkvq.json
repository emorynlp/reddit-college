I bet if they checked the cameras they\u2019d see me walking to his office, as I remember the day and time I was there. \n\nI emailed him back saying I was there and handed it to him personally. And followed up with an attachment of my exam. Honestly this is why all professors should utilize online submission \ud83d\ude44\n\nThe only conclusive thing is that he had to have lost my final exam. Im totally fuming!

That would be easier than an appeal.\n\nSecond, if you have to appeal, have your story straight. What would be really good is if you have a time stamp that shows your last edit. You might also go ahead and ask campus security if they have video footage of that day/time, and if so, request they freeze it. Many times, they recycle after a specific time period, so make the call/visit today.\n\nThird, be prepared to compromise. If you have NO proof other than your academic record, there is a chance that the best you can get is an offer to retake a new final exam. You need to psychologically prepare yourself for this.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019ve fudged your facts here (you\u2019re not a great student or you didn\u2019t turn in the exam), you\u2019re not going to have a good time.
