{"sid": "n8nvia", "link": "/r/college/comments/n8nvia/we_made_it/", "title:": "We Made It", "text": "Ive been on this subreddit quite a bit and ive noticed that a lot of us as students have been in a dark place, overwhelmed, burdened, anxious, and feeling alone with school and covid. We feel robbed of the experience that college is, we dont have the same memories we had a year ago, and for those of you who are freshman you didnt get the freshman year you deserved. Im writing and posting this to say, you've made it. You've beat the odds and finished out this semester. Seeing how many people feel alone in what they face has made me sad for our generation of students who are currently attending. You are not alone in the way you feel about school, life, your experiences, graduation, freshman year, classes, credits, or anything else. We are all in this together. I know at times it can feel like you want to give up and give in, trust me ive been there more times this year than any other, but you have to keep pushing on. Things will change, the college experience will return to normal, and life will seem happy once again. I dont know who needs to hear this as finals are either approaching, currently being given, or are over but you are loved and you will make it through. Take some time off, give yourself a breather after that last final, and realize that you were able to overcome everything this last year has thrown at you.", "author": "zachisaslut", "created": 1620595176, "retrieved": 1632947854, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 745, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gxm9w2x": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n8nvia/we_made_it/gxm9w2x/", "text": "Holdup, I still have five more weeks.
