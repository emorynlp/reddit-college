  "text": "Hey, so I'm no sure if I'm at the right place to post this but, here it is:\n\nI am considering switching to digital note-taking for what's left of college and then university.  I was looking for tablets w/stylus pen more specifically.\n\nI don't know which ecosystem would be best (win, iOS, andro).  I have to admit I tend to steer away from Apple products, and have always advocated for free software, open-source, and privacy centered systems.\n\nHowever, since the purpose of the purchase would be strictly for studying productivity.  I am looking for the most important thing; \n  \nSoftware Optimization\n  Smoothness of Operations\n  Flexibility & Compatibility\n  Readiness & Reliability\n  Comfort of use... I don't wanna fight against bad optimizations and rage quit my tablet throughout the window.\n\nOpen to any brand at this point.\n\nLooking to use zoom, pdfs, OneNote(or whatever else for note-taking), kindle, being able to capture or scan stuff to take notes on top afterwards.  Ideally I don't have to pay for every single apps I wish to use/try.\n\nWhat devices would be best according to your experiences ? (Not according to opinions or physical aesthetic of the casing)\n\nThanks",

          "text": "So no problem with palm rejection, app optimization related to screen resolution ? \nI read from other posts that display looks good with Samsung apps and some 3rd parties apps, but when dealing with eg: Microsoft office apps, optimization for palm rejection goes out the window, or the overall size of the app edges makes it suddenly unpleasant to work with. (Almost like a bulky/enlarged zoom of the windows, leaving less to see and work with).\n\nIs that a fact ?",

              "text": "I suspect the Surface is cheaper than an iPad, and it\u2019s a full computer while the iPad technically is more like a phone in its operation. So there are definitely arguments to be made that the Surface is better than an iPad. I\u2019ve had iPads for years though, it\u2019s just mine was too old to be comparatively with any of the Apple Pencils, so when I decided I needed a tablet, I went with a newer model of iPad. \n\nI recommend in addition to advice here, you also look up reviews of tablet devices, and then go to a Best Buy or somewhere else you can try each one you\u2019re considering. Hold them in their different configurations if they have them, write with the stylus, write with your finger, feel the weight (for carrying it around all day), see the physical size, check out the program functionality. And of course price shop (don\u2019t forget to get the educational discount if shopping online from the Apple or MS stores, or compare at your college bookstore).",

                  "text": "Right ! That's good thinking, thanks ! I probably do have a discount somewhere \ud83d\ude1b.\n\nAnd your right apple isn't a typical computer per-say.\n\nHowever, even windows machine gets released more and more with what we call low-powered cpu (ARM), which are based of architecture very close to those of cellphones. \nAnd those type of device are getting better and better at running heavy tasks. \nSo capabilities are not much of a concern at this point in time.  \nIt's all about software optimization, and Microsoft are far behind even though windows gets better and better... There are still frequent bugs.  No matter what the hardware.\n\nAlso.. yeah windows machine are generally more power-hungry, so a Surface Pros are likely to run anything... \n\n2 downsides comes with them: power-hungry = not much battery time (regardless of the mAh they put in them)\nAlso, it's Windows... Meaning high risk to encounter bugs at some point, especially when they rollout system updates...\n\nBut when you need it to work right now, and a simple patch from MS mess it all up in the middle of a busy week.. that's not the machine you wanna have purchased.. \ud83d\ude15\n\nI thought about the Surface Pros, but I ended up deciding to avoid taking that chance.",

If you have a MacBook however, I think it can be edited since GoodNotes has the Mac application, but you would have to save it in GoodNotes format. \n\nOtherwise, you save your notes as a pdf document and can only view and not edit (as in, cut, paste, delete or type) your handwritten notes when you open the document on another device other than your iPad.\n\nI'm not too sure where the topic of browsers came into this conversation, but you can definitely use other browsers on the iPad. \n\nI hope that's not too confusing, since I'm not too great at explaining things. You could also check out r/iPad or r/GoodNotes if you have more questions about the device capabilities or the features of the app itself. Most questions I had before buying my iPad had pretty much already been answered on those subs.",
