  "title:": "Welp y\u2019all, I missed the deadline to turn in my final project and final exams for a class. Should I email the professor asking for forgiveness?",
  "text": "Last semester, I took 24 units + 3 in the summer, and I am taking 8 classes this semester and I work 40 hours a week, and my physical health is in shambles. I had 8 midterms, 4 final exams, and 6 projects this week, so needless to say, I absolutely want to die. I was trying to do finish everything in this class last night, but gave up because I was spending 3 hours throwing up in the toilet (I have really bad health so this is normal for me). I missed the deadlines last night. The professor sent out an announcement that yesterday is the last day to turn in any work. But the class isn\u2019t officially over until Sunday\u2026I think she wants to get grading done, but she is a very lenient professor who always accepts late work. Should I try to email her begging for forgiveness to try to get any points at least? I will still have a C in the class, but I\u2019m typically a straight A student so it just hurts me spiritually",

      "text": "Yes, email her. Try to get those points. \n\nBut in the future, realize that your mental health IS important and you are jeopardizing it by taking an absolutely insane class load AND working 40 hours a week. Most colleges won't even let you take that many classes without special permission. You are taking on three full time jobs and that is not sane for any person to do. \n\nYou also said that you generally have bad health, but I'm wondering if it's caused by all this stress you're putting on yourself. Please, please take this as a lesson to be a little easier on yourself. Give yourself some time. College isn't a race. Life isn't a race. You're going to be okay.",
