  "text": "As the title reads, I'm Hispanic and I'm a part of the SHPE (engineering major) chapter at my uni. I grew up in the hood lol so k-12th was about 50-50 black and Hispanic students. It's the environment I'm most comfortable with, and the SHPE president at my uni even encourages me to join but I'm not sure. Would it be frowned upon to join NSBE if I'm not black?",
