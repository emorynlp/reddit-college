I\u2019m not blaming anyone for there being a lack of diversity on campus but I grew up in a decent sized city close to the small town where my college is located and was raised in public school around people from many different backgrounds. I went to an elementary school next door to an apartment complex for first-generation immigrants, so all my life I\u2019ve been around people of different colors, religions, and financial backgrounds. Here it feels like everyone\u2019s a clone of each other. And I can\u2019t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus. I do volunteer work for an organization that largely serves underprivileged kids and families who tend to live in ethnic or largely African-American neighborhoods so I\u2019ll have a chance to be in that atmosphere at times, but I just feel uncomfortable and swarmed by people who are exactly alike here.
