  "text": "I\u2019m an 18 year old white guy and just moved into college. I\u2019m going to a private school in the south that\u2019s largely composed of rich white people, so the culture here is obviously a certain way. I\u2019m not blaming anyone for there being a lack of diversity on campus but I grew up in a decent sized city close to the small town where my college is located and was raised in public school around people from many different backgrounds. I went to an elementary school next door to an apartment complex for first-generation immigrants, so all my life I\u2019ve been around people of different colors, religions, and financial backgrounds. Here it feels like everyone\u2019s a clone of each other. And I can\u2019t help but compare myself to other people. I miss the diversity of my middle and high school campus. I do volunteer work for an organization that largely serves underprivileged kids and families who tend to live in ethnic or largely African-American neighborhoods so I\u2019ll have a chance to be in that atmosphere at times, but I just feel uncomfortable and swarmed by people who are exactly alike here. Is there anything else I can get involved in to make me feel like there\u2019s other things in the world than fraternities and Patagonia? I want to come back to earth a little bit.",

In high school I could probably count the number of other white students on my hands, as the school was >90% latino. I went to a local community college after that and it was the same scenario, and every one I talked to was...the exact same. I could never relate with anyone and was generally unhappy. I transferred later to a different state and now my new university is majority white and I finally feel more comfortable and like I have a place where I belong.",

It's really amazing though that you are able to appreciate that kind of diversity since, I'm sure, many of your peers and other students had never even experiences such diversity. I actually went to a super bubbled up, private, religious school for K-8 and then a public high school. It was amazing how much I learned and how much I was able to change my thoughts and ideologies as well as myself. I can't say that for the other students in the k-8 school since they continued their private school education. I often found it somewhat hard to talk to them since they didn't really understand the \"real world\".",

I think I had an issue more so in catching up with the norms to the people that haven\u2019t had to struggle with money for most of their life-not that that\u2019s a bad thing (struggling shouldn\u2019t be something inherent). I ended up transferring to another school in the south which is still a liberal arts private college but I can already tell from the vibe that I\u2019ll enjoy much more (it\u2019s very racially diverse). However, transferring shouldn\u2019t be a default action. What I learned at my old school is that there are people that feel the same way you do, they\u2019re just lost in that crowd of \u201cwhite\u201d that you\u2019re describing. You\u2019ll find them!",

Some of it was just a draw of luck with who I ended up near in my classes and stuff, though. \n\nOtherwise, I'd just give yourself time to make peace with your new living situation. College is some degree of a culture shock for most people in one way or another, although there are different degrees. I'm not saying that you need to start acting exactly like the white people you're seeing now, but you'll come into your own kind of role with and feel at home at college in time.",

Especially in a white dominated state. I know they mean the best but I also understand that unsettling feeling you are talking about. Idk its just Asian friends will just click culturally. Just like white people will have their own culture.\n\nThe biggest culture shock to me was when I went inside a friend's house and took my shoes off he asked me what i'm doing. And I see him walking around his house with his shoes on. I had to explain myself but it was a good laugh. Stay strong dude you aren't the only one feeling like that!",

That doesn't mean that every person of that race is within that culture, or that no person outside of that race is part of that culture. For example, I'm sure loads of white people identify with African American culture, and there are loads of African Americans who don't. That doesn't make it not African American culture just because there are exceptions.\n\nAlso I love how you're equating acknowledging the fact that certain cultures are tied to certain racial groups and wanting to segregate all races. No. Cultures can mix and spread and collide, and that's good. Nobody on this planet exists in exclusively one culture. But that doesn't mean that certain groups can't have spaces where they can express their identity among those with the same identity.",
