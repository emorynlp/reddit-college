  "text": "Anyone experience jury duty as a student? It is scheduled for a day in the week of Thanksgiving break, so it wouldn't interfere with school. I would love to be picked. However, I have a 1 year old daughter and a husband that works shifts opposite my school schedule, and we don't have childcare if I do get picked.\n\nHow was your experience with jury selection and/or jury duty as a student? I'm in Pennsylvania if it makes a difference.",

They will almost always let you reschedule for the summer.\n\nAlso make it clear that you dont have anyone to watch your daughter.",

      "text": "I\u2019m technically a resident of WV, but I live in PA over the summer. I had gotten summoned for the summer term, but told them I wasn\u2019t currently in WV as I was living with my parents for a time. However, I said I was close enough to commute if I was needed. I also put that I would be in school for the end of the term. They had me email my schedule to them and I never heard anything back after that. I was shocked I didn\u2019t get anything else, but also relieved I wouldn\u2019t have to make the commute or worry about catching up in my classes. The lady I communicated over email with seemed pretty understanding and I got the feeling they were a little more lenient with college students. I could be wrong though. However, I was also a little excited to be picked.",
