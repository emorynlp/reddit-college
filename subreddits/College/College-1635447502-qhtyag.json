  "text": "I've applied to a few different schools for wildlife sciences / management already. I've already changed paths a couple times but this field really seems like something I'd be happy with long term. At least from everything I can read online it seems like an interesting field, but I wanted to see if anyone here had anything to say about it. \n\nFor anyone who is actively enrolled or has already completed a degree in wildlife sciences / management, what did you like and dislike about it?",

      "text": "I\u2019m just about ready to finish up my degree in conservation. Mine is a little unique as it\u2019s a mix between conservation and zoology. There are a lot of things I\u2019ve enjoyed about it. But if you do go that route, I highly suggest getting involved in research if that\u2019s something you are interested in. Something I regret not doing earlier is asking my professors about research opportunities. I wasn\u2019t aware of all the different things I could get involved in until my junior year when I started working with graduate students on their own projects. We went out and collected data on snails(I know, doesn\u2019t seem that fun but it actually kinda was lol). There are some trade offs to this though that I\u2019ve noticed. If you pick a school that likes to focus on research, then be ready to have inattentive professors. This is obviously not true for all, but my school has some professors that are almost never available due to them being out in the field or in their office writing papers. Also, really consider what jobs you would be looking to get out of this. I was gonna go for zookeeping, but after interning at a zoo vs. doing field research, I realized I\u2019d rather be out in the woods collecting things. I\u2019m currently looking at getting my masters in secondary education and applying to work as a Park Ranger. \n\nAlso, figure out whether you are actually willing to endure all the science that goes along with that kind of major. I don\u2019t know about other schools, but mine goes really REALLY hard when it comes to just about all of my core science classes. Take a good long look at the curriculum for each of the schools you are considering and determine whether it\u2019s right for you. Some may focus more on fisheries or local wildlife. Others(like mine) really get into it all and cover species from all over the world while putting a lot of focus on the smaller, less recognized animals. So I\u2019d just consider what you would really like to focus on and do a good bit of research on the school. Check ratemyprofessor. Also, ask about the passing rate of the major. Mine is 10% and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people come and go out of this place. Fortunately, I don\u2019t believe that is a common thing, but I go to a small school where things like that can occur. That\u2019s a whole other thing too. I honestly think I would\u2019ve thrived at a bigger school. Having so few professors with very few options to take a class elsewhere or at a different time made things difficult. You also wanna form good relationships with those professors cause they may end up teaching multiple of your classes and writing your recommendation letters. So get those connections while you\u2019re at it. \n\nOverall, it can be a fun major. It can be extremely stressful at times, but if it\u2019s something you need to do to get the career you want, then go for it.",

I'm transferring with two years of credits already accumulated so I'm hoping most of the core sciences will get more specialized and interesting from here on out :)",
