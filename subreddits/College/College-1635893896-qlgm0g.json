  "text": "So I am taking a public speaking class this semester, and the participation/attendance part is worth 10 percent of my grade (100 points in a 1,000 point course) and the attendance policy is pretty strict considering we're on zoom and it's a once a week class, but you are allowed to miss one class without penalty, if you miss two, you get a 50/100 points for your participation/attendance grade. I missed class yesterday on accident (not really going to get into specifics) but I had already missed the first class because I was not enrolled in the course yet as class started on Monday and I was enrolled Tuesday or Wednesday of that week. Am I going to get a failing grade because of this? I don't want to be penalized considering I couldn't help that I missed the first class cause I wasn't enrolled but she was aware of this previously, but I'm wondering if it's even worth it to email her. Speeches are 500 points of my grade and I've gotten A's on all of them so far, and I've gotten 70% or higher on all of my quizzes which is 200 points.\n\nTLDR: if i get a 50/100 for participation and attendance grade and it\u2019s a 1,000 point class, can I still pass the class? What grade might I expect? Should I email my professor considering I wasn't enrolled for the first class?",

      "text": "You're not going to get a failing grade for this. It would be a 5% reduction in your overall grade if the penalty were applied, and based on your other grades you're not within 5 percent of failing.\n\nStill, you shouldn't be penalized 5% of your grade for joining the class a couple of days late, so it's probably worth emailing the professor.",

A really large number of professors wont respond to this.  What you missed was all the thigns we did in that 90 min- how am I going to email that to you.  BIG pet peeve with a lot of profs .\n\nSo if you say, this is why I enrolled late -what do you want me to say?\n\nIf you want an answer, make it clear what you are asking .\n\nAnd dont ask what did I miss in class",

Never asked her for a play by play on what we did, it was literally the first day and she emailed back. Once again that situation was in August. I did not email her yesterday asking what I missed in class. I think you\u2019re focusing on irrelevant information to my problem. I agree I should have been more clear with my email yesterday though.",
