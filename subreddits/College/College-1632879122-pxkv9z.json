However, the issue comes in that the lectures are extremely difficult to understand, due to their extremely heavy accent, policies are hidden in lots of little places so the teacher can pull points.  Issues outside of your control such as a windows popup tabbing you out causing you to lose all points for a question.  Many things are posted in walls of capital text, and they direct questions through a tutor rather than through the professor.  \n\nAlso, as someone with kids, their rule of going to a place with no interruptions is impossible as I can not leave my kids with nobody to watch them.  If I need to add more information please let me know, as I am sure I am forgetting something.\n\nIs there anywhere that I can make a complaint about the policies?  Or is this something I will just have to try to scrape by in?", "author": "Belt_Right1234", "created": 1632879122, "retrieved": 1632945455, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.29, "comments": {"heqsmbi": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxkv9z/can_i_report_a_bad_and_unprofessional_professor/heqsmbi/", "text": "Nothing seems far out of the ordinary?
