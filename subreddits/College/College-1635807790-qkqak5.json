  "text": "hi all. covid really made this entire college thing fly by like crazy and suddenly i\u2019m planning my junior year while i feel like i\u2019m just now a freshmen (i am a sophomore.) \n\nhere\u2019s my predicament. i was online due to covid freshmen year with intentions to be in nyc. i found the institution and classes themselves were really strange and, regardless of location which i would\u2019ve died for, i knew i wouldn\u2019t get the most out of this school, so this year i transferred to my second choice, a fairly well off school that happens to be 4 miles from my home. this is fine, i\u2019m not having too much success socially but i am finding extra curriculars and opportunities to keep myself busy. i\u2019m in this constant headspace, though, of \u201cwhat the hell am i doing here?\u201d. i\u2019ve dreamt my whole life of leaving this city, even for four years, and now i find myself not only in my hometown but extremely invested in at-home-life. i have quite a few hobbies that i couldn\u2019t take to my dorm with me and find myself spending at least one weekend night at home each week. although i love the opportunity to do so, there\u2019s this constant voice in my head telling me i\u2019m making a mistake. \n\ni\u2019m not quite sure what to do. i\u2019m going to be extremely embarrassed to confess these feelings to my parents and then to friends and family if i actually go through with it. i\u2019m still going to play the spring semester by ear while being mindful of deadlines. my question is, is it weird to transfer TWICE and into my junior year? i truly don\u2019t have any social connections at my current school which also makes this decision a lot easier to grasp.",

              "text": "the credits you still have should transfer over. EX: If your major needs 120 credits to graduate but you already have 80 coming in, you will need to take 40 more credits to reach major requirement plus an extra 20 credits to meet the home requirement (if the home requirement is 60 credits) so you\u2019re allowed to graduate. Hope this made more sense. \n\nYou can take winterim & summer classes, it\u2019s really exhausting being in school all year round but this is what i\u2019m doing to graduate on time. (I transferred after my sophomore year)",

      "text": "I transferred twice (more like 2.5 times lol).\n\nI transferred credits from the local community college that I got from dual enrollment to my first 4yr school, then I transferred back to the community college after one year, got my associates, and transferred to an online university for the rest of my bachelor's. Currently thinking I have 2 years left (unless I take another gap semester). \n\nTransferring back to the CC and getting my associates made it 100x easier to transfer to another college because my credits from my first 4yr wouldn't transfer very well anywhere. So I took one more semester at the community college, then a gap semester, then to online because I hated in person college.",

      "text": "I am in the same boat, thinking about transferring again (would be second time). I am also a sophomore who was online last year. If transferring again puts another year of college on that ok at least we get 4 years in person and 3 hopefully at a school we like.\n\nIf you want someone to talk about this decision with I am in the same boat so. I pretty much feel the same way, although this was not really my second choice when I originally applied to schools, in fact this school rejected me originally. I went here because I already had a friend here from high school, they have a club swim team, and a program closer to what I want. But of course I did not get into the club after 3 days of tryouts(I have swam for 7 years competitively) which fucking hurt, especially since swim was part of the reason I left my last school. Now I have not made really any friends here 2 months in, maybe one but we only talk in class. I honestly was not excited to come here, I did not feel like I belonged here, I'm starting to think I'm right. Also there's not much to do off campus and its a party school (I don't party). Don't be embarrassed, I have already told my high school friends that I am thinking about doing it again and my parents already know I am unsure about this school. Its a hard decision but it may be worth it.",

I'm at university which was my first choice. very early into the semester I knew this school was not for me to help me reach my personal goals. so I applied to another university & got accepted. I'll be going there for my spring semester. if people can switch majors, why can't we switch schools? its not bad to transfer twice. we've all made mistakes, and we learn from them!",
