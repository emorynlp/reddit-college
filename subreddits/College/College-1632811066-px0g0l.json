  "text": "I've just started my first year of college. At the momment I'm currently enrolled for a bachelor of science degree in a pre-veterinary transfer program to a  university in my province. The university requires that I have a full course load for the previous 4 terms prior to applying directly into the veterinary DVM program and that I have a GPA of atleast 3. \n\nI can't shake the feeling that somewhere along the line I'll fuck up and that the time spent working towards that goal of getting into the program would be for nothing. It's starting to eat away at me.",
