  "text": "Hey! I am a final year high school student, I have joined a relatively fast paced course for university entrance next year. Recently, I have been very unmotivated and am having some existential thoughts like importance and reason of studying this course. Although, all my friends are very motivated, passionate and find ways to maximise their productivity so they can pass the exam. I wonder how and why are they so motivated. I doubt why is formal education is important and have similar thoughts. Can someone tell me why are so many students motivated to study? What is the reason they study so much? What is the purpose of going through such a stressful lifestyle, wasting your youth and studying things you don't like, many of my motivated friends don't like the subjects too and just focus on exam.  \n\n*Is it for a degree and job?* I understand employers need a sort of filter to hire employees and they choose degrees as a filter for it. But I wonder if that's the reason many students study, to get some job in far future, which won't necessarily be aligned to what they are studying now. IDK if that's the only reason to study but it makes me feel unmotivated.  \n\n*Is it for having basic knowledge?* Most people don't actually get the desired job they studied for and go to one of the unrelated companies that filter through degrees. And what do those people use their basic knowledge learned in college in? Apart from a few niches in daily life that could have learned by something other too. And those people are very high number if you take a populated country and many students are aspiring to be in that job. Also, I'd argue school/college in reality makes you a better \"exam taker\" than be good at your desired job, which is further demotivating.  \n\n*Is it to gain skills for life like discipline and time management?* This is something that many of friends tell me. I don't argue with them because I don't want my peers to lose their arbitrary reason to go through a stressful lifestyle. Is it the right thing to do? Anyways, what skills are we talking about? I have heard my seniors and elders whine a lot that school and college don't give real life skills actually needed for a job to be done efficiently. And as for skills like time management and discipline, it can be learned by doing anything else too. Why go through this particular long and stressful thing to gain those skills? And it's not even that efficient in doing so.  \n\nAll in all, I have lost all reason to study. I don't study or attend classes while having thoughts like these in head. And I am certain most motivated kids just set up some \"arbitrary\" reason because they don't know too why they have to go through this and hope what everyone or their parents are telling must be right. And are afraid, like me, to stray away from it because they also don't know what risks are there in rebeling and going sone totally different path ,which won't have support from their peers and parents. So yeah, I have accepted that I have to study because idk reasons(that's why I made this post) but am not seeing much meaning in it, so I won't be able to give my best in it. It's like I am just stalling away my life.",
