I just have trouble focusing in class, or shifting from one subject to the next, and I often miss things not being detail oriented, which devastate my grade\n\nThe hard working people I know are baffled by this. They think smart = success, and only lazy people struggle. Good for them I guess, I don\u2019t care\n\nI think I\u2019ll have a fine time in the work world. Though I\u2019ve only worked non academic jobs, I\u2019ve never struggled at work. The struggle is having to learn many new concepts every week. Were it just one subject, or just consistent work projects, not exams, I\u2019d do fine\n\nSo I think of dropping out, but then i remember if I stick through it work will be easier. And to those who say college is easier, im glad you\u2019re a sponge who can just soak up knowledge, enjoy that", "author": "DeepSpaceOG", "created": 1632939942, "upvotes": 1}, "heqycbr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxyuph/dropping_out/heqycbr/", "text": "every single day \u2026", "author": "TownUsual4788", "created": 1632937409, "upvotes": 5}}}
