  "title:": "A burning dumpster pile for a first semester freshman year",
  "text": "  As a freshman in my college, it's required that our first semester schedule be made by our advisors and based on our majors' graduation requirement. Due to this I was placed in 6 classes that I had no say in choosing. The first half of the semester was decent with me getting B+ to an A- for most of my assignments and exams but recently the material for 2 of my classes have gotten very difficult and I've begun to fall behind. I've tried emailing the professors for help but it takes weeks for a response.  Right now my grade in those classes are a C- and a D, with a week left to withdraw and finals coming up I'm really wondering if I should withdraw from them or power through and try to pull it up to a C or B if it's even possible.",
