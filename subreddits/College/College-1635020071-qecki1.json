  "text": "I have had a ton of trouble making friends. I\u2019m a freshman and it\u2019s been a real struggle making friends. It seems like everyone has a ton of friends and are always hanging out and doing thing. I live in apartment style dorm that open to the outside so I don\u2019t really have neighbors that I see all the time and my roommates don\u2019t ever do anything. I have joined clubs but I really haven\u2019t met anyone I really connected with. I feel like it\u2019s too late to make a friend group. Not really sure what to do because I have tried really hard to find people. Anyone have any suggestions?",

      "text": "College is a lot different than high school because in high school everyone talks, you make friends and joke around all day. In college it seems like everyone just wants to learn stuff from the class and GTFO. i\u2019m guessing this is due to more mature people, more responsibilities and the fact that they are paying for classes and don\u2019t want to fuck it up. I don\u2019t really have any advice for you because i have a similar issue 3 years into college, i just want to let you know it\u2019s not your fault",

I found that finding people in your major is a good common starting ground to talking to them. Also try starting study groups with people too, cuz you end up talking about other stuff besides the material if you do it enough. Invite people for food or activities after studying.",
