I'm older, going to school as well (also for engineering), and time has actually kind of slowed down after starting school after having worked in industry for a couple of decades.\n\nWhy does this matter?  It may be an indication that you are having trouble with the stress.  Stress can destroy your sense of well-being if you don't do something to manage it.  It can impact your grades and cause you to overwork yourself when you study and undermine you when taking tests.\n\nDon't worry, though; this is a solvable problem!  I would recommend that you reach out to your adviser and ask them if your school offers any workshops in stress management or offers an on-campus counselor, as many campuses do.  They can help you figure out how to best cope with the stress, and this is an important skillset to have.  The stress you feel now will continue as you start working in industry and have demands with deadlines just like you do currently in school.  Learning to manage it now is a skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.\n\nAnother piece of advice I'd offer is to find something you enjoy in each class, even (or especially!) in classes you aren't specifically interested in and/or hate.  For me, it was math, and I started trying to find the practical application wherever I could.  As a result, I hated algebra until we got to formulas for decay because that's applicable to determining things like the half-life of isotopes, and I'm interested in building a nuclear cloud chamber.  I actually really enjoyed trig/precalc because that's where the real-world, practical application started to come in.  (For example, using law of cosign/sin to solve triangle angles and length is directly applicable to issues like search and rescue, determine real-world size of things, etc.)  Although some of these are a little contrived, it keeps me interested and engaged in subjects that might otherwise be frustrating.  In chemistry, it's learning that solids don't just magically melt in liquid; they are literally separated and surrounded by other molecules, or why steel wool actually gains weight when you burn it rather than losing weight because it oxidizes and gains new atoms.\n\nEnjoy your time at college!  Although it seems stressful, this is going to be some of the most free exploration time you will have in your life.  You're focused almost entirely on learning and connecting with people (don't forget to network!  folks you meet now will get you your future jobs!) in ways that simply isn't nearly as easy (or even possible, sometimes).", "author": "OwThatHertz", "created": 1578868386, "upvotes": 2}, "fe5cbl6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/enj55m/ever_since_college_started_for_you_has_time_been/fe5cbl6/", "text": "It\u2019s gone by pretty fast for me!
