  "title:": "Ever since college started for you, has time been going by two or three times faster than before?",
  "text": "I\u2019m an engineering major. Ever since I started college in 2017, almost all of the time until now has felt like one giant year. However, it has been three years. For me, it is surreal how the workload and stress of college are making time go by. Memories from 2015 to me feel like they were three years ago, not five. Everything is moving super fast. I wonder if time will slow down, in my case, after college ends. It feels like I\u2019m in a sports car and everything is... so fast.\n\nEdit: thank you all for responding. Since there are a lot of comments, it'd be too hard to respond to everybody. However, sincerely, THANK YOU for commenting. I'll read all of your comments!!",

      "text": "I would posit that it's less about being in college and more about the fact that you'd doing something so fast-paced for the first time in your life.  I'm older, going to school as well (also for engineering), and time has actually kind of slowed down after starting school after having worked in industry for a couple of decades.\n\nWhy does this matter?  It may be an indication that you are having trouble with the stress.  Stress can destroy your sense of well-being if you don't do something to manage it.  It can impact your grades and cause you to overwork yourself when you study and undermine you when taking tests.\n\nDon't worry, though; this is a solvable problem!  I would recommend that you reach out to your adviser and ask them if your school offers any workshops in stress management or offers an on-campus counselor, as many campuses do.  They can help you figure out how to best cope with the stress, and this is an important skillset to have.  The stress you feel now will continue as you start working in industry and have demands with deadlines just like you do currently in school.  Learning to manage it now is a skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.\n\nAnother piece of advice I'd offer is to find something you enjoy in each class, even (or especially!) in classes you aren't specifically interested in and/or hate.  For me, it was math, and I started trying to find the practical application wherever I could.  As a result, I hated algebra until we got to formulas for decay because that's applicable to determining things like the half-life of isotopes, and I'm interested in building a nuclear cloud chamber.  I actually really enjoyed trig/precalc because that's where the real-world, practical application started to come in.  (For example, using law of cosign/sin to solve triangle angles and length is directly applicable to issues like search and rescue, determine real-world size of things, etc.)  Although some of these are a little contrived, it keeps me interested and engaged in subjects that might otherwise be frustrating.  In chemistry, it's learning that solids don't just magically melt in liquid; they are literally separated and surrounded by other molecules, or why steel wool actually gains weight when you burn it rather than losing weight because it oxidizes and gains new atoms.\n\nEnjoy your time at college!  Although it seems stressful, this is going to be some of the most free exploration time you will have in your life.  You're focused almost entirely on learning and connecting with people (don't forget to network!  folks you meet now will get you your future jobs!) in ways that simply isn't nearly as easy (or even possible, sometimes).",

Howhewer, as an adult you don't have that much time to spend for what ever you desire. So I guess that is why.",

Freshman year I was so carefree running around the halls going to dorm parties and trying to get into house parties, then Sophomore year came and I lived in an apartment and got the sophomore slump, then junior year I studied abroad in an awesome country and explored new places, and now I\u2019m getting ready to start a career.\n\nBut despite how hard it might be to leave in a couple of months, I really do feel prepared for the next step and feel like I got everything I could out of this place. \n\nSo, a little unsolicited advice to all you freshman: Always remember, You\u2019re not just in college to get a degree, but to make crazy memories, fail and learn, do things that scare you, go on random trips, and make lifelong friends.\n\nCheers to undergrad.",

We\u2019re not super close but it just hit me how once upon a time we were these shy high school freshmen and now she\u2019s about to graduate from college and I still have another 3 semesters to go.\n\nBut yea these past few years have just flown by. Part of me regrets working so much and letting being 19-21 go by so quick in a boring way but I\u2019m 22 now and I want to make the most of the rest of the time I have in college so I\u2019m making friends, joining organizations, and am still working hard to have a bright future.",

When you're older and fall into routine and experience novelty less then your brain starts slacking off and making shortcuts because you really don't need to remember a random Tuesday where nothing happened at work for the 900th time in a row.\n\nNeurologists say if you want to \"slow down\" your life then you need to experience novelty again and at a consistent rate.

For those of you who are about to start college or are still in college, really try to embrace and have fun in college. I know it sounds cheesy, but this is really a once in a lifetime opportunity to meet other people your age, learn what you\u2019re interested in, and trying out new things that you never thought you would ever do. The real world is whole other monster. Once you enter that world, not everyone will be your age and it\u2019s so much harder to make friends. Plus, it\u2019s a lot harder to try new things when you\u2019re working 9-5...",

Work is 40hrs a week or school. Learn how to study effectively, manage your time, and you\u2019ll suddenly have more time to do all the fun things you want to.",

But if you just want to live your life doing whatever then making kids and or getting tied down to your current location due to relationships may not be good decisions for that particular goal. If you really wanted to you could work 40 hours and live your life with the other 30-40 hours a week. Pick your path and build towards it.\n\nLife after high school doesn't have to be the generic suffocating depressing life you are thinking of. Your life will be built on the decisions you make. How you manage finances, how you plan ahead, how long you let your debt go unpaid, which jobs you choose and for how long you choose to stay at them. Which people you associate with. etc",
