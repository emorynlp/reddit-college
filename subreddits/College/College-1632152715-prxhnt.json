I\u2019m starting my college applications soon and I was wondering, would my gpa still be a 4.0 with a B in a class? It\u2019s in gym, I didn\u2019t have my uniform because I couldn\u2019t buy it in time. I have A\u2019s in everything else, including my 3 AP classes. I have 6 in total. Since AP\u2019s are weighted more and I have A\u2019s in them, would my gpa still be a 4.0?", "author": "joshhenderson677", "created": 1632152715, "retrieved": 1632801388, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "comments": {"hdm3w5t": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prxhnt/will_my_gpa_still_be_40/hdm3w5t/", "text": "From a technical standpoint, if you are able to get a 4.0 gpa in ap classes and get 3.0 in gym I don't think colleges would really care unless you are trying to get in a sports program.

Colleges understand senior year is hard so you have more leeway with your grades. Of course don't fail, but at this point the difference between an A and B doesn't matter. Plus some colleges reconfigure grades anyway. They may only look at uw, w, or just completely regrade your gpa excluding certain subject.", "author": "noelblossom", "created": 1632157252, "upvotes": 2}}}
