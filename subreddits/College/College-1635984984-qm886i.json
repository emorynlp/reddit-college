  "text": "It's my first semester at a major university studying mechanical engineering, but I entered with 60 credit hours completed during high school. I'm losing motivation and feeling burnout so quickly, and I think it's because I have no purpose here.\n\nI have no reason or real desire to keep pushing through it, so all my hard work feels like I'm working towards nothing.  How do you guys find your purpose? How do you find a reason to get up everyday to learn what's taught in class?\n\nI would sincerely like to know what convinced you that what you're working towards is what you want, because I'm lost.\n\nThank you to anyone who sees this.",

      "text": "When I was a student, I started out by really enjoying the atmosphere my college. The people and culture really worked for me.\n\nI can say I actually enjoyed the challenge as well. Half way through out the year, life hit me like a bullet. \n\nI stopped caring about school. Pretty much just gave up in my classes. But then it dawned on me that if I didn\u2019t finish, then I would just end up having to work at McDonald\u2019s. So for my own sake, I decided to finish. \n\nMy motivation came out of the financial incentive. I can assure you life as an engineer is much simpler than life as a student.",

I just didnt know if things would ever get easier or if life after all this would be fulfilling.  I still don't know for sure, because I'm not the same person as you, but I'll definitely be focusing on your words. Thank you!!",

      "text": "This type of thing is really common for new college students, college is a lot harder than high school homework is more demanding tests are harsher. \n\nI felt the same way at my first college, I ended up switching programs and I found something I enjoyed more and I felt like I got a lot more out of it.\n\nYour college will also have some mental health resources which are very helpful. Talking to some one can really help.",

      "text": "This is going to be a really long post but to get the whole picture it all needs to be fully laid out\u2026.hang in there with me while I give you my life story that keeps me pushing through college. \n\nSo 8 years post high school, I started college to pursue a law degree, and it sucks, I hate it, and lord is it hard\u2026.but I\u2019m sticking with it and grinding through because I\u2019ve experienced just how miserable life can be without a degree, and I\u2019ve also experienced the financial stability and freedom a degree can get you. \nFor years I worked as a bartender part time at night and usually had some shitty full time day job as well, I made okay money sometimes but I really struggled most of the time. And even with super strict budgeting I was usually still living paycheck to a few days before paycheck choosing between paying bills or buying groceries and putting gas in my car, and god forbid my old 1996 car with over 200k miles on it broke down because when it did life went from hard to hell til I figured out how to fix it, how do I go to work to barely make ends meet with my scheduled 60 hours when my car broke and I can\u2019t afford to fix it? I hated my life, I felt like a failure, and I felt like I was just wasting my life and I kicked myself all the time for not going to college so I could get a better job, but I was stuck in the cycle at that point. Then I met a guy\u2026and this is cliche as all hell but he saved my life and helped me pull myself out of the gutter of stressed, overworked and desperately broke. He\u2019s a self-employed civil engineer, and though his degree didn\u2019t make him rich, he\u2019s been incredibly successful in his field and is modestly comfortable. For the first few years while we lived separately he helped me out when I\u2019d actually let him know I needed it, which I hated even more than being dirt poor. Then we moved in together and my life changed overnight. Being self employed he has the ability to go and do as he pleases when he pleases, he\u2019s very used to this, but then when I moved in and still held a job or two barely making enough to be worth going he was frequently frustrated that my work schedule restricted the lifestyle he had become accustomed to for pennies on the dollar. So we decided that I\u2019d quit my job because we didn\u2019t need the money from it and wouldn\u2019t be hurting without it. This was probably the most nerve racking decision I\u2019ve made in my life. Unmarried living in his home, and I\u2019m about to give up my income although minimal to rely on him, is this is a good idea??? Probably not, but I took the plunge and trusted him when he said that even if we didn\u2019t work out he wouldn\u2019t put me out on my face with nothing and no job, that he\u2019d make sure I was able to stand on my own before we parted ways. Did I believe him? Nope, not really and I was really scared to fully depend on someone other than my parents, but I took the risk on him and our relationship, and well I got lucky that he is the person I really thought he is. Suddenly I\u2019m 24 and completely free, no work schedule, no alarm clock, time is mostly irrelevant to me, I want for nothing within reason, my phone never fails to make a call cause the bill wasn\u2019t paid, I don\u2019t have to add up everything I put in the cart while grocery shopping to make sure I can buy it, I can go to a gas pump and fill my tank every time without even checking the bank account beforehand to make sure I can, because I know the money is there. I was living a life most people will likely never experience and at only 24, and it was incredible and I couldn\u2019t believe everything he was doing for me, but I was still unhappy. I was bored, I missed working in a way, and it always felt wrong to depend on him and make him carry the weight of all of it I\u2019m just not that person not when it\u2019s just the two of us and there\u2019s no good reason for me to not be working other than I can\u2019t get a job making enough to be worth giving up the freedom not working grants us. I also still felt like I was wasting my life but just floating through it on his dime and his success and I always felt this wasn\u2019t fair to him no matter how much he said he was fine with it and I didn\u2019t have to work. I wanted more, not from him, but from life and I wanted to forge my own path in life. I also felt that I absolutely owed it to myself and to him to make something out of my life because of the incredible financial opportunity he gave me. I\u2019ve always loved the law, and for personal reasons I have a passion to change the system so I decided to finally go to college and get the law degree I\u2019ve always dreamed of. After many arguments about me returning to school because I refused to allow him to pay for it instead of taking loans and repaying it after school, I finally won that argument and started college, and sticking it out is rough, but every time I get burnt out, or am annoyed with how much time it requires I remind myself of what my life was like when I was working my ass off to struggle on my own, and remember that there isn\u2019t a damn thing I won\u2019t push through to avoid going back to that nightmare time in my life, and that eventually I will have earned and not just found a stable and comfortable life for myself while being able to give back to the person who got me here. So the struggle my life used to be keeps me pushing on, as well as the refusal to allow myself to take the opportunity I\u2019ve been given and the person who gave it to me for granted. I know a degree won\u2019t guarantee my success, only I can guarantee that for myself, but a degree at least opens the door to earning my success, because when that door is closed life is hard, like really fucking hard and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone.",
