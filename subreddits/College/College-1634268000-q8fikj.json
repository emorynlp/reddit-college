  "text": "im in my first year right now and everything has been going pretty well except for my molecular and cellular biology class. first of all the class is essentially watered down organic chemistry, which was something I wasn't exactly prepared for my first year. on top of this the exams are all super in depth, I feel like im only getting a surface level understanding from the textbooks and lectures. so how do I get this deeper understanding, ive been studying for my second exam for over a week now and I still feel that I don't get it the way I should. what am I doing wrong, and how should I go about studying for these effectively.",
