The grade in the class is based of of 3 tests and the homework. All of it is on Chegg. The class is on a curve. The class average was a 70. I studied so hard for a 50. Everyone in the groupchat who asks questions about homework and actually puts in effort, has grades in the 30-40 range.  \n\nFuck this.\n\nUpdate for clarification:\n\nSo essentially, the first midterm was adjusted because some of the questions were wrong, so everyone got 30 extra points. I didn't think that the class average was after the adjustment (even though it's pretty obvious now that I think of it) so the class average was a 70 and I got an 80. The curve is added after the class so I have a lot of reasons to be optimistic.\n\nAll the answers for the first test were on the internet and chegg. Essentially working through the problem with just 1 number changed. So a lot of people probably cheated. You do not have to show any work  and grades are just based off the answers. The first test was just 5 really long questions. It's not a great format imo. \n\nI have another midtern soon and hopefully all the answers won't be on chegg like last time. I'm just gonna take it without chegg and hope for the best.", "author": null, "created": 1617601703, "retrieved": 1632947341, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1065, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gtivt2l": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mkdrte/i_was_wondering_why_the_midterm_average_was_so/gtivt2l/", "text": "Realities of uni.

There is no doubt in my mind people cheated (the exam was open for 24 hours so it could be easily distributed). But of course my GPA took a hit.
