  "title:": "I was wondering why the midterm average was so high.",
  "text": "Literally all the answers for my class are on Chegg. The grade in the class is based of of 3 tests and the homework. All of it is on Chegg. The class is on a curve. The class average was a 70. I studied so hard for a 50. Everyone in the groupchat who asks questions about homework and actually puts in effort, has grades in the 30-40 range.  \n\nFuck this.\n\nUpdate for clarification:\n\nSo essentially, the first midterm was adjusted because some of the questions were wrong, so everyone got 30 extra points. I didn't think that the class average was after the adjustment (even though it's pretty obvious now that I think of it) so the class average was a 70 and I got an 80. The curve is added after the class so I have a lot of reasons to be optimistic.\n\nAll the answers for the first test were on the internet and chegg. Essentially working through the problem with just 1 number changed. So a lot of people probably cheated. You do not have to show any work  and grades are just based off the answers. The first test was just 5 really long questions. It's not a great format imo. \n\nI have another midtern soon and hopefully all the answers won't be on chegg like last time. I'm just gonna take it without chegg and hope for the best.",

One gets dropped so worked my ass off and got the same score as on the first one on the third & final exam. Thought I would at least be in the B+, hopefully A- range. Turns out 45 fucking people got As on the last exam, after only FIVE did on the first two (the whole class is cumulative). There is no doubt in my mind people cheated (the exam was open for 24 hours so it could be easily distributed). But of course my GPA took a hit. It\u2019s so frustrating, I vowed not to take another chem class till we\u2019re in person again. I feel what you\u2019re going through though, it sucks.\n\nEdit: And of course the profs won\u2019t do anything about it, because the higher averages look good for them. Sigh.\n\nEdit again: I just looked up the exam and parts of it are on Chegg. What. The. Fuck.",

I\u2019ll give it to her, she did make course corrections after that and is actually my thesis chair now, but oh man was I not her fan in that moment.",

And I'm sure you do.\n\nChegg is quite simply a website that allows students to submit homework or test questions and get detailed answers to those submissions from other users.\n\nI'm sure you're also aware that the point of an exam is to assess one's knowledge on a topic, and that can't be accurately assessed when a student is copying down answers without actually attempting to solve the problems.\n\nUnfortunately, you're being disingenuous with me and various other users on this thread by completely avoiding the previous facts. Chegg is not a resource that is there to guide student's towards the right answer, it is a resource intended to give student's the right answer immediately and with minimal effort. Hence why material from that website is being taken down on a daily basis.\n\nIf what I'm saying is something that you are so passionately against, perhaps you should not be in college. You aren't learning anything anyways.",

Btw in most of my exams, formulas and all that info are given to begin with, what professors are looking for on the exam is how you can derive that formula and then apply your knowledge.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say we learned about Poisson distribution. Professors will rarely test you if you can just plug and chug. What they are really looking for is if you really understand what this does and why we use it over other distributions and how we derived this. \n\nSure in the real world I can look these things up and in fact the formulas are also given on the exam, but even if let\u2019s say you can look this up, do you know how to actually apply it? If you just cheated your way through college, then it\u2019s most likely not.",

This isn\u2019t an easy A psych UD class, so your score is not purely based on time put in- leading to high averages. \n\nYou\u2019re not going to fail them all- so the solution is to curve around a C+ to prevent grade inflation.

If it\u2019s higher, something is generally up- so you need to do more analysis. \n\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s important to account for is how important what you\u2019re learning is to you immediately. If you\u2019re going to be an accountant someone\u2019s livelihood is in your hands, so you need to be trained properly- if you\u2019re an engineer that machine you\u2019re building could kill someone if designed wrong, if you\u2019re a chemist you could easily kill yourself if you mishandle yourself reagents. Those are really serious and it\u2019s kinda hard to afford people a lot of slack for that.\n\nMeanwhile in my 3000 level communications class the average score is around an 85% on every major assignment, because what\u2019s being \u201ctaught\u201d is more for box checking than for actual learning.",

If you actually understood what was happening, even if that meant using chegg to figure it out, all you would have to do is write your answers in your own way and be able to explain what is going on.  This is how a lot of people study in engineering, you just find similar problems and see how other do it. \n\nIt\u2019s a dick move for other students to do it on the exam, but at the end of the day if the professor called you out you would probably have plausible deniability. This isn\u2019t cheating on a multiple choice test, there\u2019s  a decent amount of work that would have gone into it. So If you can explain what\u2019s happening, say why you did the problem that way, and your answer is correct then you can make a fairly easy case that you just happened to study similar questions. After all you are expected to do that for an exam. Especially if it were only 3 questions, it\u2019s pretty believable.\n\nShitty situation for OP, but idk really how they could prove anything.",

The bare minimum is paying for a degree and you get that piece of paper. But why not actually take the time to learn alongside it? Not like it costs any extra. I personally could excuse those who are so overwhelmed with responsibilities they don't have time to put in any extra effort (occasionally perhaps, if it was a last resort kind of thing and not a curved class). But they're generally the same people who do have a better work ethic and won't take advantage of the system. The serial cheaters are generally the same people who would rather party or coast through school without working for it. And if you think about it, is partying any more worthwhile than getting the knowledge that you paid for, even if it's optional?\n\nThe sad reality is that both categories of people end up getting lumped in together, even if one is more qualified (both ethically and technically) than the other. Do we really want people who would jump at a chance to take advantage of inadequacies in a system in immoral ways as our leaders or people in positions where they're doing work that impacts us all?",

You have three obvious choices. First choice, cheat with the others and get A on the next exam and pass the class. Second choice, print out the exams from chegg (or take pictures) and send it to your professor to expose the cheaters. Third choice, keep doing you and study for the 3rd exam early. I feel the first two choices would not help you in the long run of your college career but the third choice will help you build harder work ethics. Even if people cheated or not you got a 50% and I\u2019m sure there was something you could of studied harder to at least get a passing grade. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend cheating because it won\u2019t help you graduate. Yea it will help you pass the class but the next course you take will just make you regret not paying attention. Two, reporting students without valid proof of them actually cheating won\u2019t help you. Yea you can show professor the exam but all he would do is make a 3rd exam from scratch and everyone mostly likely fail it, but the people that cheated at the start of class would still pass bc there no way to prove they personally cheated or just \u201csmart\u201d. If you are on failing hard then I would suggest to study the exam on Chegg and don\u2019t study it to simply copy answers but as a resource of study material. In this situation you cant really blame anyone other then the professor that doesn\u2019t hand write new questions each semester. Keeping the same old recycled questions is lazy and makes it so the professor work less. If the professor wrote new exam questions every year then his teaching in class would probably help you guys more exactly pass.",
