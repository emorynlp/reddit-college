Please if you have 2 mins to spare I would greatly appreciate it and will gladly return the favor if you also have a survey!\n\n[https://forms.gle/MtRcQG2EtSDxveu2A](https://forms.gle/MtRcQG2EtSDxveu2A)\n\nAlternatively, if you don't want to complete the survey but you have a suggestion or 2 on how to make the app cool and useful, feel free to message me!\n\nThanks so much!",
