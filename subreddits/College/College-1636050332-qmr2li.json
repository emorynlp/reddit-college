Both have impaired focus, but they manifest differently \u2014 unfortunately genius psychiatrists decided back in the 1990s that any attention deficit disorder was basically just \u201cADHD.\u201d Kinda stupid, but then again, what do you expect \ud83d\ude43 Now they separate out three basic types of ADHD \u2014 one is no issues with focus, but hyperactive, one is issues with focus but not hyperactive, and another is a combo. \n\nBut realistically that\u2019s the thing about brains \u2014 ADHD in one person doesn\u2019t look exactly like ADHD in another.\n\nAs for how to get a chance to play your games\u2026ask? I mean seriously, just say yo, in half an hour can I play some ____ ?\u201d",
