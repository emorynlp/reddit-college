  "text": "Is it normal for you to get burnt out near the last semester of college. I\u2019m graduating in June and I\u2019m so burnt out. Here\u2019s the thing, I went from talking college classes during high school and during the summers, to doubling up on my high school classes to graduate early. Graduated high school early, went straight to college, and have since been doing semesters back to back (including summer classes). I am usually an A student but rn my grades are like B, B- and one C (stats, always been horrible at math). At I just a slacker or is this burn out normal? Feel like I\u2019m hanging on by a thread these last few classes",

Took summer classes as well so I haven't had a real summer break. Im burnt out as hell now and just want winter break to come along. We need to slow it down , the end result is the same regardless",

Seeing how everything in the world is going downhill slowly but surely I felt the need to rush into success or a career to at least be comfortable if times get harder. I\u2019m going to take your advice, I\u2019ll take a break after graduation",
