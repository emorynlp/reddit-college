  "text": "Just wanted to share this funny story with y\u2019all in case anyone is having a bad day and needs a laugh.\n\nIt was a group project and the topic had literally nothing to do with porn whatsoever lol like it just wasn\u2019t relevant at all. This was a business class.\n\nHe goes \u201cnow, uh, i can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to say this but I used to struggle a lot with pornography. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m recovered now but I had to delete all my social media because almost every girl had nothing but pictures of them wearing almost no clothing.\u201d\n\nLike uh??? Buddy, the entire class did not need to know that \ud83d\udc80 I\u2019m not even judging him about the porn thing bc like who doesn\u2019t watch porn but sharing that to the whole class when it\u2019s not even relevant to the project? I was embarrassed FOR him.\n\nThe funniest part is at the beginning of the semester I went on a coffee date with this dude and it was super awkward and he literally never talked to me again after. \n\nLmao just an overall very funny day. Thought you guys would enjoy this story.\n\nI will say one thing though, dude\u2019s got balls for sure.",

          "text": "Because this is Reddit, I absolutely knew there'd be somebody to post this response. \n\nI think it's a little extreme to say that pornography is the number one enemy of young men. Are we talking like 13 year old boys? Adults can watch pornography and be fine. \n\nIt's just naked people screwing on a video. Not all porn has guys beating the shit out of women. Hell, a lot of the women I've met want more violent sex than I ever had. Choking and slapping was things that they explicitly ask for. \n\nWould men feel like it was detrimental if society hadn't been drilling it into our heads that we are garbage humans if we watch it? \n\nPeople can get addicted to anything. Porn is just entertainment. Masturbation is healthy. Porn is not more addictive than any drug, although it is a lot more accessible.",

It produces extremely high levels of dopamine, even higher than when you\u2019re having irl sex. \n\nIt also very much encourages the sexualization of women, literally through brain function. Men who watch it process pictures of women similar to an object. The less clothes a woman has on, the less agency they perceive her to have. Whereas, they still see naked men as autonomous human beings.\n\nIn addition, those that watch report on average less satisfying relationships, less satisfying sex lives, and rate their partners as less attractive than those that don\u2019t watch. \n\nIt can reallly fuck up your brain in ways you don\u2019t even know. And this isn\u2019t even getting into the toxicity of the industry. Personally, I cannot watch it after learning of the many negative impacts upon everyone involved. It\u2019s not worth it.",
