      "text": "It really depends. In general I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, but there are exceptions. If you are so worn out that your grades or mental health is suffering, it might be good to give yourself a break and focus on other things for a few months. If you are taking a break just for the fun of it, you risk not going back or finding school to be harder when you get back. Plus, taking a semester off means it\u2019ll take you a semester longer to graduate.",
