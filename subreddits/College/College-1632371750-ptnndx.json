I work with college students as an adviser/advocate,  and am looking for real life solutions that are working for you... \n\nFolks are generous with talking to me in my office about this stuff and I share good info... but I realized I have access to a far more diverse crew of really great people to help me help others, and to help each other while we are here! :) thanks!",

Current part time, going to full time next semester, adult student, no kids.\n\n* Passion Planner didn't work cause too small and hourly space didn't allow for to-dos. Luckily. My sister liked it. Shame it was expensive.\n* Daily Moleskine doesn't allow me to easily see the week at a glance and honestly scheduling all my adulting stuff (cleaning and such) daily sucked.\n* Most normal weekly planners lack enough space to write out to dos. They are appointment only. Which sucks for me and my brain.\n* Bullet Journal doesn't agree with my need to pre-plan things and tell how much energy I'll have. \n\nGoing to attempt to try the same planner and Google Calendar for time blocking next semester. If that doesn't work, might start doing time block-y to do lists on post it notes in there.",

My personal favorite was using an appointment book like they used to have at a multi doctor practice with 8am to 8pm scheduled every 15 minutes with columns for 4 practitioners ' schedules.. the first 2 columns I used for 8am-8p and the second two is 8p-the next morning at 8am  the first columns I would use for appointments and classes the others I would use the other for to do's.",

Your appointment book sounds lovely as well.  \n\nMy main issue is I have ADHD and never really had routine, so currently I have walls of text that are slowly being formalized into secondary lists. So, stuff like weekly cleaning I'm trying to train myself into what needs to be done then later I will just be able to write Tuesday = Clean up. But rn, I have like 12 things to clean written down and many short to-dos. \n\nOff loading a lot of routine into set days and set lists somewhere else will free up a lot of mental space and literal space. Although you just gave me the realization I can print my time-block schedule off google in tiny sticker sizes for next semester and fit it next to the daily checklist.",

I like seeing my handwriting because online planners make me confused and overwhelmed. Moreover, we're still doing online classes due to lockdown and I want a break from the screen.\n\nSetting up my to-do's for the week is more fun when I write on my planner since I also add some doodles and silly messages to myself like \"grind girl, because your cats need a bright future\"--basically trying to generate as much positive energy as I can to combat academic stress. I paste in pictures of my cats and corny stuff like that, hehe.",

Have been using google calendars to plan my schedule and chunks of free time, but beyond actually organizing assignments and exams, I have been struggling. Did a bunch of research to end up with:\n\n\\*MyHomework Planner (free, $4.99 to sync outside of service to external calendar service and no ads)\n\n\\*MyStudyLife (free, does not sync to google calendars, possible long term issues)\n\n\\*iStudiez Pro (free, syncs with Google calendars, costs to use with a second device)\n\n\\*Shovel App by [howtostudyincollege.com/shovel-study-planner/](https://howtostudyincollege.com/shovel-study-planner/)\n\nMyHomework Planner, MyStudyLife, iStudiez Pro are all around a decade old! This means they also have some limited support and future updates. If you look at the social media (Facebook and Twitter feeds) of the apps, their timelines haven't been active in the past year. I also noticed MyStudyLife had some periods of downtime where the service was unavailable for a while (which is concerning). For iStudiez Pro, they lost their google play store certificate so they no longer work with android devices.\n\nShovel looks complicated but exciting! It also is a newer app from a company focusing first on college study habits and developing their app to compliment their advice. One of the Co-Ceos claims to be a Harvard Grad, and their Social is still receiving regular posts/updates.\n\nI am going to experiment the rest of this semester with Shovel and MyHomework Planner! Will try to update you with how it goes.",
