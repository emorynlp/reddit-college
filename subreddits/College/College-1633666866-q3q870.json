  "text": "I see a lot of people on Instagram take some sort of art major and I really want to major in fine arts but maybe focus in painting. The thing is that I love fashion design and drawing/ painting. I love designing outfits in my sketchbook; designing apparel or jewelry is very exciting to me but I also love the artsy side of things like painting, drawing, printmaking etc (and designing characters with pretty outfits haha). I would love to be able to combine the two but I\u2019m not sure what to major in particularly..? If I major in painting then how will I be able to work in fashion design?? Are there majors that combine both? I\u2019d prefer not to double major or have a minor but I\u2019m so curious to how people are art majors but work with designing clothes as well hmmm",
