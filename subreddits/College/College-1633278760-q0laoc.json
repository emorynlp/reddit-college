  "text": "So here's the thing, I am in Nursing School and wish to have my course load during the year under 12 credits. The classes I plan on taking amount to 15 credits in the summer, and run for 6 weeks. So I'm wondering if that course load is too much? I don't wish to have my grades negatively impacted, so I'm just checking to see if this is a good course load to take.",

Most people recommend taking one accelerated 5-6 week course, two at most. \n\nIt is a lot condensed information you will have to grasp in such a small time frame. It will be challenging, and you will be spending a lot of time doing homework for one class alone. \n\nIsn\u2019t there anyway you can take longer classes over the summer?",
