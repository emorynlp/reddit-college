  "title:": "I\u2019m so lost in my career path, any help",
  "text": "I\u2019m a 21 y/o community college student who recently landed on the idea of becoming an accountant. The big main reasons are that the hobbies I do have (music,art,fashion), don\u2019t seem to translate to any employable college degrees. My parents are supportive in the sense they are paying for my college tuition, and in that sense they won\u2019t let me pick anything they don\u2019t approve it. I\u2019ve tried telling them architect, audio engineering, and they just tell me \u201cno do not pursue those careers\u201d. The only career related to science that had my parents approval is material science/ fabric engineering. At the same time I\u2019m kicking myself because I know deep down I just don\u2019t care about accounting. I\u2019ve never wanted to work in a cubicle or in a big office with old men in their suits, cutting my hair (I know it sounds dumb but I never liked having shorter hair) but I see it as I have no other choice. I\u2019ve always been a colorful and creative person and I just can\u2019t see myself doing accounting. I keep telling myself I can use my accounting degree to work at a music label or fashion label, or even starting my own business (fashion brand, music label, clothing store, etc). This is sort of my workaround from getting a standard \u201carts\u201d degree and possibly being unemployed. I\u2019m good with Algebra and I\u2019ve heard this is the career path for people like me. But I\u2019ve also been told to not go into Accounting because of this, that it\u2019s not such a good alternative if I don\u2019t have the motivation for it ( basically been told that Accounting isn\u2019t as easy as people say, there\u2019s a lot of busy work and time spent working late) and advice for this lost person? \nThank you~",

      "text": "My dads an accountant. He puts in a lot of time sitting in a desk for 3 hours straight without any break. It\u2019s gruelling work around month or quarter end. The work isn\u2019t easy mentally or physically a lot of people quit because of this. \n\nIt might be best for you to take a step back and reevaluate your life and career plans. Talk to someone in your school.  \n\nMaybe look into Art History. There are not as many go go after a PhD as other disciplines. Talk with someone in \u201cstrange\u201d degrees and see where they ended up. \n\nNo college degree is very employable nowadays because so many people have degrees. \n\nGood Luck!!",

      "text": "I had a similar situation. I was a physics major wanting to go to med school. But it was never what I really wanted. I have MAJOR influences from my parents, especially my mom, and they would pressure me to go down this route. Long story short, I was not passionate about the things I was studying, I was not excited for med school (the thought alone made me cry), and I started to lose confidence. \n\nNot only did my mental health started to deteriorate, but also my grades. Because I wasn\u2019t passionate about my field, I had no interest in learning, and when I would \u201clearn\u201d I would really struggle. I mentioned to my parents for a while that I wasn\u2019t happy with my major but they would just say \u201cyou\u2019ll regret it if you change\u201d or \u201cit\u2019ll be worth it, just get through this part.\u201d Beginning of my senior year, I sat my parents down and had a long conversation explaining everything I mentioned. I told them I was changing my major; they didn\u2019t support it at first but then they came around. \n\nAll I can say is, if you\u2019re not passionate about what you\u2019re studying, it\u2019ll reflect in your grades. It can also hurt your confidence and mental health. You need to do what makes you happy and what you will be excited to be involved in. Especially if you\u2019re creative - don\u2019t let that be suppressed.",
