  "text": "Basically, I\u2019m in a situation on going either out of state to the University of Arizona or going to PLNU. I will be dorming at either locations so they will essentially come out to about the same price. The university of Arizona has more of a real college experience compared to the other school, but Loma is in a great location as well as a great research program. Thoughts??",

      "text": "PLNU is probably only a good idea if you want to be in a religious education community at a smaller campus (around 3,500 students). UofA is huge (over 33,000 students) and will likely have more options for study, more opportunities to socialize, more employment connections, and it probably has a bunch of research going on at the campus since it is so massive.",

      "text": "If you go to University of Arizona, you would be paying double the tuition of your peers. If you\u2019re gonna take out loans then I would highly advise against it. Tuition for both is 28-30k, and if you add housing, you\u2019re easily looking 40k an year which would add up to 160k for a bachelors degree.\n\nIf you graduate with $160,000 in loans, and let\u2019s say your interest is 10/15%, your loans will acquire around $20,000 on interest ALONE, and I won\u2019t sugar coat it, at that point your life would have been ruined or a good chunk of it. You cannot bankrupt your way out of student loans and you can\u2019t pay that much money off with any bachelors job salary.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut if your parents are just crazy rich and they\u2019re paying for it, then go with University Of Arizona and have fun lmao.",
