  "text": "i ended up taking a gap year and withdrew my application before finding out if i got off the waitlist (usually 50% of ppl get off the waitlist of that school and one reason i was waitlisted was cuz my hs didn\u2019t submit my official transcripts so my application was marked as incomplete)\n\nthis is my dream school and they admit solely on grades which i meet the requirements. i was wondering if they would be able to tell i\u2019m reapplying. \n\nsince it\u2019s for the next cycle i had to create a new acc. my full name, parents name and school/grad year is the same but that\u2019s about it. i ended up moving house so my address is different and instead of submitting my transcript i\u2019ll now submit my final diploma results.",
