  "title:": "Part-time job at a company during school",
  "text": "I applied to what I thought was an internship, but it is a remote part-time job (a state away) during the school year with an engineering firm, which can be extended to the summer. I would be working 12-15 hours/week. The pay is supposed to be $16-28/hour. If it was below $20, I probably would not take it because that is almost minimum wage in my state/county. Aside from pay, I am unsure whether to take this position because I am here in college and feel I should be more involved in college rather than working in my room. On the other hand, it could be good experience, and it's not much different from working in a lab/normal retail or food job. Any advice? Or experience with a similar situation?",
