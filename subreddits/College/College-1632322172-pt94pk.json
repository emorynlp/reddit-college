I think I need tips to manage feeling \"burnt out\".", "text": "So as I mentioned above, I'm a final year undergrad. I'm right in my final semester, in fact I'm so excited to be finishing soon. But I've been feeling quite depressed since the start of this semester.\n\nI'm usually pretty motivated to get on with my day and study. For the past semesters, I been getting A's in my courses, which helped me receive scholarship to undertake research with a supervisor last semester. So things look pretty great. I also have a loving partner whom I been in a relationship with for 5 years, a cool caring family back home.\n\nBut I'm not sure how.. now I just feel like not wanting to do anything. I used to be pretty happy to study and do research as I love doing them. Now they just feel like chores... I find myself not interested in anything. I just want to sleep or nap or just have a lie down. I have 2 tests coming up and 1 essay assignment due next week. I would have been half-way done my essay by now and revising for my tests, but I haven't even started any of them. All I feel is this \"down\" feeling. I feel really tired. I need to do my work but I can't be bothered.\n\nI suspect that I might be burnt out from all the hard grinding these past few years. Has any of you experienced this feeling? How do you get around it?", "author": "arriellekim", "created": 1632322172, "retrieved": 1632800873, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdvfthx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt94pk/im_in_my_final_semester_i_think_i_need_tips_to/hdvfthx/", "text": "You have done a great job getting A's throughout your previous courses.

You are near the end & you see these assignments as arbitrary & almost pointless. So it's hard to get motivated\n\n2- You're psychologically preparing yourself for the period in your life when you *won't* have to do these assignments, and being 5th year, that means a good portion of the last few years of your life has been centered around school. Your brain is attempting to \"make it last\" (for lack of a better term) because you're preparing for a big shift in school responsibilities.\n\nThe only way out is through.", "author": "BarIntelligent9156", "created": 1632323463, "upvotes": 2}}}
