I came in expecting to make a boatload of life long friends and eventually they either flunked out or because distant. So, I joined a fraternity. From what people in other colleges tell me it\u2019s that either joining a frat or a sports team ensures that you get a group that goes out aside from friends that I\u2019ve made over time. \n\nJust join whatever organizations that pertain to your interests. Study and work hard to keep yourself from fixating on negative issues. At the end of the day your gpa and resume are the most important of all. Regularly keep in touch with your family and other friends too. If you follow all the above advice you\u2019ll do much better. Good luck! :)",

Except I don't like the people in my hall and my floor already has groups of people who are constantly having fun and making the best of their college lives. \n\nI have a 17 credit course load. So naturally I have many classes but when I get back it's just to my dorm and then back to classes. So far what's been happening is that I say hi to people and start talking but they remain acquaintances. And in my college people tend to stick to their high school groups or hall mates, both of which are not options for me. I don't like partying or drinking so there go 2 of the most social activities. \n\nThere doesn't seem to be a solution to this problem.  People keep saying I need to find my 'type' of people but it's really hard to do so. I might just stop dorming next semester so at least I can go home everyday instead of deal with noise and shitty bathrooms",

      "text": "I am but I don't feel too bad about it, I just have a feeling that I'm missing out on opportunities to meet certain people. I am a shy introvert/ambivertish who used to have social anxiety in high school; It wasn't bullying or the teachers, it was the system. Being forced to wake up early and become enslaved to a desk for 8 hours is the best way to make me soulless. After high school I was able to heal myself by taking a year to read some psychology/philosophy (Carl Jung & Alan Watts in particular). However, I'm still shy and socially awkward, but if the environment is right I can become a great conversationalist. \n\nAnd so now, this is my first year of college (Age 19) and I haven't socially interacted (besides group discussions) with anyone nor have I participated in any events. What I do feel bad about is that there are people who I would like to know based on my observations of them but I don't know what to do. I am absolutely horrid at initiating a person-to-person relationship but once that is out of the way I feel like I can get by. \n\nHowever, something personal to me is that I value my solitude and I have a hard time relating to most people. I feel that a majority of people seem fake, an over inflated ego, or just wouldn't work well. As I said earlier I rely on my observations of whom I find interesting which are a very select few out of hundreds. Quite often the people I'm most interested in are the ones who seem curious about me (I have a mysterious/peaceful aura which seems to catch eyes of curious individuals of whom are my favorite to relate with) but I haven't acted out on any of these individuals.\n\nSorry if it seems that I'm rambling a bunch of nonsense but I found myself doing this to be therapeutic. Helps me organize my thoughts on the situation I'm currently dealing with. But as the numerous up-votes and comments of people feeling the same way of being lonely in college the definite answer is yes; a lot of us feel lonely in college. I don't have any advice because I'm in the same boat and this is my 5th week of college, but be sure to make yourself the person you love most.",

      "text": "A few weeks ago a guy--really sweat, and friendly--wanted to be friends with me. I tried opening up to him--I really want to be friends with him--but as the weeks progressed he seemed less talkative. Most of my focus is on my grades and, whenever we're in a lecture, he wants to talk-- I can't help but cut the conversations off as I'm already struggling and getting bad grades in most of my classes. I barely have time throughout the entire week--17 credits which include three major classes (three two hour labs) and 2 two-hour tutor sessions. The rest of the time and the weekends are used for studying or to catch a breath--and as an introvert, that means staying in the dorm to read or paint. We don't talk like we did before the semester started--and I just feel so guilty. In fact, I've been falling short in making connections with many people ever since I've taken up this bachelor program--which is why I wonder if my moderate lack of interest in the degree is indirectly affecting my social life. I stay up at night drawing or writing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's one bachelor program that I wish to be in, but--even with family connections in the industry I want to go in--it won't secure my life. I'm always looking for help with my homework, which I'm ashamed of since I barely understand what's going on and often ask for a whole explanation--which takes up others time. My parents are only supporting my college education if I stick to what they said I should take--I was even told that I'd have to find a new home if I switched. If that were the case I wouldn't be able to attend college at all. This was from my mother, but my father said he just wants to see me happy--even though I know he wouldn't support me if I took what I wanted. I've been telling myself I can do this major--and I can--but my heart's not in it. Which would explain why it's so hard to make friends in that particular major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've made a few other friends since freshman year, like ten other people, but I'm always too tired to put in the effort to hang out. I fall into the habit of closing myself off from people, even my family, because I feel like I can't reach their expectations. I don't smoke weed or do any sort of drugs so if I go to a party it's just awkward (I've done it before). The majority of the friends I've made do weed and such--which only makes it slightly harder to connect. I've joined clubs where I thought my real interests would spark relationships, but I couldn't fit in. I'm planning to do a sport, but with a schedule like that, how?",

Both my brothers went to the same college that I do and kept raving about how it was the best 4 years of their life. If these are supposed to be the best 4 years of life, then I'm screwed. I mean, the academics are great and I love my classes and professors. But socially, I feel so alone and out of place. I always see people who already have big friend groups and go out all the time and I feel like I missed the boat. I've joined clubs and I've tried to go out to things, but I haven't really connected with anybody on that deeper level of friendship. I know there's always the option to join Greek life, but I'm avoiding it as my absolute last option because of the price and extreme time commitment. Idk maybe it just takes longer to find those good relationships in college as it does in high school.",

I was similar unless i understood that its me who i need to focus on first, i gave some time to myself , enhancing skills(everything in general) and then some of the other being wanted my help in some or the other way, i hence became \"mr worldwide\" . One thing I analysed that playing sports is better way of making friends. Let us assume you are good at some sport, go to play it daily , ask random peeps to join you/join them. Then get into casual talks, and ask if they play daily and can u play with them. The team games are most effective in these situations be it soccer",

I met my best friend at a cheesy welcome week event. Whether it's campus ministries, philanthropic groups, student government, honor societies within your major, or the debate team, I promise you, there is something for you. \n\nSome people can just find their people. I am not one of those people. It's okay to need a structured activity to get out of the acquaintance zone into \"buddy I'd actually hang out with\" territory. This is how it is post-college too. \n\nIf you don't know where to start, try with the office for student activities/campus life, etc. They probably have a master list. You can also hit up the International Student office. They often have \"conversation partner\" programs where you get paired with an international student who wants to practice their English. They also host events for international students since they also often have trouble mingling on campus. I used to work at my school's Office of Global Education. We were thrilled when Americans actually wanted to get to know international students. It really broadens your horizons. Finally, volunteer. This is how you meet truly awesome people you can respect and build lasting friendships with. The math department might tutor at a local elementary school, for instance. Hundreds of universities participate in the Big Event, a campus-wide community service day of MLK. This will attract kind people and filter our a lot of jerks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf all this fails, go off-campus.  Join fitness classes and try to be consistent. This way you'll see the same people every time. Again, volunteer! I showed up every week to help at a food pantry, and I got more out of it than the people I was helping. I made great friends, many of whom happened to go to my school. Churches in college towns usually have college groups that will meet weekly and host fun events like Super Bowl parties or canoeing trips that are designed to be accessible for people who may not come from that faith tradition. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you just can't make friends through any of these structured activities, make it happen yourself.  A big exam is coming up? Get a study group together. Just pick a time and a place and tell people all about it. Preferably bring food. It's amazing how food can open people's hearts. Get a board game like Balderdash or Catan and just ask people in your dorm if they want to play. If you're in a dorm, go to the kitchen and bake something. People will come in to microwave their ramen. Perfect window to strike up conversation. And, of course offer them some of what you're making. Knock on your neighbor's door and ask to borrow something like tape or printer paper. It's small, but it makes people feel like you are relatable. Treat people like they are part of your community and they'll start to believe ti. Try to spend more time in third spaces like the cafeteria or the less shushed corners of the library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you a freshman? It seems like everyone is already cliqued up, but it's totally okay to not have BFFs by September. The people who tend to find a group immediately haven't really formed deep connections, but rather are mutually clingy people who had to have someone NOW. These friend circles tend to implode, and the people in them crash and burn because they have no other community. Slow and steady is a perfectly fine way to build up your friendships.",

Commuting makes it less lonely in a way, which I'm grateful for.\nAlso it's easier to bond with people in your major once you get up to 200s and 300s courses within your field. \nI wasn't very proactive about trying to make friends when I lived on campus because no sports/clubs interested me and I didn't get along with the folks in my dorm. \nI wish you the best. It makes all the difference in the world if you can make even just one good friend.",

My roommates are all partying bro/jock types and since I knew nobody else, I hung out with them... Felt like a massive third wheel and literally wanted to change schools... I pushed myself to join organizations and attended a volunteer club which led to 1 friendship, and that friendship opened the door to her group. The craziest thing was that I went to another club and met someone that also attended the volunteer event so we ended hanging out and she introduced me to another group!\n\nI\u2019m not saying this works for everyone, but I know how it feels to be out of place and trust me, there are like-minded people out there so give yourself the opportunities and chances to meet these people! You\u2019ll increase the odds of finding the right people if you go out and do stuff, even if it\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t normally do! Hope this helps :)",

I was just simply walking with my earbuds in my ears blasting music minding my own business when two of my colleagues came from behind and said \"oh so you are also going this way home?\" I said \"yeah\" and we started talking and by the end of the road we agreed to meet the next day so we can all go together to some lectures. So we started to meet and talk some more and more and we met some other people and we started going out, having parties, hangovers, smoke session's, we met some girls and went on trips together. Next thing you know we are looking to rent a house for the next year of college.\n\nRight now I'm in my four bedroom house with my three best friends getting ready for the next year.\n\nThe thing I'm trying to say is that there is no need to rush anywhere or force anything. Friends will find you as well you will find them... Sooner or later. (good things come to those who wait)... Just don't be isolated all the time. :)",

I kind of felt alone at first, but I've learned a few things. \n\nOnce you start taking your courses that are specific to your major, the population drops. Most of my 300/400 level classes have similar faces, this can really help out. You definitely have similar goals and likings, and the classes tend to get smaller eventually.  I now have multiple friends in my program since we have either formed a study group, partnered in class, or collaborated on a project once. That brief introduction is all you need to become familiar with each other.\n\nThis semester, I've introduced myself to about 3 people outside my major through meeting at the gym. I'm a gym rat, I love weightlifting and aspire to become my strongest self. Going 5/6 times a week allowed for me to recognize who else attends that frequently. Eventually, I wanted some advice on deadlifts so I went to a guy who is there constantly and is very strong + seems to be super social. I introduced myself and asked if he could recommend me anything. He now says hi to me every time we're at the gym and has introduced me to 2 other gym rats. Despite all of us being different body types and having different goals, we all have the same hobby.\n\nAs for other hobbies, I love PC gaming and esports. I found out my statewide university has an Esports association on Discord and joined. Now I speak with people about all my interests: CSGO, Runescape, Fortnite, whatever. Hell, there's even a meme discussion board.",

              "text": "I think part of the problem is the school and where the school is located. I\u2019m a community college student in San Diego. Now, San Diego is known for being a city with lots of beer feats and SDSU is kind of a party school. Whereas UCSD is \u201csocially dead\u201d and more prestigious. \n\nSome of the people I\u2019ve encountered ended up making friends and having experiences by going to the parties and events at other schools. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should go to parties, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s your scene (and it\u2019s not mine either), but why not try going to your school\u2019s events or events at nearby schools? That or maybe try volunteering/joining clubs for things that interest you or help you towards your career path? \n\nJust some thoughts. I\u2019m not really a social person, I spend most of my time studying and I have grown to enjoy being alone. I think college is a time when you learn to feel comfortable with not having people around you all the time and the scariest part is the transition phase when the loneliness hits.\n\nThat being said, you can try making friends with someone in class by asking what their major is and if they\u2019d like to study with you sometime. It\u2019s not guaranteed to work, but your vibe attracts your tribe! Feign confidence if you have to. If you\u2019re friendly and smile when you speak with people, they are more likely to give positive feedback. So good luck :)",

It was such an eclectic sampling of the campus, and I made lifelong friends. Fortunately, at my campus, they were heavily regulated (very strict hazing policy, no frat/sorority houses), and they were much more affordable, so not every one will have that experience.

No. I\u2019ll spiral out of control. I already am tbqh. So I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019d suggest OP (or anyone else reading this) get out of their comfort zone and join clubs or study groups, but if they\u2019re not happy where they\u2019re currently enrolled they should definitely consider transferring.

Do the things you enjoy even if you're alone. Are you involved on campus at all? That can help sometimes. I have also started going to counseling this semester for other reasons, but it's helping me a lot being more comfortable with myself in general. If your school has counseling in any capacity, I would suggest going. I'm really sorry you're feeling this too, college can be hard:(",

As for weed, that's something I prefer to do alone\u2014so no stoner groups for me.\n\nIronically the one type of person I've felt comfortable with is the professor.

I kind of just want to move onto my professional life, as I've always for some reason had a better social time in work environments.

Instead we all had different classes at different times, and that\u2019s where my loneliness started. I found myself spending hours in my dorm doing nothing but watching shows and gaming. What really hit home was this weekend, 2 of them went back home for a short visit and the other one had his parents come for parent week.

Don't think that you have to block off friendships and socializing to get good grades. I used to think that too and realized it made no sense. The two aren't mutually exclusive!

I may need to try to change mid semester.",

I found I had this feeling that I was a burden or nagging if I asked to hang out again, but that\u2019s usually not the case. I think in being over sensitive to how people might feel about me I just preferred to avoid the possibility of annoying people. Basically, understand that you\u2019re probably not as unlikable as you think and that relationships take time.",

Long story short I\u2019m a 5th year right now, all of my friends have graduated slowly but surely. All of those friends were from a sports club I joined freshman year. \n\nMy best friends though come from work. My coworkers and I hang out like 3 days a week. Over the summer it was like 7 days a week. I\u2019d highly suggest getting a job somewhere and trying to bond with those people since you have to talk to them. \n\nTLDR: best place to make friends is through work or a (sports)club. Not the dorms or classes from my experiences.",
