I am a shy introvert/ambivertish who used to have social anxiety in high school; It wasn't bullying or the teachers, it was the system. Being forced to wake up early and become enslaved to a desk for 8 hours is the best way to make me soulless. After high school I was able to heal myself by taking a year to read some psychology/philosophy (Carl Jung & Alan Watts in particular). However, I'm still shy and socially awkward, but if the environment is right I can become a great conversationalist. \n\nAnd so now, this is my first year of college (Age 19) and I haven't socially interacted (besides group discussions) with anyone nor have I participated in any events. What I do feel bad about is that there are people who I would like to know based on my observations of them but I don't know what to do. I am absolutely horrid at initiating a person-to-person relationship but once that is out of the way I feel like I can get by. \n\nHowever, something personal to me is that I value my solitude and I have a hard time relating to most people. I feel that a majority of people seem fake, an over inflated ego, or just wouldn't work well. As I said earlier I rely on my observations of whom I find interesting which are a very select few out of hundreds. Quite often the people I'm most interested in are the ones who seem curious about me (I have a mysterious/peaceful aura which seems to catch eyes of curious individuals of whom are my favorite to relate with) but I haven't acted out on any of these individuals.\n\nSorry if it seems that I'm rambling a bunch of nonsense but I found myself doing this to be therapeutic. Helps me organize my thoughts on the situation I'm currently dealing with. But as the numerous up-votes and comments of people feeling the same way of being lonely in college the definite answer is yes; a lot of us feel lonely in college.

I tried opening up to him--I really want to be friends with him--but as the weeks progressed he seemed less talkative. Most of my focus is on my grades and, whenever we're in a lecture, he wants to talk-- I can't help but cut the conversations off as I'm already struggling and getting bad grades in most of my classes. I barely have time throughout the entire week--17 credits which include three major classes (three two hour labs) and 2 two-hour tutor sessions. The rest of the time and the weekends are used for studying or to catch a breath--and as an introvert, that means staying in the dorm to read or paint. We don't talk like we did before the semester started--and I just feel so guilty. In fact, I've been falling short in making connections with many people ever since I've taken up this bachelor program--which is why I wonder if my moderate lack of interest in the degree is indirectly affecting my social life. I stay up at night drawing or writing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's one bachelor program that I wish to be in, but--even with family connections in the industry I want to go in--it won't secure my life. I'm always looking for help with my homework, which I'm ashamed of since I barely understand what's going on and often ask for a whole explanation--which takes up others time. My parents are only supporting my college education if I stick to what they said I should take--I was even told that I'd have to find a new home if I switched. If that were the case I wouldn't be able to attend college at all. This was from my mother, but my father said he just wants to see me happy--even though I know he wouldn't support me if I took what I wanted. I've been telling myself I can do this major--and I can--but my heart's not in it. Which would explain why it's so hard to make friends in that particular major.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've made a few other friends since freshman year, like ten other people, but I'm always too tired to put in the effort to hang out.

I don't smoke weed or do any sort of drugs so if I go to a party it's just awkward (I've done it before).

You don't have to commit to all of them, just one or two that seem meaningful to you. I met my now-husband at a political interest group. I met my best friend at a cheesy welcome week event. Whether it's campus ministries, philanthropic groups, student government, honor societies within your major, or the debate team, I promise you, there is something for you. \n\nSome people can just find their people. I am not one of those people. It's okay to need a structured activity to get out of the acquaintance zone into \"buddy I'd actually hang out with\" territory. This is how it is post-college too. \n\nIf you don't know where to start, try with the office for student activities/campus life, etc. They probably have a master list. You can also hit up the International Student office. They often have \"conversation partner\" programs where you get paired with an international student who wants to practice their English. They also host events for international students since they also often have trouble mingling on campus. I used to work at my school's Office of Global Education. We were thrilled when Americans actually wanted to get to know international students. It really broadens your horizons. Finally, volunteer. This is how you meet truly awesome people you can respect and build lasting friendships with. The math department might tutor at a local elementary school, for instance. Hundreds of universities participate in the Big Event, a campus-wide community service day of MLK. This will attract kind people and filter our a lot of jerks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf all this fails, go off-campus.  Join fitness classes and try to be consistent. This way you'll see the same people every time. Again, volunteer! I showed up every week to help at a food pantry, and I got more out of it than the people I was helping. I made great friends, many of whom happened to go to my school. Churches in college towns usually have college groups that will meet weekly and host fun events like Super Bowl parties or canoeing trips that are designed to be accessible for people who may not come from that faith tradition. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you just can't make friends through any of these structured activities, make it happen yourself.  A big exam is coming up? Get a study group together. Just pick a time and a place and tell people all about it. Preferably bring food. It's amazing how food can open people's hearts. Get a board game like Balderdash or Catan and just ask people in your dorm if they want to play. If you're in a dorm, go to the kitchen and bake something. People will come in to microwave their ramen. Perfect window to strike up conversation. And, of course offer them some of what you're making. Knock on your neighbor's door and ask to borrow something like tape or printer paper. It's small, but it makes people feel like you are relatable. Treat people like they are part of your community and they'll start to believe ti. Try to spend more time in third spaces like the cafeteria or the less shushed corners of the library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you a freshman? It seems like everyone is already cliqued up, but it's totally okay to not have BFFs by September. The people who tend to find a group immediately haven't really formed deep connections, but rather are mutually clingy people who had to have someone NOW. These friend circles tend to implode, and the people in them crash and burn because they have no other community. Slow and steady is a perfectly fine way to build up your friendships.", "author": "alextriedreddit", "created": 1568774147, "upvotes": 1}, "f0nm6bp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/d5kja1/anyone_else_kinda_lonely_in_college/f0nm6bp/", "text": "Just some clubs that interest you, that\u2019s the easiest way to meet new people!

Most of my 300/400 level classes have similar faces, this can really help out. You definitely have similar goals and likings, and the classes tend to get smaller eventually.  I now have multiple friends in my program since we have either formed a study group, partnered in class, or collaborated on a project once. That brief introduction is all you need to become familiar with each other.\n\nThis semester, I've introduced myself to about 3 people outside my major through meeting at the gym. I'm a gym rat, I love weightlifting and aspire to become my strongest self. Going 5/6 times a week allowed for me to recognize who else attends that frequently. Eventually, I wanted some advice on deadlifts so I went to a guy who is there constantly and is very strong + seems to be super social. I introduced myself and asked if he could recommend me anything. He now says hi to me every time we're at the gym and has introduced me to 2 other gym rats. Despite all of us being different body types and having different goals, we all have the same hobby.\n\nAs for other hobbies, I love PC gaming and esports. I found out my statewide university has an Esports association on Discord and joined. Now I speak with people about all my interests: CSGO, Runescape, Fortnite, whatever.
