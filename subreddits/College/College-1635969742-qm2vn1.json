  "text": "I am thinking of dropping Biomedical Engineering and switching to business because I simply do not enjoy heavy math. I have done some research and found some good business majors are Finance, Accounting, and MIS. What really drew my attention was MIS and Finance and I was wondering which one of the two would be better to switch into? For context, I go to SJSU and there are some other business majors here too. There are also accounting info systems, bus analytics, and corporate accounting and finance. Which one of these majors would be good in the long run (career-wise and internship-wise). So far I am leaning towards MIS but some other suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "text": "Finance and accounting go hand and hand so it would be smart to double major because most clases overlap and for the state I\u2019m in, you need 140 credits to take the CPA exam and what happens towards your final years is that you\u2019ll end up taking a lot of elective classes if you were to only go into accounting, but taking those finance classes you\u2019ll take less electives and you\u2019ll get that double major.",
