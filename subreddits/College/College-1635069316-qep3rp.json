  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm curious to know what you think? \n\nTogether with a group of friends, as part of our student project, We have undertaken to change the way we learn at universities.\n\nBy talking to hundreds of university students from different education systems, one conclusion has emerged - learning at university in its current form is just inefficient and boring.\n\nAt the same time, instead of gamification, which we assumed at the beginning, most people gave a simple socialization of the process of gaining knowledge as a solution.\n\nAfter many months of hard work in a small team, in two weeks' time we are launching a social learning app that allows, first of all, to easily find a group of people who are learning exactly the same thing as we are at any given time to learn with them through brainstorming, as well as to easy digitalize and segregate all study materials in one place, like on a drive.\n\nRecently, more and more people, who believe that a change in education can only be initiated by the students themselves, not the universities, are joining the project (DM if you want to join too).\n\nSorry for such a long message, but I didn't want to leave anything out \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",
