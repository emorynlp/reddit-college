So I can only take other Engineering Majors. I can take computer engineering but that's basically the same with software engineering, and the rest are Mechanical, electrical and Civil engineering.\n\nSo my question is it worth it to have a double major in two engineering majors?", "author": "Ok_Perspective599", "created": 1632126026, "retrieved": 1632801401, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdkwsjk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prqhx1/should_i_take_a_double_major/hdkwsjk/", "text": "im doing a dual degree rn which is like getting 2 bachelors degrees at once and it\u2019s hard. so if u feel like the other major won\u2019t add anything to ur degree and ur not passionate about it then don\u2019t do it", "author": "EdelwoodOil", "created": 1632139032, "upvotes": 1}, "hdkw2al": {"link": "/r/college/comments/prqhx1/should_i_take_a_double_major/hdkw2al/", "text": "I did a double major in physics and astronomy (with a minor in music.
