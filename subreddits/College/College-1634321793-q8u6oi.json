  "text": "Hello!\n\nI've always heard that going to professor's office hours is great to knowing and getting closer to professors for research opportunities, recommendations for Master's Programs, etc. However, I'm not really sure what to do during office hours.\n\nAs an introvert, I sometimes have no clue what to ask the professor. I've asked basic things about the class, basic fundamental questions, and generic questions about research opportunities, but how do I go further and ask more meaningful questions and form stronger connections? I think I may be applying for a Master's program soon, so I would need at least 3 recommendations for that. Honestly, I think although I've been to a couple of office hours, I doubt the professors even know my name because my questions are quite generic. Thanks!",
