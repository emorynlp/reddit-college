  "text": "How do I keep up with a bunch of readings and do assignments on time and not turn them all in at exactly 11:59 pm? \n\nHow do I pace myself in readings and keep consistent?\n\nAnd how do I actually work continuously on something until completion? I have a bad tendency of eleventh hour finishes that could have been avoided had I actually just finished it earlier. \n\nAnd one final question, how best to avoid procrastination and make more efficient my worktime?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*All answers must be two pages in length, double-spaced, using 12pt times new roman font, w/1 inch margins.

I'd always work on stuff the day it was assigned.\n\nThat means no hanging out to play games no going out to eat with friends unless i was already heading to eat, no sports etc until my stuff for the week was done.\n\nMost weeks I got all my stuff done by Thursday and had the other days to chill. Some weeks i was busy all week and had to skip fun to get shit done but i had ever had to turn anything in last minute.\n\nThat alone was worth having to skip fun some weeks.",

      "text": "It's pretty hard to break a procrastination habit, so I can only speak on what worked for me. Starting an assignment (not necessarily finishing it) the day it's assigned, or at least the next day helped keep me on track. I hate leaving tasks unfinished, so knowing I had an assignment to keep working on gave me an extra push. Often it's actually starting the assignment that's the hard part. Also, give yourself some micro-breaks to absorb what you're reading. If it's a long reading, take a few breathers halfway through, every third of the way, etc. Just make sure these don't transpire into long breaks that distract you from getting back to it -- set timers and reminders on your phone if you need to.",

      "text": "Something that really helped me in undergrad and still does in grad school is to find people you can study with. Like actually study not just socialize and say you are studying. I had a group of four friends where we would sit in one of our rooms and do 15-45 minutes of work and then 5 minutes breaks. And in the break time we had to report and show the group what we had been working on to hold each other accountable. It was incredibly efficient. \n\nTo this day, some of these friends and I will hop on zoom when we need to get work done. We mute each other, but just having that other person on the screen and knowing they can see you if you are goofing off is still very effective at motivating. \n\nI also used to use rewards. i.e. \"If I finish reading this before 11 today I can go to the student stores and buy ice cream.\" But that does take some self control because if you are the one rewarding yourself you have to hold yourself accountable.",

      "text": "This is like... the most incredibly common thing with my younger peers. It's crazy. \n\nThe funny thing is, no matter *when* you do it, you still have to do the work. The amount of work that you have to do is literally the same. It's silly. \n\nMake yourself to everything the day before. Essentially tell yourself that it's due the day before and get it done then. \n\nThis is such a strange concept to me. The solution is terribly simple; do it earlier. There's absolutely no excuse other than low discipline. Develop discipline to get it done before it has to be due. You don't have anything better to do because your job right now is to be a student. \n\nThere's no secret sauce. You just need to get your stuff done earlier. The only way to do that is to just do it earlier. For one, it reduces stress by a cubic fuck ton. You'll be so much less stressed out if you get it done earlier. Plus, you can go to bed at a decent time and get good rest. \n\nJust do it. It's your job.",
