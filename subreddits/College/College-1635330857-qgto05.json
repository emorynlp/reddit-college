  "text": "I have a meeting today with my professors for a project I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s over zoom, but I have class right after so I figured I\u2019d drive in so I wouldn\u2019t be rushing out of the house after. Anyhow, as I was driving, my car sputtered and stopped like halfway up a hill and drifted backwards. The brakes didn\u2019t work so I drove back into a ditch and I was able to get it stopped. The car is fine, but I was told it will be over an hour before I can get towed. I want to just cancel the meeting at this point and ask if we can push it to another day. Do you think the professors will understand? I\u2019m supposed to be presenting to them but the service kind of sucks out here and I\u2019d rather not do it in my car.",
