  "title:": "Thinking of getting an online degree from a public college but",
  "text": "This may seem like a strange question, but if I get a degree from a public college online like Florida or Arizona State (strictly using as an example) would it be weird for me to act as a proud alum of that college or would I seem weird supporting my university and when people ask me where I went to college and have to follow up with \u201cI did it online\u201d\n\nA big motivation for this so I can be a part of a community, networking and expanding knowledge my overall knowledge. I know a lot of you may say who cares what other people think but I guess I want the university experience without the social aspect of it and once I graduate I want to be a big supporter of that university. Is that weird if I am just an \u201conline student\u201d?",

      "text": "Not weird at all! Once you get into your major you'll notice the same people in your classes as you interact and it builds a relationship without even trying. On that level also, you interact quite a bit with professors through Zoom. I have even had a professor in an online class have us make flipgrid videos for discussions instead of normal discussion boards. I don't take all of my courses online, but you have just as much right to feel like a proud alum than anyone else!",

I think it would be weird to have a flag or some thing at your front door if you got a certificate but some people are fans of a university and never went or got a degree so maybe it\u2019s not off base.",
