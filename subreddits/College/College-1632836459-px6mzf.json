However, because this get together is associated with a school function and people in the US are weird about alcohol, it's best to err on the side of not bringing alcohol just in case a student or someone in administration at the school gets upset and puts up a stink about it. It would *probably* be safe, but since it's not a 100% guarantee, you should avoid it. For all future non-school related get togethers of a similar quality, wine is an appropriate choice (unless you know your host is a recovering alcoholic-- then avoid at all costs). \n\nAs for what you should bring, appetizers or desserts are always a safe bet. Also something like soda or lemonade is also okay.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632843607, "upvotes": 4}, "helnf1d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px6mzf/invited_to_party_at_professors_house/helnf1d/", "text": "If you\u2019re unsure, I would bring an appetizer.
