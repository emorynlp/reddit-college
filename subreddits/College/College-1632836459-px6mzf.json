  "text": "A professor invited me to a get together this weekend at their house. They invited everyone in a club they run, although the majority of the people are not undergrad students but grad students. I\u2019m an undergrad student and am not sure what to do.\n\nThey said we should all bring stuff to eat/drink. I can drink legally, but should I bring a bottle of wine or some beer to share? I\u2019m not sure what the etiquette is for BYO drinks with adults.",

However, because this get together is associated with a school function and people in the US are weird about alcohol, it's best to err on the side of not bringing alcohol just in case a student or someone in administration at the school gets upset and puts up a stink about it. It would *probably* be safe, but since it's not a 100% guarantee, you should avoid it. For all future non-school related get togethers of a similar quality, wine is an appropriate choice (unless you know your host is a recovering alcoholic-- then avoid at all costs). \n\nAs for what you should bring, appetizers or desserts are always a safe bet. Also something like soda or lemonade is also okay.",

          "text": "I think you\u2019re right. I\u2019m from a part of the country where drinking is super common and not inappropriate, but it\u2019s best to play it safe. I was mostly confused about it being BYO as I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant I wasn\u2019t supposed to bring things to share. But a dessert or an appetizer seems perfect because people can just have a little if they want it and if they don\u2019t want to share they don\u2019t have to eat it. Thanks!",
