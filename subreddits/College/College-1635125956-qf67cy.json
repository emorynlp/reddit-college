  "title:": "Mystery of Item Vanished from Dorm Room",
  "text": "I keep my belongings organized for the most part because tidy environments just makes me feel better. This one item just seemingly vanished into thin air. I searched my entire closet (re-organizing sections at a time), desk drawers, and dresser, but it didn't turn up.\n\nIt's of no sentimental value, little monetary value (just $10+tax), but the fact that it is nowhere to be found is a little unnerving. \n\nRoommates and I agreed on a 'No Sharing' and No Guest policy, so it's not possible they are using it. They wouldn't have stolen it either cause its just an everyday item they have also.\n\nIt's just super peculiar that I can't find it!\n\nHas this happened to anyone, when something from your dorm room just seemed to have vanished into thin air?",

      "text": "I have accidentally thrown away things that I did not mean to when I had them in my hand and went to throw out something else. I have thrown away forks, oven mitts, and once even a checkbook. Fortunately, I figured those out and dug them out before the trash was gone for good, but whenever something vanishes, I consider it a possibility I threw it out by mistake. \n\nOr accidentally put it somewhere it didn\u2019t belong. I once lost an important tax document and had to get it replaced. YEARS later, I found it stuck to the back of the manual for an appliance I had filed away.",
