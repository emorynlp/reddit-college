Given it is a 200 person class, bigger groups mean less papers to read, i get it, but come on you really expect 10 college age people to cooperate on it with no problems? Ive had roommates who can\u2019t even throw the garbage away let alone do something thats worth 60% of their grade in a timely manner! \n\nOne month into the semester we\u2019ve chosen a topic already and are supposed to turn in an outline. Easy enough right? Just come up with subtopics and assign different parts to different people. Ha, of course not why would it ever be that easy. Came up with the outline on a Monday with two other graciously responsible group members. Annoyed that the other seven haven\u2019t said anything but whatever, benefit of the doubt given because we all have stuff to deal with. All we asked was for the other seven to pick whatever subtopic they wanna do and we\u2019ll take whats  leftover. Wednesday comes around no response, message them again using any method possible nothing. Same thing continues till Sunday, the day its due. Half respond around noon making my life less stressful knowing at least they\u2019re just procrastinators or just too busy. Cue the medical excuses because i guess we\u2019re all just bedridden apparently. 2 of them say they\u2019re sorry and were bedridden last 3 weeks i guess and are now ready to work ok it. Annoying but fine at least they responded so now theres just one person left. 11:59 rolls around, nothing. Take it upon myself to cover two subtopics because they cant be asked to respond. Heres the fun part. One week AFTER it was due, the dude has the nerve to message us asking if theres anything he can do otherwise he\u2019s gonna fail. My man must\u2019ve told the prof we weren\u2019t responding because an hour later the prof messages us asking if he can participate because he was bedridden as well. As passive aggressive as i could be i messaged him which subtopic he wanted to do because im about done with this project right now, i have other things to work on too. He chooses and we\u2019re all happy and have a topic we\u2019re responsible for.\n\nFast forward two months to today and I\u2019m fuming. Every other week since the outline we\u2019ve been having meetings to see if anyone needs help and if they\u2019re working on the project. Only around half show up while the other half filter in and out. Two of them never show up, including the guy who didn\u2019t reply to the outline. My dumbass didn\u2019t notice this obvious red flag and just thought, oh they\u2019re busy they\u2019re probably fine. I finish my part of the project early because its not the only essay i have to write this week. I put it in the shared doc and ask everyone to submit it by Sunday and I\u2019ll proofread it. Friday comes by one person other than myself has added their part. It\u2019s fine right? The group is probably just working or procrastinating they\u2019ll do it on Saturday or Sunday. Saturday, no changes to the doc whatsoever, i nag the group again just to relieve some stress building up. Sunday oh look at least half have now added their parts. I read it and you can tell it\u2019s shittiest piece of writing I\u2019ve seen. Whatever, at least they turned it in i guess, as long as it explains what it needs to. 9 pm rolls around all but 3 have added to the doc. One said they\u2019re working on it and the two that havent been to the meetings are dead silent and haven\u2019t posted anything yet. I do get worried but hey its three hours before i have to submit it. 11 pm i email everyone that im proofreading and that if they NEED to add it now. 11:45 Nobody has added anything since, missing three whole sections of the paper, fml. Me still being optimistic email them once more asking if people still need to submit, if they do, do it now before i submit. No response. 11:57 i go to post this shitty paper and fuming because i know for sure its a shitty piece of work i just turned in. Hey nothing i can do right, its about the Experience even if its 60% of my grade just gone. The only experience I\u2019ve gained from this is doing a group project sucks. Absolutely ridiculous prof\u2019s still think group projects are a great idea, let alone one with 10 people.", "author": "Rithielz", "created": 1620021061, "retrieved": 1632947957, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 629, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gwuxj1d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n3p1wr/im_literally_losing_my_mind_over_this_dumb_10/gwuxj1d/", "text": " My professors always grade based on contributions as well as the project itself.

Again, that is very career related.   Continuous gentle prodding (reminders of deadlines, etc.) to the poor students will usually get them to do work.
