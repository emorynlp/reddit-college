The \"public\" in public school is that it has been chartered by its state (or Congress, in the case of 5 DC-based schools) and, in turn, gets its funding _primarily_ from state appropriations.\n\nI only mention it as a reminder to others that state governments set public universities' budgets...keep that in mind when it's time to vote in state and local elections.",
