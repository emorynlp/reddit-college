  "text": "Genuinely curious. My university is implementing a proctoring software across the entire campus this semester, and students have been pretty much in an uproar because it was unannounced partway through the semester. A lot of people aren't keen on using it on their devices, some people have horror stories about when they tried it last year, some have used it during midterms and had issues. \n\nSo we had a townhall, and the lecturer that spoke said that if they don't use this software, they'll lose their accreditation. Obviously there's nothing that can be done about it, just curious about it.",

      "text": "My college explains it certain programs may not recognize credits from an online course that does not proctor exams. I assume it may affect the credibility of a college and their degree programs if students have the access to cheat on their exams.\n\nI don\u2019t like proctored exams since I don\u2019t like the idea of people watching my every move. But I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry.",
