You might be the opposite but just try different things until you find something that works.",

In reality, I\u2019ve met very few that have a longer attention span than 1-2 hours without several shorter breaks or at least one longer break. I could go on and on about this topic\u2026. The 8 hour work day is unnatural blah blah blah. Point is, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you.",

I get that what we are doing is kind of unnatural (even the 8 hour day was supposed to work with a spouse at home taking care of chores - 8 hours of work 8 of rest and 8 for whatever was the original), but the point is that it's kind of what's required to survive in society. Does that make sense?",

But I try not to stress myself out, once I start getting angry or anxious because I'm not getting something I quit and revisit it the next day.\n\nI'll also do flashcards for terms or previous quiz questions for every class, every day outside of that. I stared out with a few terms and just add about 10 more per class every week. I'm so good at those I can do cards for all 5 of my classes in about 20 minutes, I usually do them at work, they've saved me multiple times on tests.",
