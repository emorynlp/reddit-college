So take MyMathLab......they offer the e-text for $126 while the actual print book costs $150. It seems like a deal until you realize you can't buy the damn book used anymore. \n\n3. Some colleges are using the publisher systems (MyMathLab, Cengage Mindtap, etc) for online courses while bundling the e-text. The only problem these systems do not give you access to the material without paying the publisher.
