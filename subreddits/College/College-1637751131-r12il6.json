  "text": "I\u2019m a 29 year old college student transferring to a university next semester. I\u2019m an English major and some intersectionality classes are required. I\u2019ve heard about these types of classes being cult-like.\nIf I hear something that i feel is wrong I might speak up in class. Also, if I pushback against an idea in a paper will they be biased against my paper?",

      "text": "No, classes that acknowledge that race, gender, sexuality and the like have an effect in the world including in combination are not cultlike. Nobody's trying to brainwash you. They're reaching out to you so you can learn about the world from perspectives that aren't your own. If you push back on an idea intelligently, rationally, based on evidence and grounded in academic (not conspiratorial) theory, you won't get a biased grading. If you push back for the sake of pushing back because you obviously decided in advance that exposure to other perspectives is bad and only meant to hurt YOU, you will get a grade you deserve.",

It seems like today if you do not have progressive beliefs, even as a black man, then your the enemy to a lot of these people so I don\u2019t want a situation where a teacher is biased against me.",

              "text": "These are academic courses not elections. Approach your academic work responsibly. Do your readings and academic research for papers. You'll be fine. People who teach these subjects are not out to get you. Nobody will be grading your personal beliefs. If you're even ever asked for them, it won't be the stance that's graded. That's just now how academia works. Take the chip of fear off your shoulder and go learn things you didn't have an opportunity to learn before.",

      "text": "I can't speak to intersectionality classes in particular, but my wife was an English major and often had differing opinions from her classmates or peers in those classes. She never got in trouble, but there were several classes she was never called on to share her thoughts, and a few where the professors or student proofreaders wouldn't allow for stylistic differences in writing and she just had to write counter to her chosen style and direction. Her English major actually has made it so she doesn't read or write anywhere near as often as she used to.",
