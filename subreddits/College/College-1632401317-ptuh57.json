My roommate wants to sleep with the blinds all the way up because she \"wakes up in a bad mood if natural light doesn't come in\" in the morning. Last year, I slept with blackout curtains because natural light DOES come in even with the blinds all the way down/it wakes me up at 6am. We agreed to compromise so that the blinds are half down on the days she has early classes and all the way down on the days that I do. The thing is, I sleep with a sleep mask even with them all the way down because it's so light and on her days I keep getting woken up at 3-4am when I inevitably knock the sleep mask off (I'm a chaotic sleeper). I have no idea what to do - I woke up last night and couldn't fall back asleep for 2 hours so I put the blinds all the way down and my roommate threw a fit about it today. I haven't slept more than 8 hours a single night I've been here because of this.", "author": "lobstercapote", "created": 1632401317, "retrieved": 1632800758, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdyi8t4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptuh57/help_i_need_advice_about_a_roommate_situation/hdyi8t4/", "text": "Ultimately, it\u2019s disturbing you more than it would disturb her to have them down. \nIf you have an RA I\u2019d recommend asking to have a mediated conversation about it. It sounds like you already compromised, but it\u2019s not working out that way, so you need to bring it back to the table. \n\nI would also recommend a sleeping cap. I have one of those and you wear it like a hat, but it goes over your eyes. I have the same prob with my sleep mask coming off, but I don\u2019t have that issue with the sleeping cap!", "author": "SnooMaps460", "created": 1632401523, "upvotes": 5}}}
