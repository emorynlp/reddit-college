  "text": "Hello all, I am currently a first-year (academically considered a sophomore) studying Computer Science pursuing a minor in math. However, I had a lot of transfer credits in high school, leaving me with only one more gen-ed requirement to complete, having not actually taken any in college. That brings me to the issue. I have many classes left for my major and minor but I've only taken the first class for each. The reason I took on the minor was to help with scheduling issues so as to not have lag semesters. So, for this next semester, I am scheduled for the second major class, Calculus II, a gen-ed, and computational linear algebra. I've heard that students at my school struggle in that second comp. sci class when there is an added Calculus II, but has anyone taken computational linear algebra that can tell me if it's a bad idea to stack up that and calc 2? Sorry for the novel here, just kind of lost and my advisor is really a piece of work.",
