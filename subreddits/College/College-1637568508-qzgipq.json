  "text": "So to start things off I feel it necessary to say why I'm burnt out. Starting quite literally as far back as I can remember in kindergarten, I have been expected to get good grades by my parents. I went to some private school and we took standardized tests Starting in 1st grade, of which I was also expected to do well, and this trend continued with taking the PSAT and SAT on a bi-annual basis up until 12th grade. All the while from kindergarten to 12th grade I was expected to make high As in every class, and would be lectured and even punished if my grades started dropping. The past 4 summers have been spent taking summer classes and working for my highschool so I never got a break from school either. Now in my first semester of college I am completely and utterly burnt out. I can't find any motivation to do work, and am on the verge of failing one of my classes. I can probably squeeze out a 3.0 gpa for this semester, but I don't see this trend stopping and I don't know what to do because this is really affecting my future. Any help is appreciated, thanks.",

      "text": "Well for one, your parents sound like they are living vicariously through you. That's never a good feeling. You don't owe them anything at all. You need to take care of you, which in some ways will take care of them.\n\nI'm not sure if I have any good advice. I personally took a long time off college and came back later. Gap years need to be taken more seriously. The experience you gain from working is really helpful in college. I always thought it was silly pumping 18 year olds who are at this point, VERY young adults, into college and expect them to succeed. An 18 year old has never lived away from their parents. They rely on their parents greatly. It's like sticking a puppy into an office job. \n\nHaving a job and paying rent for an apartment is a great skill to have. Building a solid foundation of habits to be proactive and thorough come with working a job for years. Being accountable to show up every day is important. \n\nI would highly suggest taking some time off if you're not passing classes. College isn't free and there's no reason to just do it and throw money away.",
