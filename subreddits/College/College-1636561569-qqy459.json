      "text": "Talk to your professors. They're there to help you. I recommend setting aside a certain time specific for studying/homework and going somewhere that's not your room to do it. I can't focus in mine so I like to go to my apartment's clubhouse or the library. Also, make sure to pay attention to lecture. The first step is actually showing up but if you're not actively listening or taking notes it doesn't matter",

      "text": "it is ok for the first year :) after a while you get a clear idea of how things done and you get things better. \n\nif you are lost on something just talk to the lecturer maybe spend time with them during their office hours? or send email with your queries \n\ntry to take notes during classes and save them for next years they will benefit you at some point in the future\n\nat home get yourself a place away from distractions to study at (you can study in the library as well)",
