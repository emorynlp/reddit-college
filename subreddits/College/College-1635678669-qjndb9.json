You might have a pretty strict one, but more likely they\u2019ll just ignore it as long as no one is getting wasted and causing trouble.\n\nAnyhow, I promise that your RA doesn\u2019t really care that much about who you are and their opinion of you is limited.",

People who need to drink and people who are drunk, dont always make the best decisions .\n\nMy roommate in college set of one of the fire alarms, which can happen easily, which meant FD and campus cops go into the room before everyone can get  back in.  She had a not very well hidden stash of weed (not legal at the time) and alcohol.  It was quite the hassle for me.\n\nI hadn\u2019t reported it and I am not sure I would even in retrospect, but I did change roommates.",
