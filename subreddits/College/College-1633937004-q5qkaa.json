  "title:": "Dude, proctored tests suck ass",
  "text": "I had to take a proctored test for one course (all my other professors have explicitly stated they hate proctoring because it\u2019s so inconsistent, there\u2019s too many issues with internet and devices, and it\u2019s invasive) and it went so bad. My proctor kept disconnecting and making me wait to reconnect throughout the test, then retesting and resetting everything up, I missed an entire 25pt question waiting on him and did so poorly on the rest because I was rushing through trying to make my short test time. \n\nI\u2019m so freaking frustrated. It brought me down multiple percent. I was hoping to be deans list this semester and now I don\u2019t think I will and I\u2019m so mad. I emailed the professor and he said I\u2019m still at a good enough grade it doesn\u2019t matter so he won\u2019t offer any makeup\u2026.but if this happens for every test it\u2019s definitely gonna bring me down a letter.

      "text": "They really do.  Complain up the chain.  Go to the department head, the assistant dean, the dean. Send a certified letter so they have to acknowledge you if need be.   Go nuts, you're paying to be there and to receive that knowledge and instruction.  That crap system is wasting your money, so let them hear about it.  If you bother someone high up enough long enough they're likely to tell your instructor to just fix the problem.\n\nRemember you're not in highschool anymore.  You're not just a student, you're a customer.",

          "text": "The \u201cgoing nuts\u201d approach will not end well (you\u2019re just going to be \u201cthat person,\u201d and they will be less likely to work with you on issues like this; you also don\u2019t want that reputation), and students are not customers in the same sense that someone might be a customer at a restaurant or a store. Students are more like clients paying for access to a service.\n\nHaving said that, technological issues aren\u2019t cool, and if the proctor kept messing up, then you shouldn\u2019t be held responsible. As a professor, I would recommend that you speak to the department chair about the issue. In the grand scheme of things, maybe this issue won\u2019t happen again, and maybe it really won\u2019t matter to your final grade in the end. If you\u2019re right on the edge of a letter grade, though, it could indeed make a difference. Having this issue on the record with the chair would then at least make them aware of it, and if it turns out that you lost enough points to be meaningful to your final grade just from this one problem, you will have been proactive about it.\n\nGood luck!",
