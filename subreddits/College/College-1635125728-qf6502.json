  "text": "Has anyone written a successful appeal letter to be granted off campus housing???\n\nI\u2019m being denied commuter status because I \u201cdo not meet commuter student criteria\u201d. However, I was told I could possibly appeal this.\n\nAny tips or even templates for writing such a letter? \n\nThe criteria they are saying I have to meet are:\n\n1. Reside with parents/guardians within 60miles of campus \n2. 23 years of age\n3. Married or have children \n4. 5th year seniors with 90 credit hours\n\nI don\u2019t meet any of those. I am however transferring to this school with 90 credit hours. I am 22 not 23 :/\n\nThe main reason for wanting to live off campus is because I was offered free housing as a part of a live-in program at a well known volunteer fire department nearby. I have been a volunteer for a while now and am hoping to continue that while attending this school. Living in this fire station will provide me with some amazing opportunities to advance my career and training, and without it, I don\u2019t know if I could afford campus housing.",
