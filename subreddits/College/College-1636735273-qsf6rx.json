  "text": "I like to believe that, generally, I can understand most if not all concepts in my field of study. When I'm actually in classes, I internalize and understand the material greatly. My greatest limiting factor seems to be getting myself to actually get the assignments done, such as papers and projects. I know that's part of the experience, but with my ADHD, it's super hard to keep myself focused and motivated. If I were able to have a tutor or someone to just keep me in check, that would be great. Self motivation is limited in its effect and duration, especially when the stress of school and life mounts up. I even looked it up, if this type of tutor exists, but I couldn't find anything. \n\nIf anyone has any suggestions on this subject, let me know. I'm in the social sciences/psych field of study if that helps.",

      "text": "Google Pomodoro technique and motivation vs. discipline. Try to rely more on discipline than motivation. Make a daily schedule that includes blocks of time to work and stick to it. There are ADHD coaches who can help you develop a systematic way to be more productive. See about getting on medication. There are lots of books geared towards practical ways to manage ADHD symptoms.",
