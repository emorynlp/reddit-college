  "text": "I promised them I wouldn't drop the ball and I've been lying to them for weeks that I'm doing okay academically when I missed one exam due to confusing the close date and I ran out of time on another cause I was trying to do so on a fucking plane. That day I was supposed to be back in my college town already but the previous day my flight got fucking cancelled.\n\nNow I have to meet with my professors and talk about being a fuckup.\n\nI just can't tell my parents. I can't let them know I failed two exams. I know how they'll yell at me and they will probably stop loving me.",
