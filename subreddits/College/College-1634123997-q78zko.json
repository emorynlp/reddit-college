  "text": "I kinda messed up a test big time a few weeks ago. It just happened. Was feeling burnt out and it showed through my marks. I got a D for the first time since high school. It was a blip/blunder. I have always been a straight As student throughout college and I know I can do way better. But I feel very shitty rn. Idk I guess I want to know if anyone else has been in the same boat recently",
