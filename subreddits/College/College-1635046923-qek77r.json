  "text": "I recently just moved to a new town for college. I went to a college that nobody else I knew really went. My older sister goes to the same school and I think the biggest reason I wanted to go here was because I wouldn't be at home, but I would have family. When I accepted myself into this school I was in a very different place emotionally, and now that I am actually here I am miserable. Not only do I miss being home, I also am having an issue making new friends. I've met a very good amount of people, but I haven't been able to connect with anyone, everyone had just been annoying me. But because of this I spend most of my time alone. My dorm roommate is gone most of the time and usually at home, and when she is here she doesn't invite me to a lot of things. When i'm alone in the room and hear all these people walking up and down the hall with all their friends I start to get really sad. I've cried a lot, been pushing away my boyfriend back at home because I feel like I can talk to anyone. I never tell anyone my issues which makes it worse, but I think its just because I've realized i've just grown to be a loner. If anyone has advice, I would love to hear it:)",

      "text": "Hi, Ik it\u2019s tough, I\u2019m super introverted and I hate it lmao. But here\u2019s how I survived. There are a shit ton of events on campus like all the time. Check your campus calendar, we had campfire night to just talk t each other, bingo nights, movie nights, mini field trips and all that junk. I was bold enough to walk to my neighbors door who had his door open and asked him if he wanted to come along, he agreed and we both went to one of the campfire nights, he\u2019s more talkative than I am, but I just clung onto him for dear life lmao. It worked because he ended up liking me because we had quite a bit in common, so we hung out and became best friends and his friends became my friends. \n\nAnd Ik you\u2019ll hear this a million times but clubs aren\u2019t a bad idea, they get you out of your dorm, Ik how easy it is to sit in your dorm for hours after waking up, skipping breakfast, maybe lunch just to stare at the ceiling and cry occasionally, been there. Just get out, even being outside you have the chance to spark a conversation with someone nearby. \n\nAnd maybe your roommate would invite you places but you don\u2019t come out often and feel you\u2019d rather not be bothered, they could be your event buddy or lunch person, idk you can tell if they actually like you or not, go with your gut feeling. Good luck I really hope it gets better for you! There are apps to make friends too, worst case scenario make a tinder mile radius and state clearly you only want friends, people will scroll if they see they don\u2019t have a chance at getting with u.",

      "text": "Same, I've always known I was a loner but I had some pretty close friends I made back in high school. Leaving them behind made me feel so alone and the realization that I couldn't really connect with anyone didn't help much. Maybe one day I'll make some college friends but for now I just feel alone.",
