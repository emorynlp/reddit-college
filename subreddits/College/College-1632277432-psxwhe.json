Yeah, I've had interesting classes, but the atmosphere of the class has never been fun.\n\nI know it's lame to compare things to high school as a junior, but even the classes I absolutely hated in high school were fun sometimes just because of the people in them. I miss having classes where I would laugh and actually enjoy myself in addition to learning.\n\nAnd maybe college classes aren't for goofing off and laughing with your friends, but I feel like going into college everyone used to say that the professors are so much more laid-back and fun and everything is relaxing, but I haven't found that to be the case at all. I don't think the college schedule of having each classes 2 times a week for \\~1 each time is conducive to forming bonds as students that make the class fun and enjoyable.", "author": "TheFoolsWhoDream", "created": 1632277432, "retrieved": 1632800898, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hdwpse7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psxwhe/are_your_classes_fun/hdwpse7/", "text": "Congrats.
