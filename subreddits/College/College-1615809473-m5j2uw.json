  "title:": "When I am discouraged about college, old replies from professors help lift my spirits",
  "text": "At the end of every semester, after final grades come out and things settle a bit, I send a short email to my professors thanking them for their patience and time in teaching me. I briefly mention my favorite parts of the class, little things they did that meant a lot, and how I'll incorporate their lessons in the future. \n\n(I do this after final grades are released so they don't get the impression that I'm trying to kiss up to boost my grade. Also because I feel like teachers are also stressed at this time, trying to get all the students processed and grade all their exams.)\n\nEven if their class wasn't my favorite or if I did poorly, it reminds me to count my blessings. \n\nMost of the time they appreciate me reaching out, extend words of encouragement, and wish me well on my journey. \n\nI pin these replies and save them in a folder for a rainy day. \n\nLast semester I experienced a rough patch that affected my academic performance. I used to be enthusiastic about school and learning in general, but for some reason even the smallest amount of reading (which is my primary and most reliable study method) required a great deal of energy to complete. My test anxiety was at its worst. I felt like my old self that desired knowledge and enjoyed college was gone. A few days ago, I was scrolling through old emails and I found a few from my former professors. Although a small gesture, their words of encouragement really helped me get out of that funk and helped renew that familiar curiosity that motivated me to pursue my degree. They believed in me, even though I didn't believe in myself. \n\nI just wanted to share this with all of you. You don't have to do what I did though. I hope this can help someone. Thanks for reading this far. College can be overwhelming, anxiety ridden, and stressful as it is, let alone during a pandemic which has changed so many aspects of life. Even though I'm just a random person on reddit, I believe in each of you, and I wish you the best in your academic and personal endeavors. :) Stay safe.",

But somehow now I am on top of it. It took awhile but it can be hard to get out of a funk. Your post was really nice and it kind of reminded me of my situation. Thanks for letting us know that we may not be the only ones going through something similar. Best wishes \u263a\ufe0f",
