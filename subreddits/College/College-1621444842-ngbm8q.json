                      "text": "I'm no expert, but I have done some research on this topic. There are many reasons why many students are not graduating in a \"timely manner\" and that includes lack of preparedness, financial barriers, and lack of resources or effective guidance. According to the National Student Clearhouse, only 1/3rd of students still haven't gained a BA in the 6th year mark. [Source](https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/NSC_Signature_Report_14_StateSupp.pdf)\n\nPreparedness: A chief economist at Georgetown University mentioned that unequal elementary and high school education contributes to the lack of pepardness and struggles students face in college. A study found that those students who come unprepared are more likely to drop out of college if they can't find the adequate support they need. ([Source](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Education/Georgia-State-University)) \n\nFinancial problems: A study showed that 48% of college students had faced food insecurity while in college. ([Source](http://studentsagainsthunger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Hunger_On_Campus.pdf)) The same study showed that recent data from the Federal Student Aid showed that 58k students indicated they were homeless. Another financial problem is the cost of childcare for parents who are in college. (also me) The Institute for Women's Policy research found that 4.8 million college students were parents. Another study in CA found that 8% of students who were food insecure were planning to drop out. ([Source](https://www.aacu.org/aacu-news/newsletter/facts-figures/jan-feb2017)) In that same study, 65% faced housing insecurity.  I lost count of how many times I didn't eat and just went throughout the day with water in my stomach. \n\nNow, ofcourse, if we're talking about financial problems we have to incorperate race into this discussion. There is a growing college graduate gap most certainly among Black and Hispanic adults. A study showed that only 14% of Black adults, and 11% of Hispanic adults held a bachelors degree in comparison to 24% of White adults. ([Source](https://1k9gl1yevnfp2lpq1dhrqe17-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Black-Degree-Attainment_FINAL.pdf)) What also continues to rise is the lower completion rate for these groups of people, and the gap in graduation.  \n\nIt would make sense why these issues contribute to this overarching issue. It's tough to pay for college, eat a decent meal, get the support, learn, and graduate on time. Lets not forget about our marginalized groups too, who often contribute to the gap.\n\nLet's not forget that colleges are businesses that don't really prepare you for the challenges and overload of college. I lost count of the many times I had to track my adviser down like a bounty hunter, and when I had questions she could barely answer them. I'd go through a list of people to get pulled in the right direction. Most of the time you will figure things out on your own. (due dates, graduation expectations, majors, minors, anything really)\n\nNow again this is only a tiny section on the barriers that prevents students from graduating in a timely manner.",

But I think its understandable if people change their majors, people can't decide that stuff in high school, they're kids, especially when they've never experienced the university courses to see if it fits them. So that's probably why so many people change their majors, but even though people say its okay to do it, the financial burden that comes with it is too much of an issue so lots of people just end up enduring their major. No wonder the statistics show only around 50% of graduates found employment where their degree was useful or relevant",
