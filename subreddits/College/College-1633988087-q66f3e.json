  "title:": "Thinking of majoring in biology and minoring marketing, is it a good idea?",
  "text": "I\u2019m undecided right now but I\u2019m thinking of taking biology as my major. I\u2019ve always been interested in animals and nature, but I\u2019m intimidated by some of the things that come with it. One of my cousins says that it\u2019s a lot of work. My other cousin says that she likes it so far, she just doesn\u2019t like chemistry (we both suck at it). Another reason why I\u2019m still hesitant is because I don\u2019t really see myself as some kind of researcher that\u2019s on a mission to change the world or some stuff like that. I just want to have a job that I don\u2019t hate.\n\nHowever, I am taking a biological anthropology class right now and I actually like it so far. My professor does make us do a lot of work and reading, but at least the material is interesting to me.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m thinking of minoring in marketing, in case I can\u2019t find a job with just a bachelor\u2019s in biology. I think it\u2019s also a useful skill to have so why not.",

Having a background in biology would helpful because you have first hand knowledge of what it is you\u2019re selling, and in order to sell that\u2019s where your marketing skills come in. \n\nJust a thought",

      "text": "I can't really give advice on studying biology but I work in digital marketing and I think it's a great field! I studied graphic/web design in college but I wish I would've taken marketing courses. You can do a lot with it like there are so many areas you can niche down into. For example, SEO (search engine optimization), social media marketing, email marketing, paid ads/SEM (search engine marketing), content marketing, even graphic designers can work on creating marketing materials. As someone who had a really hard time choosing a major (I changed it 4 times), I would say it might help to find a job you think would be interesting and work backward from there. I used to think studying something you enjoy is the way to go, but tbh it's probably better to study a field that has job prospects lol. It took me almost 3 years before I gave up finding a graphic design job. That's a story for another day though. Studying something you're passionate about will make school easier, but if you can't find a job out of college, then I feel like you're kind of throwing money away. Tuition isn't cheap, at least in the US. Anyway, that's just my two cents. Oh, and if you can, find an internship in something you're interested in to test the waters.",
