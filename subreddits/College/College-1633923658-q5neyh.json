  "text": "I have managed to form a very positive relationship with one of my professors. She knows my name and pronounces it correctly (most people don't), regularly compliments me on my assignments and participation in class, and I have a 100 average which is 29% higher than the class average.\n\nI was wondering, since I only have her for a semester, if I ask for a letter of recommendation for med school now and hold onto it for 4 years or if I'm supposed to ask in 4 years and hope that she remembers who I am?",
