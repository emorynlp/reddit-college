  "text": "I am currently enrolled at Purdue university for my bachelors in Information Technology But I would also like to get my bachelors in Cyber security and I already got accepted into my other university I haven\u2019t filled out the fafsa for the other school thought. Can I do both at once? Or is it not possible I could handle the work load",

      "text": "You mean like doing a double major? If that's the case, then I would take a look at what the required courses are, and I think you know yourself best in the sense of if you personally could handle the course-load, and how much motivation you can have to get all of this done. Generally speaking, if you've applied and have been accepted to a school for major X, you can always add another major Y during your time there as long as you have enough time to finish the second degree. Hope this answers your question!",
