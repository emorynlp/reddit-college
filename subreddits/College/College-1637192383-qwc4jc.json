  "text": "First semester student here. I go to CC for free. \n\nJust got two refund checks from my CC. One is around $600 and the other is close to $3,000. The tuition at my college is $2.8K/semester so I\u2019m just wondering why I\u2019m getting this money? Lol. \n\nI want to save up for a car with this $3K but I\u2019m afraid that this money given to me is the money I\u2019m supposed to pay to the CC as tuition. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sent an email or anything regarding these checks.",
