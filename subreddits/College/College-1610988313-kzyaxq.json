This semester I got this huge wave of sadness and I actually started crying since school is coming so close... I don\u2019t really understand either but you know ( please excuse my English)\n\nEdit: thank you kind strangers for the wholesome, hugs, and silver. I really appreciate it!!",

      "text": "Hey there, I am a college senior who is graduating this semester, Spring 2021 with a Biology BS Major at UHD and transferred from my CC, Lone Star College and got an Associate of Arts last Summer 2020, since I the degree plan for university didn't require some courses that were needed for my associate of science. Let's say I have some anxiety for today being my first day back for my last semester in my undergraduate studies, but I am very excited for the end goal to graduate and then go to medical school (after a gap year) in Fall 2022.   \n\n\nFurthermore, just like that wave of sadness you had Fall 2020 is normal for everyone, but when we adjust and build momentum, we will get used to it and get it done. As the saying goes adjust and over come. Also, as Albert Einstein once said, \"time is relative\", everything comes in cycles, and Spring 2021 will get this wave of sadness just like last semester. Just power through, give your best foot forward and keep in the loop your support group, such as faculty, friends and family. Everything will be alright. We will persevere and succeed.   \n\n\nGood luck everyone, stay safe and we got this.",

Once through the first week, you have a very clear idea of instructor expectations and can start to develop somewhat of a system.\n\nI had a mini freakout last night because I registered for a \"creativity and innovation\" class that turns out not to be what I thought it was. I don't fancy the idea of writing three pages of rambling nonsense every single morning just to \"reach the dark corners of my conscienceness\" so I can \"activate the creative flow hidden deep within my mind\" as if creativity could be summoned by a formula. I should found out today whether or not I'll drop this class and replace it with a different one.\n\nAlso as a Christian, prayer helps immensely!!\n\nUPDATE:  \n\n\nA spot just opened up in the other class. I've registered and am gonna check it out. Then I'll decide which class to drop.",

Going back to get prereqs for a different program. ***After being in the working world I can tell you this, if you are depressed because a break is ending. You will be depressed every Sunday night before Monday. You will be depressed before your vacations are over because you know you have to go back to work.

I spent two weeks moving during Xmas break and then back to school for winter session. I have moments of demotivation but I can\u2019t afford to get behind in a class that does a full semester in one month. I try to remind myself laziness is the only reason I could fail this class. One day of laziness in winter session can cost. Three days and it will cost a lot of points fast. A day After that there will be the spring semester which is where the real burn out will challenge me. \n\n***One thing that is helping me is living with my family again. I cannot tell you how much my mental health has skyrocketed since making that decision.***",

Not only that, but sometimes I really do love learning. However, I find that my energy and happiness is exponentially drained during school. And I\u2019m constantly overcome with nerves, stress, deadlines, and expectations. It\u2019s like having a huge burden on my mind. I think that\u2019s what makes me not look forward to each semester, and it\u2019s a major reason for my lack of excitement and sadness.\n\nAnyways, sorry for my rant. But I understand how you feel completely. I guess my advice would be to just push through it? That\u2019s what I do, at least. Best of wishes and stay safe.",
