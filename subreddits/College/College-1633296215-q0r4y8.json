  "title:": "Question about GPA Requirements for applying",
  "text": "Let's say you had a 3.0 GPA in High School and the school you're wanting to apply to has a 4.0 requirement. I know this is probably a stupid question, but could you get accepted to the 4.0 university if you went to a lower requirement college and get a high GPA there? Or is the 4.0 requirement solely from your High School transcripts. I'm sorry if this is a dumb question I just have no idea and I can't really find an answer online\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: Go to a low requirement university, get a high GPA and grades, then transfer the following year\\*",
