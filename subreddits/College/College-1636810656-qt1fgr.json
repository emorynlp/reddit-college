      "text": "Um, outside of homework really not a ton. \n\nI'll usually do some studying about a week prior to exams. I usually study around 4-6 hours per exam I'd bet. A good solid day of studying. \n\nI never miss homework assignments either and generally get 100% on them. I use them as kind of a intermediary to studying, as it helps plus I get points to do it.\n\nI've got 3 classes this semester that are terribly easy. I don't study for them. I didn't study a single minute for the one and nailed a 97 on the midterm while consuming tequila. \n\nMy more difficult classes usually take a bit more. My Statics course is generally just doing practice problems before the exam. The homeworks can take 2-3 hours a piece though. \n\nFor my materials course, I make flash cards and probably study 6-8 hours total for the exam. It helps a ton. I was the first done out of \\~80 students and my grade was 15% above the class average. \n\n*How*  you study is just important as how long you study. My materials course was a hard one to gauge at first. I got a 79.5% on the first exam after a 10 point curve but then greatly changed my study habits. I went from using the professor's skeleton notes that she fills in to ignoring them all together and writing flash card questions for the entire lecture. The only thing I do outside of class is put my questions into a flash card program and then run through them a few times. \n\nThen again, I wouldn't be using flashcards to study for calculus either.",
