  "title:": "College's Should Be Advancing Remote Learning",
  "text": "I'm a big believer that technological advancement is the future, but I'm observing that some universities including my own want to avoid it. This pandemic should have been an opportunity to enhance online learning, and invest in tools that make the student's experience tolerable.  Many students want to go back in-person because the online procedure isn't efficient enough, but efficiency could increase if the university focused on developing a model that worked.\n\nInstead, my university uses its funds to buy aesthetics. They decided to buy fancy paintings rather than investing in technology that would make remote learning sufficient. We are in the middle of a surge in infection rates, and they want to force in-person when it doesn't make sense if the goal is to protect students. There are universities that were ahead of the times who provide online programs that implement augmented reality and advanced technological designs. Why aren't others following?\n\nIt isn't a secret that variants of Covid are going to be around for a long time, and there's one type of variant that is spreading which mutation renders the vaccines useless (I'm not an anti-vaxxer). With this information schools that have the money should invest in the future which is remote learning. They are only avoiding the inevitable. If they refuse to innovate and adapt to the circumstances, they will be even more unprepared when the next disaster hits. They really have no excuse since they are ranked first in the state and universities below them have already adapted. It's time to invest all that student tuition money on making an optional online program that's not put together carelessly.\n\nTLDR:\nIf colleges really do care about the health and safety of their students, they would invest in remote learning. Forcing in-person is putting students in danger of catching the new variant that makes vaccines ineffective and is just avoiding the inevitable. It's time to invest all that student tuition money on making an optional online program that's not put together carelessly.",

      "text": "My college literally can\u2019t afford people not being on campus. They\u2019d have to refund people their housing, which they didn\u2019t last year. However, people didn\u2019t stay on campus the previous semester so they got little money from that. I just find it so crazy that they put all that effort into transitioning to online learning only to completely stop and drop all the guidelines they had us follow. Not to mention, my school is a covid hotspot\u2026but we aren\u2019t addressing that.",

I think it matters what type of person you're talking about because there is surely someone who did online and is at the same level or even better than someone who was physically there. I think it's a static belief that someone who does traditional learning is always going to be better in comparison.\n\nI think it's possible for technology in the future to make online learning as effective as physical learning if it were more financially supported. Technology has always found ways to increase efficiency, and I think that's going to happen in the future whether people like it or not.",

                          "text": "I disagree it takes so much motivation for online students to finish their course work. It takes time management and there's nothing stopping teamwork online especially if technology advanced to make that more effective. Again, I think the type of person matters. Generalizing a group of students is never an accurate description.\n\nI'm not here to debate. You can keep your perspective, but I'm saying that the circumstance the world is at right now makes it definitely not safe to have students forced in-person. You can tell it's all for the money. I'm paying for a gym membership when it's such a bad idea to have students even go to the gym right now. You can't opt out of it. Remote learning needs to be enhanced because the virus is not going to just disappear.",

You are suggesting that students stop going to college for years because you wouldn't hire someone who did online? \n\nWell, that's not a shared perspective for the majority of employers. I've come across tech employers who just want to see you have a degree as a checkmark for HR. They mostly care about your experience for the field. My sister's employer even offered to pay for her online WGU degree in software development and said once she completes that she can move up in the industry. Your advise is so questionable because you want students to pro-long their graduation while the economy hits one of its biggest lows.",

Also, I suggest you research the R.1 variant as it is a mutation that is more dangerous than the others and is already in several states. The vaccine doesn't protect against R.1 and there's enough anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers to spread it. If R.1 mutates into a more severe type, then like I said people who tried to force in-person will be putting students at risk for just monetary gain.\n\nI believe that by the time you and I are dead the future is advanced remote work.",
