This pandemic should have been an opportunity to enhance online learning, and invest in tools that make the student's experience tolerable.  Many students want to go back in-person because the online procedure isn't efficient enough, but efficiency could increase if the university focused on developing a model that worked.\n\nInstead, my university uses its funds to buy aesthetics. They decided to buy fancy paintings rather than investing in technology that would make remote learning sufficient. We are in the middle of a surge in infection rates, and they want to force in-person when it doesn't make sense if the goal is to protect students. There are universities that were ahead of the times who provide online programs that implement augmented reality and advanced technological designs. Why aren't others following?\n\nIt isn't a secret that variants of Covid are going to be around for a long time, and there's one type of variant that is spreading which mutation renders the vaccines useless (I'm not an anti-vaxxer). With this information schools that have the money should invest in the future which is remote learning. They are only avoiding the inevitable. If they refuse to innovate and adapt to the circumstances, they will be even more unprepared when the next disaster hits. They really have no excuse since they are ranked first in the state and universities below them have already adapted. It's time to invest all that student tuition money on making an optional online program that's not put together carelessly.\n\nTLDR:\nIf colleges really do care about the health and safety of their students, they would invest in remote learning. Forcing in-person is putting students in danger of catching the new variant that makes vaccines ineffective and is just avoiding the inevitable. It's time to invest all that student tuition money on making an optional online program that's not put together carelessly.", "author": "Emiriley", "created": 1632420034, "retrieved": 1632946114, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he505ze": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pu0wmk/colleges_should_be_advancing_remote_learning/he505ze/", "text": "My college literally can\u2019t afford people not being on campus.
