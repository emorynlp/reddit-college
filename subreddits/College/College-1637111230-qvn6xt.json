  "text": "I have a paper I'm currently writing about faith healing, and I need some sources on a devil's advocate that agrees that faith healing works.  This is just an English paper I just cant find anything that agrees with it, not the fact that is could be the placebo effect, someone who completely believes that it exists and has a website or paper written on it to be able to cite.",
