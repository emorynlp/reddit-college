  "text": "Hello!\n\nI am taking finite math (for business/social science majors) and I failed my first test. I got a 56%. For the class we have 3 tests in total, each exam is worth 15% and we still have two regular tests before the final exam (worth 35%). Homework also counts for 15% of final grade. Do you think if I do well on my next test, it could bring up my grade to a near 70? My university has a deadline of November 1st if you need to withdraw from a class. That\u2019s a last resort of course.",
