  "text": "I\u2019m currently going to community college in CT and I will be finished by the fall if I take summer classes (which I\u2019m planning on doing). I want to transfer to URI next fall, but it\u2019s out-of-state. I know it may not be a good decision since it would be more expensive, but I just feel like it would be a better experience than some of my options in CT, based on my situation.\n\nI\u2019m going to community college for free because of financial aid, and I\u2019m just wondering if I\u2019d be able to get financial aid if I transferred to an out-of-state school (obviously will not be free). \n\nI think going to URI would be more fun than some of my other options, but if it\u2019s going to wreck my life for years by having a lot more debt I\u2019ll unfortunately have to pass on that.\n\nIf anyone has any insight please let me know, thank you.",
