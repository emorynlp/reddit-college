  "text": "I can't be the only one this has happened to: The teacher goes into detail about what we need to learn, gives us the subject matter and I write it all down in fine detail.\n\nI go home to do homework, open up the text book and... the questions are entirely different.\n\nNo I am serious, this happens WAY too fucking often and in more than one class/teacher: Either the books are using entirely different information, or the teacher doesn't actually know what they're assigning us for homework!\n\nI honestly don't understand this. How the hell is it fair to expect us to do problems when the FRICKIN' BOOK doesn't match what we're TAUGHT?!",

      "text": "I'm taking a class right now where most of the questions on the homework isn't actually discussed in lecture until AFTER the homework is due. I get just as confused as you do. What always ends up happening is, I teach myself the material through the uploaded slides and youtube videos, do the homework, and then I'm just super prepared for the next lecture. It's not ideal... at all, but I'm trying to make it work.\n\nYou should try check to see if the material covered in the homework is something that will be covered in lecture in the future. And if you have a problem with it, email your professor.",
