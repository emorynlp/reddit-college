She substitute's for Chinese teachers frequently and she asked me a few days ago if it were possible for her to go to college. I've thought about ways to help build her career but not sure how to go about it. I know she has a passion for teaching Chinese, but don't know the methods of getting teaching certificate without a bachelor's degree in my state.
