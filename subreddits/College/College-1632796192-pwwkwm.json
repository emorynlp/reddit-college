I have mostly worked in retail, up until May when I obtained my degree. I was wondering, does my cashier experience need to go on my resume? its not really relevant so I was thinking about leaving it out. I would have 2 short term volunteer positions (4-5 months), an internship as a mentor to college age students with developmental disabilities  (10 months) , a summer job as a summer school instructor (3 months) and my current job as a substitute teacher, that I started this month on my resume. The earliest position would be 2019 when I\u2019ve been in the work force since 2015. So just wondering if I should include my retail experience or if it\u2019ll be fine without it.", "author": "Findingsabrina", "created": 1632796192, "retrieved": 1632799981, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
