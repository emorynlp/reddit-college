  "text": "my roommate has been smelling pretty bad and she\u2019s really nice! she has an emotional support animal (chinchilla) that doesn\u2019t smell at all. it just smells like sweat in the dorm, she mentioned she only showers 3 times a week and i can\u2019t really use air fresheners cuz of the chinchilla. Today, I mentioned the smell and she said she thought it could be her clothes and at first put those febreeze things in her closet, but later removed it because she was scared it could make the chinchilla sick. Tonight i put my fan in-front of the window in hope to bring more fresh air into the room. So far it\u2019s working, but just incase it doesn\u2019t how should i approach this? i don\u2019t really want to move dorms because I already was having a difficult time with housing because my original dorm with a high school friend housing put us in a triple with a guy, so my parents made me request to leave and now i\u2019m in this dorm \ud83e\udd72",
