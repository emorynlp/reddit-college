  "title:": "Staying Home or Going Away?",
  "text": "So I'm a 4th year student studying mechanical engineering at a UC in Southern California. The housing market down there is atrocious right now and I was not able to secure a place for this current fall quarter. I stayed home in Northern California, took a leave of absence, and worked. Now I need to make a decision if I'm to go back this winter quarter with a less than ideal living situation (living in a loft in an apartment with 2 random people) or stay home, take a couple classes at a CC, and transfer to either one of my local UC's or CSU's.\n\nI'm having trouble deciding. I really want the independence and experience of moving away to school, since the past couple of years I've been at home. However, I enjoy being at home, I like my family and the area that I live in. Plus it would be a lot cheaper to stay.\n\nThe UC that I'm currently enrolled in has a pretty great ME program, and the two schools that I am looking at locally aren't as prestigious (UCD and Sac State).\n\nI just want to hear some advice or personal experiences to help me decide how I should move forward.",

      "text": "I assume you have been a student at the southern Cal UC for a while now. I would stick with the UC you are enrolled at if money is not an issue. Continue to build that relationship with the ecosystem there, career center, etc and get a job thru them. Can you go on the college social media sites and try to find roommates who at least go to your UC?  That might lesson the randomness of people. They\u2019re probably also trying to get done with school and trying to find a decent living situation, too.",

Money is not a huge issue, I have a nice amount saved up and I get really good aid from the school. Thank you for replying, I'll take this into consideration.",

              "text": "Good luck!  I\u2019m an engineer and I know how hard engineering classes are. Usually there is a capstone project or class senior year. You also spend a lot of time searching for jobs, interviewing senior year. I personally would simplify life and just take classes that I know will help me graduate from the current school without having to worry if the ones from CSU or Davis lines up with what you need to complete your degree with partial from UCSD and partial from another college. Davis is a solid school, but UCSD has a legit rep for engineering. Don\u2019t give up that cred on your degree!",
