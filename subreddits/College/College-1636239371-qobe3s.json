  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m currently a first year freshman at Rensselaer polytechnic institute and I\u2019m just thinking about how I\u2019m going to move forward in college. I\u2019m actually a commute student, I\u2019ve been in this area for my whole entire life essentially and I\u2019m getting pretty bored of it:\n\nI attended high school 30 mins away from where I\u2019m going to college, in which I applied to RPI getting lots of aid, especially since I don\u2019t live or use the meal plan, so it\u2019s pretty cheap. The problem is my social life is basically just not there. RPI is notorious for being a boring stem school, and it doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m not even with any of the students most of the time in the campus (only go to classes and stuff). The clubs don\u2019t interest me that much, I\u2019ve joined 1 which is for chemical engineers but barely anyone goes. I\u2019m actually a chemical engineering premed, and I think it would be better if I just left this area, as I\u2019m getting tired of being alone and seeing family every single day. Thoughts?",

Join a fraternity. Join non-major related class/ clubs. It\u2019s harder to find financial aid as a transfer student. Finally save up and live on campus one semester just because.",
