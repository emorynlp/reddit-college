  "text": "I have to complete a work placement over this year and I was wondering if attendance would impact my chance of securing an internship. My attendance has always been good, but I have missed a few classes over the course of this year. Would this stop employers from hiring me in the process?\n\nEdit: I have seen this question asked before, and I was also wondering if attendance is marked on transcripts.",
