  "text": "Hey all, I've seen for a while on here that students have been having problems making friends/being social on campus. Tbh, it's the schools fault for not wanting to foster actual conversations among students...my one piece of advice for you all is to focus on your goal. Focus on why you're going to school to begin with. You're going there to become a success, to get a good job and to be educated. Making friends is cool, but it isn't required because at the end of the day, the person who is putting in the work and effort for the degree is you.\n\nWith that said, I've been working on a platform called FriendMe that focuses on connecting you with like-minded people to help you make friends. We're still in beta testing, but our mission relates to the problems everyone is going through. Check us out at [thefriendme.com](https://thefriendme.com) and dm me to learn more, it's free and is focused on helping you make the most of your college experience. Thanks and stay blessed!",
