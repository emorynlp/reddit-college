  "text": "I am currently a second year student working towards my bachelor's degree in psychology. I adore psychology, and love being able to learn about it and find ways to use it literally everyday. \n\nThat being said, is the \"college journey\" all worth it? While I've been loving my time in college and enjoy learning about my major, I am constantly bombarded with family members and older adults claiming I'm completely wasting my time and money going to school for psychology. The more I try looking into it, I see more and more posts claiming it is not worth it, I'll end up stuck working part time anyways, won't be able to find someplace to apply my major, or will be stuck paying back loans for the rest of my life. \n\nIt just seems that everytime I feel like I'm enjoying what I'm doing I get told it's wrong and hopeless. I can really see both sides of the argument, but am really interested in what other college students, graduates, professors, drop outs, or anyone that has any affiliation/experience with college, have to offer here. I would greatly appreciate it! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9a",

I have no idea \n\nThe job outlook can be great, you just have to what to look for and where to look. In my area, I can get a job as a probation officer starting at 95K with just my bachelors degrees. Due to the labor shortage, most social work positions have also extended their requirements out to people with psychology BAs. There\u2019s some in my area now starting at 65-90K. \n\nPeople always think the only thing you can do with a psych degree is being a therapist and that\u2019s simply not true. Even if you do want to be a therapist there are ways around the schooling so you aren\u2019t spending 8+ years in college and practicums.",

      "text": "Psychology degree here.\n\nI think it really depends on what you want to do. For me, i initially came into college not really knowing what to do. I was fortunately, I took classes with some pretty cool professors and this is what I've found.\n\nA Psychology degree (depending on the classes you take) can open up quite a few career paths for you. That being said, a minor can really help (also getting a minor in history). I've had the opportunity to look at IO Psychology (hr stuff) as a potential career after undergrad. If i decide, i can also go to grad school, whether to do research, become a licensed therapist/MD, etc. With a history minor, I can also look into politics or journalism bc of the connections I have made with the history department (and if i can sell/properly tie it w/ my psych degree).\n\nAll in all, it's really what you make of it. Take a diverse amount of classes. Get some experience (maybe some student org stuff; i have a membership engagement role in my student org, which I can tie to IO Psychology).",
