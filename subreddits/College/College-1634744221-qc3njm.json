  "title:": "Post Covid Student Behavior",
  "text": "Since the beginning of this semester, my college has dealt with concerning student behavior (mostly off campus) This includes: theft, vandalism, apartment complex/vehicle damage, an amplified party culture, etc\n\nIMO, living at home & taking online classes for an entire school year may have caused these negative actions to occur, even though other colleges may be dealing with similar problems at the moment as well?\n\nIs your college currently having problems, outside of students partying more, since they weren't on campus for an entire school year?",
