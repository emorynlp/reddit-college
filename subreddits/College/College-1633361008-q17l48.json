  "title:": "Psych Survey about Sexuality",
  "text": "Hello! I'm a Psychology student and my Learning and Behaviour professor asked us to conduct a survey and ask at least 10 people. The thing is I don't know many people who will answer this question, so I decided to try my luck here.\n\nIf you are interested in helping me, first I need a few data: age, sex, gender and sexual orientation. If you're uncomfortable sharing some of them, that's ok! But it'll be better to have everything.\n\nThe survey in question is about 5 stimuli that provoke a sexual response. Those stimuli could be things, smells, views, etc... and it would be better if you think they're inherent of your sexuality, that other people don't perceive them sexually. (I know this is hard, kinks are usually shared with more or less people, so don't think too hard about this).\n\nIf you are able to think about 5 stimuli, you could try and try to think why said stimuli had developed their sexual nature, where they come from essentially.\n\nHere's the [link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe75Ei3BeaPtg8cZVd43USjPJfCrNE-vOYQNOBeROkDXAIxRA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to fill the survey.\n\nIf you have any doubts, please DM me! And thank you so much if you decide to help me.",
