Go through them once, pick out the ones you know immediately, pick them out, set aside. The harder ones, rotate more frequently. I am talking handwritten flash cards, not an app. You are far times more likely to remember your handmade flash cards and in your own handwriting. Keep 10 in your back pocket. Rotate them out. Go through them every single moment you have downtown. The subway, grocery line, etc. \n\nThen: topics on one side of the page, fold it over, develop that topic into short essay on the folded side. Flip those back and forth to quiz yourself. You can use the back of the paper up this way as well, without killing trees. \n\nIf it\u2019s a new language, try drawing a picture to represent that idea. Write \u201ctree\u201d (in the target language) on one side of the flash card, draw a tree on the next. Even better for names of family members. Draw a family tree and write in your own names with the titles in the new language.\n\nDefinitely go home and take a short break, then spend at least 1 or 2 hours re-reading and filling in your notes with more detail on the daily. Leave space in your notes day to day or line by line to do that. \n\nMath, make example problems and make yourself pretend to teach them out loud to yourself or a study group. Highlight where you typically get confused or stuck, make up rules or a formula to help you stay on track. Same for grammar. Math is like grammar- and they\u2019re both like following a recipe.

By the time I was done with all the weekly work I had a list of information that was likely to be on the exam. I did that for about the first year and got tired of writing that much, so I color-coded word documents with the same info for quick reads before exams. Brought my exam grades up from Bs to As for the most part (a few professors snuck random questions in there on occasion that you had to have memorized the entire chapter to remember). \nI came across quizlet while practicing for my dsst exams and that website has games for common chapters from textbooks that you can use to learn the info with as well.\n \nHang in there and figure out how you can best learn and retain info.
