{"sid": "kig3p8", "link": "/r/college/comments/kig3p8/in_the_cares_act_colleges_and_universities/", "title:": "In the CARES Act, colleges and universities received $14 Billion in Covid-19 Aid. In this second stimulus package, they're receiving $23 billion. My question is: where is that money going to end up?", "text": "After doing some research, it seems that the $23 billion, similar to the $14 billion, is being earmarked for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). But, does anyone know how these funds will be used exactly, and will it be similar to the March relief?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI think I found the allocation scheme. It's starts on line 16 on page 1872 of the bill which is titled \"HIGHER  EDUCATION  EMERGENCY  RELIEF  FUND\"\n\nSpecifically on line 19 of page 1877, it states how the universities may use the funds allocated to them.\n\nHere is the excerpt:\n\n**USES  OF FUNDS \u2014An  institution  of  higher  education  receiving  funds  under  this  section  may  use  the  funds received to**\n\n>**(1)  defray  expenses  associated  with  coronavirus (including  lost  revenue,  reimbursement  for  expenses already  incurred,  technology  costs  associated  with  a transition  to  distance  education,  faculty  and  staff  trainings, and payroll);**  \n>  \n>**(2)  carry  out  student  support  activities  authorized   by   the   HEA   that   address   needs   related   to   coronavirus;**  \n>  \n>**(3)  provide  financial  aid  grants  to  students  (including  students  exclusively  enrolled  in  distance  education), which may be used for any component of the student\u2019s  cost  of  attendance  or  for  emergency  costs that  arise  due  to  coronavirus,  such  as  tuition,  food,  housing,  health  care  (including  mental  health  care),  or  child  care.  In  making  financial  aid  grants  to  students,   an   institution   of   higher   education   shall   prioritize  grants  to  students  with  exceptional  need, such as students who receive Pell Grants.**\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI think I found the provision that dictates the amount higher institutions are required to give as financial aid to students.  It's starts on line 11 of page 1880. It states the following:\n\n>**(5)  Institutions  of  higher  education  receiving  allocations  under   section  314(a)(1)  of  this  title  shall  provide  at  least  the   same  amount  of  funding  in  emergency  financial  aid  grants  to   students  as  was  required  to  be  provided  under  sections   18004(a)(1)  and (c) of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law  16116\u2013136).**  An  institution  of  higher  education  that  repurposes  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  (2)  **shall  ensure  that  not  less  than  50  percent  of  the  funds  received under section 18004(a)(1) of division B of the CARES  Act  (Public  Law  116\u2013136)  are  used  for  financial  aid  grants  to  students**  under  either  section  18004(c)  of  division  B  of  the  CARES  Act  or  section  314(c)(3)  of  this  title,  or  a  combination  of  those  sections:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, it seems that the students that received payments in March from their university will also be receiving it this time around, as well. However, I'm not sure if more students are going to be included in these payments. Given that there's going to be almost $11 Billion dollars more in funding this time, it would only make sense that either more students receive money or the students that received money last time will get more, but nothing has made sense this year, so I wouldn't bet on this making sense either.\n\nI may be missing something here, so if one of y'all find better info, please don't hesitate to correct me. It'll help all of us get a better picture of what's going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to try to find more information then here's a link to the bill: [https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "gttm2019", "created": 1608677416, "retrieved": 1632947216, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1399, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"go1fgns": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kig3p8/in_the_cares_act_colleges_and_universities/go1fgns/", "text": "Have any of the schools received the money yet.
