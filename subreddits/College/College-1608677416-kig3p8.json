  "title:": "In the CARES Act, colleges and universities received $14 Billion in Covid-19 Aid. In this second stimulus package, they're receiving $23 billion. My question is: where is that money going to end up?",
  "text": "After doing some research, it seems that the $23 billion, similar to the $14 billion, is being earmarked for the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). But, does anyone know how these funds will be used exactly, and will it be similar to the March relief?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI think I found the allocation scheme. It's starts on line 16 on page 1872 of the bill which is titled \"HIGHER  EDUCATION  EMERGENCY  RELIEF  FUND\"\n\nSpecifically on line 19 of page 1877, it states how the universities may use the funds allocated to them.\n\nHere is the excerpt:\n\n**USES  OF FUNDS \u2014An  institution  of  higher  education  receiving  funds  under  this  section  may  use  the  funds received to**\n\n>**(1)  defray  expenses  associated  with  coronavirus (including  lost  revenue,  reimbursement  for  expenses already  incurred,  technology  costs  associated  with  a transition  to  distance  education,  faculty  and  staff  trainings, and payroll);**  \n>  \n>**(2)  carry  out  student  support  activities  authorized   by   the   HEA   that   address   needs   related   to   coronavirus;**  \n>  \n>**(3)  provide  financial  aid  grants  to  students  (including  students  exclusively  enrolled  in  distance  education), which may be used for any component of the student\u2019s  cost  of  attendance  or  for  emergency  costs that  arise  due  to  coronavirus,  such  as  tuition,  food,  housing,  health  care  (including  mental  health  care),  or  child  care.  In  making  financial  aid  grants  to  students,   an   institution   of   higher   education   shall   prioritize  grants  to  students  with  exceptional  need, such as students who receive Pell Grants.**\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nI think I found the provision that dictates the amount higher institutions are required to give as financial aid to students.  It's starts on line 11 of page 1880. It states the following:\n\n>**(5)  Institutions  of  higher  education  receiving  allocations  under   section  314(a)(1)  of  this  title  shall  provide  at  least  the   same  amount  of  funding  in  emergency  financial  aid  grants  to   students  as  was  required  to  be  provided  under  sections   18004(a)(1)  and (c) of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law  16116\u2013136).**  An  institution  of  higher  education  that  repurposes  funds  pursuant  to  paragraph  (2)  **shall  ensure  that  not  less  than  50  percent  of  the  funds  received under section 18004(a)(1) of division B of the CARES  Act  (Public  Law  116\u2013136)  are  used  for  financial  aid  grants  to  students**  under  either  section  18004(c)  of  division  B  of  the  CARES  Act  or  section  314(c)(3)  of  this  title,  or  a  combination  of  those  sections:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, it seems that the students that received payments in March from their university will also be receiving it this time around, as well. However, I'm not sure if more students are going to be included in these payments. Given that there's going to be almost $11 Billion dollars more in funding this time, it would only make sense that either more students receive money or the students that received money last time will get more, but nothing has made sense this year, so I wouldn't bet on this making sense either.\n\nI may be missing something here, so if one of y'all find better info, please don't hesitate to correct me. It'll help all of us get a better picture of what's going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to try to find more information then here's a link to the bill: [https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf](https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;",

Look at a school like Purdue they had another record incoming Freshman Class which is like 4 or 5 years in a row the Dean is always being interviewed on Squawk box in the morning,  and have not raised tuition this will be the tenth year. I hate to say it but some schools probably need to go out or be swallowed up for mistakes they have made for many years. But to others points , most Universities have had made major major cuts just some were operating more efficiently than others.",

      "text": "My school split funds between summer and fall.  They selected some student populations with a FAFSA to receive a check automatically.  Everyone  with a FAFSA (including initially awarded students) could that appeal for additional funding.  Between the two semesters students showing need and automatically selected could have received up to 4600 between Summer/Fall but more likely received 1000 to 1500.  These funds bypassed any bills, but many students immediately turned around to repay tuition anyway.\n\nNon-FAFSA students could apply for non federal funding, but that was tracked differently and we ran out of those funds and started building a waitlist on late summer or early fall.",

The schools don't need half of it. The students do. The students that can't live on campus because dorms are closed, or have $1000 extra in online fees because thats all that's being offered, or the students that have to buy fast food because cafes are closed on campus... etc. \n\n\nI say pay 1/3 to the vendors the college uses for covid prevention supplies, the rest directly to students.",

      "text": "This was my school personally using it just as an example: \n\nMy school is a smaller school in a rural community. It\u2019s about 3,500 students. We had classes outside with our whole class the first part of the semester then we switched to half in person half online and half the class went one day and then switch to online. We had to hire more janitors and we had to switch from hand dryers to paper towels. We got tested every two weeks each test is about 100$ a person. We could no longer eat in our dinning hall but only take take away so they bought to go drinks and snacks and to go containers for everything. They even paid for wifi and anything else students needed when we went online the last three weeks of classes. They bought cloth face masks, hand sanitizer and wipes for everyone to have. They had sanitizing stations all over campus too. They did a great job and I was very fortunate they did this. Our other state schools did this too and it worked with a school of 10,000. We also all got money based off of our credit hours I think I got like 600$. \n\nI know a lot of larger schools could not do this or chose not to and it\u2019s easier with smaller schools I just thought I would share.",

I could go on. \n\nTextbooks are not a significant source of university revenue; in fact, at most places (like my current uni) they\u2019re subsidized by the college and so actually cost money. Unis do not buy tech just to show \u201cidk, stuff.\u201d \n\nI understand that you\u2019re frustrated, and no ones ever been happy to hear this, but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.",

There was no writing center, learning center of tutoring center. There was no preheat, business, pre law, grad etc admissions counselors (your figured it out yourself).  There was no mental health counseling and effectively no physical health center.  There was no form of support at all for students lacking the financial or technical means to do a class , other than official scholarships and Pell grants etc (so no laptop loaners). TiTle IX was passed in 1972, but there were no office and even 10-15 years later, there was little support or infrastructure to actually protect the protected classes in that legislation.  There were no free computer programs (they are free to because your school pays for them).

I attended *The* Ohio State University in the early 2000s. I started as an out of state student and paid about $6k a quarter. Then, after over a year, once I petitioned for residency status and it was granted (no small feat may I add because you have to prove you didn\u2019t move there specifically to attend the college) my tuition dropped to less than $1900 per quarter. \n\nBefore I was even a student, and while I was a \u201clegal resident\u201d I worked in Columbus, paid Ohio state and federal taxes, rented apartments where I paid for utilities, shopped for my food and clothing and everything else in local stores, frequented restaurants and events, volunteered my time to charitable organizations, bought and registered a vehicle in Ohio - the list goes on and on. I contributed just as anyone else does. Except, I did it and got the \u201cprivilege\u201d of paying more for an equal education and even more in interest on those loans that were absolutely necessary to cover the outrageous cost of out of state tuition. I *could* have worked my way through college if it were affordable but it was not and that was by design. \n\nIf the argument is that I \u201ccost\u201d Ohio more by being from another state, why weren\u2019t all my living expenses subsidized to offset my financial contributions to the community I lived in? Why was I penalized financially? What financial gap did my increased tuition cover for the university?  \n\nThe answer is a new student union built years past my tenure there when the old one was perfectly fine and a new field house and athletic facilities for the NCAA football team that takes in millions, if not more per year, on \u201cstudent athletes\u201d they \u201cpay\u201d with a \u201cfree\u201d education and nothing else.",

You\u2019re perfectly fine in speaking on your own experience, but different schools don\u2019t all operate the same. You ask for plans and budgets that are actually already out there (I looked at several when I was choosing my college).  You also forget that colleges aren\u2019t all primarily education institutions. They do a lot more than just teach undergrads. There are schools that focus on this, but a good chunk dont. A lot focus on research and their grad programs, so if you went into a college expecting an amazing undergrad experience to a school focused heavily on research, that\u2019s your own fault. \n\nYou\u2019re literally ranting about your own faculty and classes.

Online classes are also expensive since schools have to ensure that students and teachers have the technology they need to make it work. My best guess is that this is going to mostly just keep people on payroll and stop some schools from going under entirely rather than aid students that much, but I could be wrong.",

I was stirred, in particular, by their genuine preference to face the consequences for skipping class versus practice. They were as motivated students as they could be, given the time constraints. That said, I gave several athletes a proportionally rude awakening as an Honor Council member when adjudicating sanctions for their academic dishonesty. The blanket disdain for student athletes was something that I shook from my own biases. Disapproving of university spending patterns, however, abound. \n\nSeparately, I am sure that your university has an ongoing and established relationship with whichever hotel franchise the athletes ended up at. The hotel managers are conscious of revenue opportunities stemming from university visitors, speakers, conferences, graduation, etc. You can rest assured that they are paying a reasonable fare.",
