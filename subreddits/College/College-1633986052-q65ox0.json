  "text": "Alrighty- I think I might fail a test but I need some help to calculate my end of semester grade:\n\nPassing: C (70-79%)\n\nMidterm and Final (60%, 30 each)\n\nHomework types (40, 20 each)\n\nIf I have a 64.4 with the hw, and I score a 70 or an 80 on the final, what do you think my final grade would be?\n\nIf this is not an answerable question, that's okay. The system won't let me calculate it on my own.\n\nI just need at least a 70- or a 69.6 since the prof rounds.\n\nThank you!",
