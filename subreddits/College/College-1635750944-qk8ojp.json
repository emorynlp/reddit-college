  "text": "Its not fulfilling, i dont care about the things im learning about, im barely getting my associates degree this semester after 4 years. Ive been wanting to drop out since freshman year and im only still here because i dont know what else to do, gotta make parents proud i guess. \n\n\nI barely put any effort into my school work & half ass all of my assignments. I honestly dont care about a diploma or money or even a career at this point.\n\nI think id be better off with a basic job & more time to experience life, my hobbies, teach myself & learn whatever i am actually interested in. No more stress about deadlines or assignments.\n\nI know im being to idealistic, but im honestly so sick of college. Its such a ridiculously expensive scam. Literally i pay to have an older person read bullet points off of powerpoint slides that recap the textbook. Like why the middle man? Why cant i just read the textbook? Not like professors have the time to actually sit down with us and explain anything anyway.\n\nI usually have to re-teach myself or learn from YouTube videos anyway",
