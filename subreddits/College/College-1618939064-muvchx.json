  "text": "Most colleges now require you to have an internship of some kind before graduating.This is completely ridiculous and should be optional.How on earth am I supposed to work an unpaid internship (one recommended to me by my professor),carry a full load of classes, and work an actual real job because I need to pay my bills?I\u2019m paying for a class to tell me I need experience-no duh.I am failing my internship class even though I have an internship!There should be no other criteria to pass or fail this class other than securing the blasted internship.I don\u2019t have time to write about how \u201cenlightening this experience has been\u201d when I\u2019m required to update university postings,send out fundraising letters,and email Congress multiple times a week for this internship.I\u2019m barely passing my other classes as is and I\u2019m so tired.",

It\u2019s also why internship classes stress that you write about the reflection and learning. \n\nA lot of occupations are romanticized, but when students receive hands-on opportunities to see *all* of the aspects of the profession, many change their minds. That\u2019s excellent, because it saves them time and money and allows them to get a start on figuring out what is better suited for their strengths. \n\nI do agree internships should not be unpaid.",

However, it\u2019s not impossible to do it that way. I\u2019d say whatever free time you have, even 15 minutes a day, dedicate it to searching either for a job/student job that is close to what you\u2019re majoring in, a paid internship, or start networking with recruiters and explaining when you\u2019ll be interested in interning. Good luck & be persistent & patient. It\u2019ll work out in the end :)",

The reality is that many of the things you learn during an internship might not be that relevant, but just that experience in a professional environment helps. Some companies care about nurturing new grads and so the experience isn't as required. I know it is hard but try to get something, anything. You will do fine either way",

Typically in internship-required majors, you'll walk the stage but will only get the degree after you come back and give a presentation on how your internship went. \n\n So, in these majors, the economy never really fully bounced back after '08, (as in amount of professional jobs) and now with COVID-19, I know maybe five guys off the top of my head who aren't able to graduate as they never got an internship or the internship got cancelled. Some programs/departments are allowing independent research projects to take the place of an internship.",

I did my entire internship without realizing I was eligible for a work study because no one told me. My internship is also a nonprofit based out of my school, and my director told me about the work study and I got paid minimum wage to intern. But this wasn't until I accumulated all my hours for my internship class that I found out, then decided to quit my job and just stick to the internship. \n\nRealistically students are expected to either do it over the summer or as one of their 5 classes during a normal full course semester, so its not exactly THAT much more work, especially if you make sure you take easier classes alongside it if you can. My class for the internship was just to submit a paragraph or two each week about what I did, and a 3-4 page paper at the very end of the internship. And I worked 6-10 hours a week or 3-5 hours twice a week in between classes. It sucks and is grunt work but honestly thsts the type of shit you're more likely to see in the workplace than any of your classes anyway lmao. And like others said about being competitive, I will guarantee you you're not going to get a competitive or better job over others. Most people have 2-3 internships and more. Internships are way too important in 2021. Worth more than the degree truthfully. If schools didn't force students to take it then students like yourself would undervalue yourselves and think the school failed you or that your education wasn't good enough. \n\nA degree used to be enough, now it's internships. After your first one you're sure to get an even better one. My first one was similar to what you described but I also ran their social media accounts and some other random things. That internship got me another internship with a fortune 300 company twice. And with that internship I hope to get an internship with a major company like Spotify, Google, etc. For sure wouldn't have been possible without he first grunt internship at the nonprofit my school had. Of course this all leads to a job in the end too",

Hell with that money you can save up enough over a year and just use that to live on campus and have all your expenses paid for. Or for your situation you could just pay the full price of the internship class over the summer and just spend an extra 10-15 hours a week on your internship while working full time. If you're working full time (40 hours) you def got time to work an easy part time internship over the summer with no classes to worry about (with non-working weekends you got 2 full days to work, which most part time internships are extreeeemly flexible because they know they are dealing with students who usually already have a part time job and have chaotic schedules). OP sounds like money is the main problem though\n\nAlso does your job not have tuition reimbursement? Most companies do and will pay for your credits. You can get loans for the rest like most people. A basic masters degree on the cheap side can be about 20k (which if you end up making 80k a year you'll have this paid off in the same year lol) or higher ends about 80k. But I dont think anyone would recommend going 80k in debt for a masters/higher degree unless you're becoming a doctor or anything like that, which the ROI of that type of job typically outweighs the amount of debt",

The past few months have also been very abnormal for the business so I'm definitely making a lot more then the last two years and I don't know how long that will last. \n\nI work about 50 to 60 hours a week right now including weekends. I am off on Wednesdays, but end up coming and working at least half a day on that day about 2/3 of the time, and then on Sundays when nothing around here is open. My average work day is 7am to 7:00 pm and then I go home and do homework. This is what is making me think it will be hard to find an internship.\n\nI'm also 39 years old and have been going to college off and on for a long time, split between courses at community college and trying to attend on campus universities and realizing it just didn't work with needing to work full-time and having a child. The whole problem with all this is I have a mortgage, a car payment, and my son is in some therapies which are pretty expensive even with insurance, so I'm having to pay a lot more in bills and things than I did when I was younger and basically just had to worry about living and existing as an undergrad.\n\nMy job does not have tuition reimbursement. The thing that kind of sucks is the brand that I work for offers a program where they will pay for your degree, but you have to do it through Strayer University and the dealership has to pay to opt into it, so most do not. \n\nI'm just physically and mentally exhausted from the hours and I know that things will change big time where I work when our current owner retires and he's already in his '60s, so I want to either be in the position to make a switch where I can do management only and not go back to the sales floor and such crazy hours, or what I would prefer today would be totally changed tracks and go into counseling or possibly get my doctorate in psychology if I can ever figure out the time and cost thing. That's really what I'm more passionate about and I figure as I get older I would have some flexibility and still be able to make decent money through private practice. But right now I have an 11-year-old and I feel like I've missed 80% of his life because I'm always at work and want to at least be there so I'm during the teenager years.",
