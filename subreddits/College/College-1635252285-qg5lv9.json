  "text": "I can't garner any motivation whatsoever to take notes and study for my online classes. It feels like it would be 1000 times easier to be in an actual hall. I really hope I'm not just lazy; but it's my very first trimester and things are already falling apart. Ugh.  \nThat's all. Time to go fail a midterm.",

Online classes are very hard to concentrate as opposed to in person learning because, even when you want to slack off, you still have to hear the professor at the end of the room. \n\nHowever, be diligent. Shake those feelings off of you. Pay no mind. Sit down, pay attention, and then practice. Practice is the key to passing classes, not the idiotic professors who are utterly useless.",
