Last year in 2020 summer term, my college offered calculus which is worth 4 credits. As a student who is taking STEM for his future studies, I willingly took it. Notice here that I was very willing to learn. However, it was the first term for my college to organize an online based program, and they ridiculously only had inquiry sessions and no teaching sessions, meaning there are only Q&A meetings with the professor on zoom and they are not supposed to teach us! Our Biology and Human Geography professor noticed the terrible idea, so he taught us during the inquiry sessions anyways, like explaining the chapter and stuff which was helpful. However, we were stuck with the math professor who we only met in inquiry sessions and taught us almost nothing. He would talk about weather and COVID in his country and then sign off. We had to do our homeworks which was really tough with no explanations, experience and being taught nothing! All we had was YouTube links that he provided. We complained the school, and that made him upload more videos and find more sources only. Overall, though I do not wish to blame the professor, I feel like the effort was very poor. I dropped math and left it behind.

And at the university level, if my university doesn't offer online classes, then the students will simply enroll at other places. **In this sense, online classes are actually destroying higher education.**\n\nOn the other hand, it isn't really a case of professors being lazy.
