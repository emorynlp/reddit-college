  "text": "In my college, only pre-nursing students are to take Anatomy and Physiology their first semester of freshman year. The ppl in my group have prior knowledge to this stuff and I\u2019m stuck w my highschool education and whatever we learn currently. I rewatch the lab videos, I go to office hours, I stay up studying but I literally can\u2019t help them. During group contests, I just don\u2019t understand anything and at this point they kinda know I\u2019m lost\n\nThen I feel they think I\u2019m slow bc when they\u2019re having a debate about a question, one person always goes to me and says \u201cHey what do you think the answer is?\u201d and the other person would snicker or something\n\nI also dropped some glass and my dumbass picked it up and got called out\n\nMan idk, this ain\u2019t it",

      "text": "it\u2019s not personal and you aren\u2019t dumb. A lot of people don\u2019t like group work because it will never be even no matter how much education you have. \n\nYou cant really beat yourself up over this bc you are genuinely trying. You also don\u2019t have 2-6 semesters under your belt. Anatomy & physiology is a weed out class just like O chem.",

Keep going to your office hours and studying hard, OP. You will learn, and it will stay with you, because you had to put in the effort. All the best in nursing school!",

      "text": "If you are a freshman in college,it\u2019s okay. I was in the same shoes as you were when I started my prerequisites. I failed AnP 1 my first time unfortunately and I had to change how I would study for the second time around. IMO your first semester/quarter is going to be the hardest in terms of finding out how you can study, and how you can manage you time better. Crash Course and Science with Susanna are good YouTube channels you can go to if you need help on AnP. Good luck.",

I swear, every person I'm working with is a fucking genius who's been doing this shit for years and I'm like this rando who managed to just stroll into the picture and I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing. \n\nI honestly feel really guilty, too, for even being allowed in the program/group/project I'm in because it's really competitive and I know people who are *way* more qualified than me trying to get into same thing I'm doing who could do a much better job but they just weren't as lucky as me. \n\nI try the best I can, but I don't know how I'll ever feel like I'm \"good enough.\"",
