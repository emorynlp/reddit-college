  "title:": "Do I really need to be drinking at college!?",
  "text": "Ever since I went to college with, my dormmates have been inviting me to drink. I don't personally like drinking unless I really have to (business meeting, etc.) because I don't really see the point on drinking and I want to avoid getting drunk, my dormmates are very forceful to the point that He will buy some random alcohol and invite us to drink regardless we reject or now. How do I deal with this? It's like I'm losing my own personal boundary\n\n(This is my first year of college, living away from my family for the first time and I'm currently staying in China where denying an offer to drink is considered as a rude gesture)\n\nYes, I did have bad experience about drinking before. \n\nUPDATE :\nI resisted them for the first time, I went to chill with them with coffee. They were drinking vodka and stuffs. It feels great to be able to be in control of your life again against this peer pressure!\n\nThank you very much for the help guys, I might have to work on my principle, because I find it hard to say no sometimes.",

Chemically, ethanol is a flammable solvent that can be used to run your car. That is to say: it would be cheaper to just sip from a gallon of premium unleaded gasoline.\n\nIf you are interested in doing well in school and creating some kind of career from it,  or becoming a more enlightened person, I do not suggest drinking while in college or ever. Not only does it mess up your body, mind, and metabolism for a time but it blows out your internal organs and leaves you dull for various periods afterward.\n\nAlcoholism and binge drinking are behind many great mishaps in life, and have been a great downfall of many cultures and peoples.",

      "text": "It was said in another comment, but I have a story that goes with this. When I think about going to parties with alcohol, I try and gauge whether the alcohol is the point of the party or a companion. \n\nA few days ago actually, I was at a party with a lot of close friends. Like most parties, you only really know 25% of the people sometimes, but that\u2019s okay if you\u2019re all there to enjoy each other\u2019s company. There were actually quite a few people there who either didn\u2019t drink because of personal reasons, or because they were a DD. And most of us there had mad respect for that, just because they had the will to not partake in drinking so that all of us could get home safe. There was even one guy there who was only there to hang out and watch us all get drunk. It was his first party with us, so he didn\u2019t realize we don\u2019t really get shit faced, but no one thought any less of him for being there. He was everyone\u2019s go to guy if they lost their phone or purse or anything. \n\ntldr: I believe that if you\u2019re with the right people, consuming alcohol should not be a critical point for them to not like you or like you. \n\nI know this may not help with your roommate situation, but it may give you insight on how to approach it. Hope you can figure something out, and also find some cool peeps to party with and enjoy your time in college with!",

I used to go to parties almost every weekend my freshman year, now I (who's aged a couple years) stay in and watch Netflix.\n\nI've been to many parties where people don't drink and have the most fun out of everyone. The fact that your dorm mates are pressuring you to drink, even when you say no, is a problem. I'd probably request a new room if they keep stepping over boundaries like that. Or if that's something you want to deal with, (moving sucks, I understand) you could always go somewhere else when they choose to drink and come back later. However, nobody should feel like they can't stay in their own room. Put your foot down and tell them to quit asking you. It's one thing if they drink around you and don't bother you, but it's another if they do it and constantly try and pressure you.",

But there is a considerable difference between being drunk and being knocked out drunk under a bench while others try to clean you out of your own vomit. I won't ever go near even the first, because as a diabetic it could cost me my life and I don't need the headache in the morning. If others want to do it though, have fun, I'm not judging. But I never could and I suspect never will see or understand the enjoyment factor in the second version.\n\nAs for the wrong or right people, please understand that I meant it relatively. In my view, the \"right\" people to go drinking with are the people who you can have fun with even without alcohol. That way, yes, you are absolutely right, it can lead to great stories and memories. And they will accept if you say no.\n\nLastly, personally I never liked drinking for the sake of drinking alone or to drink just to end up blackout drunk. Don't see the point of it, that's why I included not being flat out drunk where I did. But hey, YMMV. And perhaps I could have phrased it better.",

Because drinking isn't the point in any of your examples. It's there accompanying something else, a conversation or other activities.\n\n> No shit, but you acknowledging that here where as above you said getting drunk makes you a wrong person to hang with. \n\nI never said that. I said that drinking with the right company \"probably noone will be **flat out drunk** by the end of the day.\" Which, as we've discussed above, is not the same as being simply drunk. And that is because, as you said yourself, ending up blacked out is not the point.\n\n> Great of you to clarify down here.\n\nThat is, after all, what a conversation is for, no?",
