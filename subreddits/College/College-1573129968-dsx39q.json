When I think about going to parties with alcohol, I try and gauge whether the alcohol is the point of the party or a companion. \n\nA few days ago actually, I was at a party with a lot of close friends. Like most parties, you only really know 25% of the people sometimes, but that\u2019s okay if you\u2019re all there to enjoy each other\u2019s company. There were actually quite a few people there who either didn\u2019t drink because of personal reasons, or because they were a DD. And most of us there had mad respect for that, just because they had the will to not partake in drinking so that all of us could get home safe. There was even one guy there who was only there to hang out and watch us all get drunk. It was his first party with us, so he didn\u2019t realize we don\u2019t really get shit faced, but no one thought any less of him for being there. He was everyone\u2019s go to guy if they lost their phone or purse or anything. \n\ntldr: I believe that if you\u2019re with the right people, consuming alcohol should not be a critical point for them to not like you or like you. \n\nI know this may not help with your roommate situation, but it may give you insight on how to approach it.
