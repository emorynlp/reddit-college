      "text": "I started college with a windows laptop and it just couldn\u2019t handle what I was doing. It was slow as hell and couldn\u2019t run a lot of things at once. Switched to a MacBook Air and used that for the rest of my undergrad. It was awesome. I just got rid of it (6 years old). It was still running well and I didn\u2019t have to get rid of it but I started my masters that\u2019s completely online and needed a bigger screen (I have bad eye sight). Got a new MacBook Pro before the new one came out. This will probably last me for at least 10 years. They are expensive at the front but they definitely last longer. And work faster. My husband has a windows computer that was a $1500 computer and two years old and my MacBook Air that was 5 years old at the time still was faster.",
