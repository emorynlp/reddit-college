  "text": "Whenever I\u2019m reading books for class, I get this nervous anxious feeling. I\u2019m just worried that I won\u2019t understand them and that I\u2019m an idiot. What if my understanding of the books don\u2019t match the intended understanding of the majority of students and the instructor? \n\nHow do I ease this uneasy feeling?",

      "text": "Not a psych major, but it honestly sounds like a Pavlovian response.  I.e., you\u2019ve become conditioned to feeling anxious every time you crack open the book. I sometimes feel this way when studying for an exam, which is counterintuitive, because studying should make me score higher and so I should feel less anxious\u2026 but instead I feel MORE anxious as I uncover more of what I don\u2019t know or have forgotten!\n\nOne thing I tell myself (which might also help you) is this: in most of my classes, less than half of the students even bother doing the assigned reading. By reading ahead, you\u2019ll have another perspective (the author\u2019s, or your own if you\u2019re analyzing the reading itself) to compare to what your prof(\u2018s notes) said.  You\u2019ll probably have more and better questions, opinions, etc. so you\u2018ll be analyzing and engaging more than someone who\u2019s passively absorbing material from lecture for the first time.\n\nSo yeah, read and be proud of yourself.",
