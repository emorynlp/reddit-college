  "text": "Hi, so I\u2019m kind of new to Reddit so please excuse the formatting. I\u2019m a freshman in college and I have an online friend that I like to joke around with a lot. Sometimes we make pretty vulgar racist jokes that could be seen as simply being racist if taken out of context. Well he ended up getting upset with me over something and is threatening to send screenshots of the things I\u2019ve said to one of my professors. I\u2019m honestly super scared because I don\u2019t know what would happen if the professor saw the screenshots. My friend knows my real life name, but the screenshots don\u2019t include my full name. I don\u2019t know what to do, if he does see them should I just try my best to explain the context and tell him I will try to change? I really regret making those jokes now and am scared with what will happen.",

      "text": "Sorry OP, but it's hard to be sympathetic to your situation. The \"context\" we live in is a country that has a brutal past of dehumanizing and abusing people who don't have the \"right\" melanin content in their skin. No matter what you say about the \"context\" of your conversation, nothing can really override the context of our history. \n\nStep number one is to stop making these \"jokes\" altogether. Nothing productive can come from it. Step number two is to wait and see what happens. In the unlikely scenario that you actually get in trouble, show remorse. Realistically, the most likely scenario is that your professor will silently judge you but continue to treat you like every other student and move on with his or her life because professors are paid to teach and grade all their students fairly, even the racist students. \n\nSome schools have stricter codes of conduct than others, so it's certainly *possible* that you could get in trouble. It also depends on *how* vulgar these \"jokes\" are. Some statements are more egregious than others, and while I'm against all racist jokes, I think it's silly to act as if they're all the same. \n\nYou can't undo the past, so the best thing you could do if someone calls you out on it is to own up to it and DON'T MAKE EXCUSES. Claiming something was \"taken out of context\" is a copout and makes it seem that you are not aware of the actual harm caused by the context of our racist history. Making statements like that will get you into even more trouble and will make you seem ignorant at best, and that's a generous interpretation. Just acknowledge that you were stupid and apologize. That's about all that you can do, tbh.",

Learned quickly how shitty of a person I was and took a lot of time for self-reflection and apologizing to those I hurt. I hope you learn your lesson too, regardless of the outcome\n\nDepending on how messed up the shit you said and the quantity, you could be expelled or get a slap on the wrist depending on where you live. We\u2019re gonna need more information. People mocked George Floyd\u2019s death last year and some posted racist Snaps and Instagram posts and got expelled for it.\n\nAlso \u201cwe made vulgar racist jokes that can be seen as racist with no context\u201d is embarrassing. No amount of \u201ccontext\u201d will excuse your racist comments to any sane professor and recognizing that should be your first step to truly being a better person. I wish the best for you.",

Still, I agree that nothing excuses those types of remarks. I truly hope I am not severely punished for this but there is no complaining if I am because the nature of the things I said were overall shitty and inexcusable.",

However, if it does get to the point where you are spoken to, then showing the same remorse and sincerity like you did in this comment will likely make everything okay.\n\nYou\u2019re in college, kids say and do dumb shit on a regular basis. A student saying edgy things online probably isn\u2019t something that crazy enough for expulsion at this point in time. I\u2019d say relax, you\u2019re going to be okay.
