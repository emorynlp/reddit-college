  "text": "I am a student worker in my college because of COVID and the suspension of in person enrollment services, I have to help people enroll even though that isn't my job. Because of this there also has been an influx of street people that come in and completely waste my time just to abuse our facilities. I got one man that came in so high I had to call security. \n\nNow there is one woman who comes in and loves to say she's going to enroll but in reality all she does is nothing all day. Literally nothing! She is so demanding and annoying. I have been seeing her for three months straight. At this point she is trespassing yet nobody cares because \"at least she isn't violent\" \n\nWhat can I even do? Should I quit?",

          "text": "This isn't true-- many public colleges have rules that you must be have authorization before entering certain buildings. Being public doesn't change that-- if being a public institution were all an institution needed to have literal open access to all the public, then we'd all be able to just stroll right into the pentagon, lol. \n\nObviously colleges don't need the same level of security as the Pentagon, but many colleges nevertheless do house expensive and/or dangerous things that they have to protect and many schools are bad at locking labs and the like, so it's a real security concern that someone can just stroll right in and do whatever they want.",

It makes me feel uneasy because I work mostly alone in a huge area on campus and this woman behaves in a bizarre manner.",
