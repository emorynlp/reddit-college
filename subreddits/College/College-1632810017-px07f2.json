Does anyone else feel as hopeless or is it just me, i mean ive struggled with depression and other issues that make it harder for me in school but this year of procrastination/lack of motivation is next level, maybe its bc i worked full time over the summer and did summer classes so im just like dead but honestly i had a month where i just worked full time and that was heaven, no outside of work grueling hours you can come home and be at home instead of dreading and hating yourself for not being productive or finishing hw earlier. It sucks bc im usually a try hard and perfectionist but i just cant seem to care anymore, I still enjoy work and have been balling pretty hard in that sense but school just seems so redundant and meaningless", "author": "karmafloof", "created": 1632810017, "retrieved": 1632945456, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heltw6q": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px07f2/serious_burnout/heltw6q/", "text": "Burnout and Lack of Motivation is a real consequence of online classes.
