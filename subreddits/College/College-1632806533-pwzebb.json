  "text": "The gist of my situation is I am in a different university in a different country for my final year. While I got to meet many different people from different countries I haven't been as outgoing as others have been bringing up familiar feelings of FOMO. I have read previous posts on making friends in this sub I ask is it worth it putting much effort to making friends with people who I may never meet again within the next year.",

      "text": "I think whether it\u2019s worth it or not is completely up to you. Some people in this sub seem to think no effort is better so they can sit here and whine about it. In my eyes it\u2019s worth the effort even if it\u2019s just for a year since it\u2019ll make that year better. And with technology these days, just because you leave the country means it\u2019s goodbye forever, you can still keep in contact I it\u2019s important to you.",
