  "text": "I\u2019m taking a precalculus class, and up until now I\u2019ve maintained a 99.7 average from working my ass off. I was proud of myself until we took a final administered not by our professor, but by the head of the math department. We had 2 hours to take it, around 25 questions, and the questions were extremely odd and different from anything we\u2019d ever learned. Most of the questions, I\u2019d never seen in my life and we had never touched upon it in the entire semester. \n\nThe entire class failed, and now my average is down to somewhere in the 70\u2019s. The professor refuses to give extra credit or a retake and won\u2019t answer his emails. The other precalculus classes had easier exams, but were still in the same situation. \n\nWhat can we do? I\u2019m so stressed.",

          "text": "Lol, in the graduate class that I dropped earlier this semester, the professor switched up the grading composition to 45% for the Final Exam midway through the semester. A lot of students had cheated on his weekly quizzes, so he decided to address this issue by raising the value of the Final Exam. Sure, a genius plan. This class is also considered to be the hardest in the department. Also, he does not curve.",

The structure should remain the same however.",

Like sometimes the question will purposely omit some information that is required to solve it via standard methods, but with math intuitions you can probably solve the question(Like presenting you a analytically unsolvable ODE but actually expecting you to use quadratures)..I am guessing the topic is the same but the questions are just focused on different aspects of a theorem with the aim to examine your intuition. As a math major, most questions I answered on exams feels \"random\" and aren't remotely similar to what was taught in class, never seen in my life and much more difficult than the homework sets. It is usually fine to \"fail\" a hard math exam. One of the math exam I took go from -100 points to 100 points, where you start off with 0 points, gain 10 points with each right answer and lose 10 with each wrong one. A problem left empty count as 0. Needless to say, some people got negative scores and complained they should have never showed up to the exam.(The average was 7 in case you are wondering)\n\nI think your professor will curve the class, unless the class has a decent average. By decent, I mean something around a 75%. If he insisted that he will not curve, then maybe the class did not do as bad as you think.

There are 59 BONs total. \u201cBoards of Nursing (BONs) are jurisdictional governmental agencies that are responsible for the regulation of nursing practice.\u201d\n\nThe NCLEX is a national exam so everyone takes the exact same exam from Kentucky to Vermont to California. \n\nBecause it\u2019s a *national* exam, there\u2019s the singular National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), which all 59 BONs are members of. \u201cThe [expectation ](https://www.registerednursing.org/answers/what-does-state-board-nursing-do/)of each BON is to regulate the practice of nursing using defined nursing standards. Each state has their own version of the Standards of Nursing Practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are four main focus areas for nursing boards: *education*, practice, licensure, and discipline.\n\nThe BON's arm of education encompasses topics such as *nursing school curriculum approval*, online nursing programs, continuing education unit (CEU) regulations, evidenced-based nursing education, *simulation standards for schools, and publications.*\u201d\n\nI live in California. Here\u2019s what the [CA BRN](https://www.rn.ca.gov/education/programs.shtml) website states regarding their purpose and authority: \u201cThe BRN has the *authority to approve* registered nursing and advanced practice nursing programs in California. The purpose of approval is to ensure the program's compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. *Prelicensure nursing programs must be approved by the BRN.*\u201d\n\nWhen a college\u2019s curriculum is not approved by this *government* agency this is what happens: \n\n\n[UNAPPROVED NURSING PROGRAM: Advanced Pro Nursing Institute (APNI) operating in Hayward, California is not approved by the Board of Registered Nursing as a nursing school. The Board of Registered Nursing issued a Cease and Desist letter on December 11, 2014. Any person who has graduated or is attending this school will not be eligible for licensure as a Registered Nurse unless he/she attends and completes a Board of Registered Nursing approved nursing program. If you did or are attending APNI you may file a complaint with the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education; please visit their website for more information.](https://www.rn.ca.gov/education/programs.shtml)",

              "text": "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that. Definitely keep trying things for now, but don\u2019t be totally surprised if your final assigned grade is higher than you\u2019re expecting. If you showed you were a top student all semester, and came out with one of the higher scores on the final, your professor may look on you favorably. I had a class which did not announce a curve (if anything, I was expecting to be curved *down*), but was pleasantly surprised on the date grades came out, and even made sure it was not a mistake. \n\nIt\u2019s possible your professor is avoiding confirming a curve because of the constant attention from students he would receive - those who may be on the edge of a certain grade, seeking to know their exact standing before grades come out, appealing their curved grade, etc. - all of which would be greatly decreased if he just assigns a grade. It\u2019s also possible none at all is coming, in which case, again, I\u2019m very sorry. My advice is to stay as professional as you can in any efforts to fix the situation. \n\nEven if things don\u2019t go well, you will absolutely be fine.  Based on the level of effort you put in to earn your previous mark, you seem to be a good student and I\u2019m sure you will do well in the future. And you\u2019ll have this story to tell if anyone asks about this specific class on your transcript. \n\nSorry for a very long-winded reply, but I hope this may ease some of your anxieties about this. It\u2019s totally natural to be stressed, but once there is nothing more you can do, it\u2019s not worth your energy. Make sure you have explored every reasonable route your school offers, then try to direct that energy in a positive direction until your final grade is posted.",
