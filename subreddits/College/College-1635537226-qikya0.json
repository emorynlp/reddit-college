  "text": "So I'm currently taking 5 classes, 15 credits. I just transferred to UAF so I don't have a GPA here yet. I'm currently sitting at 3 As and 2 Bs. If I let it ride I'm looking at around a 3.55. Or I could the drop lower B and end with around a 3.75. My goal was to get the highest GPA I could this fall to apply for internships in the spring so I know number wise it makes sense but it seems a waste to drop a B and have to retake the class I paid for.",

      "text": "Presumably you will have to submit your transcripts, which means they will see the W. W's are bad. A 4.0 record with a lot of W's is significantly worse than a 3.5 with just one or two.",
