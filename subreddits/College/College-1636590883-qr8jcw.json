  "title:": "Should I Transfer for my Girlfriend?",
  "text": "So, my girlfriend is graduating this year and I will still have another 2 years of school to complete. I currently go to a pretty prestigious school in the middle of nowhere and she goes to school 3 hours away. We've made long distance work for the past two years by alternating who goes where and seeing each other every other week. She's going to be moving 3 hours in the other direction of me to a major city and starting work. She's moving to this location specifically because it's the general area I grew up in and where we've talked about settling down post college.\n\nNo part of me doubts that we could make the long distance work, things would just continue on as they have already, and we're both happy. I just want so badly to sort of jumpstart living my life with her. I've read a lot of posts about just one person chasing the other and then resenting them for it, but does it make it better that she's also choosing where she's going to be moving essentially because of me?\n\nWhat's making this all so hard is that I'm not actively unhappy where I'm at. I've done pretty well for myself here and it's a good school, I'm not super happy with it either, kind of just neutral, yet I fear I might transfer and just be back on ground zero in terms of social-life, professor relationships, etc. \n\nWhat would you guys do in such a situation? I fully intend to spend the rest of my life with her and marry her, I'm kind of torn between this whole \"start life with her now\" option and a \"well if we're going to together for the rest of our lives what is another 2 years\" perspective.",

If you guys broke up a month after you transferred you would pretty much be stuck, just wait it out for two years and see if you both still have interest in each other.",

You guys have already made the LDR work, so surely you what it takes to continue it for another two years, especially if it is meant to be. Good luck.",

It\u2019s a lot of money and I can\u2019t do that on top of a whole location switch. \n\nPut your academics/job first. When you\u2019re done with college, you are financially stable, and you definitely see yourself marrying her then move. Also before moving look for jobs. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like any of this advice and say a year down the road you think everything is going great then you\u2019ll probably move anyway. Just make sure you have a solid plan for your education and etc. Never rely on anyone else for that or put it on the back burner.",
