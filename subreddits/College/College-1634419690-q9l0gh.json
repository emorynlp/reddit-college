  "text": "These classes aren't for my major, they're electives. But they want me to do charity. Like how tf am I supposed to organize this in one week? Who do you think I am? I'm not that involved with my community or anything, so how am I supposed to get involved in a week? Does this happen to you in your classes? Wtf am I supposed to do?",

Google \"volunteering (city)\". Search for food banks, animal shelters, etc and call and ask about volunteering. Its not the type of thing that takes months to set up, you really only need to make a few phone calls.",
