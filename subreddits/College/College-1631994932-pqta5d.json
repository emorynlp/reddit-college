  "text": "I'm a senior in high school in IL. I have a list of colleges I want to apply to (5), but some schools have given me offers to apply with no application fee and no essay requirement (or test score requirements given the virus). Should I apply to these schools even if I have no intention of going to them?\n\nAlso should I only give the schools I'm interested in my SSN or?? Thanks because I'm clueless. No one in my family has gone to college.",

I ended up getting a full tuition scholarship and I\u2019m attending there right now and really like it. I applied to 11 schools but I don\u2019t recommend that lmao. I do recommend applying early if you can ! Good luck",
