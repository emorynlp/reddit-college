  "title:": "Graduating Early or Enjoy Senior Year?",
  "text": "So I have been debating on graduating college early in Spring 2022 and take my remaining 18 credit hours or just lengthen it out so that I can enjoy my senior year and possibly raise my GPA. I have a 3.66 GPA as of now and one of my professors said that I should possibly slow down next year so that I raise my GPA for graduate school. Any advice?",
