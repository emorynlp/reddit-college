The military offers a program called the Armed Services Health Professions Scholarship Program. Basically, they pay 100% medical school tuition, a VERY nice sign-on bonus, and a monthly housing stipend (a monthly payment that goes towards your cost of living and what we prior military folks receive to go to school as well) in exchange for a period of time after residency to be done as a medical professional in service with one of the branches. Also, if you do look into it, choose the Air Force. Not because I was USAF, but because they offer the most! Lol",

Not TOO shabby but I am making plans to somehow bring that down to $35k by trying to find full time jobs while doing my masters that offer tuition reimbursement.
