  "text": "This semester has been draining the life out of me and I just feel defeated. I go to school in the U.S. and have been looking forward to having Veterans Day off of school. For weeks all I\u2019ve been thinking about is just enjoying myself and finally get to sit down and watch Netflix again. There is nothing like being home and sitting in bed. For those of you who have the day off tomorrow too, please enjoy yourselves. If you don\u2019t have time off from school, take some time to relax tomorrow, this weekend, whenever. We all deserve it.",
