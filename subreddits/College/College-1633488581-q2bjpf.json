  "text": " \n\nHello all,\n\nI'm  thinking about transferring but I'm not sure how to find a more  meaningful college experience. I'm not totally sure if I'm going to  transfer, because right now I'm in a sort of exploratory engineering  program, and things might be better next semester when I'm in \"real\"  classes for my major, but I still want to apply for transfer in case  things aren't better. I've been very dissatisfied with my college  experience. The classes haven't been particularly difficult, despite  what I was promised (although who knows, the upcoming midterms might  really hurt), but they don't feel meaningful.\n\nI'm  taking five classes this semester, and the only one that doesn't feel  like it could be replaced with just reading the textbook (or in the case  of my engineering class, watching a TED talk on project management) is a  literature class. I am in college to learn how to be an engineer, and  it seems like the professors don't add much to that experience. I'm even  considering just dropping out, getting my hands on copies of the  textbooks, and studying everything myself. I know material is going to  get harder, but I don't see the point in spending tens of thousands of  dollars on Q&A sessions. For my math class I've had to come up with  my own problem sets and teach myself everything from the textbook, what  is the point then?\n\nI think that it  is possible this could get better in higher level classes, but the base  problem still seems like it would be present. Most of the hands-on  stuff seems confined to internships, clubs, and grad school, and I'm  trying to do the first two but it seems silly to be in college at all if  it's just a prerequisite for these experiences with very little unique  learning. I do understand that college is supposed to be a collection of  experiences and broaden my thinking, and I will admit it has helped me  meet new people, but I can just buy general education textbooks as  well??? Could transferring help? If so, how do I find a new college that  will feel more worthwhile? The college descriptions and rankings all  seem very deceptive in hindsight, so I'm feeling pretty lost about what  to do. My current thinking is that I will apply for transfer for fall of  next year, so I can decide if I want to transfer after my \"real\"  classes begin. Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "text": "But aren\u2019t these kinds of classes what you expected in an engineering major? Engineering is a tough major. Most of your classes will be math and science based, so these might not be your definition of \u201cmeaningful.\u201d I\u2019m kinda confused on what you mean by that anyway. Classes like literature are general Ed\u2019s. No matter what you do, you have to take general Ed\u2019s\u2014at least around 30-45 credits worth, so that\u2019s at least 1\u20131.5 years. You may find these classes boring, but you have to take them.\n\nIll be Frank with you\u2014if you drop out and learn the material yourself, no one will hire you in engineering. It\u2019s one of those professions that require a degree. Plus, classes aren\u2019t just about reading the textbook to learn all your knowledge. Professors have you read textbooks then make assignments based on what you got from reading.\n\nI can\u2019t tell what year you are, so it\u2019s hard to give proper advice. You might just not like your major or are bored with general Ed\u2019s. General Ed\u2019s are inveitable, though. Maybe experiment with some classes if you are still early in college? Like idk take a philosophy of religions class or something you find interesting. I can\u2019t tell if transferring would be best. If you don\u2019t like clubs, then don\u2019t join them. But I would go out and do some social events or make college more \u201cmeaningful\u201d for yourself. But again, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s your major or the general Ed\u2019s that you don\u2019t like. And as far as the textbook goes, not every class will be fun. Some classes are boring and they suck. College is hard. But some classes are also fun and are exciting. \n\nAnyways, hope you take something from this",
