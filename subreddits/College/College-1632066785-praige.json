All the friends I made freshman year branched out and met new people, I was left behind. I still hung out with them occasionally, but a lot of times they were busy with their own stuff and I was lonely. So I poured myself into my work, went to the gym, etc. Looking back on my college years as a graduate, sophomore year I was at my healthiest (physically wise) and had the best grades. Yet it was definitely the worst year out of all them cause I was bored and lonely. \n\nWeirdly, what ended up working for me was going on dating apps. However, I did so with the hopes of meeting new people, not starting a relationship (I tried bumble BFF too but that didn\u2019t work out well). Towards the end of my sophomore year, I went on non mainstream apps, invited people to a movie I was interested in seeing, and became great friends with a pretty fun guy. I introduced him to a friend of mine and we ended up having some great times together junior year. \n\nSo I would recommend you try to make friends. Doesn\u2019t have to be this way, and you don\u2019t have to make a lot. Even just one new, high quality friend can change your life.", "author": "ludgatedwyer500", "created": 1632067340, "upvotes": 14}}}
