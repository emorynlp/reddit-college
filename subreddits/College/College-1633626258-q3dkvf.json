  "title:": "So alone - did I choose the right study?",
  "text": "Pondering on what study to choose, I went for one that has a bigger emphasis on natural sciences, despite being a bigger social-science whizz (like the rest of my family).\n\nI took this as more of a daring approach, since the subjects taught at the course I'm taking might require a bit more work on my part, but at the end of the study, I feel it's something I might enjoy doing as a job. When I decided on taking this course and in anticipation of starting college I was confident, perhaps even a bit enthusiastic, as to what new knowledge this course will bring me.\n\nIt's been some days now and I feel enormously lonely. It's clear that this is a whole lot different to high school, you don't make so many interpersonal connections between people, people there are by themselves or in groups, arrive at lectures, then go home.\n\nThat's the first bit. That's just the way it is with college around where I'm at, I guess, so you can't change that. Most people I know who've gone through college haven't made strong new friendships, most are from highschool or elsewhere, so hey.\n\nThe second bit I find more worrying though. Having chosen a different course of study than what I initially thought, a la social-sciences or information technology, the majority of people in my classes are way more enthusiastic about nature sciences than me. They are all those biology-whizzes, chemistry-enthusiasts etc., when I, when I was in highschool, dreaded those subjects. I don't study biology or chemistry per se, but the field I'm taking does brush up on those two things. \n\nSo I find myself feeling like such an outsider. Most science-whizzes I've met have been outwardly cold, or arrogant, or introverted somehow. Whereas the philosophy, sociology, etc. enthusiasts have had a keen grasp on social sense, and just an all-around joy to be with (most times).\n\nI still think I wanna finish this study as it's something I wanna do. But seeing the science whizzes speak up in class, makes me think I appear as if I don't know why I'm even there to other people compared to them.\n\nAnd going through it alone, if everyone will be cold, will be a freaking nightmare, I suspect. Spending 8 hours a day there, every day, with no one to talk to, will just be hell.\n\nI really hope there's a silver lining in this, meaning it's possible to enjoy myself ***with*** myself somehow, if I'm alone. But so far, the other students present have made me feel lonelier than the course itself.\n\nIs it not right for me? I even think sometimes if I'm not as enthusiastic as them I somehow won't pass. Like they're the ones the study was made for, and I'm there by mistake.\n\nIt's only been less than 2 weeks, but I still feel like on another planet there. And most subjects during lectures seem hard (mostly because we're doing everything so fast), but some of them are just participating/going through it like nothing. Even if the professor just gave a terrible explanation of it - these people have afore-accumulated knowledge from their high schools, presumably because they took more interest in such subjects before taking this study.\n\nLong story short, I just wanna bear through this challenging for-me-unusual study I took I want to graduate from, but am worried of the people there not being my type, making my study experience a dull nightmare.\n\nSide note, I'm not from the US, so sports and stuff like that don't play much of a role in college. I'm from Europe.\n\nAnd, of course, no offense to any science-whizzes out there! I'm just talking about my experience with the people I've met who were into that in my high school. Not all of you are the same! :)",
