  "text": "so my laptop has not been working all day, no matter what i tried. i spent 4 hours at my school's technology services getting it fixed, but i had a zoom class today that i didn't attend because of the laptop. i've already missed 2 classes this semester because i got sick, and i really don't want to fail. how do i tell my professor? i don't want to come off as someone who just makes excuses.",
