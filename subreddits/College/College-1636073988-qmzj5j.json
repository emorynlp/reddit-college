  "text": "Particularly if you like live in New England or like near the Canadian border.\n\nIn general it's roughly about the same as paying in state tuition at some schools if your parents are just well enough that you don't get any financial aid but poor enough that you have to go to an in state school but you're not going to be getting any grants.\n\nAnd on the bright side the drinking age in most of Canada is either 18 or 19. So you don't have to deal with any of the bullshit normally associated with jumping through hoops to be able to go out at night and have fun with your friends.\n\nAll you really need is to fill out some forms half a passport and get admitted to the University and statistically statistically speaking it's a lot less stressful to get to get into a Canadian University then an American one.\n\nThere is some competition but if you can get in it's cheaper and you can go out and party in addition to studying.",
