  "text": "So for context, I\u2019ve been in college for 3 years now and I\u2019ve only dropped one class. I also have financial aid through my dad being in the military. This semester has been kinda hard because almost all my classes are a bit complex and I also have to work. (Also I\u2019m back in person classes from almost two years of online) I\u2019m taking a total of 4 classes (one is a lab). However, I think I have to drop this science class because I\u2019ve failed 2 exams already and I\u2019m so behind. I didn\u2019t realize how hard it really is to manage these classes all at once. \n\nI know my situation isn\u2019t as bad as others on here but I just need some advice. How do you guys manage your classes while still working a part time job? Anyone got any tips? And should I feel bad about dropping my class?",

      "text": "Dropping one will put you below full time status (12 hrs) if you have 3-3 hours (9hrs)and 1-4 hours classes (total 13 hrs). Will that affect your student loans, health insurance, scholarship, parents' taxes, on campus housing? If so, it might be best to take the F! Many schools will allow you to replace a grade by taking the same class over at the same school. Call the financial aid office first about the military scholarship and financial implications of going less than full time.",
