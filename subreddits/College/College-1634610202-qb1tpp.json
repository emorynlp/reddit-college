  "title:": "Dad was taking loan refund checks",
  "text": "Wasn\u2019t sure where to post this but figured this is my best bet. So essentially, my father was in charge of my loans (which we agreed upon) and he told me that he was taking the refund checks for over balance towards tuition and was paying them to my loans, however; I just discovered this was not the case, and he was spending these refunds with no intention of paying them back. I am now 20k deeper in debt, as the refunds equaled to about 20k. What can I do, if anything, to ensure he pays those loans back. Everytime I have brought it up, he turned it on me saying he doesn\u2019t believe I\u2019ll pay my loans back, which seems to me this is his way of projecting he will not be paying them back. Any and all advice is much appreciated",
