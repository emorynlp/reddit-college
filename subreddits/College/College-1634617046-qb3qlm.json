  "text": "i genuinely don\u2019t know how this is possible, i can\u2019t focus at ALL most of the time so i usually only get things done when i\u2019m panicking at the last second. i\u2019m also always either too depressed or too anxious (or both\ud83d\ude01) to have any motivation. i waste so much time stressing and obsessing about meaningless things. working with groups is also difficult bc i get very anxious in social situations and have no confidence in my knowledge. i also work a part-time job that stresses and exhausts me a lot. i want to learn and i do like my major, but it seems impossible to keep going like this. how do you guys do it?",
