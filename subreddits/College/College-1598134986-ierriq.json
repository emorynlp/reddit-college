A transition to in-person in the middle of spring semester due to a vaccine becoming available is very unlikely (for my school at least in the CSU system) due to all the logistical hurdles that would have to be cleared. The decision to host classes in-person or online needs to occur several months before the semester begins.\n\nThere's a decent chance we'll have at least 1 effective vaccine during the first half of next year. \\*\\*IF\\*\\* we have successful vaccines that are widely distributed by next summer, then I see Fall 2021 as mostly normal. I expect mandatory vaccines for all college students in that case. The timing of the vaccine(s) being available will be interesting. If they're available by May or June, then Fall 2021 *should* be safe. If they're not available to the public until late summer or early fall, schools will have to make some tough decisions. Do they still commit to having fall 2021 classes all online despite a vaccine being widely available early in the semester? Is the fall 2021 semester delayed?  Schools can't wait until 2-3 weeks before the semester to make a decision. Every day life will NOT return to normal on the first day of a vaccine being available. It will take months to return to normal (albeit with conditions improving during that period of time).   \n\n\nThere's a lot that can go wrong and delay the vaccine process, however. If all the vaccines currently in trial 3 fail, then we will be living with online classes for much longer (probably through the 21/22 school year, at least). If no vaccine is ever successful, then herd immunity may begin to slow down the spread of the virus sometime in 2022. There's growing evidence that suggests immunity is long-lasting, which puts herd-immunity into play. Of course, having no vaccine in 2021 is a worst case scenario, and I don't think it's the most likely either.", "author": "Fish177", "created": 1598153691, "upvotes": 17}, "g2jsh7i": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ierriq/will_covid19_ever_end_the_college_experience/g2jsh7i/", "text": "Lol are you at gcsu?
