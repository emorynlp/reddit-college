  "text": "I get that COVID-19 is very unpredictable and very hard to make a guess at how long corona will be relevant, but let\u2019s be real, how long do you think it will last? I\u2019m in my freshman year of college, and it\u2019s completely miserable. I\u2019m allowed on campus but it is a very small liberal arts school. Some of the state schools have gone back and have little to no restrictions, where my school is sending kids home for having more than 2 people in a room and giving discipline action with the campus police. People are ratting others out for not wearing a mask and kids can\u2019t even be outside with eachother without being harassed. I get that safety is the number 1 priority and we want to stay here, but I feel like college kids, the question is how long can we make them follow these rules? College kids are not going to do this the whole year. No visitors allowed, it\u2019s a nightmare and has really ruined the orientation to my school for me. Many kids are online classes only. Some of my peers think this virus will \u201cdisappear\u201d after Election Day and others think everyone will have to go home from the virus. I just want the world to be normal again. It\u2019s a never ending nightmare that has really affected everyone in different ways.",

I made great friends and great people but I didn't meet people from clubs or anything, everyone I met was from social media because there were barely any opportunities to meet people on campus. it got incredibly lonely at times, with being alone in the dorms and it really hit me at times when it looked like everyone else was having the time of their lives making tons of friends and just living life as if Covid wasn't a thing. I didn't have an easy time in high school and wanted to get a fresh start at college and just put all of that behind me. I tried to make the most of things while on campus but it was really hard at times. thanks a lot COVID.",

States are placing state bans, not allowing people from certain states to come without proper quarantining.\nThere has been a massive rise in unemployment, and there has been a very loose effort to try and contain it all.\nI hate to say it, but even if a vaccine is made and even if it is distributed remotely properly, we are still going to have to wear mask. we are still going to have to social distance for a bit. We still are gonna have cases and we are still gonna have deaths. \nThis is our new normal.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve heard trials for certain vaccine candidates will conclude as early as the end of October of this year, and if those are successful, distribution can began almost immediately to those most at risk because companies have invested something like $8 billion into the manufacturing and distribution of this thanks to Project Lightspeed. I predict late January to early February for when the majority of the US population will have access to it. I believe they said 300 million doses by January for the US. Arguably more importantly, something no one is talking about is the new saliva tests, which will help immensely with this pandemic. The saliva tests are said to deliver faster and more accurate results than all previous ways of testing. Hopefully this means far less false negatives/positives and test results you can actually use, instead of waiting days or weeks for a result. \n\nAnyone who says 2022 or later has not been doing their research. Even Fauci said 2021 was likely. My prediction is Winter 2021.",

They\u2019re going to be rampant with Covid, and at this point it\u2019s killing healthy young adults with no premorbidities so it\u2019s still very dangerous to that age group. So, the students at those colleges are going to be spreading this disease around and making the whole situation worse. While it sucks (my school has relatively strict rules too) it\u2019s really important to follow the guidelines. And if it\u2019s no against the rules, just go to whatever version of a quad your school has and have a picnic with your friends or something. Make sure you\u2019re adequately distanced, but nobody can tell you that you can\u2019t. \n\nAnd honestly, if you\u2019re not wearing a mask you deserve to be ratted out, unless you\u2019re the only person around. (My school requires it even if you\u2019re the only person around, and even if you\u2019re just walking ten steps to your car) Not wearing a mask is putting others at risk and having no respect for the people around you. Wear the mask. \n\nAND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BE LIKE THOSE FREAKING PENN STATE FRESHIES THAT HAD A DAMN MOSH PIT PARTY IN THE QUAD.",

The pandemic will definitely end, but there's no way to predict when that time is. Vaccines will come out but not everyone will be able to get them immediately.

If I were a new college student, I would probably be most pissed about having to pay thousands for a dorm I wouldn't even need to be living in as I can have an Internet connection anywhere with a cellular tower to do online classes safe from others, including home. The colleges should just be charging only tuition & not renting the dorms out this year if they're doing only online classes.

Job applications will probably also go the same way. \n\nFor long term consequences for the average person, they\u2019ll probably be more emphasis on handwashing, especially for workers in service industries. Masks will probably not be government mandated post pandemic but they\u2019ll be more social pressure to wear them if you know you have something contagious, and a lot of people might wear them as a precautionary measure during flu season. \n\nImmunocompromised people also might continue to do some level of social distancing, of course not staying home all day but probably avoiding large crowds if possible.",

If I had known prior that my last two years of school would be online, I would have just done community College into online school / the cheapest 4 year school around. I developed no social circle or friends because of my disastrous mental health my first two years as well as having transferred during the middle of the year and took a gap year in between. I decided I was going to bank on doing well academically and getting involved in research work and give up on trying to make friends my last two years. Well now most of the research is inaccessible to me and although my grades are good online I learn absolutely nothing in this format. So academically and socially my college career has been a straight up failure and I regret everything. Everyone in my family has met their partners and best friends in college. The only things I met were a stage of bulimia, suicidal thoughts, people who shunned me, and disappointment from my parents. And I mean I'm complaining about this while other people have genuine tragedies happening because of this pandemic or other circumstances.

I\u2019m a Sophomore technically and just transferred to a university but I\u2019m totally online this semester. I really don\u2019t see a universe where this is going to be totally gone for Spring semester. In some low case areas if the schools report zero cases all semester they may open up some more, but absolutely would expect a number of schools to close. There\u2019s already been many and schools are starting up even more here these next 2-3 weeks. Everyone being selfish and wanting to party is making it worse on themselves by making this last longer. I haven\u2019t even been able to see my girlfriend in nearly 6 months because nor work because living at home with my family in which someone is high risk and can\u2019t risk it. Everytime I go to the store there\u2019s people without masks still. If Biden wins I believe he has stated there will be federal actions taken to enforce masks country wide that implement fines and that will help a lot in some areas if police chooses to enforce that. Unfortunately we live in a country that has to be forced into fixing the problem. I\u2019m guess next Fall there might be some more relaxed but steadily active campus life around the country again. Figures my year or two I could be somewhat slacking in school I\u2019ll likely be forced to be online and then senior year in 2022 when I have the massive capstone courses I\u2019ll be on campus.",

These past couple months have felt like an eternity and have taken a huge toll on my mental health, it feels like so long since I was happy or excited for my future. I never considered that it might be until late 2021 or later that I'll have the normal college experience I used to look forward to. My college is looking to be extremely strict (not saying that's a bad thing, it's not) and I feel like this upcoming year is gonna be really rough for me... I'm naturally introverted and I'm really afraid of being lonely in my dorm with nothing to do and no way of meeting people. I dunno, I'm not mad at my school or anything, just super upset with the way things are looking to be for a long time.",

I miss my friends and having a fucking social life, now I just spend all day working to numb the feeling of loneliness I feel for most of the day. I've always been a person that prioritized in person interactions, I hate texting and often I will just call someone to send a message. There are a lot of people I wished that I could have hugged one more time before this pandemic hit and a lot of things I wish I could have done too.",

Many of them already are.\n\nThe world is *not* going to be normal again for some time. The best we can hope for this academic year would be a cheap rapid test (saliva based) that would give results in 10-15 minutes; Yale has one in trials now that sounds promising and will cost $10/test. Once we have that we can move to 100% testing of students on a regular basis (3x/week is minimum per some models). That will allow us to drive the R below 1.0 and starve the virus out by isolating infected people before they spread it to others.  *Maybe* we'll have a vaccine by next fall but even if we do it's unlikely enough people will have access to or will agree to take it to make testing unnecessary.\n\nThe world is different now and it's not going back quickly. This would be a good year to gap, frankly, but for those who are already committed the best strategy is to keep safe personally and stay the hell away from people who won't. As we've seen over the past few weeks it only takes one frat party or house party to drive dozens of infections, which quickly turn into hundreds if people aren't being careful.",

They probably have on average higher population densities (at least some of them). And you're saying this isn't trump and his parties' fault that this virus is lasting so long? The amount of inaction and stupidity up there is astounding.

A transition to in-person in the middle of spring semester due to a vaccine becoming available is very unlikely (for my school at least in the CSU system) due to all the logistical hurdles that would have to be cleared. The decision to host classes in-person or online needs to occur several months before the semester begins.\n\nThere's a decent chance we'll have at least 1 effective vaccine during the first half of next year. \\*\\*IF\\*\\* we have successful vaccines that are widely distributed by next summer, then I see Fall 2021 as mostly normal. I expect mandatory vaccines for all college students in that case. The timing of the vaccine(s) being available will be interesting. If they're available by May or June, then Fall 2021 *should* be safe. If they're not available to the public until late summer or early fall, schools will have to make some tough decisions. Do they still commit to having fall 2021 classes all online despite a vaccine being widely available early in the semester? Is the fall 2021 semester delayed?  Schools can't wait until 2-3 weeks before the semester to make a decision. Every day life will NOT return to normal on the first day of a vaccine being available. It will take months to return to normal (albeit with conditions improving during that period of time).   \n\n\nThere's a lot that can go wrong and delay the vaccine process, however. If all the vaccines currently in trial 3 fail, then we will be living with online classes for much longer (probably through the 21/22 school year, at least). If no vaccine is ever successful, then herd immunity may begin to slow down the spread of the virus sometime in 2022. There's growing evidence that suggests immunity is long-lasting, which puts herd-immunity into play. Of course, having no vaccine in 2021 is a worst case scenario, and I don't think it's the most likely either.",

Yes, more people will still die after that, but once we have vaccines we literally can't do anything more. Lockdowns and mask mandates *must end* once a vaccine is in mass production and distribution.\n\nBut knowing how people's attitudes toward this thing are (i.e. tending to think having more than 0 deaths from Covid means failure while not considering that somehow we find 35,000-50,000 annual flu deaths to be perfectly acceptable) I doubt that's gonna happen. Even if everything goes right and a vaccine reaches the masses before Thanksgiving, lockdowns will slowly come up over the course of the following few months. They won't come up immediately even if everyone's vaccinated, even though that is the only course of action which makes any sense.",

The internal contingencies of the US govt would force him out, one way or the other. He doesn't have enough loyalists in the White House to help keep him there, and he's not an ex-Spetznaz or Mossad operative. He's an old man. He'd either get forcibly and quickly removed, or JFK'd at Mara Lago. That's how the US govt *really* works.",

Also, it isn\u2019t the physical covid virus that necessarily does the killing. Take a bullet for example, and say that someone is shot in the lungs and dies. Technically, that someone died because of a wounded/punctured lung, and not directly because of the bullet. Same idea applies for covid, in that the virus simply brings about certain conditions that cause the body to cease function.",

The rest of the stuff is fun (plus some things in addition to the 'fun' category), and a total disappointment to miss out on for a while, but it ultimately the primary purpose of the institution does not evaporate in their absence. And, besides, it'll all be there in the future.",

If we continue online school for another year... and I study abroad for a quarter next year as I should have been doing right now... then yes, I will kind of lose my college experience. There\u2019s a possibility of me getting only 4 quarters (1.3 years) of in-person at my school. So I\u2019m mourning. \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want debauchery, and I don\u2019t and never did party. Heck, I spent weekend nights playing board games with my friends until past midnight LMAO. I just want to spend time with my friends in person and not be at home. \n\nI\u2019m not contradicting your argument; I think that what you said is true in the majority of cases. People should just suck it up. But I feel really, really bad for transfer students like myself. We already weren\u2019t going to get 4 years. I feel especially bad for the rising juniors who just transferred to my school. Will they even get one year of in-person at a school that they want to go to? (Because we tend to transfer because we\u2019re not happy)",

Our peers need to realize that if they don't follow the rules, and the school has an outbreak, then they will be spending their year at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only way that in-person college will work this semester is if people report their peers for breaking the rules, and if colleges adopt draconian policies with regards to discipline. If somebody throws a party, they need to be sent home. If someone consistently refuses to wear a mask, they need to be sent home. That is the only way we can make this work. These people obviously have no respect for the rules, and are therefore high-risk for transmitting the virus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, reporting other students for breaking these rules isn't \"ratting them out\" or \"snitching.\" Those terms apply to actions which generally only hurt the person doing them. Nobody considers reporting a murderer snitching, because they're harming other people. It's the same with Covid rules: when any one student breaks these rules, they jeopardize the ability of every single other student to have in-person college. People very well should be reporting their peers given these stakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short: Wear your damn masks, don't go to parties, and call your RA when you see people breaking those rules, because those people are the ones who are going to cause you to have to spend your school year in your bedroom at home.",

When they rolled out that vaccine people rushed to get it due to a somewhat similar situation we are in now. 40,000 people were infected by the vaccine due to a mistake.

No vaccine in history has been developed in that timeframe. We still don\u2019t have a vaccine for HIV that was allegedly around the corner in the 90s.

The 1918 flu which arguably was worse didn\u2019t last for much more than a year and they never had a vaccine. \n\nI predict life will move on with or without.

We were, and still are in many places, dry tinder. But as time goes on, that's going to change. People are going to get exposed to it and will gain antibodies and T cells that will help their body resist it the next time. A vaccine, even if it's not perfect, will help a lot with that too. Eventually, we're going to get to a point where most people have some sort of resistance and the virus can't just indiscriminately rip through a population, like the flu now. Sure the flu infects a lot of people, but we can deal with it; it's not like society grinds to a halt every winter.",
