  "title:": "Confused with the grading system for a specific class",
  "text": "I would really appreciate your help because I often calculate my grades in advance just to see how well I\u2019m doing and for this particular class, the professor gave me a 2.0 (Our university operates on 5.0 grading system where 1.0 is an A and 5.0 is an F).\n\nI don\u2019t have trouble computing grades in other subjects because the individual tasks are graded on 100 scale but I don\u2019t know how I would compute with a 2.0.\n\nI already emailed my professor and she said that it\u2019s based on our university\u2019s standard system so I checked and a 2.0 is equivalent to 80-85% so how does that work?\n\nWe have 6 outputs with equal weight and I already missed one.",
