  "text": "I\u2019m a music major and I have had absolutely zero motivation to learn my music and I have to perform it in front of the staff in a few weeks. It doesn\u2019t help that my vocal teacher wants me to get it down in the span of a week while I\u2019m on vacation.  \n\nI tell her I don\u2019t think I can do it cuz they are hard Italian songs and she tells me not to be negative and that she\u2019s \u201cnot playing with me.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also terrorized by the upper classes. I\u2019m on my second year.\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to change my major because I\u2019m not really good at anything.\n\nI just want to curl up on my bed and sleep or cry instead of going to classes or doing work. Am I just lazy? What\u2019s wrong with me?",
