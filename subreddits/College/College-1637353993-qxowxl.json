  "text": "I\u2019m a music major and I have had absolutely zero motivation to learn my music and I have to perform it in front of the staff in a few weeks. It doesn\u2019t help that my vocal teacher wants me to get it down in the span of a week while I\u2019m on vacation.  \n\nI tell her I don\u2019t think I can do it cuz they are hard Italian songs and she tells me not to be negative and that she\u2019s \u201cnot playing with me.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m also terrorized by the upper classes. I\u2019m on my second year.\n\n\nI don\u2019t want to change my major because I\u2019m not really good at anything.\n\nI just want to curl up on my bed and sleep or cry instead of going to classes or doing work. Am I just lazy? What\u2019s wrong with me?",

I\u2019ve been a hard worker all my life but sometimes I gotta skip class and lay down in bed all day to refresh, and that\u2019s fine you should always make your mental health a priority. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure what you mean by terrorizing, but if it\u2019s serious you should report it to your teacher, advisor, dean, anyone who will listen because no one should have to deal with that",

      "text": "I'm a music major kinda in the same position. I am a pianist and haven't learned my music until last week with juries coming up. Are your juries pass/fail? \n\nThe best advice I can give you is to listen to some of your favorite singers or pieces. Honestly don't even practice your pieces tomorrow, just sing something that made you fall in love with singing or listen to a piece/vocalist that truly inspires you. Anything to remind you of your love of music and get you back to the practice room. \n\nI suggest taking the next few weeks to write down a plan on what pieces you'll do each week. Practice a little bit of each piece everyday. Do a few measures at a time, record yourself, listen and compare it to recordings. Try to be as efficient as you can and you will see results! You can do this you just have to push through. No matter the result, you'll back on these next few weeks knowing you worked hard and that is something to be proud of. \n\nIt's also about your mindset too. Remember you can only do your best, nothing more or less. Don't stress about upperclassmen or your teacher because you are on your own path, not theirs. It's about you and your progress. You made it there because the staff saw your audition and saw your potential. Nothing is wrong with you at all. You can do this.",
