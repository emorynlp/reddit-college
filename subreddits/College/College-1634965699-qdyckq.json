  "title:": "Sad about having to transfer to different University (Anybody went through similar situation?)",
  "text": "I initally started in CC and transferred to a public university's B.A visual arts program in hopes of eventually getting into their BFA program that has a specific focus on graphic/visual design.\n\nAfter a long battle of submitting my portfolio on mutiple occasions and finally getting a response I was told there wasn't any room. \n\nOf course there's the option of just finishing  with the visual arts major but it would be a waste of time because the curriculum is more art history based.\n\nSo I'm applying to other universities but it just sucks because I had a whole plan that I have to rearrange (makes me feel alittle lost). The campus and location was starting to grow on me too. \n\nI did learn a lesson on not putting all my eggs in one basket. I'm also aware that where I went to school won't matter in the long-run of my career. It just sucks when something you had planned doesn't work out.\n\nAn upside is the universities I'm looking into are more open to granting transfer scholarships-so yay to less debt! Lol",
