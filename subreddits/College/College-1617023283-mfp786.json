I feel like an idiot and like a dumb failure, I'm losing motivation for EVERYTHING, even my favourite subjects  , i feel like there is no way i can do this. And its not just that i have to pass the exams, i have to get GOOD grades in them in order to get into grad school, it's how uni's in my country work. I feel like giving up and I'm desperate.\n\nEDIT (IMPORTANT): First of all thank you all for the kind advice, it really means a lot. Second of all, i need to clarify something because a lot of you seem to think i only have 8 exams over 2 semesters. No, we have 6 subjects in EACH semester which means 12 exams over 2 semesters BUT in my uni you can pass some subjects by taking smaller exams all throughout the year so in the end you don't have to take the exam but your grade is formed through those smaller exams. This depends on the subject and the professor.", "author": "Generous-Pirate", "created": 1617023283, "retrieved": 1632802761, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 605, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gsrew9n": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mfp786/i_have_8_exams_at_best_for_the_summer_and_fall/gsrew9n/", "text": "r/domyhomeworkforme101", "author": "Jugz123", "created": 1617072796, "upvotes": 1}, "gsqr3vj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/mfp786/i_have_8_exams_at_best_for_the_summer_and_fall/gsqr3vj/", "text": "Don't spend your entire studying time pouring over a textbook alone in the dark.

I have been in your situation (and even in more dire ones) and came out ok. I have seen many other students in similar scenarios and they ended up passing their exams and getting decent and sometimes even great grades, and not all of of them were geniuses. What I am basically telling you here is that it's doable, many people have been there, they've succeeded and so can you.\n\nMy answer would basically  be planning things out as much as you can. I would suggest printing calendars of the months to come, pin them to a wall and write the deadlines (exams, workgroups/ research paper dues,...) So you can have a better overview of the situation, see when it's very busy and when you have a bit more time. Take each subject for which you have an exam, and write a table of contents with all the chapters and different elements to know, so that you have a clear list of what you need to study. Identify the chapters/subjects that are the most challenging for you, and try to allocate them more study time. If you have some holidays/free time before those exams, write a detailed study plan for those free days.\n\nAbove all, remember that you can do this, that you are capable of it. If you are very prone to stress/ are a perfectionist, maybe try focusing less on getting a certain grade, and more on doing stuff as best as you can, step by step. Remember to save some free time for self-care, and reward yourself!\nYou got this!

I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this tough time. A bunch of us can relate to this situation of feeling burnt out. I\u2019ve been in school for a long time (it feels like).. community college and just transferred into a 4-year for engineering\u2014the amount and difficulty of the course material has felt like it\u2019s quadrupled. Although, I\u2019ve not yet mastered the best daily routine for college, I\u2019ve been experimenting and found that the following has worked fairly well.. I\u2019m sure with some creativity and personalization it could be catered to a person\u2019s specific needs.. \n\nNote: I\u2019ve also been reading and listening to audiobooks about productivity because I find it so important in living a balanced life. (Ref. The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey) \n\nBasics:\n1. Organize\n2. Prioritize\n3. Execute\n\n1. Organize: organize everything you need to do. I like to do this on a short term basis, (daily tasks & weekly tasks\u2014 because you could have say a winter storm that shuts down your entire state and changes your weekly schedule for the remainder of the semester.) \n\nIn a word document, I like to document course work that NEEDS to be done and is conducive to my education (for example, I\u2019ve found reading the textbook (in most classes) is not beneficial FOR ME.. therefore I don\u2019t do it.) \n\n2. Prioritize: using the syllabus and general idea of the course (this intuition will come after your first few assignments and first exam\u2014you should be able to gauge the layout of the course and what is required of you to pass, your strengths and weakness on the subject and the grade-to-effort ratio relative to your other courses). \n\nGoal: prioritize tasks according to:\nA. weight a specific assignment has on your overall grade in that course. If it is a high percentage of your overall grade: it is a HIGH PRIORITY. If it has little to no consequent on your grade/understanding: it is a LOW PRIORITY task. You can create intermediate levels as you see fit. \nB. Will this task help me understand the course material better? PRIORITY. PRIORITY. PRIORITY.\nC. Due Dates\u2014goes without saying. \n\n3. Execute: now that you\u2019ve outlined what you need to accomplish, which tasks require your attention most, you can start working from high level to low priority tasks. \n\nGoal: Accomplish all tasks. BUT, if you aren\u2019t able to complete all the tasks on your list.. at least you\u2019ve put your most important tasks at the top and in turn maximize your grade-to-effort ratio. \n\nTo work more efficiently, you can create a productivity chart and document as you work to see how your energy levels are throughout the day. This will also give you a general idea of how long certain tasks take you to complete\u2014 in turn allowing you to plan more accurate study blocks for assignments and prioritize your high priority tasks for a time in the day that YOUR energy levels are high. For me, my prime time is from 9pm to 1am. Just know this is unique to you. \n\nFinally..\n\nDO NOT PULL ALL-NIGHTERS.. once or twice cool, do not make this a habit. You will fail. Think about it. If you just get some sleep you can wake up early and learn more in a span of a few hours than you would trying to cram or catch up all night with a fatigued, improperly firing brain. All-nighters make you feel like you\u2019ve used your time efficiently.. but in reality you will be more behind than you were because your fatigued brain did not internalize that information you tried to absorb all night. \n\nTD;DR\n\n1. Organize your assignments.\n2.Prioritize based on consequence of grade & understanding\n3. Execute with less anxiety and feel more grounded\n\nUse productivity/energy levels tracker to discover how YOUR energy levels progress throughout the day and use this information to tackle high priority and demanding assignments. Leave all point/click and copy/paste assignments for your low level periods throughout the day. \n\nTake breaks, reward yourself, do not pull all-nighters and tell yourself every night before you go to sleep \u201cI am worthy of the life I wish to lead. I am intelligent, good hearted and strong enough to tackle tomorrow with just as much dedication I have today. The skills Ive learned today will be internalized and tomorrow I will continue to build this foundation because I love myself enough to know that I am worthy of success\u201d. \n\nLove yourself.

For the assignment I was helped with a very kind friend, so I didn't have to spend a lot of time there. The exam was okay too -- was a sheer luck actually, because the prof provide similar study case to prev exam, so I sort of got the pattern easily during the exam itself. There was one exam with 2 professors and a lot of memorising that I only got 2 days to prepare. I cried the whole night before that. Other exams were sort of okay.

I know it feels like an almost impossible task, we\u2019ve all been there. My freshman year I ended up failing some exams, I was premed and felt crushed. My friends all seemed to be doing well but I was struggling. Sit down, take a breath and figure out what changes you need to make to improve. Find out if there\u2019s any study resources like a study mentor, tutoring, or online resources. \n\nLike others have said, make a study plan and make sure it\u2019s the type of studying that will help you. If you\u2019re a visual learner, maybe a handwritten study guide will be best for you. If you\u2019re better at learning from listening, watch videos. The best method of studying for you might vary for a class and you\u2019ll figure that out as you go along in your study process. \n\nTake breaks, don\u2019t run yourself into the ground. Get up every hour or so, take a short walk. And give yourself a real break. Not a \u201coh shit I\u2019m an idiot I should be studying\u201d while you take a break. But a genuine break where you leave your work on the back burner and enjoy your time. I found that I struggled to balance free time, exercise, and studying as a freshman so I often would spin slowly on a bike or walk on the treadmill while watching lectures or going through flash cards. \n\nI recommend sitting down, putting your exams into a calendar and then making a study schedule outline. Give yourself time limits so you don\u2019t end up spending 14+ hours studying. You\u2019ll burn out doing that. Also avoid all nighters, eat your meals (junk food is better than none food), drink water. Take care of your body, it\u2019ll work better for you if you do. \n\nI know it seems too hard right now OP, but whatever happens you will be ok.

It shows you really care about doing better and they will appreciate that/ maybe not go as hard on your because they know you\u2019re trying 2.) try to learn the format of the tests and what the teachers are looking for.
