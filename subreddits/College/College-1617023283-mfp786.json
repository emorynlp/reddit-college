  "title:": "I have 8 exams (at BEST) for the summer and fall exam period combined. How do i not throw myself out the window?",
  "text": "I'm a biology major freshman and i only passed 2 exams so far. And because of that i will now have 8 exams for the fall and summer exam period (if i do not screw up my second semester even more than i already did). I feel like an idiot and like a dumb failure, I'm losing motivation for EVERYTHING, even my favourite subjects  , i feel like there is no way i can do this. And its not just that i have to pass the exams, i have to get GOOD grades in them in order to get into grad school, it's how uni's in my country work. I feel like giving up and I'm desperate.\n\nEDIT (IMPORTANT): First of all thank you all for the kind advice, it really means a lot. Second of all, i need to clarify something because a lot of you seem to think i only have 8 exams over 2 semesters. No, we have 6 subjects in EACH semester which means 12 exams over 2 semesters BUT in my uni you can pass some subjects by taking smaller exams all throughout the year so in the end you don't have to take the exam but your grade is formed through those smaller exams. This depends on the subject and the professor.",

Instead try to find a study group, join your school's biology club (and clubs for every other subject you're taking or are interested in), and switch it up by playing study games and such.\n\nThere's only so much studying you can do. Everyone has a different style. Personally I remember information the best when I've talked about it with other people or done related hands-on activities. So try to shake it up every once in a while and do something new.",

      "text": "As a fellow European student, here's what I would say\n\nFirst of all, just know that you're really not alone in this. I have been in your situation (and even in more dire ones) and came out ok. I have seen many other students in similar scenarios and they ended up passing their exams and getting decent and sometimes even great grades, and not all of of them were geniuses. What I am basically telling you here is that it's doable, many people have been there, they've succeeded and so can you.\n\nMy answer would basically  be planning things out as much as you can. I would suggest printing calendars of the months to come, pin them to a wall and write the deadlines (exams, workgroups/ research paper dues,...) So you can have a better overview of the situation, see when it's very busy and when you have a bit more time. Take each subject for which you have an exam, and write a table of contents with all the chapters and different elements to know, so that you have a clear list of what you need to study. Identify the chapters/subjects that are the most challenging for you, and try to allocate them more study time. If you have some holidays/free time before those exams, write a detailed study plan for those free days.\n\nAbove all, remember that you can do this, that you are capable of it. If you are very prone to stress/ are a perfectionist, maybe try focusing less on getting a certain grade, and more on doing stuff as best as you can, step by step. Remember to save some free time for self-care, and reward yourself!\nYou got this! Best of luck!",

      "text": "Adding some tips for staying motivated below. Rooting for you and good luck with the exams!\n\n*Figure out which study environment is most comfortable or productive for you. Some examples of qs you can ask yourself:*\n\n* Do you study better during the day or at night? Do you like to listen to music while studying? Or do you need complete silence? Are you able to study if your room is messy, or do you always feel like you need to clean up a bit before you can focus? What do you enjoy doing the most? Are there specific classes that make you feel anxious? How do you feel after you have achieved a goal?\n\n*Make to-do-lists. Prioritize your tasks according to their urgency level.*\n\n* Tackling your most daunting work first might be motivating for you because you will know once you are done your remaining tasks are easy or enjoyable. Alternatively, getting your easier work done first and conserving time and energy for your most difficult tasks might be a better approach for you.\n\n*Join study groups*\n\n* Studying with friends can help you to maintain a healthy work environment and enable you to keep each other motivated. Tutoring each other and solve problems together to increase your comprehension of the subjects.\n\nExercise regularly, get a night of healthy sleep, and try meditating\n\n* These activities are very helpful for boosting intrinsic motivation. Even if you do not have enough time to meditate or exercise regularly, sleeping at least 7 to 8 hours a day and taking small walks will help you clear your mind and stay motivated.",

      "text": "Hi, OP. I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this tough time. A bunch of us can relate to this situation of feeling burnt out. I\u2019ve been in school for a long time (it feels like).. community college and just transferred into a 4-year for engineering\u2014the amount and difficulty of the course material has felt like it\u2019s quadrupled. Although, I\u2019ve not yet mastered the best daily routine for college, I\u2019ve been experimenting and found that the following has worked fairly well.. I\u2019m sure with some creativity and personalization it could be catered to a person\u2019s specific needs.. \n\nNote: I\u2019ve also been reading and listening to audiobooks about productivity because I find it so important in living a balanced life. (Ref. The Productivity Project by Chris Bailey) \n\nBasics:\n1. Organize\n2. Prioritize\n3. Execute\n\n1. Organize: organize everything you need to do. I like to do this on a short term basis, (daily tasks & weekly tasks\u2014 because you could have say a winter storm that shuts down your entire state and changes your weekly schedule for the remainder of the semester.) \n\nIn a word document, I like to document course work that NEEDS to be done and is conducive to my education (for example, I\u2019ve found reading the textbook (in most classes) is not beneficial FOR ME.. therefore I don\u2019t do it.) \n\n2. Prioritize: using the syllabus and general idea of the course (this intuition will come after your first few assignments and first exam\u2014you should be able to gauge the layout of the course and what is required of you to pass, your strengths and weakness on the subject and the grade-to-effort ratio relative to your other courses). \n\nGoal: prioritize tasks according to:\nA. weight a specific assignment has on your overall grade in that course. If it is a high percentage of your overall grade: it is a HIGH PRIORITY. If it has little to no consequent on your grade/understanding: it is a LOW PRIORITY task. You can create intermediate levels as you see fit. \nB. Will this task help me understand the course material better? PRIORITY. PRIORITY. PRIORITY.\nC. Due Dates\u2014goes without saying. \n\n3. Execute: now that you\u2019ve outlined what you need to accomplish, which tasks require your attention most, you can start working from high level to low priority tasks. \n\nGoal: Accomplish all tasks. BUT, if you aren\u2019t able to complete all the tasks on your list.. at least you\u2019ve put your most important tasks at the top and in turn maximize your grade-to-effort ratio. \n\nTo work more efficiently, you can create a productivity chart and document as you work to see how your energy levels are throughout the day. This will also give you a general idea of how long certain tasks take you to complete\u2014 in turn allowing you to plan more accurate study blocks for assignments and prioritize your high priority tasks for a time in the day that YOUR energy levels are high. For me, my prime time is from 9pm to 1am. Just know this is unique to you. \n\nFinally..\n\nDO NOT PULL ALL-NIGHTERS.. once or twice cool, do not make this a habit. You will fail. Think about it. If you just get some sleep you can wake up early and learn more in a span of a few hours than you would trying to cram or catch up all night with a fatigued, improperly firing brain. All-nighters make you feel like you\u2019ve used your time efficiently.. but in reality you will be more behind than you were because your fatigued brain did not internalize that information you tried to absorb all night. \n\nTD;DR\n\n1. Organize your assignments.\n2.Prioritize based on consequence of grade & understanding\n3. Execute with less anxiety and feel more grounded\n\nUse productivity/energy levels tracker to discover how YOUR energy levels progress throughout the day and use this information to tackle high priority and demanding assignments. Leave all point/click and copy/paste assignments for your low level periods throughout the day. \n\nTake breaks, reward yourself, do not pull all-nighters and tell yourself every night before you go to sleep \u201cI am worthy of the life I wish to lead. I am intelligent, good hearted and strong enough to tackle tomorrow with just as much dedication I have today. The skills Ive learned today will be internalized and tomorrow I will continue to build this foundation because I love myself enough to know that I am worthy of success\u201d. \n\nLove yourself. You are worth it.",

I had to retake 7 exams in summer, in only a span of 2 weeks plus one big coding assignment. For the assignment I was helped with a very kind friend, so I didn't have to spend a lot of time there. The exam was okay too -- was a sheer luck actually, because the prof provide similar study case to prev exam, so I sort of got the pattern easily during the exam itself. There was one exam with 2 professors and a lot of memorising that I only got 2 days to prepare. I cried the whole night before that. Other exams were sort of okay. In the end I passed 6 out of 7 retakes. \n\nI am now still struggling with my studies, that's because of a mental health issues. But I'm glad I passed my first year. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a student advisor or a psychologist might help. I did that every month. Asking help from friends is also essential. I was helped a lot with my friends' notes and past reports.",

I studied 11 subjects during the lockdown, where we studied each subject for only 1 or 2 weeks depending on their difficulty. Then from December end to March 1st week, we continuously had offline semester exams for those subjects. It went as follows. \n\nOne week was taken for practical examinations for the first 4 subjects. The next week we wrote offline exams in college for the 4 subjects. No study holidays in between. Then the next week the same happened for the next 4 subjects. We never had the time to study, and the papers were tough (my teachers were merciless bastards) and for practicals we were given 10 - 20 programs in different programming languages which were ancient(one of them was used to code apollo 8) and zero training and help. But we went through all this bullshit by studying limited portions, like if 10 chapters were given, we would study the easy 5 or 6 chapters, and I got good grades.\n\nI don't know how different biology courses conduct exams, probably dumping more burden on you by talking about my depression, but I think it will help  to know that there are people who have faced worse situations and succeeded.

      "text": " Sacrificing sleep in order to super boost study progress IS A NO GO. IF you do that, you will overwork yourself and burn out much more and in the end your brain won't have enough energy to absorb study material.\n\nGetting sufficient sleep is very underrated in certain times which idk why but bro/sis, trust me,  you need the sleep to avoid your brain being rigid to study whatever you need to. Speaking from experience last semester, I didn't do that and I ended up being exhausted 24/7 and lost interest in everything and ended up in depression unconsciously.\n\nIf there is too much study stuff...break it up and split it into days or weeks or hours and KEEP your STUDY goals for a day REALISTIC AND MANAGEABLE.\n\nPlan things out in order of their importance and urgency.Also accept the fact that there may or may not be certainties either ways and STOP worrying about what will happen in the future because by doing so, you get way too much anxiety. And thinking too much about the future or stressing over it doesn't help.Executing your plan helps more even if it is small steps.\n\nProgress in small steps is much better and builds up to a larger progress after a certain time rather than no progress at all.\n\nCreate a plan, execute the plan a step at a time and get enough sleep and nutrition. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am speaking this from my own experience a few months ago when I sacrificed sleep and overworked myself sooo much that I lost control of myself and ended up exhausted 24/7 and unconsciously fell into depression where I too lost interest fro the subjects I really loved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary,\n\n1. Create a plan and execute it.\n2. Do your due diligience because that way your conscience will be cleared that you tried your best.\n3. Create a study plan according to urgency and importance and keep it realistic.\n4. GET ENOUGH REST.\n5. Accept the fact that there will be a small bit of uncertainties either ways.Embrace it.\n6. Try your best and relax and STOP WORRYING. If one grad school won't take you, another might or you might get an opportunity that was better for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my pieces of pointers and advice.",

      "text": "Hey it\u2019s gonna be ok. I know it feels like an almost impossible task, we\u2019ve all been there. My freshman year I ended up failing some exams, I was premed and felt crushed. My friends all seemed to be doing well but I was struggling. Sit down, take a breath and figure out what changes you need to make to improve. Find out if there\u2019s any study resources like a study mentor, tutoring, or online resources. \n\nLike others have said, make a study plan and make sure it\u2019s the type of studying that will help you. If you\u2019re a visual learner, maybe a handwritten study guide will be best for you. If you\u2019re better at learning from listening, watch videos. The best method of studying for you might vary for a class and you\u2019ll figure that out as you go along in your study process. \n\nTake breaks, don\u2019t run yourself into the ground. Get up every hour or so, take a short walk. And give yourself a real break. Not a \u201coh shit I\u2019m an idiot I should be studying\u201d while you take a break. But a genuine break where you leave your work on the back burner and enjoy your time. I found that I struggled to balance free time, exercise, and studying as a freshman so I often would spin slowly on a bike or walk on the treadmill while watching lectures or going through flash cards. \n\nI recommend sitting down, putting your exams into a calendar and then making a study schedule outline. Give yourself time limits so you don\u2019t end up spending 14+ hours studying. You\u2019ll burn out doing that. Also avoid all nighters, eat your meals (junk food is better than none food), drink water. Take care of your body, it\u2019ll work better for you if you do. \n\nI know it seems too hard right now OP, but whatever happens you will be ok. And I won\u2019t promise you 100% everything will happen exactly the way you want it but that\u2019s ok. If you keep trying, you\u2019ll find the best path for yourself. I got the lowest scores out of hundreds of other students on my midterms (and I mean the lowest as in a 12% as my grade) and after changing my approach, I managed to graduate with honors. You can do it. You\u2019re not stupid, you\u2019re not a dumb failure. You\u2019re in a transition period of your life, so be kind to yourself and best of luck on your academic journey!",

Like, calculate how much you have to study, how much time you have, how much time you'll study each day, how many chapter you have to complete each day, etc. Then stick to that plan. You need to change up your environment a little if you've been stuck in one place for too long, cause your mind likes a change of scenery. If you're scared, maybe study with a friend, or study in the presence of someone, or shock your system with an ice cube, or make a reward system like a cookie or a YT video after every chapter. Having a hobby that's rewarding to you helps balance the stress out. You and your mind are the only things that can make this happen. You can do this. Go make yourself proud",

I was ALWAYS studying to get average grades on my tests. It\u2019s really hard and a huge mental game with yourself to see how much you can push yourself. I will have to say I changed my plans of what I wanted to do after undergrad because my grades weren\u2019t THE BEST. I would say the best ideas are 1.) talk to your professor! It shows you really care about doing better and they will appreciate that/ maybe not go as hard on your because they know you\u2019re trying 2.) try to learn the format of the tests and what the teachers are looking for. A lot of teachers have test formats that are the same for the whole semester. Knowing that will be super helpful in studying as well as if the prof is looking for specific keywords, vocab, etc. you can do this by going over your test with the prof or another classmate to see why your answers were wrong 3.) try to get a tutor. It may feel like you really know the material but nothing helps more than actually talking it out with someone who knows a lot about the concepts, especially when it\u2019s 1 on 1. 4.) make sure to take breaks during studying and to break information down however works best for you, instead of trying to learn it all at once. Hope this helps but please don\u2019t be hesitant to ask me more questions!!",

While this doesn't really happen anymore, when my parents went to college, they had final exams at the end of the year worth 100% of the grade based on the 12 classes taken throughout the year. The real catch is that 6 of these classes ended by Christmas. So they literally had to keep studying those 6 classes during the second semester in order to do well in the finals. That's absolutely ridiculous. Nowadays, however, there are just exams at the end of the first semester.",

Even on weekends. Exercise, eat a lot. Study yourself as if you're a subject. Observe yourself. Focus on being healthy.\nDon't drink alcohol or eat junk food. Don't get distracted, don't escape your reality.\n\nOnce you get most of your shit together, you can get the rest of your shit together.\n\nI've been living the life I described, after being a failure of a student for all my college life. And to be fair, you won't be able to pull it off immediately, I barely passed my courses and could never study properly.\nSo feel free to ignore my advice completely because it might not be a good one for you.",

Every day if you can, but don't beat yourself up over it.\n\nMake a schedule and stick to it. If you've got a video game you can play for 10 min as a reward for getting showered and dressed in time, it can be a great reward.\n\nHonestly, just rewarding yourself for doing things. Like the point above. You had a particularly stressful week? Take some time for yourself and go eat out with some friends.\n\nI heard someone say yesterday that one thing they did was plan a (can be very small) fun thing to do every day. That way you have something to look forward to besides 14+ hours of assignments.\n\nYou can't run faster than you have strength, so try not to push yourself harder than you can go. I tried to do that this semester and I'm still in a funk from it. Ended up dropping a class and that made things better, but I'm so over everything right now.\n\nPlease take care of yourself, OP. It sounds real tough and I totally get it.",
