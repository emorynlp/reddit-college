I was waitlisted but then received the permission number to join my class which is online and I have been doing the classwork/exams since the start of the semester. I missed deadline enrollment by 2 weeks. I was only able to access the class page(canvas) because my professor manually added me, so I\u2019ve been doing the work and totally forgot to enroll with permission number and pay for class. I\u2019m 2 weeks pass enrollment date and already spent the money on the books. Should I just take the L? Any advice?", "author": "Narrow-Advantage-734", "created": 1632280439, "retrieved": 1632800917, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdt62m2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psyq4m/lateadd_petition_way_past_enrollment_deadline/hdt62m2/", "text": "Talk to professor.
