  "text": "I am a biology major with a concentration (which entails more requirements than a minor at my college) in biochemistry. It is a good liberal arts college and I really enjoyed learning about Buddhism when I had to take my single requirement in a religious studies course. A minor in religious studies requires 6 courses in total from at least 2 different religions and only 2 need to be a 200+ level course. \n\nI would like to pursue the minor for interest and desire to learn, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be either doing too much or a minor in religious studies would not provide any benefit for what I want to do in my career. Lots of people are telling me to just take a couple religion courses for fun and I don\u2019t need the minor. However, I feel this is a good opportunity in my life to learn about things I\u2019m interested in \n\nDo you think there is any value to me taking the extra couple courses to get the minor ?",
