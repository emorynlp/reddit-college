  "text": "Had my first huge algebra test today, 40% of my grade. Math does not come easy to me so I\u2019m not kidding when I tell you I\u2019ve studied for close to 60 hours this week. When I should\u2019ve clicked the link to the test, I accidentally clicked submit and got knocked out of proctorio. I didn\u2019t even get to start the test, Messaged them and they said only the professor can give me a second attempt, do you think she\u2019ll be cool enough to give me another attempt? If not there\u2019s absolutely no way I will pass the class.",

Although if its possible for her to see that you submitted without putting anything than I\u2019d say you have a good case. As long as you were fast in contacting her should be good enough. But I can\u2019t say. Just talk to her",
