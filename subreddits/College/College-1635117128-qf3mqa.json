  "text": "Guys I've been doing pretty okay in my OChem lab up until today (it was the only thing keeping my lecture grade somewhat afloat). Pretty sure I'm at a D right now and at this point all I'm looking to do is pass, it's not too late for me, right? Or do I need to wake up and smell the roses? \n\nAnyone have any of their own comeback stories to share? OChem is literally killing me slowly but I've come too far to let myself die.",

      "text": "it depends on how your grades are weighed, so you\u2019ll need to do some math. if you have a final worth half your grade, for example, you can definitely bounce back if you start prepping for your final NOW. learn every concept from the beginning of the semester, do practice problems until you understand the concept, and binge organic chem tutor videos if you need clarification. however, if you\u2019ve received most of your final grade\u2019s weight already, then it may be difficult to raise your grade to whatever is considering passing, if D isn\u2019t",

      "text": "In my experience it does kick you ass until the end when somehow you pull it off. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s going to come easily but OChem is a hard class and my finals were weighted. An A was an 83, I think. Do practice problems, speak with the professor or TA, go to tutoring. I wouldn\u2019t give up if I were you, you still have a chance to pull it around. \n\nIf you don\u2019t, it\u2019s not that uncommon to retake it. OChem is HARD for everyone.",
