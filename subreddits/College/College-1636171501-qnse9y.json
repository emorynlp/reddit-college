  "text": "I graduated high school in June of this year (June 2021) and for this past fall semester have been attending community college. My community college has made financial aid basically impossible, from telling me I was not eligible due to a system error to telling me I wasn't eligible because of a mandatory class I had to take as a freshman in high school to then telling me I was eligible for just enough to cover class enrollment fees to just recently (today) emailing me that I'm no longer eligible and will in fact have to pay for my fall semester. \n\nFor context, I was accepted into every university I applied to and only settled on community because my family couldn't afford to help me despite making so much I couldn't get enough financial aid and my hesitance to take such large loans. In hindsight I constantly wish I had just taken the loans and accepted a university offer and was considering dropping my community classes just to reapply in a university. If I'm going to have to take a loan out anyway, which it appears I am, I think I'd like to go to a university after all. \n\nI know this probably seems like a stupid question\u2014 due to Covid and my current school's horrible counseling office I haven't been able to sit down or call and get any real answers\u2014 but can I drop community college classes and apply in the next application period for universities? Will that still be an undergrad application and do I need to mention my short, single semester at a community college at all?",
