  "text": "hey y\u2019all. came here for unbiased opinions. i\u2019m a sophomore in my business school. recently i\u2019ve had no motivation to go to my classes. Former student athlete, recently joined a frat. currently i\u2019m enrolled in 4 classes. 2 of them i go to 95% of the time, basically every single time. the other two are lecture based and i have a strong disliking for these professors. my grades are still pretty much what they\u2019ve been for the past year and a half. Inside i feel like it\u2019s wrong that i\u2019m missing classes just to sit on my ass but on the other side, i have zero motivation to try when i will get the same grades i do now. Is this wrong? probably but i need some of y\u2019all to help get me back on track ;)",

      "text": "First off I would make sure these classes don\u2019t give points for attendance, at the end of the semester that point tally could lower your grade. But also on the other hand this is a good way to get into a slump. You may become too comfortable skipping class and it will be a hard habit to break. The next semester may come and you won\u2019t feel like going to those classes either. In my opinion it\u2019s good to have discipline because if you start to slack off going to class, you may slack off doing the work or missing important class info, and eventually it will hurt your grades and GPA.",

If you\u2019re not worried about getting rec letters from these profs and you can keep the grades I say it\u2019s fine to skip. For me it was a time management thing, it was more efficient for me to do class on my own time. Just make sure you go if you start to struggle.",

Pretty sure that's a net negative.",
