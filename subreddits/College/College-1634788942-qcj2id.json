I did make 20k, but that's still under the pell grant requirements isn't it? I'm single and no kids. I'm confused...",

      "text": "Your expected family contribution is based on a number of factors but things such as your parents income and your own income generally go towards it. (though it is primarily based on your parents tbh) It is the \"max amount\" that you/your parents would be able to supply to your education. Essentially, they assume that your parents could pay for a good chunk of your  education (up to $6,111) and so that's why you didn't get it. The higher your efc, generally at least, the less likely you are to get a pell grant unless you have a special circumstance or something.",
