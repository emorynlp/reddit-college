  "text": "Hello everyone! I hope all of you are having a great day so far.\n\nI'm a 29 year old who decided to finally pursue a degree. I've been working as a software developer for some time now and thought it would be a good idea to get a new degree in the same field.\n\nI've been attending this college for about 12 weeks now and overall I am doing great. I get along with everyone in my class. So far I'm a straight A student and I'm willing to work/learn hard to get my degree as fast as possible.\n\nThe problem is that I'm currently starting to doubt the quality of the institution as a whole in which I am participating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problems I have currently observed are the following:\n\n1: The pace at which everything is taught is extremely slow.\n\n2: Teachers are not grading or even checking students homework/assignments. Around 95% of all assignments have not been graded. Including those dating months back. Teachers also have said that they will not review any code of any student not even partially. They just want to check the output.\n\n3: A large portion of the students don't seem very interested in learning and as a result mostly play video games in class.\n\n4: There is supposed to be a fast track program, the people were supposed to be selected on week 10. Although some of the more serious students asked about admission into this program the response of the school currently is that they have no idea how they are going to implement this and therefor nobody is selected yet and there is no definite time table set as to which this program will start. It is currently week 12.\n\n5: Teachers make very basic mistakes such as putting all assignment folders in the htdocs folder of xampp. This includes subject files from subjects such as math, C#, Python etc.\n\n6: There seems to be no coherent structure or plan regarding which language or concepts students should learn first. This is not so bad for me because I have some experience but for students who just started out this seems to be extremely frustrating and confusing. There is no coherent plan between teaching methods/assignments made by the teachers. For example on Wednesday the programming language/concepts which are covered will be discarded by the teacher on Thursday who will then give a new assignment in another language without finishing the concepts covered previously, only to be discarded and changed halfway through again by the teacher on Friday. Rinse and repeat. As a result over  +- 70% of the class is already failing.\n\n7: Assignments and their criteria are not discussed between teachers. In the rare case when they are graded the following seems to happen quite often. They are given separately and as a result of bad communication or lack thereof between teachers some students are scolded/graded by a teacher who did not issue the assignment and did not read the assignment criteria. This again raises confusion with students who are starting out and it is frustrating for everyone since points are sometimes downgraded as a result.\n\n8: The head of our department who is responsible for coordinating the teachers and planning when each subjects is to be covered seems to have no idea and no interest to what is going on. This person is also a teacher and teaches us one day in the week. I would like to discuss such issues with this person but I concluded that the chances of this leading to a positive outcome are improbable. This person doesn't seem to know what the teachers this person directs are teaching, no coherent plant regarding anything etc. Shows no interest in student progress and if students manage to finish days/weeks in advance the person's response is something along the lines of \"Well it's not my problem that you have nothing to do good luck with that.\". This person seems very insecure about their qualifications and skills which seems to be hidden under a layer of toxicity and arrogance which seems obvious by making remarks about the beginner students. Such as \"I've been doing this for 43 years and some students show me a PHP form. Well that's nothing I've been doing this since they were in diapers they shouldn't come to me to show me that junk.\" etc. This person has never said this to anyone directly but does mention such things when other students are around.  I find this extremely toxic, unprofessional and a very bad personal/professional quality for a teacher to have. Especially for one in charge of the department. Student progress should be celebrated not scorned. This can be very demotivating to students who are just getting into this. I understand this person's frustration with some students but this is not the way to handle this and this type of mentality should be beneath that of a teacher, let alone the head of the department.\n\n9: Students often end up asking some of the more experienced students including myself for help. This is not necessarily a problem and I am more than willing to help other students and I'm certain the other students who are more experienced don't mind doing so either. The problem arises when we are basically teaching the entire class on subjects the teacher briefly covered. We are sometimes overloaded with questions. Even to a point that some students make remarks that we sometimes teach better than said teachers, this to me sounds very worrisome. Again we have no problem helping people but we signed up into this institution as students, not as teachers.\n\n10: Most of the more experienced students are at a point where they leave lessons halfway through the class because there is nothing to do or end up not showing up for long periods of time and seem to be getting more and more demotivated by the current situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all how do I even influence this? I don't want to set off some personal vendetta with any of the teachers. Then again the current model seems unsustainable and things do not seem close to a point in which they will improve.",

      "text": "There are 2 main variables when it comes to school quality. 1) what career field are you entering 2) what level is the school at.\n\n1) This is more important (obviously) because some fields want a degree others want you to be top of the class in Harvard. I would do some research and talk to people who are in your job roles about this. The one conversation I had with a sofftware dev was about training programs and certifications. He said that finished projects an employer could review is way more valuable than any certification. So assuming this applies to education, I would make sure you are learning new skills that are helpful for your career.\n\n2) People get really hung up on going to the best school possible. The way I see it, there are 3 general levels of higher education. At the top you have elite ivy league schools (harvard, mit, yale etc). In the middle are large universities (Texas A&M, University of Georgia (bulldogs), University of Oklahoma (sooners) etc, Baylor). At the bottom are low level colleges that you can identify by a high acceptance rate and a low graduation rate (texas state bobcats, smu in dallas, university of houston). The higher you can be here can make a difference in earnings. The big difference is your ability to get started because ivy league will have more people asking for you than a low level state school. Don't stress if you are at Texas A&M or Texas Tech because they really are the same quality.\n\nI kinda mentioned it already but your institution doesn't matter in 20 years (for most jobs). If you are are good at what you do, previous colleagues/bosses can testify to it. I would try applying to higher level institutions if you can make a good roi.\n\nIf you want to test how good your current place is, see if they have records of salary after graduation, I know Texas A&M does. If the salary is not what you thought, consider other options.\n\nRemember a degree serves 1 main purpose. It says I'm not stupid/crazy and I can learn to work in the environment. You can certainly learn important/helpful things but degrees are mostly a signaling device.",
