      "text": "For the vast majority of people, yes, this is okay. The exceptions are usually people who intend on applying to programs that require or expect at least a 3.5 GPA. B's translate to a 3.0 on a GPA scale which isn't bad, but too many of them get you below a 3.5.\n\nFor most people, you just want to keep your GPA above a 3.0 and you're good. Below that and you'll start losing out on opportunities, but if that happens then in practice you can just leave your GPA off your resume and find other things (projects, experience) that will help you and then GPA won't have too much of an impact (assuming you plan on working after your bachelor's-- if you want to further your education then below a 3.0 is really bad and between a 3.0-3.5 is less than ideal but something you can work with).",

My physics prof always told me \"C's get degrees.... so don't stress over perfect grades.\" All I can say is that you're doing something good because I know so many people who aren't near to having a B in any classes. In my opinion, as long as its above a 70 average or however your UNI's grade system works, you should be perfectly fine.",

      "text": "Exactly how it will affect your GPA is just a math formula that you can do yourself or find an online calculator for. As far as how it will affect you your GPA should really just be about a 3.0, and if you were in a competitive field and want to work for a high profile company you probably want something like a 3.25 or 3.4. big companies like Microsoft or Tesla get so many applicants that they just need some way to pare it down a little bit and unfortunately GPA is the easiest way to do that even if it isn't the best reflector of your skills. A few bees or even a semester full of bees won't ruin your GPA especially if you get back to making a few more days or have a lot of semesters under your belt already.",
