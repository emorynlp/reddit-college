  "text": "Hello USA, I\u2019m a writer for a small Croatian publication that is mainly eduction related. We are releasing our first US t100 college rankings. We did not include any liberal arts colleges not because they aren\u2019t worthy of praise but because we believe they have clear differences with traditional universities. Our rankings were based off a combination of under grad and graduate quality. We stayed away from the traditional US model of focusing on small class sizes and falling in love with big private school names. We felt the American approach was not in agreement with academic standards. \nPlease give us your feed back, we want to hear what America thinks.\nThe article will be posted in the next few days here is a sneak peak!!!\n1.
