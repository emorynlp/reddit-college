  "text": "I saw a post asking folks to use Rate My Professor at the end of the semester. If you\u2019re like me, you weren\u2019t given a choice what professor you got for a certain class so this isn\u2019t really a helpful tool. \n\nMost schools have formal review surveys called \u201cProfessor Evaluations\u201d that they ask folks to do at the mid term and the end of the semester. These are extremely helpful for the professor, administrators and future students. They are anonymous and the professors don\u2019t see the results until after they submit a grade. Administration looks at these reviews when deciding to rehire adjunct professors and during tenure review for full time professors. If you\u2019re experiencing a truly awful teacher this can also add to a paper trail when you report them. \n\nThroughout my schooling, My professors have had to beg students to fill them out and they get low responses. This sucks because it\u2019s really a great way to commend great professors and chastise shitty ones. \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure if your school has this review system in place, it\u2019s most likely in your student portal. You can also email the academic department or registrar. \n\nPlease review your professors in a way that counts.",

      "text": "I teach at a university, and I encourage all of my students to use the feedback methods provided.\n\nOne thing I will add is that whether your experience was positive or negative, include specific, actionable statements.  \"Dr. FreakyBlueEyes was the best professor EVAR!!!!\" is sure nice to hear and makes me feel good, but it doesn't actually help me improve.  The same goes for \"Dr. FreakyBlueEyes is actual a demon in human skin.  I'm pretty sure I saw him eating a live baby on the way to class.\"  Not fun, but also not helpful (and usually makes me feel like you're angry about your grade, which may or may not be my fault.)\n\nHowever, if I get comments like \"The material on the tests was nothing like the homework,\" or \"The way XYZ was explained made no sense to me,\" or on the other side \"When we did ABC activity, that helped me to connect with the material,\" I now have things to work with.  I can go back and review what I did and maybe focus more on something good and/or adjust something bad.  Of course, it's a balance and one comment out of 75 might not get much change.  In particular, if I have about an equal number of students saying that quizzes were too hard and too easy, then there's a solid chance things are about right (and factors outside of student feedback matter, too.)\n\nTL;DR: Absolutely do use your voice, just do so in a way that gives detail and examples.",

At large universities with a high rate of adjunct usage (part time professors hired on a very short term basis for low pay with no job security), the administration only looks at the numbers at the end of the term. It is beyond unfair for someone to loose their livelihood because no one likes virtual learning and rated them low, despite the instructor having no control of the university's decision not to hold in person classes, and very little control over the fact that virtual class are almost always less personal and engaging.",

      "text": "I'm of two minds on formal student reviews, coming from the instructor side. All professors should be held accountable to how good of a job they do, and a good way of doing that is student ratings. In principle, it's a good system. \n\nThe issue is how it translates into practice. All these things serve to do at present is act as another form inequality between folks like me, who jump around from contract to contract (and the lack of security is why I'm leaving teaching forever after this term), and the tenured professors who do an absolute shit job, give zero fucks about students, and laugh at horrible reviews when they come in.\n\nObviously those aren't mutually exclusive. But anyone who is a contract instructor right now is very likely doing it out of passion, because let me tell you, they aren't doing it for literally anything else. When your employment is inherently precarious, and you care about students, you pour a lot of soul into it. Very rarely do you see a tenured professor give a flying fuck about improving pedagogy. They download all of that shit, like everything else, onto the poorly paid and temporarily employed instructors trying to cobble together a living.\n\nSomeone else made a comment about biased questions. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the faculty union imposing a temporary alteration to how the questions are asked because a lot of students this year will complain or argue their instructor didn't do enough when this year has been so fucked. It's been as difficult for us as it has for all of you. Asking questions about teaching methods might actually be more reflective of effort rather than just, \"did this sort of satisfy your desire to take an in-person class?\"\n\nJust two cents from the other side. Please review your professors, but just be aware that depending on who your professor is, it may or may not matter. Tenure is not a structure that benefits students in any meaningful way, and I think it needs to be radically rethought.",
