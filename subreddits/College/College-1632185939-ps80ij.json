We'll call her K), and K's roommate from last year (someone I've never met before, we'll call her L). K is currently away on coop, so it is just me and L right now. We are in off campus apartments that come with a shared kitchen and living space.\n\nThe problem: L never does her dishes. She lets them 'soak' for days at a time, throws big pots into the dishwasher (which means they don't get cleaned bc they need to be hand washed...), and then will never empty out the dishwasher. Also, she does the same thing with laundry; leaves them in forgets to switch them over, ect.\n\nRecently, I texted her (our schedules are very different so we never really get the chance to talk face to face) asking if she could wash the bigger pots by hand because the dishwasher doesn't clean them. She gets very passive aggressive with me, and states that she will do it \"if she has time\" \n\nI get being busy in college, however, I am busy as well; I have a part time job, my full time classes, and many other social and family obligations, but yet I always manage to clean my dishes after every use. However, we are both adults and I really do not want to end up cleaning up after her like I'm her mother. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips or solutions for dealing with this situation.

Don't let the dishes get done so she can live in her own filth. If you and K have your own set of dishes that she is not allowed to use, then you can keep cleaning up after yourself and just let her dishes get dirty enough. She'll have to clean up after herself eventually. If she leaves her laundry in the wash, just take it out and leave it soaking wet in a basket for her to deal with. Don't ever switch her laundry for her. \n\nThis all sounds harsh, but she really needs to develop some sense of responsibility, and letting her suffer natural consequences of her own actions is a start.", "author": "Paesana", "created": 1632190849, "upvotes": 3}}}
