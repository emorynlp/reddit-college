  "text": "i\u2019m a freshman in college and i\u2019ve been here for a little over a month now. and as much as i like the school i\u2019m at, i\u2019ve had the hardest time with making friends and i\u2019ve slumped into one of my worst depressive episodes in a while. i\u2019ve never felt so alone. making friends has been such a challenge. im about 7 hours away from home, didn\u2019t know anyone else going here, and while i have made like 3 friends, it\u2019s obvious when im with them in the odd man out , they just aren\u2019t really my \u201ctype\u201d of people and i just feel lonely even with them. i really don\u2019t know what to do. im getting involved with clubs, im a part of our schools radio station, but man it just sucks. my birthday is in a week and usually that\u2019s my absolute favorite day of the year, but im dreading it because i know im just going to spend it alone, and because i know i have barely any friends to hang with on that day anyways. i feel so stuck.",

      "text": "I know exactly how you feel and I also have some friends that aren't really my type either. But what helped me is that it seems like the both if us are putting way too much pressure on ourselves. There is so much going on right now. We don't necessarily HAVE to go around and make friends everywhere we go. This uneeeded pressure we put on ourselves makes everything so much harder, sadder, and lonely. So what I suggest is don't worry too much about making friends. Go out and do things that make you happy. The people that are your real friends will stick around and be your friend. If you do things that you like, you will be happy again and forget that you were struggling to find friends in the first place.",

I\u2019ve made a few friends just by going \u201chey what\u2019s your name\u201d to however I\u2019m sitting next to at the beginning of a class. Some people may not be interested in talking to you, and that\u2019s life, but you\u2019re bound to find someone with whom you\u2019ll click. I used to have this misconception that is was \u201ctoo late\u201d to talk to people because they\u2019d already have friends or something, but most people would welcome it, or at the very least would be indifferent. I know it can seem daunting, but the worst that could happen is it\u2019s a little awkward at first, and the great thing? In college not everyone know\u2019s everyone else like in high school, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if some prick thinks you\u2019re weird.",

Sometimes they don\u2019t even have friends either and are extremely happy you\u2019ve talked to them. I\u2019m wishing the best of luck to everyone going through the same thing<3",

But after embracing the loneliness for some time, I felt like I loved myself more every single day. I started to treat myself better, picked up some new skills, started to enjoy every little things I encountered in life. Just do the things you love and make yourself happy and eventually people with similar mindset will be attracted to you soon. Life can be great either with or without friends. Most importantly, just do the things that make you feel happy.",
