  "text": "I'm out of my room all day, kicking it with somebody all the time, manuevering around the city by bus. I do all of this while still broke as hell.\n\nI don't even hate the all night study sessions. They brought alot of clarity to me. And it's worth it when I look back and see another 20/20 in the gradebooks. (My schedule isn't light either: 2 math classes and Chinese + some cores).\n\nI don't drink or do drugs of any kind, so I can't always kick it with club members. But I have a solid friend group with similar interests. We winning rn.\n\nIn summary, I'm waiting for midterms to humble me.",

In classes no one talks to each other, it's incredibly anti social. Clubs aren't even that fun and not a great way to get to know people. The only thing that looks fun is the bars which I can't get into yet.\n\nI try to be social but at this point the only real way to do that is basically go up to random people to try to get their number or talk to someone for like 2 minutes at a club and then get try to get their number.",
