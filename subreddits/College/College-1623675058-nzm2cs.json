In other words, if you did not register for the draft, this will have no bearing on whether or not you can receive federal student aid.\n\nThis is HUGE news, and something we\u2019ve been waiting on for a long time. We had an idea that this was coming, but thought it would be several more years. As someone who\u2019s worked in this field for years, I\u2019ve had to deny many, many students federal aid because of this. Transgender students, students who were incarcerated, and students who were not citizens between the ages of 18-26. Students who *needed* the money.\n\nOutside of FSA, this is huge progress and shows where society, and, more specifically, the Department of Education, currently stands on the SS. It means that, aside from potentially diminished chances at landing a government job, consequences of not registering are nearly nonexistent.\n\n**Update 1 \u2014 We\u2019ve just been informed that this change also grants eligibility for students who would otherwise be ineligible due to \u201cdrug offense restrictions.\u201d Yes.
