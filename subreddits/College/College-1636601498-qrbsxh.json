I believe college is just a place to train us to work at offices making money for other people.\n\nBy the way, my professor don't stick to the syllabus so it makes it harder to keep with everything because my professor are way behind on material.

I wouldnt be this pissed or post this if I was lying. \nYou weren't there nor are you taking my class. \n\nIf you dont want accept this that's a YOU problem.
