I\u2019m a high school senior right now, trying (and failing) to choose a major. Before i get hit with the \u201cgo undecided\u201d, comments, just know that is not an option for me. My family will not let me go without declaring a major. Furthermore, I know I can change majors, but I would also get in trouble for that by my family.\n\nMy parents and grandparents want me to pursue medicine, but I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand that. I don\u2019t enjoy it enough. \n\nMy question for those of you in college now, is it worth it to peruse an English degree and a second degree in music education? \n\nI\u2019ve wanted to teach my whole life. I live in Florida, and plan to stay in Florida, where there is a teacher shortage.\n\nTherefore, is it advisable to pursue this degrees? From current or former college students\u2026 what is your opinion? Your advice for double majoring?\n\nThank you so much in advance, all of you. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your responses!", "author": "jedi_avenger", "created": 1632935866, "retrieved": 1632945352, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"her1k3m": {"link": "/r/college/comments/py02u3/choosing_a_degree_double_major_in_english_and/her1k3m/", "text": "From what I've seen, a music education major is pretty high course load in itself, between the music and the education courses.

Music and English will likely be a dual degree for you, not a double major. Dual degrees are when you get separate degrees from different schools within your college. Most of the classes you have will not overlap and therefore you will do much more work than someone seeking an actual double major, which is when you get one degree with two specializations from the same school within your institution\n\nAlso, a lot of people caution students against getting dual degrees, and not without reason, so that's something you'll really want to think long and hard about before making this decision", "author": "vampyreontitus", "created": 1632937134, "upvotes": 2}}}
