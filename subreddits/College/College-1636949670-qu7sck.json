  "text": "hi everyone. bio major here and specifically planning to go into neurobio. currently taking physics because of major prereqs and I am having so much trouble in this class, I think it\u2019s bc of all the conceptual mathematical part of it. bio and chem/ochem are equally as hard I feel, but I enjoy them so much more. will this physics stuff even be needed if i want to go into biotech or med school (apart fr it being on the mcat)?? i feel like im goin thru this pain for NOTHING can anyone relate ?? I literally like ochem more than physics which is wild. smh ty for coming to my Ted talk",

Try to learn all you can. It's incredibly useful knowledge to have in your back pocket. The kinematic equations are super great to know.",
