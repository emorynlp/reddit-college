We went around the room reading the book aloud.  We drew pictures about the topics and had our classmate add onto them.  That was suppose to \"create a study guide\" for final exam.  That exam was 12 randomly selected essay questions from a pool of 30.  Each required 1/2 page answers.  Hand written during class.  And we drew pictures together to study for it.  For a freshman level class.  Now you know that kind of nonsense I was dealing with.  \n\nFor the ice breaker: He assigns a partner.  You stand face to face, maintaining eye contact.  Each of you does various hand gestures, stomps, etc and the partner is supposed to mimic them even though they could only see them through the their peripherals.  You don't say a word during this \"ice breaker\".  This went on for several minutes.  To make it more uncomfortable, the girl I was paired with had a very severe facial deformity.  You could tell she was mortified by this.  It affected the entire structure of her face and forehead. When I'm 3 feet away and meant to be staring this distraught stranger in the eye for several minutes, it was impossible not to glance at the rest of her face.
