  "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI need a little bit of help starting up my first academic essay paper. The prof has been no help as he said that's something we would've learned in school but we've done very limited stuff regardining this. (I asked him for help but he referred me to student services). How would one write an academic paper reviewing and summarising three articles these articles as to how they relate to one another? I feel like I've got the general idea behind it but whenever I start to write it up it  I cant phrase the information on paper. What structure should I follow? Is there a specific format? How much should I quote for a review or a summary? \n\nThank you !",
