  "text": "I hope I can post here.\nLooking for some advice on how to study also some hours in the night, before sleeping and keep pushing and do more.\n\nFor now my routine is going to study room and I stay there from 9 to 17. I do about 3 hours to commute. So I leave home at 7 and I come home at 19.\n\nWhat I would like to do is to try to study 3/4 hours more from 21 to midgnight or 1 am.\n\nDo you have any suggestions or tips to do that?\n\nI do watch people on YouTube who do a lot of hours of studying, I would like to do that as well.\n\nThanks in advance.",

In terms of tips\u2026 you just gotta have the will to study so late. To make it easier, you can do stuff like Pomodoro so that you have breaks every now and then.",

              "text": "It's hard to explain my exact process, but here's some tips:\n\n1. Have a similar routine everyday. Don't confuse and tire yourself with irregularities. I even study during winter and summer breaks to not lose my habit (plus it puts you ahead of others).\n2. Min-max your efforts. Some concepts are more important than others. Some concepts might not seem important for this term, but will be important on your future classes. Two 90% is better than one 80% and one 100%.\n3. Run and workout everyday. It's the equivalent of taking prozac and ritalin without the side-effect.\n4. Enjoy what you study. I love STEM classes, but I also love taking electives that have nothing to do with my major such as art, American history (my favorite), literature, and etc.",
