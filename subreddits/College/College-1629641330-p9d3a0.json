That may work like one in 100 times, but it is generally not going to be received well. If you are interested, there\u2019s not really much you can do to help with that, but you need to start off by just striking up a conversation and not immediately jumping to \u201cwe should go out sometime.\u201c The only exception to this might be if you consistently see this person in a dining hall and they are giving you \u201cthe eyes\u201c, though even then I would approach with caution and respect. (Also, generally speaking, I would avoid using the term \u201cfemales\u201c when referring to women collectively. While I am not a woman, and I certainly don\u2019t want to try to speak for women, my experience has been that they generally dislike being referred to as females in a casual context. It can set off a lot of red flags, which you may not intentionally be doing, but could be off-putting to some). \n\nThat being said, I think this is definitely a problem that a lot of college students and adults in general face. It would certainly be great to have some kind of system to let people know that you are down to just chat with people. The reality is that a lot of times people sitting by themselves do you have a reason for doing so, but there are also definitely a lot of people who wish that they weren\u2019t by themselves. If you go to any college sub Reddit, you\u2019re more than likely to encounter some amount of posts that are something like \u201cI\u2019m lonely\u201d or \u201chow to make friends\u201d.  Ideally, there would be someway to discreetly signal to people that you are not opposed to meeting new people while seated and That people can approach and know they are meeting someone interested in talking. This should ideally be a discreet signal so as to avoid becoming synonymous with \u201cbeing a loser\u201c (which by the way, if you are having a hard time making friends, you definitely aren\u2019t a loser, but just trying to be realistic here and think about how these kinds of signals can develop into further stigmatization which is the opposite of what we want). I was thinking maybe turning a chair outwards or something of the sort, assuming that there is enough room and that you were not going to block the way. At the very worst, something like this could result in a few unassuming people sitting down at a table and people coming up and asking to sit, but would also be discreet enough to avoid becoming an obvious signal that you are looking to meet people.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a tricky issue, so just approach with caution and respect. Generally, the worst thing people can do is say no. It\u2019s hard and a lot of the time it\u2019s probably not going to be super great conversation, but sometimes it also could lead to the beginning of very good friendships.", "author": "cprenaissanceman", "created": 1629661193, "upvotes": 2}, "h9y0ihe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/p9d3a0/asking_people_to_sit_with_them_in_the_dining_hall/h9y0ihe/", "text": "Yeah, as long as you don't call them \"females\" to their face.

Sometimes people will say no and the best way to handle that is just say ok no worries I\u2019ll find a spot somewhere else but usually people don\u2019t mind it just depends on the person. \n\nMy best advice is make friends with the cooks and the cashiers that swipe your card if you go to the same dinning hall. I went so often that sometimes they\u2019re already have my plate ready with food because they KNEW I\u2019d be in by a certain time lol.
