  "text": "I\u2019ve been directed to this sub reddit so not sure if it\u2019s right place or not.\n\nHey guys! \n\nI\u2019m currently in university and about to complete my first year. Since going to university I\u2019ve had to move two hours away and don\u2019t know anyone that goes to my uni so I\u2019ve just gone to classes and come home and studied. I would say I\u2019m happy and my grades are really good however I\u2019ve always felt like I need a good connection with someone. Over the year I haven\u2019t really met anyone that I\u2019ve connected with well however half way through this semester I found two people who I joined in with on lab classes. Great group and found I really fit in well with them. However these classes were only once a week and it obviously there wasn\u2019t too much time to just chit chat. Now, the last couple of years hasn\u2019t been too good for me regarding relationships especially romantic relationships, kinda got fucked over and wasted 2 years. I\u2019ve always been the guy that knows a lot of people but I\u2019ve never really been in a tight friend group so I kind of struggle with everything in that regard. I felt accepted straight away with these two people. The last week or so I keep thinking about this one girl and I haven\u2019t felt that feeling in years. Things she does just keeps getting better. For example our last class was today and the lecturers wanted us to give feedback of the course on this online survey and she goes up to the head tutor and says thank you and explains that she has done a wonderful job of the course. I was amazed by this kind gesture, as the girls I\u2019ve dealt with would never have done anything like that. I\u2019ve befriended the other guy on Facebook and we\u2019ve been debating about the whole covid situation (in a very friendly matter) over the past week. I was wanting to ask the girl for her number, Snapchat etc. but once again I never know how to bring it up and we left. Now my question is, is it weird if I ask the other guy if he has her Facebook, number, Snapchat etc? \n\nI should also add that I think she was flirting with me a little. What I\u2019m trying to say is that I think she\u2019s could also be into me aswell. \n\nP.s I\u2019m really bad with names and I don\u2019t know her name sooooo (it\u2019s like that seinfeld episode lol)",
