  "text": "When I was at university I shifted from Mathematics to Economics and my God it was the best decision I have ever made in my entire life. However my parents and my older brother hated it. I EVENhad a teacher who thinks stidents that shift do not prepare well. I only shifted because \n1) I realize Math is not going to be about just numbers. The numbers wil soon go away and I will deal with theorems and proving.\n2) I need business learnings to. Economics to me is a good mix between math and business \n3) The thesis is Solo and no way i want to do thesis solo. Economics have group thesis.\n4) Applied Math is a new course in my uni and it was only established 10 years ago. Some of the seniots felt like guinea pigs while econ has been around since 1991.",

      "text": "I've personally never met anyone who had anything against people who change majors. I suspect that it's cultural, because it seems you're not in the US and in the US we have 4 year degrees where the first year mostly consists of bullshit classes that everyone takes regardless of their area of study. \n\nWhile this has it's own problems (it extends the length of degree program and first year courses are almost always less rigorous than they would be if they were taken only by declared majors) one of the benefits is that it allows students to stay undecided or to change majors up through their second year, and it's largely that way by design. \n\nMost people know that 18 year olds don't know shit about what they want to do in life and that it's best to let them try things out before committing. It might not be that way in your country, but I find that in the US people are extremely friendly to the idea of students choosing a major and then jumping ship to another major.\n\nNow the students who change majors *several* times... those students are a different story.",
