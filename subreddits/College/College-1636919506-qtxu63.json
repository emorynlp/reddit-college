      "text": "Nope. We know about essay farms. It is VERY obvious for so many reasons when a student hasn't written the work. Here are just a few reasons to not commit academic dishonesty:\n\n1. Most important: we know your writing voice by now. 1. Y'all aren't nearly as slick as you think you are.\n2. Many services use the same few essays, run them through a synonym program, or copy/paste articles into references that they haven't \\*actually\\* read.\n3. They don't read the assignment sheet, missing some important aspect or formatting the student would know. They also way too often add information not relevant to your specific class.\n4. Most will take your money and run. One semester, I had a writer-for-hire email me about a student buying papers when the student refused to submit payment.\n5. You can and will likely be kicked out of class, possibly your program and university. Unless you have a very lenient professor who gives out warnings (very rare after COVID), ask if this one paper is worth your future. Even if you don't get the full book thrown at you, word gets around real fast in departments about dishonest students.\n\nAsk your professor for an extension, work 5 minutes at a time on your break, ask the writing center for help with focus, go to the library for help with references. Don't cheat.",

I think it's all about to save yourself from failing the semester or the whole course. That's why I think this can be acceptable in some (very special) occasions. I heard gossips in dorm - some guys were whispering they used this service because they were partying all the month and did none of the assignments they had to.",
