  "text": "I applied and had an internship interview on the 1st of October. They told me they would get back to me in 2 weeks. I just received a different offer 2 days ago, but it was with my second choice and I really want to get the other job since it's in my hometown. Is it normal for companies not to get back to you over the time they specified? I was told I would still get an email if I was rejected.",

      "text": "If it's been two weeks, and you need an internship for your major or just really think it will help your resume, try calling, emailing, etc a few more times and take your second choice before the second choice goes with someone else.\n\nDepends on the company but /r/recruitinghell and /r/jobs seems to paint the picture that ghosting and near-ghosting are more common than not. \n\nOnly two companies have ever responded to me within a week of application. REI, responded within three days; and a local school for disabled students responded one day after my interview and explained COVID policies were changing too rapidly and budgets were so short they actually didn't pick any interns, iirc. \n\nI applied to I think 80 in the last two years and only about 10 responded ever, and ten more just played phone tag. Last week, I heard back from one I applied to in early August.",
