  "title:": "Why do I keep getting below average on exams?",
  "text": " \n\nThis is a serious post, I legitimately can not understand why I keep getting below average on exams. I tracked my studying habits for my last exam and I used the tomato timer method so I was not burning out.  \nI legitimately practiced and sacrificed so much of my free time in prep just to get below the average. I have been desperately trying to understand what is going on that is causing this. I know that it's studying smarter not harder and all that, but I feel like I'm grasping the material then just freezing up on the exams. Meanwhile, my peers seem to not study as much but still do much better than me. I am not just sitting staring at a piece of paper, I'm practicing problems over and over, trying to understand the material, etc.\n\nCould someone offer some serious advice on how to change my trend of just scoring below average, I used to be a 4.0 student and now for every class, I'm just scraping by. \n\nI'm an accounting major for reference",

This is called using contextual clues. Math tests used to give me anxiety, so I did this after a friend recommended it, and it worked. I also paired my math studying time with the smell and taste of mint (sounds weird, I know, but it's psychologically valid). Whenever I studied math, I drank mint tea and used a pencil that smelled like mint that I got online. I also wore the same light jacket whenever I studied math. I went from being a C student in math to an A student.",
