  "text": "\nEverything feels so disorganized. Everything feels overwhelming. We are struggling to just create a basic routine. It\u2019s hard sometimes just to speak up and talk about our issues. To the professors and educators that understand this, thank you for working with us.\n\n\nI missed a midterm on Monday and was completely unaware until my professor reached out today and talked to me about it. I told him it was my own fault that I missed it. He offered me an extension on it and I\u2019m extremely grateful. I know you\u2019ll likely never read this, but thank you.",

I've always done my work completely honestly because I want to learn/actually earn my grade. My school's/teacher's intense response to cheaters is causing so much suffering and grade tanking (previously 4.0 student) that it makes you feel like maybe you need to become one of the cheaters just to fucking survive it..... The increased difficulty seriously impacts the students doing their work honestly and the cheaters are definitely still cheating unimpeded.",

                  "text": "Course content will increase in difficulty naturally as it builds up new concepts, so hopefully that's not what you are referring to. Just in case I was unclear, when I say \"make this more difficult\" the implication is that the exams are written in a way that makes it difficult to cheat (and likewise difficult to grade) and third party software (which is often cumbersome) is used to proctor and deter cheating. Not that the course content is made intentionally harder than it needs to be.\n\nCheating isn't worth it, so keep sticking to your guns and stay honest. It's not easy, but the right thing often isn't. Let your instructor know about what you're struggling with and you might find something that will stem the grade tanking situation.\n\nWhat has your instructor changed that is making the assessments more difficult than they were before? (I do genuinely want to know, since it will help me understand your position better.)",

Now my school and teachers have been trying to deter cheating more this semester by adding extra work, such as additional essays/other work that's harder to cheat on. When you were already working on school full time and not cheating there is no time for the extra work. With the extra work there is not enough time to do it all honestly and by yourself, definitely no time for studying for tests anymore when you are rushing against so many deadlines... Now I feel our courses are designed for cheaters to be the only ones who have time to be able to do all the work. But people who really want to cheat will find ways no matter what, so it's really only the people who do the work honestly that have to suffer from this",

That's a good thing.\n\nReally wish you guys would stop implying that professors are too lazy to edit assignments or that tenure = never working. If you experienced one of those, that's some bad luck - for the majority of instructors revising assignments is a given. Stirring bad blood based on strawmen doesn't do anyone any favors.",
