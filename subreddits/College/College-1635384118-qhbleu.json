  "text": "hi guys, for those of you that have taken survey of bio chem or even biochemistry in general, how hard is it? for reference, i hated general chemistry and just sucked at it. i have to take survey of biochem for my major next quarter. i\u2019ve heard mixed reviews about it. does it consist of math? is it similar to gen chem? any tips for how you studied for it would also be very appreciated!",

      "text": "Have you had organic chem yet? I am in bio chem right now in my opinion it is in between the difficulty of organic 1 and 2. My experience with biochem is that many of the interactions happen with intermolecular forces, which makes explaining things not too bad. What I struggle with is memorizing things, and I feel I have to memorize a bit more compared to other chem classes but not much. I also never took biology before this class, so I am at a slight disadvantage compared to other students but I am doing fine so far. \n\nThere is some Gibbs energy in biochem, so you only do a little math.",

Physics 1 and 2 were much harder in my opinion. You will do good in organic if you can do lewis structures and understand intermolecular forces from general chemistry. These two concepts (especially lewis structures) are super important.",
