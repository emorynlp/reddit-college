  "title:": "Having extreme issues managing 10 credits this term",
  "text": "I'm so stressed. We're only a few weeks into the quarter and I'm already finding that I can't handle the 10 credits I'm taking. I don't know if this is because it's my first term in person in over a year or what, but I'm really worried. Two of my classes take up the majority of my time (we have to write a lot of reports and do many different assignments in addition to the homework) and I get next to no time to study for the third one. I'm now failing the third one and I have no idea what to do. I've spoken to the professor and she didn't really have any advice to give me. \n\nI also want to add that I'm not a procrastinator. I spend almost every waking moment doing the work for the first two classes. Self-care has also gone down the drain due to the amount of time those classes take me. I don't eat every day, I have to remember to drink water, and my sleep schedule is terrible.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. I used to be able to handle 15+ units without a problem. I really want to drop the third class and only focus on the first two, but I can't imagine only taking 7 units in a term. Any advice?",

      "text": "Talk to financial aid to ensure there won't be any repercussions. If you're truly failing that class , do a grade weight calculator. to look at \"what-if\" scenarios. How high would you need to get in the final or other grades to pass/OR get the grade you would have liked. If after discussing this w/ fin aid, your professor, advisor etc you may want to just drop the class. An F is most often worse than a W.\n\nPlease also speak to a mental health professional. Your mental health is more important than taking a specific class imo.",

      "text": "Talk to your advisor! Sometimes dropping a class and working your way back up to see how many credits you can handle is the best plan of action. They know about more resources and are there for giving advice\n\nYour professor would be able to provide you with study material or help with the work. Although some give amazing advice, sometimes they just don\u2019t know how to help you in the way you need",
