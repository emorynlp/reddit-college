I realize I should have just picked the most obvious major for me (computer science) and stuck to it but I was lazy and disillusioned and now I'm a foreign language major for no reason other than trying to graduate in 2022.\n\nSo my question is, can I attend community college or get a second degree, after my bachelor's degree? I learn best in a class environment despite me hating school. I need that \"school deadline\" and I have trouble learning on my own schedule. I know that for computer science there are certificate programs and coding bootcamps but I am trying to see what my best options are, especially financial- and schedule-wise. I have a day job so ideally I don't want something as intensive (or expensive) as a bootcamp. \n\nAny advice from someone who is able to help will be greatly appreciated. I really really feel like I fucked up and I have no skills at all to show for my time at university. It was a reputable one at that, yet I feel ashamed of the choices I've made.", "author": "hwa4", "created": 1632896078, "retrieved": 1632945381, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hepn3o1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxpd55/can_i_go_to_community_college_after_my_bachelors/hepn3o1/", "text": "If you're entertaining the idea of going to a CC for an associates, why not just get a CS minor at your current school?", "author": "ILikeGoldAndShowers", "created": 1632916460, "upvotes": 1}, "hepg8x9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxpd55/can_i_go_to_community_college_after_my_bachelors/hepg8x9/", "text": "Yes, so can go to CC or get a second degree afterward.", "author": "WCCobra", "created": 1632911647, "upvotes": 2}}}
