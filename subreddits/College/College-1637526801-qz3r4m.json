  "text": "I've always, ALWAYS, been a procrastinator. I cannot get things done unless deadlines are very close and I'm showered with pressure and anxiety from head to toes. I've always been like this. My grades are really good, the problem is that I have 5 exams left and must take 2 in January and one of them is really really difficult, it's a subject I don't like and I'm terrified of the professor because he's known to be an a-hole. This is not an excuse but I'm terrified of opening the notes because I know it's not an easy exam and it takes a lot of time to prepare it, time that I've been wasting and I'm afraid it might be too late. My parents think I go to the library everyday but I'm not and they also know that I have to take these 2 exams in January. I don't know what to do, I know the problem won't solve on its own unless I get myself to study but I just can't. I already got my BA and I'm studying to get my MA, I'm so tired of college I swear I don't wanna have anything to do with it anymore but I have 5 exams left and my thesis to write (it means another year and a half at least). .",

I'm a lazy ass and this is what I do. I've been going to a college counselor for 6 years and despite them telling me to start studying wayyy beforehand since I also suffer from anxiety I just cannot seem to do it. Even though cramming 3 weeks prior the exam has always worked fine this time around I'm scared it won't because the exam I'm about to take is 3 times more difficult than the ones I've taken in my college journey and I've taken like 30 or something",

A good way to start not procrastinating is just to do something as soon as it pops into your head before you have time to think about it it might help to have a friend or parent help keep you on track. Try to maintain a positive attitude while you study our negativity is what hold us back.",
