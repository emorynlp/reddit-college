I\u2019ll keep it short, but home life, work, mental health, weather, etc. I know others have it worse, but I get overwhelmed.\n\nI\u2019m falling behind in most of my 5 courses this semester. Still better than last semester though. I thought about taking a break but it\u2019s my last year and loans and everything...I figured I\u2019d just stick it out.\n\nAnyway, my professor messaged me yesterday with the subject \u201cChecking in\u201d:\n\nDear ______,\n\nHow are you doing? I'm writing to check in with you. I haven't heard from you in this class yet and I'd like to connect with you to figure out how I can best support you. These are difficult times and I'm more than happy to be flexible with the course.\n\nLet me know if you want to chat over video or phone, or just check in through email.\n\nBest,\nProfessor _______\n\nI honestly teared up. It\u2019s a small class, probably around 10 people, so I\u2019m not surprised he noticed. He already has a \u201cno penalty for late work\u201d policy his semester that I\u2019ve definitely been taking advantage of. \n\nIt was just so nice to receive. To be reached out to instead of having to reach out (which is really hard sometimes). Even motivated me to make more of an effort to get stuff done for his sake. I\u2019ll try this weekend. I haven\u2019t replied yet, but of course I\u2019ll thank him and be honest.\n\nSorry, it\u2019s 6am and I\u2019m still awake and started thinking about how I\u2019m going to respond. I really hope he doesn\u2019t have Reddit omg, that\u2019d be embarrassing sorry prof\n\nJust, thank you :)", "author": "dreamer0303", "created": 1614256186, "retrieved": 1632801590, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2082, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"got3tlw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ls5idn/to_the_professors_that_email_students_who_are/got3tlw/", "text": "One of my professors individually asks every student how they're doing at the beginning of every class.
