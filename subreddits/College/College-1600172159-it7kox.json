I tried Professor Leonard, o chem tutor, and a few different ones on YouTube. \n\nShe\u2019s clear, does tons of practice problems, shows where students generally make mistakes, and provides memorization tips. She covers all of calc 1-3, precalc, linear, diff eq, so everything is on there if you need to review earlier material, and it\u2019s organized. \n\nOf course it\u2019s a subscription, but I think it\u2019s highly worth it.",
