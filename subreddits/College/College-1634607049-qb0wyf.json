  "title:": "Frustrated with only knowing small percent of my grade until close to the end",
  "text": "Typically as the final days to withdraw approach (which indicates about 65% of the class is completed) we know around 50-75% of our grade, depending on the course. I'm frustrated with one class because we won't have but about 20% of our grade back by then. We took one test weeks ago and it hasn't been returned yet. It's giving me so much anxiety wondering how I'm doing (I currently know 0% of my grade and we are half way through) This isn't normal to me. How much of your grade do you know by the drop date?",
