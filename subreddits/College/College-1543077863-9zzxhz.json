In fact, I sobbed the day I left high school, in front of probably fifteen teachers, and on the way home.\n\nNow I\u2019m a freshmen in college, I suck. \n\nI was bubbly at first, but soon I hated getting a hi wherever I went, even from people I don\u2019t know. I hate having to wake up early for a class that doesn\u2019t affect my major, like theology, just because my school is a catholic school. I don\u2019t talk to people, I give death glares. I don\u2019t even put on fresh clothes. I\u2019ll wear PJs for days at a time, to class, and sometimes even when I leave school for something like walking half a mile to pick up a pizza. I look like I\u2019m depressed, but I generally don\u2019t want to be bothered. All I do is sit in my dorm and listen to Eminem. \n\nOn most days, I just leave my dorm to shower, poop, eat, study at the library and go to class. I rarely participate in activities, even RA activities. I only go because of stuff like freshmen seminar. A lot of classes I was looking forward to I loathe and just want to get over. I don\u2019t even get the work done in some of them, because I\u2019m not used to the few times a week deadlines. In fact, I have a 2.9 because of that.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of money, or a car or license, and most of the cool stuff in my college town you need is far removed from cool stuff. Besides, my school is a commuter school, so on weekends, only people there are graduate students. I hate but at the same time love college. I miss the discussions we had in AP classes, but I love having my own room and being able to just talk to myself or say whatever I want without getting mad.
