  "text": "hey guys a few question so i\u2019m currently living away from school in a house but things came up and unfortunately i cant afford to live away from home anymore:( so my questions are\n\n1.  if i were to transfer to a school closer to home but i would still be in the same program would that mess up things with osap? \n\n2. i\u2019m also currently on academic probation so when they say you have to finish your current academic year does that mean the 2021-2022 year or the current year at that current school??",
