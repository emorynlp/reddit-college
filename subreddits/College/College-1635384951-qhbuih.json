  "title:": "Tired of people thinking introversion is bad and needs changing",
  "text": "So many think it is bad to be an introvert or quiet and if you aren\u2019t bubbly and super friendly that you are living life wrong and need to change. I think there\u2019s enough room in this world to have introverts too. I like being an introvert. Why do you all (people in general) assume that I am limited by my personality and assume I must want to change because I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not shy. I speak when I have something to say. I don\u2019t let fear get in my way if I want to accomplish something. Yeah, I will be more quiet that some others. I\u2019ll think before I speak and listen to what other people have to say. I see nothing wrong with that. I wish people would stop saying I need to \u201cbreak out of my shell\u201d. I\u2019m not a shy extrovert. I\u2019m an introvert and that is completely fine, in fact it is awesome. \nIt is not like we criticize extraverts as a society and insist they listen more and speak less, and need to \u201cbring things in\u201d. Both extraverts and introverts are good in their own unique ways.",

      "text": "So there's a common misperception about introversion. Introverts aren't shy and do not lack social skills. Being an introvert means you are content being alone with your own thoughts, you charge your social battery by getting alone time and you just happen to get overwhelmed in social events a bit easier and a bit sooner than extroverts. Introverts are actually deemed to be more effective communicators overall because they spend more time in conversations carefully listening and observing. And their responses are thought out. People tend to get introverts mixed up with those who have social anxiety or are shy.",

What people don't see is that I sleep like the dead afterward and usually spend the next day reading or playing games by myself. It's not that I don't go out, it's that I'm using my energy when I'm going out.",

It's totally fine to be spend more time with yourself, but that should never be an excuse to not be socially capable\n\nI'm not targeting you btw, this is just my general observation",

But hopefully people will realize that their fears are holding them back and want to grow as a person, but I know for some it takes them longer to get there. \nI think social skills are related but not entirely the same thing. I agree that we all should work hard to strengthen these skills because they are so important. \nBut we can also meet people halfway, we all adapt to different social situations, which means knowing how to communicate effectively not only with extroverts but people with communication or social skills difficulties too.",

      "text": "as someone who used to be an introvert until college and then became an extrovert i totally understand. i think people in general think if someone isnt doing great at making friends theres this immediate blame and that bothers me. some people struggle and dont find joy in striking up random conversations like others do. also, introvert by definition is how you **feel** around people, not act (though feelings effect actions). so by definition introverts prefer being alone. this means there can be outgoing introverts, or reserved/shy ones. sure shy is more common but both exist. i have many outgoing friends who you would never guess are introverts. i do agree that at some point one does have to at least try to get out there, but its also harder when you feel like you dont need that type of interaction (again, me in hs). long story short i agree and i also think people need to realize introversion isnt just \u201cshyness\u201d it\u2019s legitimately how human interaction makes you feel.",

Even with jobs that dont involve ppl interactions tho if youre not as bubbly as someone else in the interview \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f or with promotions if someone is being more buddy buddy talking nonstop with the boss \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Its an unfortunate fact of life i have accepted and been working on. Book smart is not enough . But i feel the pain of the original post, if you are smart and good at what you do, but lack social skills, it sux watching as other ppl pass you up cause of their personality more than anything else, but it is a skill.",
