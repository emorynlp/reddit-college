  "title:": "Is anyone else\u2019s school late on financial aid this quarter?",
  "text": "Hey everyone, so I\u2019m a Fall 2021 student and everybody at our school this quarter is still awaiting for their financial aid, it\u2019s almost a month past the tuition deadline but the school just keeps sending the same emails over and over again apologize for the delay and how they\u2019re still \u201cworking and reviewing and processing the award\u201d. It\u2019s gotten to a point where their phone voice mail is already full because everybody is asking where\u2019s the money. And keep in my mind we got an email all the way back around the beginning of August telling us that they\u2019ve already started processing the award. So basically it\u2019s been more than 2 months and nobody has gotten a penny yet. Has this been happening to any other schools? Honestly I\u2019m thinking somebody at the school probably took the funds and used it for their own benefits and now they\u2019re having trouble coming up and giving back the money. That\u2019s honestly how I feel right now. We got a temporary free 14 day access to all the important class materials but time is running out. And we\u2019re not paying cash. This is just crazy?",

Or maybe it\u2019s just not your administration\u2019s first priority although if that is the case that really sucks and they should be working harder on getting that out to you guys. Have they given any answers on when it should be ready or what\u2019s taking so long?",

                          "text": "Lol I\u2019m attending a small community college as well. All they\u2019ve told us is that financial aid will start to be disbursed starting 09/24. Which is obviously a lie and just an excuse to keep us waiting and stop asking them. And their excuse is that they\u2019ve recently transitioned into a new award system which could cause delays for the awarding process. Like yeah right, I\u2019m sure the IT department exist for a reason. And also you\u2019ve been working on this since the beginning of August. There is obviously something else going on. I just hope they\u2019re not as corrupt as I think they are.",
