(the midterm was only open during the day it was due.) I was unable to do the exam, and in the course syllabus it states, \u201cMake-up tests are given only if there is solid evidence of a medical or otherwise serious emergency that prevented the student from taking the exam\u201d. I wrote her an email stating my situation and offered to provide all documentation as necessary. My professor replied that since they went over the test during the following day\u2019s lecture, there is nothing I can do to make it up. \n\nMy grade went from an 85 to a 51. \n\nEDIT 1: So I should probably clear this up. I emailed the professor before the test was due, and she didn\u2019t respond. Then I followed up after the test was due. I also didn\u2019t make it to class where they reviewed the test, but the lectures are recorded so technically I could go look at the answers at any time.\n\nEDIT 2: Some of you are asking for the exact wording from my professor so here it is. The first email I sent, several hours BEFORE the test was due was where I explained my situation and stated that I would be unable to take the test on the given date and asked if I can make it up. To this I got no response. Then I sent a second email the next day asking again if I can make up the test in some way, as the syllabus says I should be allowed to. Professor replied to my email with, \u201cNo you can not make up the test. The solutions were covered in class. Thank you.\u201d\n\nHope this clears the confusion.\n\nIs there anything I can do in this situation? Can I message someone higher up in my college about this? I can\u2019t really afford to fail this class, especially not for a reason such as this.", "author": "mrcheese14", "created": 1604078334, "retrieved": 1632802110, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1098, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gb20w5p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jl0zgd/professor_wont_allow_me_to_makeup_a_midterm/gb20w5p/", "text": "First, go to your advisor.
