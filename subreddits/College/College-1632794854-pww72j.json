Any advice?", "text": "So I'm planning on graduating this May after working towards my bachelor's degree since 2018, which feels unreal. However, it's still not over and I still got a lot of work that needs to be done before graduating. But after studying all these years, I'm starting to get this feeling now that I never really had a problem with too much throughout these years. I've had my fair share of procrastination throughout my years of studying, but I never had it this bad. My grades aren't really doing too bad I'm still scoring well on my exams, but my productivity these past few weeks are just going completely down the drain. Has anyone had this problem in the past or is currently having this problem as well? Is there any strategies to better my productivity so I can make it through this last year?", "author": "CageSwanson", "created": 1632794854, "retrieved": 1632800145, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
