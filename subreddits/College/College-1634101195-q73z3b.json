  "title:": "Help me interpret my professor\u2019s message in terms of grading my assignments",
  "text": "I was supposed to turn in 2 essays Thursday (10/07.) But I asked my professor if I could turn them in Friday (10/08) and he said yes. Instead of turning them in Friday (10/08,) I turned them in Sunday (10/10/2021).\n\nWhen we turn in papers, we turn them in in person on Thursdays. And if we turn them in on blackboard, he always wants us to let him know that we did by sending him a message or email. I turned in the essays on blackboard Sunday (10/10) at 4 pm but I sent him a message today at 9 pm letting him know that they were on blackboard just as a reminder.\n\nThe text convo:\n* Me - I just wanted to remind you about the assignments I turned in on blackboard just in case you didn\u2019t know.\n* Him - I usually grade all of them at the same time on the weekends. Thanks.\n\nIn the past, whenever I let him know about an assignment I turned in on blackboard before the weekend, he has either said \u201cok. Thanks\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll probably get to it this weekend. Thanks.\u201d But this time I told him after the weekend and he sent me the message \u201cI usually grade all of them at the same time on weekends. Thanks.\u201d What do y\u2019all think his message means? Do y\u2019all think he\u2019s still going to grade them?\n\nHe has entered 0s before in the grade book for assignments I didn\u2019t turn in. But he hasn\u2019t entered a 0 for this one and my classmates told me her papers got graded already (her papers got graded last night which was on Monday, not the weekend, and they got graded 1 day after I turned in my assignments.)",

      "text": "Since you didn\u2019t turn in your paper when you said you would, he isn\u2019t obligated to give you a grade immediately.  He\u2019ll probably take longer to grade it because you turned it in after his grading period.\n\nWord of advice: always overestimate how long it will take you to do something.  It\u2019s not a good look if you say you\u2019ll do something and don\u2019t keep your word.",

      "text": "He is probably going to grade it later,due to how late it is. As a little advice please turn your work in on time,and you won't have to worry about when he will or if he will grade it. \n\nThe fact that he gave you a extra day( which is extremely nice and a lot of professors wouldn't give one),and you still turned it in late is very irresponsible. Please be more diligent in doing your work so you don't get any more zeroes,it will be good for you in the long run.",

      "text": "Seems like he just hasn\u2019t gotten around to grading them yet since you submitted them at the end of the weekend. \n\nOr he could be giving you a zero for handing the assignments in late depending on the policy for late assignments. I mean, yes, he did approve of your one day extension, but you failed short of that and really handed the assignment in three days late from when it was initially due.",
