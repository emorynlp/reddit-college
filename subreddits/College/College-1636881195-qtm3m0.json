  "text": "Its been around 3 months since school properly finished and 1 months since my entrance exams have finished(altho I didn't prepare properly for those, I still had them on my mind and was stressed too much about everything).\nCollege is starting next week and the orientation will probably take place this week, and I'm getting too much anxiety and I'm very scared about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna do and will I even be able to do anything or not.\nI have social anxiety but it goes on and off, sometimes I can confidently do anything but most times my heart rate increases and I start to shake and overthink and my head gets too hazy and noisy.\nProcrastinating and time management are also  problems I've been facing for long plus since covid occured and the whole lifestyle changed, I don't even know when a day starts and ends, a week starts and ends, and an year just goes by without me realising what is happening around me.\nI overthink things and I analyze things and come to conclusions but I forget them easily and so much that even if I decided to do something that would be good for me and that would make me happy, I forget it and if the chances are good then I remember it after a week or a month.\nI even made a plan on what subject I should study at what time(as in the subjects of first sem I should've studied them before the college started so that I could actually understand what is happening in the class since it becomes difficult for m to focus in online classes and making friends would also become difficult in online classes because it's not like we can talk during the breaks because we aren't even face to face) but I'm already failing to follow that plan.\nI'm very worried about everything.\nI had thought that school studies was something I couldn't control but since I'm conscious of everything before college has started, I would be able to keep everything in control but I dont even know what talent I have and who I am how will I make any friends or focus on studies or take part in clubs if I don't even know what my thing is.\n\nPlease give me advice on anything that you thought that it would've been better if you knew before going to college and also online college tips.",
