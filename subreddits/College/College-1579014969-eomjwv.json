But I still wanted so bad to graduate because if I didn't I just would have to kill myself (no graduation, no future). And I just wanted to quit school, an environment where I've always suffered as far as I remember (more mature, maybe high potential, bullying, rape, loneliness, mind abuse, blackmail...). \nBut in order to graduate when you have just the few notes of a (rare) generous classmates, you have to tackle the lessons very seriously. Yes I have facilities with school, but still, I didn't know how to work nor how to be motivated to do so.\nBasically, I learned how to work last year, and noticed that without going to school, I was able to learn 60-70% of the classes of the day in 3 hours (then I would just sleep because of my depression). I insist on the 60-70%. Why ? Because when you are in class, listen, take notes and participate, you learn 80-85% of the class ! Imagine, by just going back your lessons of the day during the evening for 30 minutes in total, you can lock those info. Personally, I memorise the better throught recreating the actions I do in class (speaking, writing), so I write resumes of my lectures (plus, my memory is still fresh so I can remember some extracts of the lecture).\nSo... Why stressing out one week before the grand finale when you can calmly do some quick revisions regularly ? ;) You would still be stressed of course, but during the test you would want to dance (well I'm very expressive xD).\n\nThe objective of doing a bit everyday is really to lock those info.\nThen, on my Sunday (I have classes in university from Monday to Saturday in my case), I just do a huge lerning session (3-4 hours depending on my subjects and the size of the classes). And I'm almost ready to face any tests.\n\nBut there's the question on how to be motivated to do so. Well, personally I love learning and doing things for school. Studying is my thing. But when I don't feel like it, I watch \"study with me\" and \"how to take notes\" videos. Those give me the will to do more and well, like just annotating my notes and write summaries of them.\n\n\nNB 1 : Please learn a bit on how to take notes, your notes are the basis of your learning journey. Everyone have its own, so find yours. Personally, I use the indenting and abreviation one, and one color per chapter. I'm not a visual learner, but at least I can associate a notion with 25 pages of the same color theme !\n\nNB 2 : Attitude in class is so important ! Par-ti-ci-pate. It's hard yes, but one question at the beginning of the class and one in the middle or at the end force you to be focus from A to Z. Even if it's not a question directly related to the topic.\n\nNB 3 : Which type of learner are you ? We are all intelligent in our own way. Kynesthesic, visual, writer, listener, speaker, reader... AND BE ACTIVE WHILE LEARNING ! Mostly if you have sciences or reflexion classes (bio, anatomy, economics, physics, politics, sociology...).\n\nNB 4 : time of work. Learn about the Pomodoro method. 30 minutes : work, 5 minutes : pause, etc. Adapt it to your need. Install Forest if you are tempted by your phone (you plant virtual and real trees with this app ! Double motivation !). Because if you do too much, sometimes you're just not effective anymore. \n\nNB 5 : feel very bad and depressed af one day ? S.K.I.P. It's okay, you're not in the good state of mind to do so.

Here's my two cents.\n\nI usually try to gauge how difficult my classes will be within the first few weeks of a semester. I try to break up my time a bit evenly at first and then start putting more time into the classes that feel more difficult to me. I also try to see what i can get away with (let's say, hypothetically, time consuming projects are only 15% of my grade and tests are 60%. I'll definitely put more time onto studying for tests in this case). \n\nI'm not the type of person to kill myself just to get all A's anymore. It simply isn't efficient for me to use that hectic approach since I have a more busy lifestyle. I learned that it's ok to lose a battle, but it doesnt mean I'm going to lose a war (i have yet to fail a single class. Note that im graduating the end of this current semester with a GPA around 3.5). \n\nHow much time do I study? It varies wildly. Some days i can put in 2-5 hours. Some days it's as much as 30 minutes. Some days are no study days because i either dont have the time or i ended up feeling brain dead and can't bother to pick up a book. Those days naturally happen so it's no big deal.\n\nWhat's important that people seem to forget is that regardless of how much time you study, your success depends on how efficient your studying is. \n\nLet's say you start reading a new chapter in your textbook. How many minutes go by before you doze off, go on your phone, or constantly rereading that same paragraph five times because you keep forgetting? Having those issues repeatedly add up and will dampen the quality of your study time. Put the phone away. Remove yourself from distractions. Get a timer and set it for 10 minutes. Read without disruption and resist the urge to lose focus. Did it work? Good. Now make it 11 minutes. Comfortable? Make it 12. You get my point.\n\nWhat's also important is to make sure you have a healthy lifestyle that allows you to be in the best shape possible overall. Eat healthy and stay away/minimally eat food that is bad for you. Exercise even if it's a day or two a week. Whenever Nikola Tesla came about with a problem he couldnt solve, he went for a walk for 30 minutes and the simple act of walking helped him tremendously. \n\nSLEEP. Sleep sleep sleep. Sleep is so damn important. You're no better off with 2-4 hours of sleep than a drunk person at 2am. Google \"Joe Rogan Experience #1109 with Matthew Walker\". Listening to that podcast changed the way i understood sleep and it was for the better. It's not to say i always get a good night sleep, but my sleep has improved. This simple act alone will help you tremendously.\n\nThat's pretty much it. I know it was a lot to throw at you, but everything i discussed are variables that i feel are important.

Try to find real world problems that require that field and go into office hours to talk to your professors ALL THE TIME. Seriously, dont be intimidated. They chose their job because they want their students to learn. If they're here to teach, perfect they want to teach. If they're a research professor, also perfect. Ask about their research, get real world problems from them.\n\n\nTo sum it up, review even if you know it because you want to create long term knowledge not short term facts.

If I have two exams on the same day, with one in the morning and one in the afternoon, I study for the morning test the night before, then spend the rest of the day studying for the afternoon class.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also have a tendency to study for other classes during lecture. The prime example would be studying for my Materials class during my Economics class. This is a matter of priority- I would never consider doing the opposite. The economics class was practically a blow-off for me, while Materials was a very challenging class. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Review notes and chapters before exams, do the homework completely by yourself, don't be afraid to study for one class during lecture for an easy class, and don't try and study for two subjects at once.", "author": "Dj_White_Gold", "created": 1579025780, "upvotes": 2}, "fee3oyr": {"link": "/r/college/comments/eomjwv/how_many_of_you_actually_study_on_a_regular_basis/fee3oyr/", "text": "I get up at 7 everyday, either grab coffee and do reading or just read in my dorm.
