  "text": "So I know if you start at a community college and finish your BA at university, your degree will have the final university name.\n\nThe question I have is:  if I take most of my classes at a lesser known name university, transfer my credits and take just my last few classes at a highly reputable college, can I get them to issue me the degree?\n\nI'm aware of the danger of credits not transfering. This is for curiosity purposes only.",

      "text": "If you finish your degree at a university they will be the one to issue the degree as long as you meet credit minimums. The tougher part is as you mentioned with transferring credits. Most of the time its no problem transferring over 100 level courses to jump ahead a year, but the further you get into the program the less likely it'll be that you can get the credits transferred successfully, I wouldn't plan on being able to transfer any more than 25 - 50% of a degree. And the bigger the \"gap\" is between the two colleges, the less the better one will accept.",

          "text": "I have zero intention of actually doing it. I guess that's why I didn't care about credit transfer.\n\nI just wondered that if I went to some low level college, did all but two classes, in a perfect world got all my credits transferred, and the last 2 classes take at Harvard, could I get my degree to say I graduated from Harvard, for example.\n\nI don't care enough to actually do that. It was just a genuine curiosity.",
