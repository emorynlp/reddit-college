  "text": "To start:\nI am a totally online student.\nI have a diagnosis of major depression.\nThe class is really fucking hard.\n\n\nI had a mental breakdown because of a senior level elective I don\u2019t even need (besides the senior level credits). I was bogged down with work and other classes and assumed this class was modular, so I let a lot of it slip by. Now, I want to catch up on late work and find out the professor is completely uncompromising.\n\n\n\nAt this point, I will get nothing back if I withdraw. I am on FAFSA and have the Pell grant. I also receive a scholarship that covers half of my tuition, but I need to be full-time. A large portion of my failure in this class is due to mental health issues. All of my other professors have been compromising and even helpful.\n\n\nIf I withdraw/fail, I think my scholarship will be revoked. I will end up owing more money than my pell grant and FAFSA will cover. What can I do?",
