      "text": "If you are presenting live in class, volunteer to go as soon as possible. If you're nervous about it (like most people are) the worst part is sitting there waiting for your turn. I always try to go first and it's a big relief to get it done and over with quickly.\n\nAlso, make sure you practice it a few times and time yourself. Every time I've had to give a speech I always have to cut out a bunch because I make it too long. 5-10 minutes is a lot shorter than you think once you're up there speaking.",
