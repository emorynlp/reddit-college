I thought high school Me was going to magically come back out again, but this time I acted just like college Me - Socially awkward, no sense of humor, difficulty paying attention to what was happening, constantly thinking about schoolwork, etc. It's like college has killed the old me and replaced it with an automaton who only exists to study for exams, work through assignments, etc. \n\nI miss the old me. I feel like college has ruined who I am by isolating me from other people for so long.

It's starting to piss me off because I don't want to just be a robot for the rest of my life. I feel like I'm no longer a real person.

I find this is very common as people have new life experiences. I\u2019m very lucky to have a few good friends from high school still but I live with one (same college), one I\u2019ve known since I was 7 and we work at the long distance thing, and the others go to different but local schools. I\u2019m still very close with these people but our relationships have definitely changed over time. That being said it sounds like you are struggling with college. Not necessarily the grade aspect but certainly from a stress management and social perspective. Try not to beat yourself up college is hard. I graduated cum ladue in high school came to college to find I had no friends, recently divorced parents, a major I hated and was doing badly in, too many credits (19 &18 yr 1) and failed a course.  College can be bumpy, but hang on to it and pick yourself up. I believe in you! College isn\u2019t easy for me and I don\u2019t think it ever will be, but I\u2019m back on my feet and it\u2019s manageable. The things I found the most helpful were:\n1. Getting a therapist \n2. I suck at making friends so going on trips with our outdoor resource center where I would be forced to be with strangers for extended periods\n3. On a similar note I went to Australia with ISV (international student volunteers) and studied abroad in Italy with a group of students from the art department at my school (I\u2019m a marketing and arts management major with art and art history minors)\n4.Scheduling my own classes (this sounds dumb but my uni tries to tell us what to take when and schedules for you freshman year... this royally fucked me over)\n5.

I\u2019ll share a bit about my own experiences too; hopefully, they\u2019ll help you out a bit.\n\nMy parents are both incredibly talented and successful in software, and I kinda grew up in the culture of being extremely analytical and calculating, but to me that was more messing around than anything else (things like trying to hack League of Legends so I could DDoS people in game - shitty, I know, but entertaining to do when you have nothing better to do.) It never really manifested to me as doing work until college, and once it did, I felt really out of touch with my HS friends - they were all too concerned with smoking weed and playing video games like we did in HS, and my life was different. Eventually, I started hanging out with them less and less, and now I see them at the library maybe once a month (doesn\u2019t have to be that way for you, necessarily, but it was for me.)\n\nWhat I eventually did was make new friends in CS who valued being successful in classes and all, just like I did, and that made me feel a lot more like I had a personality because I was surrounded by people doing the same thing. Eventually, I (tentatively) found my place in it and developed a clearer definition of what I want to do with my life.\n\nTo talk about you now, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re losing yourself so much as it sounds like you\u2019re changing - that\u2019s OK, and in fact is encouraged. Life only gets harder and harder for people who are trying to maintain the same version of themselves throughout their lives, because the problems that they deal with and the things that they\u2019ll need to be happy are always changing - especially in CS, a field that changes every 10 minutes on a slow day.\n\nSome others mentioned finding a new group of friends, and while that\u2019d work too, I also think there\u2019s something to be said for striking out alone (if you\u2019re the kinda person who that\u2019d be useful for.) \n\nI\u2019m all about  people moving through their phases in life; sometimes, when people are struggling to define themselves in a rapidly changing lifestyle, they\u2019re going to feel alone and as if they have no personality (I sure did.)

Another user talked about it earlier and that was pretty good. Joining another organization might help too (like someone else mentioned).\n\nBut I've definitely been where you are in terms that I feel college has drained my personality out of me. One thing I learned this semester is when it's okay to prioritize my mental health over school. I'm a biochem major who used to be pre-med, so I was studying a fuckton to the point where I barely saw anyone, even my roommate, unless I studied with them. Its so, so draining. One night I was like \"fuck it, I'm going out instead of writing this paper and I'll do it in the morning.\" I did pretty shitty on that paper, but because I was able to spend time relaxing the night before I was more focused on other work that I got a good grade on. You claim to not have time (as I often do too), but sometimes you need to be like \"fuck it, I know I don't have time but I need to take a break. I'm taking the L on this assignment because I need me time.\" \n\nI'm not sure what your grades are (no need to share), but irl it probably won't matter past you getting your first job. Most employers won't give too much of a shit about it. My dad works for a computer company as a manager (and has done so for 25+ years), and he once told me a story of someone who had a D or two in his classes, but was an A/B student otherwise. My dad still hired him despite others not wanting to hire him because my dad saw that although he didn't get the best grades in a few classes, he had the attitude of success. That dude turned out to be an amazing addition to the team and is now a manager also. The point is, one or two or even three bad grades won't kill you. \n\nYou also have mentioned feeling that guilt of doing something non-school related...I understand that wayyyy too well. I'm the exact same way! Its a hard feeling to de-program yourself from feeling that way. I don't have too much advice for this cause I'm still struggling with this guilt, but my \"fuck it\" attitude helps a bit. \n\nYou seem to not be in a great spot with your mental health. Like I said earlier, you need to say \"fuck it\" and go to counseling. Mental health is still health! If you ignore some symptoms of a cold, it might not affect your schoolwork now and so you don't take time out of your day to see a doctor. But when it turns out that its the flu and you need to be rushed to the hospital, you will lose more time for schoolwork than if you just said \"fuck it\" and went to the doctors earlier on. Same way with mental health! At the very least, start a journal. That has helped me in ways that I don't think a therapist ever could. You don't need to do it every day, but if you ever get anxious or stressed just say \"fuck it\", take a break for a few minutes to write down your feelings, and then get back to work. \n\nAre you even happy with your major? Something you're doing for the rest of your life absolutely shouldn't make you feel this miserable. You're so damn young, you have time to rediscover another pathway. \n\nAlso, I seem to have noticed that you go to A&M. May I suggest the safe ride program there as an activity to do? I am currently involved in the one at my college and its fucking great. I met a dude who was a part of both the one at A&M and my college's, and he said they're pretty similar. Don't let the fact that its a sober ride program into fooling you that the people are all conservative, non-drinking students...the ONLY people I go out to bars with are the ones who I met through that organization! It occurs at night so you'll be sacrificing a night of partying or whatever, but I find it worth it. Plus, it gives you a fantastic thing to talk about on your resume to make you as a person (not your grades) seem more interesting. I have so many people ask me about the program and are always impressed. This type of program isn't for everyone though as it sometimes can be a bit intense with driving late at night.\n\nAaaannddd thats the end of my wall of text. It was really long, but thats because I related too much. Idk if it helped, but I hope you takeaway at least one thing useful from this. \n\nEdit: grammar ", "author": "AceOfRhombus", "created": 1546679021, "upvotes": 24}, "edadty4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/acr2jj/i_have_lost_my_personality/edadty4/", "text": "I know this seems like a generic response, but try talking to a therapist or a psychiatrist about it.
