  "text": "Hey all. It's almost midterm week and I am dreading it. I haven't taken an in person exam of any sort since the first semester of senior year of high school. Now I am a sophomore in college. My first midterm is Multivariable Calc. I know the material and I will continue to study more, but I've never had test anxiety like this in my life. Any tips for that? Anyone else feeling this? How does an in person exam even work in college??",
