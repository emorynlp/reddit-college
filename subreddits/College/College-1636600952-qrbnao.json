  "text": "Hello everyone! So I need your view on some questions for an English assignment. If you could answer these following questions that would be greatly appreciated:\n\n1. What are your thoughts about using animals for testing and research?\n\n2. Do you think there should be limits to animal testing, such as not allowing it for cosmetics?\n\n3. What do you think some of the benefits are to using animals?\n\n4. Are you aware of the other methods of testing a product or vaccine? If so, how trustworthy do you think these are?",

Uh, that we don't kill people testing on them. That's the key one here.\n4. Testing a product? There's millions of methods. I'm not sure how to relate those methods to being 'trustworthy'.",
