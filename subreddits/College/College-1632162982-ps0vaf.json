  "text": "I have a Zoom class at 9 am, and my roommate is never awake so I have to go sit outside to have the class, which is not ideal. I'm kind of annoyed because I always adjust my schedule to make sure that she can have the room free during her classes, so I wish she would just wake up a little earlier so I could have mine. That feels really petty and selfish though. I guess I'm just frustrated overall because our sleep schedules don't align at all and I feel like I'm always the one to adjust for her, never the other way around.\n\nDo you think my annoyance is justified? I'm not going to say anything about it regardless, I'm just curious.",

It sounds like their schedules unfortunately just don\u2019t align well. That happens. OP\u2019s class attendance matters and OP shouldn\u2019t have to leave their room but the roommate doesn\u2019t deserve crap either for sleeping in. If they get upset about OP talking, that means they and OP need to have a conversation about it. If OP is catering around the roommate but the roommate doesn\u2019t know OP is catering, it\u2019s unfair to resent people for things they don\u2019t know about because for all we know if the situation were reversed, the roommate would take the class in the room and just figured OP prefers going someplace else.",
