  "text": "Last year, I made a decent amount of friends. However, I'm not the most outgoing and have a very low social battery. Drama ending up happening and I lost 2 friends. One friend just distanced for whatever reason (I'm guessing because they found other friends who interested them more), another I'm still really close with, and my ex who I'm still on good terms with but we don't hang out much. This semester, I've really only hung out with my close friend and my ex occasionally and that's it. My roommate this semester is pretty outgoing and an international student whose friends are all off-campus this year. I've attempted getting to know her, but she's made it very clear she doesn't find any domestic students interesting (me included which is fine, but still kinda stings). Mostly I've been hanging out in my room (mostly because my dorm is kinda far from everything) and working. I'm okay with this balance, but I feel the insecurity and loneliness I had last semester seeping in. Has anyone else really struggled with being alone in college? I know I'll get through it and I am also looking to transfer (kind of unrelated, but I don't feel like listing those very personal reasons here), but I am starting to feel really alienated. Most people I interact with hate being alone often and I usually enjoy my own company until I hear so many people complaining about it and saying it's kind of pathetic.",
