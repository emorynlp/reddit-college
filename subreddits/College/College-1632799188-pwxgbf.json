I've dabbled in a few coding projects but in all honesty it's not what I would want to do with my entire life. I chose this major because the majority of applications in the tech field I've seen wanted a Bachelor's in computer science, so I figured it would be a great overall degree for those of us who don't know what they want to do.   \n\n\nI currently work as a support analyst (tier 1) at a local company and I'm enjoying it so far, though, not sure this is exactly what I want to do forever, either.\n\nEither way. I'm currently having difficulties with calculus 1, and it's causing me great distress knowing that I have barely scratched the surface when it comes to the advanced math courses that comes with computer science.   \n\n\nHonestly, I'd really rather not drop out of college. Although I don't feel motivated whatsoever, I know I will absolutely regret not pushing myself to finish this and spiral into a lifelong depression because of it. Kind of in a catch 22 here.   \n\n\nIs there a tech major that's maybe not so math heavy but is widely accepted across many fields when dealing with computers? I'm currently working on getting my CompTIA certifications but again, I have an internal desire to graduate, I just don't think I can. I'm really not sure. I've had to get back on antidepressants and I'm being prescribed xanax for overwhelming anxiety and I'm not sure if I'm cut out for this.
