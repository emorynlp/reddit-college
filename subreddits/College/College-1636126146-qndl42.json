  "text": "Hello!! High school senior here!! I have a kind of low GPA, and I have 2 schools that I REALLY want to get into, but I\u2019m scared I won\u2019t. I just got accepted to a diff school with like a 95% acceptance rate so worst case I\u2019ll go there a year or two and then transfer. Has anyone also been in my situation? I feel like the biggest idiot in the world rn.",

      "text": "I got a D in Chem in HS and never took summer class to retake it, so I didn't get into the only 2 colleges I applied to. I ended up at community college then transferred to an even better university than the 2 I originally applied to. It's a completely normal and common thing to do, so don't feel bad! We are all human and sometimes life happens the way it does for a reason :)",
