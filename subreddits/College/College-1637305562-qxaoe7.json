  "title:": "Is Anyone Else Screwing Up Their GPA Due To Depression?",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently at the halfway point of my associate arts degree(2.75 GPA right now). It's not as awful as some other horror stories I\u2019ve heard, and that I\u2019ve got time to change it. But God, being a traumatized CSA victim while having no money or time for a therapist is absolutely awful. I know there could be resources out there, but I'm not sure if I qualify for them. \n\nIs anyone else experiencing this? I would love to hear some tips that could help me out from people in a similar situation.",
