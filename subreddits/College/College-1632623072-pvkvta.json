If you know this school you may be aware of the prestige it has and how well regarded it is. I'm here to ask you all what is considered a good grade. I'm asking this because in High school I was an average student, I failed 5 times in multiple math subjects and didn't put much effort in class. Now, I'm in the process of becoming a better student, I'm studying Law and doing way better than i did High school. But i noticed that I get really down when I achieve an 85 (on a 0/100 scale) because I feel it's an average grade. My general grade rn it's between 85-90/100 and I wanted to ask you if you would considered this as a good grade. Sorry in advance if this isn't the appropriate sub/reddit to post this. Hope you have a great day you all.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIt's 85-90/100 a good grade or is it averge (Law Student)", "author": "DaFranco45", "created": 1632623072, "retrieved": 1632800311, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hearz99": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvkvta/what_is_considered_a_good_grade/hearz99/", "text": "C's get degrees.\n\nOne thing you have to understand is that in life you will not always succeed in everything you do and you have to be ok with that. I apply the same logic in school.\n\nWould it be great if I aced all my classes? Hell yeah. But that's not always the case, either the subject I don't understand at all, or the professor is difficult or sometimes other classmates screw you over.
