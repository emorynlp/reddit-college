  "title:": "Last semestre of Master Degree, can't fucking follow a lesson if my life depended on it",
  "text": "Title.\nI was never the most efficient or dedicated student in class, I have always prefered to study from home or on my own but... Goddamn, once I could follow lessons at least. \n\nNo, it's not being used to covid remote lessons. \nI just can't follow the lessons overall. I get distracted and It feels like the teachers are cramming 6 hours worth of lesson in barely 2. \nAnd their slides suck, they have less than half of what I would truly need to follow the lesson. \n\nIf I didn't have mandatory presence, I would skip them entirely.\nWhat the hell is wrong with me all of a sudden? It's a relatively common experience?",
