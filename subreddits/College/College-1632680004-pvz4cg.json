I literally feel almost like I want to puke from it. I am in this college algebra class that has an emphasis on transitioning to calculus (so not a base level college algebra class) and I feel like this class is gonna be rough and I'll be lucky to get a B, I am currently struggling in it despite putting in a lot of effort. I am so stressed with keeping up my GPA to transfer to a competitive university because I feel like if I don't I'll have a way harder time with job prospects or being competitive for a FAANG company \\[which i'd really like to work for\\]. I am honestly just so depressed and even as I am typing this I feel an onset panic attack coming on. This class has made me feel quite dimwitted and I cannot emphasize enough how much impending doom I feel from all of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any helpful advice/words? Have you guys been in my position before?", "author": "Sunbro888", "created": 1632680004, "retrieved": 1632945593, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hee6vd4": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvz4cg/mental_health_degrading_from_college_stress/hee6vd4/", "text": "yes college , work , this website , other people just everything. life is one gigantic aids bukkake fest and i want to grab chunks of my hair and pull them out screaming nothing short of primal.", "author": "cute_diplomat", "created": 1632689944, "upvotes": 2}, "hedsu30": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvz4cg/mental_health_degrading_from_college_stress/hedsu30/", "text": "This may or may not help, but don't worry, since 4.0s get rejected from competitive unis too. What seems like the best strategy would be to build up your computer science resume during your time at community college as well (and feel free to let the gpa drop to 3.8-3.9 at minimal consequence). This way, your outside involvement can help your transfer applications out. And, if you don't end up getting that competitive uni, you'll still have a good resume for you to land \"faang\" tier internships -> faang tier full time.", "author": "YingkaiLee", "created": 1632684223, "upvotes": 2}, "hedqga3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvz4cg/mental_health_degrading_from_college_stress/hedqga3/", "text": "If you can reach out to a school councillor they may be able to offer you some advice \ud83d\udc99 in the mean time, try to do something nice for yourself!

I cannot possibly imagine how stressed and scared you are feeling right now. But I will do my best to give you some comfort. \n\nI graduated highschool with a 3.6 gpa, I chose to go into a community college, my GPA is now 3.2. \n\nYou are doing really well. Remarkably well. But at the end of the day, you need to pursue something that you can see yourself waking every morning to do. Make sure you are doing what you want and it will make those classes worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother thing, try your best to NOT take too many courses. if it takes you another 2 years to get your BA or another year for your AS, that's ok. The time passes anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, math is rough. It is absolutely horrible if you are doing it alone and for the first time. My best advice is to use websites like Chegg or Brainly and form a really good study group. I don't care if your anxious ass is scared to talk to your classmates, I want you to say, \"hi there, my name is x, I really need help in this class and was wondering if you would like to make a discord chat for our class. I PROMISE. It helps. It helps so much. Even if people don't share the answers, they share frustrations and you will feel so much less alone.\n\nPlease reach out around you, chances are, there are a dozen kids who wish they could connect and help each other. No one is as confident as they appear. Especially those who are good at math. If you use canvas for your class, you can send an inbox message to everyone in your class with a discord link!", "author": "Cup_O_Tea_For_Two", "created": 1632680648, "upvotes": 10}}}
