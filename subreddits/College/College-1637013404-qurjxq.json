  "text": "Has this happened to anyone else? I called the financial aid office and haven't heard anything. I'm at a community college so I don't have any loans just fafsa. They don't send checks they just deposit it into my account so it's not like I can reject the money. I'm also afraid to spend it because I'm really not sure it's mine. My school also sent me an email teing me they were sending me money with no extra details of where it was from or why I'm getting it. Something feels off though because it seems too convenient. Anyone got any advice?",
