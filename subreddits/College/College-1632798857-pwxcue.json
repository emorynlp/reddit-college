Now that I am in college, this is not working out so great and I don\u2019t think I know how to approach turning acquaintances into friends. I worked at a customer service job that requires Trader Joe\u2019s or Lush level friendliness so I am good at forming acquaintances but I completely struggle after that. I hate and suck it at vulnerability and struggle to behave in a way that is not \u201cscripted.\u201d \n\nAll that to say, I am not sure what is the appropriate (not weird) way to text/talk to an acquaintance or class friend about things that are not related to the class or the context in which you met them?", "author": "sharmud21", "created": 1632798857, "retrieved": 1632945467, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"hekli4x": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwxcue/how_to_turn_class_friends_into_friends/hekli4x/", "text": "Start with study group\u2026hey do you wanna go get drinks/food afterward?\u2026or like have you checked out XYZ activity on campus?
