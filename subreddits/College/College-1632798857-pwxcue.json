Now that I am in college, this is not working out so great and I don\u2019t think I know how to approach turning acquaintances into friends. I worked at a customer service job that requires Trader Joe\u2019s or Lush level friendliness so I am good at forming acquaintances but I completely struggle after that. I hate and suck it at vulnerability and struggle to behave in a way that is not \u201cscripted.\u201d \n\nAll that to say, I am not sure what is the appropriate (not weird) way to text/talk to an acquaintance or class friend about things that are not related to the class or the context in which you met them?", "author": "sharmud21", "created": 1632798857, "retrieved": 1632800134, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
