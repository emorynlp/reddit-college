Literally paired up with the kids that didn\u2019t care, lazy or just bailed out last second due to \u201cillness\u201d or \u201cfamily issues\u201d. (Yes, I remember one group team literally skipped school that day and I ended up having to present all by myself. They still got full points despite not showing up) My parents got so sick and tired of group projects (because they ended up helping me) that they begged teachers not to pair me up with anymore team projects during my senior year of school. They told me in college if I end up with a group project, do a Hail Mary on the project as \u201cyou can\u2019t rely on others but you can rely on yourself.\u201d \n\nWell\u2026. Ended up going through the same thing again. Last minute scrambling and I know major points will get docked. I\u2019m literally upset once again. My professor doesn\u2019t care despite emailing them 2 days prior to the project being due. They told me \u201cI have to be a team player\u201d and all that jazz. What\u2019s the point of group projects when they don\u2019t even reply back or plan out something? I waited one day at a coffee shop and nobody showed. Nobody! I\u2019m beyond frustrated with this specific class as the professor doesn\u2019t understand about personal lives and what not. I\u2019m tired and my anxiety has been sky rocketed all day. I took a major hit on my other classes investing time into this project (worth 30% of my grade) so I\u2019m just behind on everything. \n\nAnyone else just absolutely hate group projects??", "author": "iamahugeliarregret", "created": 1632870134, "retrieved": 1632945361, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "comments": {"hep3pne": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxi8ht/anyone_else_hate_doing_team_projects/hep3pne/", "text": "God. \n\nI can\u2019t wait for my term to start so i can make one of these posts out of frustration.
