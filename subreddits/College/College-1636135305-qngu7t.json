  "text": "Hey all, \nI posted here yesterday asking for advice about an RA interview and just got finished with it. \nI\u2019m concerned that it was to short to fully express why I wanted the position and all that. The interview lasted for about 10 minutes, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s average time for a interview. \nDoes anyone know if I should worry about it being that short?",
