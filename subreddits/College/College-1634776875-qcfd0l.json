  "text": "I have done dual-credit high school and came out confident in my academic performance holding a spot in the top 10 of my class. However, being in full-time college is quite the white truck of death and i seem to be the victim under it. I\u2019m bombing my two 4-credit classes (the important ones) and i\u2019m wondering if this is how freshman year hits everyone. How was your first year of college and was there a good recovery to where you are now? (STEM student btw, biochemistry)",

      "text": "The material gets harder but it will feel more manageable. Freshman year is a really stressful time and although the material you learn is easier, I was probably the most stressed then. As a freshman, the college format is still very new and some of the intro classes are made to be difficult to weed out students. Do not let this discourage you. My freshman year sucked in terms of stress and although i am talking more advanced classes now, I feel like i have found my bearings and can manage much better.",
