  "text": "I'm asking for those people who were always considered as stupid students for their whole life (from elementary to highschool) and how did you guys change that in college? \n\nWhat has motivated you? How do you stay discipline (i know discipline is something very hard for those below average students).\n\nI would love to receive your personal advice and listen to your personal experience!",

      "text": "-Be easy on yourself. Just because something difficult for you is easy for someone doesn\u2019t make you stupid. You\u2019ll find out eventually you have a different strength from others. Being competitive is good as long as it is healthy and you wouldn\u2019t make it a reason to look down on yourself. \n\n\n-You can have a different reputation in college. You know how the social structure in high school works. Once you\u2019re placed in a certain social class, it\u2019s difficult to switch classes. When you\u2019re in college, you meet different people unlike in high school where you become familiar with almost everyone. In college you can explore and that can help you get to know yourself and motivate you to do better\n\n\n-Think of college as the final chapter before entering adulthood. When you feel lazy, remind yourself that you won\u2019t ever pass this stage of your life again. This is your last chance to make the most of your life as a student. \n\n\n-Find the fun in everything. Enjoy learning. Never think of studying as a chore. It\u2019s easier to check on your socials instead of working on your tasks right? Think of learning as something that will greatly contribute to your life. The things you will learn from studying are more valuable than the things you will see on your socials (like updates from friends which can wait).",

It's silly. \n\nIt takes the exact same amount of work to get things done before hand. It's not like being punctual with deadlines is any harder at all. It just occurs at an earlier time, that's the only difference. \n\nI found that my experience and well being is improved an ungodly amount if I simply stay ahead. I'm not working harder at all but my stress is gone. When I have an assignment that creeps up and starts getting close, I get stressed. It's such an easy problem to fix if you've got a little discipline. \n\nOh, the other guy saying the grind is life is correct. I worked a decade before coming to school. The grind is life. It won't stop so you better get used to it. There's no time where you're ever done. It never stops.",
