I thought I had no choice and went to 4 face to face classes that were only 10 mins apart after they ended when I specifically asked for online classes. It sucked because I had to drive to the other side of campus.",

Breaks decided by the professor during a longer class period are up to the professor.\n\nAt least that\u2019s how it is in the US.",
