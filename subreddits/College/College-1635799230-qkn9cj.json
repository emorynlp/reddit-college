  "text": "So in sophomore year (2018/2019) of high school, I started caring about band a lot more. Got 3rd chair in symphonic band (the top band of our school\u2019s 2 spring concert bands; the other was concert band), and I was proud of myself since I wasn\u2019t that good in middle school. Freshman year I was 7th chair in that band (I was originally 6th but we do challenges so my friend Lydia challenged me and beat me because she did better on the sight reading portion of the challenge). Anyways so I really started to like band and I got a step-up clarinet (an actual real wooden clarinet) because my band director told my parents I was ready for one (they normally did step-ups during 7th grade but back then I sucked and I didn\u2019t really care for one). I liked it so much I decided I wanted to be a music major when I went to college. I kept that decision throughout my junior and senior years too. Junior year I got 2nd chair (3rd originally but I challenged Lydia and finally won; she had won both times freshman and sophomore year) and I made our district\u2019s honor band (got 21st chair since it was my first time trying out) and went to the honor band clinic. It was fun even though Dixieland Jazz Funeral was like the only song I liked and the only one that was actually fun to play (because it had Oh When The Saints Go Marching In in part of it). Senior year I got 2nd chair again (my friend Jazmin who beat me was my new rival since Lydia quit band; Lydia was taking a lot of AP classes so she didn\u2019t have time for band). Made the district honor band again and got 2nd chair but the clinic was cancelled due to COVID (although Mississippi State had their honor band but spread out and everyone played with slit masks on, and I\u2019m pretty sure ICC\u2019s gym was big enough to spread everyone out. However I understand the risks posed as we couldn\u2019t get the vaccine yet and we probably wouldn\u2019t sound as good playing spread apart). When I went to college band camp, I was nervous on the first day because I didn\u2019t know anyone except for the people that went to my high school. I hated it at first but I started meeting new people and loved it. I was excited to be a music major because I had new friends that were music majors and the chair of the music department goes to my church (she does the children\u2019s choir there) so we\u2019ve known her since I was little. But the workload has just caused me to be stressed. It\u2019s like I\u2019m struggling to get things turned in on time in my required classes. Music Theory is hell. It\u2019s so hard for me and I just don\u2019t think I can handle any more of it. I mean I have friends in the class (many of them are in Symphonic Band with me for the spring semester) but I just don't like it. I don\u2019t think music is the right path for me. I love my clarinet and I love band because I\u2019ve been on some fun trips (we went to Atlanta for the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game and that was fun because I got to explore parts of Atlanta I didn\u2019t see when I went 5 years ago such as riding the SkyView Atlanta Ferris Wheel and eating at a Waffle House for the first time\u2014please go eat at one it is SO GOOD!; I also went to Auburn for that game this past weekend and I got to explore the campus there some and it\u2019s a beautiful campus!). But it\u2019s like it\u2019s turning into a job. Me and some of my friends joke all the time in piano/keyboard class that we sold our soul to the music department. One of the kids in that class said he was changing his major because he couldn\u2019t handle it (and I think another is changing to journalism). And honestly I want to as well. But I feel awful because I have 2 scholarships (one for music majors and one for band; I plan on staying in band because it\u2019s fun) and I already registered for classes for the spring semester. My grandmother suggested I should be a political science major since I used to watch the news a lot last year and this year (but that was mainly because since I was voting in the 2020 election, my mom said I needed to be educated on the candidates since it was my first time voting). Political science honestly sounds more fun than music. Like I enjoy going to the recitals for my student recital class (a class where you have to attend 4 daytime and 4 evening recitals) because I like hearing my fellow students playing their instruments. But I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the right path for me (contrary to what I thought in high school). My parents though are probably gonna be really upset with me because I\u2019m receiving 2 scholarships and I\u2019ve already of course picked my classes for next semester. But I just don\u2019t enjoy music as much as I thought I was going to (and it\u2019s just the workload that I don\u2019t like but still, the workload is what\u2019s stressing me out) and to sum this long post up, I just really want to change my major.\n\nAnyways sorry about the long post. Hopefully someone out there is able to relate to my struggles of finding the right path for myself.",
