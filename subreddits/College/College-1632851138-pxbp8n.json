  "title:": "Worried that I will regret program change",
  "text": " I'm a first year university student and I've felt the need to be in a program that leads to a more straightforward career. I was originally going to go for business technology management but then switched to economics last minute because I read there are good job opportunities and I enjoy social sciences, not a business person at all. The problem is economics is quite math heavy and I realize I have no motivation to learn any more math. I've always been average at math and never enjoyed it that much and I want to enjoy my university experience, not stress myself out everyday doing something I don't like. It's especially stressful with my anxiety issues since I have a hard time focusing so I already dropped it with plan to take it in the winter if I continue with econ. I kinda want to switch to a bachelor of arts in history though since that's my true passion and I'm good at it but I'm worried I'll regret it if I can't find a good job with good pay. I'm kinda lucky though because I won't have a bunch of student debt since my province gives out decent grants.",
