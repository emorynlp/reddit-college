She got home around early morning and just had time to sleep a few hours before heading to school. Obviously, she didn\u2019t have time to do any of the homework. \n\nWhen she went to class, she told the teacher in private that she hadn\u2019t been able to complete her assignment from the night before but could turn it in after lunch.
