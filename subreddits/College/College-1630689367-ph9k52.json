  "text": "Just an observation I had. I dont know if other people also feel this but college professors actually talk and sound like normal human beings. Some of my high school teachers and even middle school teachers were the most stuck up, obnoxious, egoistic people you would ever meet always pushing this weird superiority complex over students. Like its not even just plain \"strict\" its this kinda unpleasant demeanor that just repelled everyone away from them.\n\nCollege professors talk normal. If you ask them a question, the genuinely respond with interest and care. I guess this varies but I've learned from 7 professors/lecturers now",

      "text": "Yep, high school teachers were worse than my college professors. In high school, a girl in my class had a brother who had a medical emergency one night. She was the only one home that day so she had to drive her brother to the hospital. Plus, as the only one in her family who spoke English, she had to be on standby at the hospital to translate for the doctors. She got home around early morning and just had time to sleep a few hours before heading to school. Obviously, she didn\u2019t have time to do any of the homework. \n\nWhen she went to class, she told the teacher in private that she hadn\u2019t been able to complete her assignment from the night before but could turn it in after lunch. The teacher looked at her and asked why she couldn\u2019t take the assignment with her to the hospital. She gave her a zero on the assignment and told her that her brother had nothing to do with her class.",

People tend to hire people who are like them, the people elect the school board who hires the superintendent who hires the principal who hires the teachers. So if you have a city or town who is more traditional then you will have teachers like this whereas in other places teachers will be more chill. Same with colleges, I'll bet there are some colleges where the professors are much more strict, but usually colleges have a much bigger pool of candidates to hire from who come from a variety of backgrounds.",

Some will be good students, but the majority don't care for the class and don't care for learning in general. That attitude shifts at uni where everyone is there because they WANT to be there. \n\nLecturers know that when they're speaking with students, they're speaking with people genuinely interested in the subject. \n\nAlso, uni tries to promote an egalitarian culture that isn't rigidly bound up in informal hierarchy (don't get me wrong, there's a LOT of formal hierarchy, but informally it's egalitarian).",

              "text": "> More like, people under the age of 18 are not respected by adults. Once someone becomes \"an adult,\" they start to gain respect from other adults.\n\nFor what it's worth, most people over the age of maybe 25, in my experience, tend to feel as if 18 and 19 year olds are child-like. Unfortunately, it's usually kind of obvious that they're new at the \"adulting\" thing. There's nothing wrong with that of course-- we all started somewhere-- but I don't really think adults quite see 18 year olds as their equals yet. The thing is that reasonable people realize that a person can't learn to act like an adult unless you place adult expectations on them and treat them like an adult. Treating an 18 year old like an adult is the \"adult\" thing to do (in my opinion). Honestly, it bothers me that high schools treat 16/17/18 year olds like they're children, since kids that age are more than ready for many adult responsibilities and privileges, but I don't make the rules at high schools, so what I think doesn't matter.\n\nI will also add that I know many professors and many k-12 teachers, and k-12 teachers can often be quite childish themselves and this bleeds into the way they treat their students. As u/ProfessionalEngine50 said, \n\n> Some of my high school teachers and even middle school teachers were the most stuck up, obnoxious, egoistic people you would ever meet always pushing this weird superiority complex over students.\n\nSadly, this is true in my experience. Many teachers are just plain immature people that you just wouldn't want to be around. I don't know if the average undergrad realizes this, but the bar to becoming a full professor is much, much, much higher than the bar to becoming a k-12 teacher. Becoming an adjunct is pretty easy, though, but those full time professors generally had to jump through many hoops to get to where they are today, and those hoops often require a level of intelligence and maturity that 99% of high school teachers wouldn't be able to reach. \n\nNeedless to say, someone who is intelligent and mature is usually (but not always) going to treat young people more respectfully than your random k-12 teacher who probably doesn't put much thought into how he/she treats people.",

                  "text": "I do agree that 18-19yos need to be given responsibility in order to learn to manage it, but I think that does have some limits. If something is super important to me and my life and I stand to suffer pretty severe consequences if it goes wrong, I can\u2019t give that to a random 18-19yo to handle. They\u2019re still learning and there\u2019s still a massive risk that they\u2019ll fuck it up (that\u2019s how we learn!). \n\nIt\u2019s the exact same as how you wouldn\u2019t put a little kid on a street racing bike designed for an adult with more control, you wouldn\u2019t put a learner driver in the Grand Prix, and you wouldn\u2019t drop a new swimmer in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Experience and responsibility has to come in doses and you have to prove that you can handle the current level of responsibility before you\u2019ll be given more. People aren\u2019t trying to be assholes when they\u2019re apprehensive about 18yos, they\u2019re just being realistic on a population level. \n\nI\u2019d rather we treat 18-19yos for what they are: new, young adults who *generally* lack experience being an adult and *generally* need additional guidance. Ideally, there should be a legal transition period where you get more freedom and responsibility than a 4yo but haven\u2019t been left entirely to your own devices like a 50yo.",
