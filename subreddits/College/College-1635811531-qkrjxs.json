      "text": "It depends on your specific school\u2019s program but honestly at the undergrad level psychology programs are supposed to be pretty general, there\u2019s a lot of different kinds of psychology and they want you to have a foundation for different graduate programs which are more specialized (though some programs do offer concentrations at the undergraduate level). I think my degree only required one abnormal psych type class (though obviously you could take more). As you get to junior/senior year you\u2019ll probably have more freedom and you can choose classes more related to your interests. My school had electives related to counseling techniques and stuff. It\u2019s still pretty early for you but you can start looking into counseling masters\u2019 programs if you\u2019re interested.",
