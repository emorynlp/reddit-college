  "text": "Tested positive for COVID and I have a presentation next week. Sent an email to my professor and she told me if I had a documented emergency that she would allow me to do it via zoom. So I told her I was positive and now she sent me an email that because of me ,she will now do class over zoom. I know it\u2019s my fault and all. But when I went to class I didn\u2019t have symptoms until the next day. The main point here, is that her email sounded very aggressive and rude. Like I know it\u2019s an email but the tone of it sounded very blameful.\nAny suggestions on what to email back lol? \nWould\u2019ve like some compassion or something.",
