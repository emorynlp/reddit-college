  "text": "Hi! I am currently looking for a thesis topic relating in Civil Engineering. My group and I had proposed quite a number of topics to our adviser but aside from being rejected, our okayed topic is quite too 'okay only' that even us are not quite satisfied to proceed to do it. So I am hoping if you could give me some topic or outline of any problem that you know that might be answered by Civil Engineering work. Thank you. \n\nNOTE: Please highly take consideration the possibility for the project to be done in a specific time and price. Thank you. \u2764\ufe0f",
