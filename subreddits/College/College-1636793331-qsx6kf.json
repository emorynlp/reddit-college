I am saying this because i have had people telling me exactly the same during my graduate studies, while their parents still funded their studies so their only job was to study, but i had to work full time and also study in full time program. \n\nPeople also mature in different paces. That person you see failing their classes might also be trying to cover this knowledge they lack from high school in same time. While yes, there is also a portion of lazy busy bodies, this portion is actually low. I don't think someone really wants to lose their time by doing something that pointless, unless they just do it as an excuse to say that they are doing something while lazing around. \n\nBut you can never know that.

This is why I was curious, I'm not trying to ask for sympathy or I was trying to judge anyone, not myself.  It takes me much longer to get things done and this can snowball things when you're a college student.  I'm genuinely curious as to if I'll ever be able to actually function using what I got by going to college.  I want to know because I want to pivot if need be so I'm dont waste my life fighting a battle I can't win.\n\nedit: ya, not sure why we're all so offended here\n\nedit: imagine if I chose to put \"i\", instead of went with \"they\"... i wonder if you would've commented then \ud83e\uddd0",

You sound like you really are determined to go through college and learn, so don't worry, you will find a way through.\n\nAs for ADHD, i have it too. When i attended college, i did some paperwork at the secretariat, presented a copy of my diagnosis, and was given some \"accommodations\", like extra time on tests and extra verbal exam after having taken the test, on the questions on the test, with the notes that i took during the test. You could maybe look if college you attend offers those accomodations. They make tests a lot easier to handle for sure.\n\nSure ADHD can affect some things, but everyone needs their own time to process stuff. People aren't one pace serves all. We all have different learning paces.\n\n You may have seen that \"meme\" where different animals, including a fish in a bowl, a dog, a horse and a monkey are judged just by their ability to climb a tree. That's how educational system sadly works.  People of one specific learning pace thrive in it with ease, while the rest have to work harder to have some result. That doesn't mean you won't make it though. \n\nAlso as a person who has already been in the workforce on something relevant to my studies for a couple of years, yes, what i learnt in college helped me to an extent, but most stuff i learnt on the job. College gives mostly theoretical knowledge. The practical knowledge that will be more useful for working is learnt on the job.\n\nAs for the IQ, i think you are being hard on yourself again. The way you are writing doesn't indicate a person with low IQ ...\n\nIf you keep working hard, you will succeed! After all, as the old story with the Tortoise and the Hare taught us, \"slow and steady wins the race!\".",

Practical learning was easier, at least from my point of view, because everything i was learning had a purpose and a practical explanation now. Plus the result is much more directly visible, than when in theory.\nEveryone starts somewhere though. Don't expect to be handed the manager position the moment you apply for first job. No one is given that from the beginning, no matter how well they did at college...Life is an endless learning experience after all. We work, learn, progress and grow.

Anyone who cannot think of at least *one* of these reasons is lacking in perspective, at best.",
