(Even though I got a frigging A!) \n\nDoes anyone else have this issue? Like even when you do really well, you still think you could have done a lot better? I feel like I need to nip this in the bud or else I'm going to be crazy burned out. \n\nHope everyone's week is going well!", "author": "designingwoman", "created": 1632322532, "retrieved": 1632946562, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "comments": {"hdvztlk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pt98xq/how_to_cut_my_self_some_slack_when_it_comes_to/hdvztlk/", "text": "Yes, I\u2019ve had this issue all my college life.

The 3rd place winner realizes that had they been a bit slower, they wouldn't have placed at all, so they are proud.\n\nBut the 2nd place runner feels as though if they tried just a *little bit* harder, they would've gotten first place. \n\nI will try to find the literature & send it to you.
