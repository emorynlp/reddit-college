We don't have to wake up at 6 or 5:30 in the morning, we don't have to eat at a specific time, AND we don't need to ask for permission to go to the bathroom during class. Plus it's so much easier to make new friends. Maybe that's just because we're older and therefore feel less awkward when it comes to making new friends, but also it's because we're meeting people outside of the school zoned district where we're stuck with almost the same kids for 13 years, so you get a chance to meet more people.
