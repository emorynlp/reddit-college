  "text": "So I transferred over a credit from my local community college to my university. The rules were for me to get it evaluated first by that department, send in my transcript, then send it to my advisor so she can actually put it in. \n\nI did do all those things and was surprised when I looked on my University transcript and saw the credit was accepted because I didn\u2019t get notice back from the department after submitting it into their mailbox. I ended up calling my advisor and asked her if there\u2019s anything else I need to do since the credit is already in my transcript, and she said no. \n\nLater down the line, the person in charge of the course department, emailed me saying she didn\u2019t see my documents until now because she was working remote, and she didn\u2019t accept the course. \n\nHowever when I look on my university transcript,  I still received credit for it. Should I turn in this information to my advisor?",
