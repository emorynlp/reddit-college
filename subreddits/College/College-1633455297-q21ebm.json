      "text": "Faculty here.\n\nIn general, no.  You should feel free to go to office hours and ask whatever questions you need to.\n\nThe only caveat is a situation where you show up at office hours and other students are there too.  In that case, the general etiquette is to allow as many different people as possible to ask their question.  So if you show up and try to ask 20 questions such that the other students can hardly get a word in, then in that case you might be asking too many questions.  Same goes for lectures.  Asking questions is completely fine, but you shouldn't interrupt the professor every 60 seconds to ask something; the professor has to get through a certain amount of material in the lecture, and it just isn't possible to entertain unlimited questions.",

Using office hours, is part of that. So go for it, whether you're a nuisance to your prof or not.",
