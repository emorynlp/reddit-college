  "text": "I\u2019m on mobile so excuse the formatting. My boyfriend goes to an expensive private college. He was a mechanical engineering major and recently switched to aerospace. I\u2019m a senior and he\u2019s a junior. The whole time he\u2019s been in college he\u2019s aced every exam. He has straight A\u2019s and literally never studies. His exams, however, are open note for every test. He gets to use all his notes. The content still looks very difficult. It looks like a foreign language. I\u2019m so proud of him and how smart he is. I can\u2019t wait to see what his future holds and hope I can be a part of it too. That being said, I\u2019m totally jealous of his natural talent! \n\nI\u2019m an allied health science major. I struggled through anatomy and physiology, organic chem, and microbiology because it was a lot of info at once. I\u2019m not great at studying and lack time management. I still was able to pull A\u2019s in a&p and orgo I. Microbiology was rough and the professor was actually let go last semester for repeated complaints from students. Just a little bit of information so you guys can understand why I\u2019m asking. \n\nI\u2019m definitely envious of his ability to ace everything. How does he do it? I thought engineering was supposed to be one of the hardest majors. My engineering friends at my school study a lot for exams and still fail. He definitely has a natural talent, but how on earth do you get an A on a thermodynamic exam you\u2019ve never studied for? Do all the exams being open note really make it \u201ceasy\u201d enough to warrant no studying?",
