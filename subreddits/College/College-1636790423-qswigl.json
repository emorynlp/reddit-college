  "text": "I have A's and B's this semester but I feel like I might end up with a D or C for my elective course. If I do really good enough, there's a chance I can get a B perhaps but idk. Unless I don't, I'm afraid it might bring my GPA down or it won't increase enough if I get a D or C. Since I'm trying to better and increase my GPA, if get a D or C for this class by the end of the semester, should I just withdraw from it?",
