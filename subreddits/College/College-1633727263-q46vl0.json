  "text": "I\u2019m a sophomore nursing major and this is my first year living on campus and I lowkey hate it. I have friends (we don\u2019t party or anything just go out to eat), I\u2019m in a club but at the same time I keep to myself because I\u2019m introverted. I go home every weekend and every time I have to return to campus I feel miserable and just rather stay home. \n\nI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t get into my nursing program because my grades in Chemistry and Biology (which are required for nursing) are absolutely terrible even though I have a tutors for both. \n\nSometimes I just consider living off campus or moving back home and just changing my major. Nothing fun happens on campus and I don\u2019t go to any parties but does anyone else feel this way? How do you overcome it?",
