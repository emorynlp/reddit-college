He is studying physics, was going for a bachelor's (4 years). Towards the end of his second year, beginning his third year, the school announced that they were ending the physics program. On top of this, his physics advisor retired (she was also his physics professor but by this time he had finished the physics course). \n\nFast-forward to today. The school is going to use the engineering professor to teach the physics courses. I feel like although this is a quick fix, it's not a good one. My bf is thinking abt transferring somewhere different to finish his physics degree. Thing is, we are in our senior year, one quarter into the first semester, so another quarter and semester to go and we're done.\n\nI feel that the school has really done him wrong. He has been beyond stressed for the past year due to this school issue.
