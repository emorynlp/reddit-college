  "text": " I'm currently taking Calculus I online, but next semester my school is only offering Calc II in person, so due in-person issues (I'm in Brazil, my university is in Canada, and I'll move there only at the end of March) I won't be able to take Calc II next semester. \n\nBecause of that, I'll only have the opportunity to take Calc II on Winter '23, do you guys think I'm too screwed if I spend such a long period of time apart from studying Calc I and Calc II?\n\nDuring the mean time, I'll be taking other classes for my majors. For context I major in Math/CS and Econ, and I was told my uni doesn't offer Calc II during the summer.\n\nThanks for reading this!",
