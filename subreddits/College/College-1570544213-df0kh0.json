However, I\u2019m worried that this will look worse on me, considering I didn\u2019t miss a test or a quiz. I have also already gotten the notes from class today.\n\nMy professors attendance policy is that there are no make-up quizzes, make up tests for excused absences, and that regular attendance is expected.\n\nIs it worth emailing my professor at this point, or should I just move on?", "author": null, "created": 1570544213, "retrieved": 1632802760, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 613, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"f3tmyvg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/df0kh0/i_overslept_through_my_8am_chemistry/f3tmyvg/", "text": "Honestly, I've never emailed a professor about missing class unless I knew I was going to ahead of time.
