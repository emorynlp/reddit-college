  "text": "Right now, I\u2019m currently a sophomore at my university. I got all A\u2019s and B\u2019s my freshman year and even made the dean\u2019s list that year. However, I am really struggling with my first semester as a sophomore. I got COVID, and have been going downhill ever since (I\u2019m scared to even check my grades at this point); especially due to financial reasons and having to work almost every day. So, I\u2019m thinking I want to just withdraw from all my classes so it doesn\u2019t affect my GPA, and transferring to a different university/community college next semester where I can gain my time and dedication to school back and maintain my good grades. So right now, I just really need some advice on what to do as a whole. I\u2019m really stressed about this, as I take school very seriously, but life is getting the best of me right now. I\u2019m worried about my financial aid, future employers (ESPECIALLY because I want to go into the law field), and transferring. If anyone could offer some insight, I would appreciate it so much. \n\nThank you \u2764\ufe0f",
