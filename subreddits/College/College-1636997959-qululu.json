  "text": "Coming into higher education whether that be at a big university, small community college, tech school, or anything is a time for growth. It's almost designed to put you into challenging and difficult situations in order to help you respond to those scenarios in the real world. What I commonly see on this page is very minimal issues like \"how do I make friends???\" or \"my professor is a jerk >:(\" or even your classic \"what do you bring?\" or even \"Should I drink?\". The fact of the matter is you're becoming an adult and this is your time to realize what kind of responsibilities are at your hand and with that you have to learn how to react. It's going to benefit you far more by figuring out your own social scene or knowing when studying is best for you, discovering these things for yourself pays off a lot more than asking a stranger on the internet. I made all of my friends by playing pick-up basketball at the rec, but there's absolutely nothing supporting that you will do the same. The bottom line is that the entire higher education experience provides immense opportunities for you to understand not only the reality of an adult world but yourself as a whole. You have to realize that all of these happenings, while you're in school, are precedents for what may happen to you later on after college. So, when wondering how to make friends you just have to go for it, when your professor is a jerk odds are your boss or co-worker might be so deal with it, when wondering what to bring think about it for a minute, and if you're questioning whether or not to drink think about what's going on tomorrow morning. Take the time in school to conquer your challenges and make the most of your time.",

      "text": "Absolutely. It's also a huge lesson to put yourself out there. You can't plan life out to a tee but you can make your odds better. Like, you can't guarantee you'll find friends by going out, but you'll increase your odds by studying at the library and getting food at the dining facility vs staying in your dorm/apt all day and getting doordash.\n\nGet out there and live your lives! I met my now-girlfriend through a random chain of events where I stayed outside of class to exchange socials with a girl I briefly talked to on the first day of class, which led me to talking to the people in her group, which then had me walking with them towards their destination, which led me to the smoothie/acai shack we have on campus, which in turn led me to sitting down at a table with my now-girlfriend where we chatted up and got to know each other.\n\nI was originally going to go home after class but because I took the plunge to make a new friend, I ended up making a whole group and even coincidentally found myself a SO. Put yourselves out there people. This is what college is about.",
