  "text": "I'm at a UC, so we're on the quarter system and start later, so we've only had like a week of classes, and I've been here at school for two weeks. So I guess I should give it more time. But I'm just really sad.\n\nBefore I left for college, like five months ago, I had a big blowup with my closest friends and lost them. I was really needing to make new friends in college, because I'm very social and I've really missed having close friends to talk to. And so far I've really put myself out there a lot, but I just don't feel like I've found people I really vibe with yet.\n\nI genuinely have been trying really hard. I don't stay in my dorm every day. I go out to meals with people, I think I've only eaten alone once. I say hi to everyone on my floor, and I'm on a really social floor. I often go to the common lounge and just hang out and play board games. I'm really friendly in classes and chat with people and have fun. And I'm not bad at socializing. I have made friends on my floor. But they're not exactly my people. They're partiers, they drink and smoke pot and everything. Not bad, they're genuinely cool and fun and nice people, but not exactly my vibe - I like being friends with them, but I don't see them being like, my ride or die best friends that I tell everything to like my old friends were.\n\nAnd I do have some friends, like a lot of people from my HS are here and I hang out with them a lot. But tbh I wasn't really super close with them in HS and they're my closest friends now, but it's not at all the same level of closeness as my old friends. And I know I need to stop comparing everyone to my old friends, but I keep doing it.\n\nAnd I've been joining a shit ton of clubs. Like way more than everyone, I've just been trying to check them all out to see which ones I vibe with (I won't stick with them all, but I want to check out a lot). I auditioned to six different clubs, and got rejected from them all. But I still plan to join some less competitive clubs, if they're out there. \n\nPart of the problem is also that I really wanted to go to a small school. I like small classes. And I hate the quarter system. I miss HS classes, where you knew everyone and got the same people and teacher for the whole year. I hate that I walk around and barely know anyone. I miss that small community. And I hate how goddamn competitive all the clubs are, because it's such a big school, there's just too many people for everyone to join. But I hate that you basically have to be already good at some stuff to join the clubs. College is the time to explore new interests, and I just can't seem to do that here, because you have to already be really good at whatever it is to have a chance of making it into the club. And I know I need to just accept that I'm here now (I'm a second year, first year online at zoom), but it's so hard not to pine for what I don't have. \n\nAnd the last few days, I've just been exhausted. I'm really scared I'm just going to give up and accept that this is my fate, and I don't want to do that, because this is not the life I want. I don't want to accept that just the people on the floor are my main friends, and that's that. And then I have alright friends for the year, but I never find my people. And I feel like I'm starting to give up on clubs, as I've gone to some events but have started to miss others, and I'm so scared I'm just going to not commit to any and give up on all of them. \n\nI'm in therapy, but I moved down from a much more intensive program to just once a week now that I'm in classes, and I feel like it's not enough. I also got a new therapist, and I'm just not sure. I don't think it's helping enough, but I don't know what else to do, because I'm on medication and I just don't have time for more therapy. I get plenty of exercise walking around campus (average 12k steps a day) and I try to sleep and eat well. And I feel like I was making progress while I was in the more intensive therapy, but now it feels like my \"therapy-minded brain\" is receding. Like I learned all these strategies for letting go, for not comparing, for being in the present moment, but it's so hard for me to force myself to go back through all those strategies on my own accord.\n\nThat's my main problem, is just that I struggle so much to force myself to do things. I don't know why it's so hard for me. I want to do my assignments, but I don't, I procrastinate. I want to go to clubs and make friends, but then in the moment I just want to lie in bed. I can't seem to follow through, to commit. I'm trying so hard to keep pushing myself but I don't know how much longer I can keep it up. \n\nAnd I struggle with perfectionist tendencies, and I just don't want this to be my life. There's so much more I want to do, and maybe that's the perfectionism talking, but there is genuinely so many hobbies and interests I want to explore, and I'm scared I never will, because I can't seem to force myself to keep going.",
