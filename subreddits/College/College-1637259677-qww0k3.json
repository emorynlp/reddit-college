I\u2019ve emailed someone before when a student said they had to miss my class because of something they had to do for another class (surprise, they just chose to do it during my class instead of the many other time slots they had available and could have chosen). That\u2019s very rare, though, and I would only ever reach out if there were some kind of scheduling conflict like this example.",

      "text": "Even if your professor does not have access to your schedule, it is likely that an administrative staff member in their department does, and that they can check your schedule to see whether there are any final exam conflicts.  \n\nOn rare occasions, a student will claim a conflict that does not exist to buy more time to prepare for one of their finals, and said staff member can put a stop to that without any communication at all between the student\u2019s professors.",

      "text": "Faculty here.  It depends.  At some universities, faculty have access to a student's schedule as part of legitimate educational access to the student's records.  At other universities they don't.  In my experience, it's more common *not* to have access to a student's full schedule.  But it varies.\n\nStill, access to records like that is based on some legitimate educational or administrative purpose.  So it generally wouldn't be legal for a faculty member to look in your records and then contact your other professors just to gossip about you or something like that.  There needs to be a legitimate, justifiable reason for looking at official records.  For example, if you're under investigation for academic dishonesty, it would not be unreasonable to check with your other professors to see if you've been sanctioned in their classes.  Or if you're out on medical leave it would be legitimate for your professors to work with each other to coordinate your makeup work, etc.  Things like that that are clearly related to the educational mission of the university and their particular role as instructors of classes you're a part of.\n\nBut, in general, a professor can't legitimately access your academic records just out of mere curiosity or anything like that.  But, as I said before, keep in mind that the information professors can access varies from place to place.",
