  "text": "I feel like I'm breaking part. I stood up to my mom who was abusive towards me and hurt my feelings a lot. Couldn't think straight for days. She said I need to get tougher and not be so sensitive typical then eventually apologised but I didn't even care, the hurt is still there cause she doesn't care about my feelings. \n\nI have no friends or connections because of Asperger's social anxiety adhd and thought doing an online degree would be a good option for me to get one when I was unable to cope in college in person. I feel completely isolated and alone, there is nobody to talk to. Its lecturers throwing information at you on screen and then leaving it to you to do it.\n\n I feel totally unsupported and I don't know what to do. Its me alone living with an extremely strained relationship with my mom and feeling the pressure of doing this online course that feels too pressurizing for me to complete alone at home. I was thinking of seeing if I can get the money back and going to do a community course that helps people with mental health issues instead? I feel like such a failure. Nothing I do ever works out. I hate myself so much and wish I wasn't alive.",

      "text": "I think you need more human connection. Don\u2019t worry about connecting it to your classes just yet, although it may be a good idea to switch to live classes in the end.\n\nFind some people you can chat with in a relaxed way. Join a hiking club, attend a church group, whatever sounds good to you. And I urge you to talk to a counselor \u2014 these problems are temporary and solve-able. It will get better, hang in there.",
