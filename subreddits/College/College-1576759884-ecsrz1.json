Then again, maybe I just don't run in the circles that would do that. \n\nAt the same time, part of it is because of what's considered acceptable. If you have inflationary pressure, what's considered a good GPA at a school with deflation is still gonna look like shit and disadvantage you for the workplace, for scholarship considerations, etc. so schools have an incentive to grade leniently. If you go to UChicago or Pton, they might know about the deflationary pressures and be more lenient, but what if you aren't fortunate enough to go to one of those? From what I've heard about students in systems such as the French and German one (or the British one for that matter), the bounds of acceptability are also very different so while we might have \"higher scores,\" our idea of what's acceptable for scores is also more narrow and differentiation still happens. The British system in comparison for example if converted to GPA, generally converts along something like this:\n\n- First Class: 3.7-4.0 (which is an A- average to perfect A in the American system.) \n\n- Upper Second: 3.3-3.7 (which is a B+ average to an A- average)\n\n- Lower Second: 2.7-3.3 (which is a B- to B+)\n\nObviously, there are some disagreements but that's the general idea. However, under the American system, there's significant distinction between a 3.7 and a 4.0 and for certain careers such as IB, a 3.3 is considered too low and a significant disadvantage while a 3.7 is significantly higher than the minimum bar. Not only that, the British First is awarded for those who achieve a 70%+ at most schools which is just at first glance incredibly different from the American system which typically works on 93+ for an A, 90-93 for an A-, etc. Another difference is that the British system typically does not weight or determine grades in the same way as American schools, where you have a number of assignments, grades for participation and attendance, etc. \n\n\nAnd after all that? There's rampant grade inflation in British higher education. Roughly 30% of students were given a first in 2019 and as of 2015, 49% of students got a 2.1. While the US has had similar inflationary pressures, we can see that in 2013, the average GPA still hovered between a 3.1 or a 3.2 [here](http://www.gradeinflation.com/) which would be the equivalent to a 2.2 in the British system. \n\nSo maybe part of the reason you don't have the same grade grubbing is because the systems are entirely different as well would be my guess.", "author": "doneanddead", "created": 1576775520, "upvotes": 1}, "fbdys7d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ecsrz1/grade_grubbing/fbdys7d/", "text": "Don't assume it's a \"regular\" thing across the US at all sorts of institutions.

So when students come grade grubbing, precariously employed faculty are more likely to give in out of fear that the student will trash them in their course evaluation.\n\nWith tenure track and tenured faculty, our jobs are more secure and our livelihoods are not as dependent on contract renewal, so we are less likely to inflate grades or give in to end of semester grade grubbing (though it still happens).\n\nIn the US, most students are unaware of the different types of faculty positions or any of the unethical labor practices that are rampant at US universities (such as widespread adunctification or having grad students teach for extremely low pay). People will beg for grades at the end of semester because some faculty do cave and bump grades, so from the student perspective- it seems very arbitrary and subjective. This is why people on here will say things like \u201ccan\u2019t hurt to ask\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s worth a shot\u201d. \n\nPersonally, I only bump grades up if students are within .5% of the next letter grade and it is something I do for most students, it has nothing to do with the grade grubbing. Those requests are just annoying and reflect poorly on the student, in my opinion. Especially when it is someone who missed a lot of class, didn\u2019t submit all assignments, didn\u2019t take advantage of extra credit I offered, etc. A grade is something a student earns, not something I give them. \n\nSorry this is probably beyond what you were looking for, but the reasons for grade grubbing (and grade inflation) in the US are actually really complicated and students don\u2019t usually understand how it is connected to difficult labor conditions for faculty.", "author": "ProfessorHomeBrew", "created": 1576761328, "upvotes": 471}, "fbdg86d": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ecsrz1/grade_grubbing/fbdg86d/", "text": "Just as a bit of context, I think a lot of this in the US is due to education being treated as a commercial product where students are the consumers and the school works for them.\n\nI would expect that in places with a more conventional approach to education this is far less of an issue.", "author": "bl1y", "created": 1576761180, "upvotes": 61}}}
