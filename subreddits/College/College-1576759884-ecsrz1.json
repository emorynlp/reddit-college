  "text": "Hey everyone\n\nSince I've joined reddit, I've noticed, students in the US seem to regularly ask for better grades than they've been awarded by their professors. That's kinda completely new to me as someone who studies in Germany. Only way anyone here ever gets a better grade is if they find points having been falsely deducted on an assignment.\n\nExtra credit is also not a thing at all\n\nSo I just wanted to ask, what students from other countries have experienced. Where is \"grade grubbing\" a thing and where is it completely unheard of?",

She thankfully was very helpful and revised a couple assignments. I know that this isn\u2019t a situation I should expect in the future but it was very helpful.",

Students will often talk to there teachers or talk directly to the school if they really think they deserved a different grade. I was actually part of a committee for a short amount of time at my college that delt with these complaints. It consisted of two professors, two non professor faculty, and two students. We heard the professors side and the students side and then made a decision on if the students grade should be changed. Most of the time the professor won and the grade was kept. There was one case where a girl was 0.02 percent off of what the proffessor considered a C+, which was the grade she needed to have her work cover the cost of her class. The sylibus was not very specific on if this should be a C+ or C, as it only went to the tenth decimal place. This put her in this weird grey area. I was able to convince the faculty to give her a C+, but the vast majority of these cases are not so lucky.",

We dont get our exam papers back, but we can go to the professor or the assistant responsible for them and see them. I personally dont look at my exam papers unless im 100% sure i did smt right and didn't get the appropriate grade for it. Or if professor tells me to come and see, which is usuall for some subjects. Mostly where there is a lot of calculating done. Some professors are wacky and even if you aswerd correctly they wont give you points cause its not word for word how they \"thought\" it.

He said if I showed him somehow that I understood the content by the end of the quarter, he might consider helping me.

International students who are studying in Aus obviously bring some habits from home with them, so they do try to \"grade-grub\" sometimes. \n\nIME, it always felt like a respect thing here. \n\nI respected my lecturers. I trusted that they:\n\n - knew the subject better than I did, \n\n - knew how to teach an undergraduate class better than I did,\n\n - knew how to assess learning in their class better than I did, and\n\n - would always do their best to be transparent and fair.\n\nIf they gave me a B then I deserved a B. Unless there was obviously some mistake in the grading, it wasn't our place to question what they gave us. \n\nBut these are the same lecturers who'd give you extensions just because you had a lot of other work to do and you asked for one, who never took attendance, and who had (and exercised) the freedom to set your grade to whatever they thought you earned, almost regardless of your marks. If everyone did uncharacteristically poorly on one exam they'd assume that they'd written a bad exam and either ignore the grade or scale us all up by whatever amount. Basically, they were all good blokes who wouldn't screw us over. \n\nI think in the US they prescribe *way* more rules at the start of term and that encourages people to find ways to \"bend\" those rules. In Aus, our syllabi are maybe 1-2 pages, with half a page just being a generic warning against plagiarism. Our \"rules\" are negotiable and changeable, and we had in-class votes quite a few times to change the weightings of sections or set the date for our exams. They won't screw us over and in return, we won't try to game the system too much.\n\n[Also helps that our final grades are properly final. You can't request a regrade of material beyond a week or so, and your grade can only change at the end with a formal regrade of your final, which is a properly formal process with independent markers and everything. The lecturer doesn't have the power to go in and change things at that point.]",

Then again, maybe I just don't run in the circles that would do that. \n\nAt the same time, part of it is because of what's considered acceptable. If you have inflationary pressure, what's considered a good GPA at a school with deflation is still gonna look like shit and disadvantage you for the workplace, for scholarship considerations, etc. so schools have an incentive to grade leniently. If you go to UChicago or Pton, they might know about the deflationary pressures and be more lenient, but what if you aren't fortunate enough to go to one of those? From what I've heard about students in systems such as the French and German one (or the British one for that matter), the bounds of acceptability are also very different so while we might have \"higher scores,\" our idea of what's acceptable for scores is also more narrow and differentiation still happens. The British system in comparison for example if converted to GPA, generally converts along something like this:\n\n- First Class: 3.7-4.0 (which is an A- average to perfect A in the American system.) \n\n- Upper Second: 3.3-3.7 (which is a B+ average to an A- average)\n\n- Lower Second: 2.7-3.3 (which is a B- to B+)\n\nObviously, there are some disagreements but that's the general idea. However, under the American system, there's significant distinction between a 3.7 and a 4.0 and for certain careers such as IB, a 3.3 is considered too low and a significant disadvantage while a 3.7 is significantly higher than the minimum bar. Not only that, the British First is awarded for those who achieve a 70%+ at most schools which is just at first glance incredibly different from the American system which typically works on 93+ for an A, 90-93 for an A-, etc. Another difference is that the British system typically does not weight or determine grades in the same way as American schools, where you have a number of assignments, grades for participation and attendance, etc. \n\n\nAnd after all that? There's rampant grade inflation in British higher education. Roughly 30% of students were given a first in 2019 and as of 2015, 49% of students got a 2.1. While the US has had similar inflationary pressures, we can see that in 2013, the average GPA still hovered between a 3.1 or a 3.2 [here](http://www.gradeinflation.com/) which would be the equivalent to a 2.2 in the British system. \n\nSo maybe part of the reason you don't have the same grade grubbing is because the systems are entirely different as well would be my guess.",

I would have never, ever in a million years considered asking a professor for a \"bump\" and none of my friends either.  \n\nBut it turns out, there are selection effects going on here -- my friends and I were good students mostly concerned with learning and not grades.  Once I became a TA/Lecturer, I learned that grade grubbing was an epidemic -- and often of the kind that offers no justification other than \"I was only 1-2 points away!\".  \n\n\nFWIW, where I work now, I have gotten almost 0 grade grubbing emails.  In fact, students have failed to contact me when I've discovered I made an actual error which is a different kind of problem.  Different population of students, different culture, etc. etc.",

There is a saying \"4 gewinnt\" which basically translates to your \"Cs get degrees\", so while 4.0 is ok, people dont usually strive for it. For many Masters degrees you need an average of 2.5 in your Bachelor degree at least to even apply for it. Students can usually take a look at grade measurements for an exam when they look through their exam to see if the professor graded correctly. I think it's usually 100-95%=1.0, 94,9-90=1.3, 89.9-85=1.7, 84.9-80%=2.0, 79.9-75=2.3, 74.9-70=2.7, 69.9-65=3.0, 64.9-60=3.3, 59.9-55= 3.7 and 54.9-50=4.0., but as I said, the professor might curve. \n\nWhat grade your \"expected\" to get varies strongly depending on your course of study. E.g. in most STEM subjects, the students are usually over the moon if they get a B or better (so 2.3 or better) and a C (2.7-3.3) is completely normal, while in most liberal arts, a C is felt to be a failure.\n\nOh yeah... This grading scale doesnt apply to all courses of study.\nIf you're doing law, you're awarded between 0 (or 1) and 18 points. 18 being the highest, 4 being the last passing grade. Anything 10 or better is like top 10%, a 15 is barely heard of, the professor providing the exam would barely get a 16 and not even God could achieve an 18... Or thats what Im told...",

For all we know, \"your\" C could be as difficult to achieve as our 1.0 or as easy as our 4.0.

      "text": "Perspective from a US professor- in the US, grade inflation is very real and has a direct connection to labor conditions that result in more adjunct and contract faculty who are precariously employed. This means a lot of faculty are highly dependent on good teaching evaluations for their continued employment. So when students come grade grubbing, precariously employed faculty are more likely to give in out of fear that the student will trash them in their course evaluation.\n\nWith tenure track and tenured faculty, our jobs are more secure and our livelihoods are not as dependent on contract renewal, so we are less likely to inflate grades or give in to end of semester grade grubbing (though it still happens).\n\nIn the US, most students are unaware of the different types of faculty positions or any of the unethical labor practices that are rampant at US universities (such as widespread adunctification or having grad students teach for extremely low pay). People will beg for grades at the end of semester because some faculty do cave and bump grades, so from the student perspective- it seems very arbitrary and subjective. This is why people on here will say things like \u201ccan\u2019t hurt to ask\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s worth a shot\u201d. \n\nPersonally, I only bump grades up if students are within .5% of the next letter grade and it is something I do for most students, it has nothing to do with the grade grubbing. Those requests are just annoying and reflect poorly on the student, in my opinion. Especially when it is someone who missed a lot of class, didn\u2019t submit all assignments, didn\u2019t take advantage of extra credit I offered, etc. A grade is something a student earns, not something I give them. \n\nSorry this is probably beyond what you were looking for, but the reasons for grade grubbing (and grade inflation) in the US are actually really complicated and students don\u2019t usually understand how it is connected to difficult labor conditions for faculty.",

I asked my engineer professor once out of genuine curiosity if he really enjoyed teaching vs being in the field as an engineer. His response was the he really enjoyed teaching, hates \u201cschool politics\u201d. \n\nMy \u201ccore classes\u201d professors are also of the same opinion. They\u2019ll bump a grade if you\u2019re just a hair under, have been present, don\u2019t make excuses, and have made a good effort. Our assignments are work heavy, very few graded things, and each assignment is not worth many points.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t find the courses unfair whatsoever - just an observation. I don\u2019t find it unreasonable to have at least conversation if you\u2019re a great student and fractions of a percentage away from a different letter grade.

That's mostly due to the fact that the professors themselves don't have control over what kind of assignments they give and how much they contribute to the final grade. Usually courses in Germany only have one graded assignment and maybe additional pass/fail assignments. The final grade is supposed to be 100% the one graded assignment. Thanks to this system I've been awarded a better grade in the graded assignment, because the professor didnt think it was fair that only one assignment should make up the whole grade.\nSo we definitely have professors bending the rules for students over here, as well. But it's never done (as far as I know of) because of a student begging for a better grade, becauae they really want/need it.\nAnyways, I'm really grateful for our tertiary education system when I hear about all the problems in the US",

In most countries, professional degrees like medicine and law are undergraduate degrees that students apply to directly out of high school. In the US, they're graduate degrees where a B vs an A makes a big difference in admission.\n\nOther countries also have lower education costs, so students are less likely to need to maintain a certain GPA for financial aid or scholarships.",

Is this something you\u2019ve witnessed?\n\nI have worked at four different universities and have been teaching in higher ed for a long time- as a grad student, then as contract faculty, and now as a tenure track assistant prof. In my experience this all varies a lot. I have known adjuncts who teach \u201ceasy A\u201d classes that horrify the regular faculty with their lack of rigor, but I have also known adjuncts who work really hard to hold their students to a high standard. It really depends on the context (institution, department, type of course) and the person. \n\n>However, the courses I\u2019ve had which were more \u201cwishy-washy\u201d (less straightforward such as a capstone course or something relatively new) and had professors who were maybe just there to do research always tried to emulate that tough class by being unreasonable: assigning things the same day they requested it due, ridiculous work loads/policies, being unapproachable for discussion on grading, etc. \n\nAgain, there is a lot of variation here. In my own department for example, I have tenured colleagues who I know will throw students curve balls, like suddenly assigning things that weren\u2019t in the syllabus or grading really harshly when they never provided clear instructions. However, I am personally very careful to give students enough time and material to succeed, it\u2019s something I take really seriously. I have many friends who are also professors who care a lot about pedagogy and student success. This is at an R1 university, so you do get research focused faculty who never really wanted to teach, but there are a lot of tenured and tenure track people at my university who I know love both the research and teaching side of things and work hard to help their students succeed.",

Many of them had just come over for grad school from other countries and their English was not at a high enough level for teaching. We were having enough problems understanding the content, but then the instructor would use a word and someone would ask what it meant (thinking it was specific to math) and it would turn out it just wasn't a word at all and the instructor would spend 5 minutes trying to come up with what she was trying to say. To be fair, this was pre-smart phones (and to really date myself) pre-internet in the classroom, since it was all still dial up, so she couldn't actually look it up quickly and move on. The entire math department actually got put on some sort of probation by the university (this is a very well known, big university also) because the problem was so rampant.",
