  "text": "I\u2019m 26. Been in school on and off for nearly 8 years and I\u2019m so fucking sick of it. I HATE IT. \n\nI barely have any \u201creal world\u201d work experience and I see complain constantly they can\u2019t find a job with their 4 year degrees. I\u2019m not getting something useless either (project management). So how tf am I supposed to get a job, how am I not wasting my time\n\nEvery semester I find it harder and harder to get through and the work is so unappealing to me and it\u2019s more draining than actually working. \n\nHow do people do it I don\u2019t get it",

      "text": "Are you close to finishing your degree? I\u2019m in a very similar situation. I\u2019m on my 8th year of college just to get a bachelors degree. I\u2019m someone who has never liked school, plus I have ADHD, so college has been a miserable experience for me. It feels like I am missing out on life because school limits everything I can do. I still live with my family and have done nothing with my life so far. Everyone else my age is either working a fancy job, getting married, or having kids. I still live like I am a kid. It\u2019s really frustrating to be an adult but not really be an adult. What has kept me going though is knowing that I will be mad at myself if I drop out of school and don\u2019t see this through to the end. I\u2019m finally about to graduate. The end is near. I still feel tempted to drop out every time I have another life sucking assignment, but I just push through. I want to make myself proud and finish this thing. If you want to finish your degree, you have to find your reason for wanting to do it. I\u2019m guessing since you have stuck through it this long, you probably have a reason why you haven\u2019t dropped out yet. You just need to identify it and use it as your motivation.",

              "text": "The last couple of years of college have been the hardest for me. It often feels like it\u2019s not worth it. You have to think about how accomplished you will feel once you are done though. And the best part is that once you\u2019re done, you\u2019re done. Fuck grad school lol. A bachelors is enough. It\u2019s more education than a lot of other people. It\u2019s hard and it sucks, but you are capable of pushing through and finishing your degree. As the saying goes \u201cno pain, no gain.\u201d Lol",

I get through it because I\u2019ve been on the other side: what it\u2019s like to be in a low paying job that makes me unhappy. I see all the other ppl my age already graduated and I feel horrible for not even being like a sophomore yet.",

      "text": "you claim to hate it, but don't you hate working for 30 years in a near-minimum-wage job where you'll always have to worry about money, never be able to buy fancy foods to eat, never get to travel (if you like to travel), always worry about medical bills? never be able to afford a nice home in safe, clean, peaceful suburban neighborhood?\n\nyou are in USA. unless you live under a rock, you know poor people always complain they never make enough money and have tough life (which they do). Do you really want to be in their circumstances? Do you HATE SCHOOL that much to weather their circumstances for the next 40+ years?\n\nyou can hate school all you want, but unless you are especially lazy, you probably hate the alternative even more. Depressing or not, that is good enough to get you through school to what we hope is a decent life.",

          "text": "These are great points but perhaps probably not the most eloquent or sensitive way of putting things. You have no idea if OP has a learning disability or what cards were in their favor or stacked against them. I'm not saying luck is more than hard work, but what I am saying is that the more cards are stacked in your favor, the less awful school will be. Eg:\n\n504 / IEP that allow those with (only diagnosed) disabilities extra  test time\n\n\nMoney from parents to pay for tuition\n\nThose two things alone right there, just to go to a doctor and get help/ a diagnosis costs money let alone going to the Disabilities resources at ones school and getting help.  Disabilities are invisible and they come in the form of ADHD all the way to dyslexia, all things that impact grades and learning.\n\nAlso I'm not sure what country you are from but I am Asian American and have always been honors, graduated and got a job right out of college. \n\nI worked day in and day out and when I was in the hospital as a patient for covid, I still asked for my laptop to keep working on school assignments from a hospital bed with an IV and oxygen tube. And I had ADHD too. I worked twice as long and missed a lot of my life to hide my diagnosis and hit deadlines. \n\n Just because i do these (preface:toxic things)  doesn't make it right for me to turn around and then use my situation to judge OP and others who were in a better mental health state to not still do homework while sick with a deadly virus. Let OP vent and keep your judgements out.",
