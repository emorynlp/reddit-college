  "text": "okay so for our small dorm we decided to buy a mini fridge for our dorm together, splitting the cost. sharing the fridge will not be an issue as we are both independent and work decently well together. however my biggest concern is when we have to pack up and leave. i go to a california school but i\u2019m originally from illinois so i absolutely under no circumstance will i be able to keep the fridge. they are from the LA area and are much closer and would likely be the one to take it home. they were hasty and wanted to buy the fridge asap and i wanted one too, but i didn\u2019t think to discuss this issue before we went ahead and bought it. so the fridge came out to be about $193 and I will pay about $96 (not cheap at all). what is a fair thing to do when the time comes where they will likely take it home. do i ask them to pay me about 50% or 75% back (considering depreciation) or should i state that i want to sell it at the end of the year and split the money that we receive?",
