  "text": "So, I recently turned in a small(pretty inconsequential to overall grade in the course) assignment worth no more than 2 points. These are frequently assigned given around 1-2 times every week. It is literally a question to lead following discussions in class.\n\nThis assignment being the first, I had missed the initial due date and turned it in late. In this assignment my work was not up to the standard as presented by the professor as I was missing a key part of the assignment. I take full responsibility for both and I am accepting of the 0 i got for this first assignment. \n\nOut of some semblance of hope I shoot a quick THREE SENTENCE EMAIL in what is considered \"Proper Email Etiquette\" . The structure of the emails starts with me explaining I recognize her grade, then followed by if there is a chance to redo or earn any points on this assignment.  And I close up by asking what she requires specifically to get full points and thanking them for their time.\n\nShe responds with \"nope.\".  Upon reading this i felt angryish(idk), because of her inability to provide specific expectations of how she wants her assignment completed. But now I feel more confused than anything. \n\nMy first thought was, like any sane and rational person(this is sarcasm), that maybe she just didn't like me. This is pretty unfounded as I am literally two weeks into this class and she has just graded a 300ish reflection paper that was by far not my best work and gave me full points and said \"Well done.\" along with a few more specifics of why she though I did well. \n\n  \nBut now I don't know how to respond or to digest her email back to me. \"nope.\" I mean come on it was three sentences theres no way she didn't read it completely.  Sorry if this is convoluted, I don't really post ever and my head is a bit muddled after this. Thanks for your time.",

      "text": "Faculty here.  My take on this situation is that the assignment is worth so few points and is such a trivial thing that you basically get one shot at it.  You either do the assignment with solid effort, or you turn in the assignment late / don't do the assignment at all / do an obviously poor job on it.  So it's an either/or thing.  You either get the credit, or you don't.\n\nBy \"nope\" I suspect the professor is communicating that (i) no, it isn't possible for you to turn in the assignment after the fact and get back some credit, and (ii) that the assignment is so trivial that there's really nothing she can write about her \"expectations.\" The only expectation for such a simple assignment is that you just do it - answer the question and submit your answer on time.\n\nSo you missed this assignment and will not get the two points.  As you already wrote, it's no big deal.  Just keep up with the due dates in the future, especially because you know that these small assignments are due multiple times per week.\n\nGood luck.",

How might I respond to her email to indicate that I do indeed understand and accepting of my grade but am quite frustrated at the lack of explanation behind the assignment. Thanks for your reply.",
