  "text": "Let\u2018s start this off with me saying I have a weird sleeping schedule. It\u2018s regular for me to sleep at 7-8pm and wake up at 3-4am. I don\u2018t really love it, but it hasn\u2018t affected me much, till now I guess.\n\nFor more context, I\u2018m in the honors college of my university, and honors classes are hard to come by (you are required to take 1 honors class/semester to stay in the college). I have priority registration, but so does everyone else in the honors college, meaning the competition for honors classes stays as fierce. \n\nThe class I\u2018m gunning for has 25 spots, 27 counting waiting list. \n\nI\u2018m not sure *exactly* how many people are going to camp and register at 12, but I don\u2019t want to underestimate that number and end up SOL.\n\nSo, what are your tips for staying up really late? I have energy drinks, but I don\u2018t think that alone can help. OR, at the very least, do you think waking up at 3 will give me a chance?",

Yours may be different.",

      "text": "Two ways you can do it! One is to stay up a couple hours late, do your registration, then go to sleep. The other is to set an alarm, get up and do the registration, then go to sleep. I haven't had many problems with either option, but it also depends on when you need to be awake and alert the next day.\n\n\nFor waking up, beyond caffeine, I think that doing something physically can help. Maybe taking a walk around the time you go to bed, or taking a cold shower when you get tired, anything that will get your body stimulated to know it isn't sleep time. Sometimes eating can help. Having someone to stay up with you can help too; when I registered recently, my housemate was in the room with me, so talking with them until the menu opened up made the time go faster and made it easier to stay up than if there wasn't another person talking haha.",
