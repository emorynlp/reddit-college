      "text": "I second the rate my professor advice. If you have a little bit of time before enrolling you can always email the professors and get an idea of the class. I always email professors prior to taking a class with them and just introduce myself. I\u2019ll see if I can get a past semester\u2019s syllabus to get an idea of what I will be in for. \nAlso be honest with yourself. If you aren\u2019t a morning person, try your best to take courses later in the day. Or vice versa if you are a morning person. Play to your strengths and weaknesses. \nPersonally for me as well, I like to try and place a majority of my classes in one day. This is tough to adjust too but then it\u2019s only two or three days where I really have to attend class and the rest is studying at my own pace. \nLastly play with the schedule a little bit. If a class  has numerous sections, wait to place that class until the end. Focus on classes that don\u2019t give flexibly. (Hopefully this one makes sense, because I can\u2019t figure out a way to word it better).",
