  "title:": "What happens if a professor dies in the middle of the semester?",
  "text": "So I had this professor last semester for a drawing class. She was a sweet little old lady, and she was in good health and spirits when I last talked to her in May.\n\nWe received a campus-wide email today saying that she passed away today. Some of my classmates in another course were in her drawing class this semester (like actively taking her) and now they're kind of in a weird limbo state where Blackboard says \"Multiple Instructors\" but nothing more. It didn't say that before according to them, and as far as I know there hasn't been anything said about how the class will proceed...\n\nHas anyone ever experienced anything like this before? What happened in your class as a result? I'm gonna keep up with my classmates obviously, but I was just curious as to what different things could happen.",

      "text": "It generally takes a bit for the department to find someone else to take over. The less common the course is, the harder it is to cover. For example, it's a lot easier to find someone to take over a college algebra than an advanced calculus course. \n\nDepending on how unexpected it is, they may be able to just pick up and continue or they may end up having to replan parts of the course. \n\nIf I were in the course, for my own benefit I'd probably just try to keep following the plan the instructor had been following while I waited to see what would happen. Worst-case scenario, I end up a little ahead.",
