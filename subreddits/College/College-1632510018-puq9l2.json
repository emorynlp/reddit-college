They were contributing and talking continously, and all the ideas I had in my head are all spoken out by them so I didn't have anything to add. And there are some that I couldn't find the courage to add\n\nThey are one of the most active and exprienced people in my class, they are much older than me and so they have tons of knowledge and experience. Meanwhile I'm 20, got to college right after I graduated from high school and hasn't got a job before. \n\nI'm stressing out though i know it's normal that there are people who are more excellent than other people, and there are many things that being a few years ahead can help you know. I'm worried they're gonna look down on me or if I will be as good as them when I'm at their stage in life", "author": "angchiee", "created": 1632510018, "retrieved": 1632946052, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he8hjg8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/puq9l2/i_wasnt_able_to_say_anything_during_a_group/he8hjg8/", "text": "Is participation in a group mandatory?

Everyone has different skill sets, everyone takes life at a different pace, so you will never be just like someone else. That doesn't mean you don't have anything valuable to contribute, or that you can't add to the conversation. I know in one of my seminars, we have *one undergrad* in a class of grad students, so he's younger and less experienced, but he's so insightful and engaged that he contributes more than a lot of the grad students in there haha.\n\n\nI will also tell you, as someone who's late-20s with friends much older than me: most folks are too focused on their own lives and work to care what your life looks like. Besides, when you're 20 and you're behind, it's easy to notice, but by the time you've been an adult a while, you grow out of expecting everyone to go the same pace. Life just isn't clean like that; often, shit gets in the way, and you have to go to Plan B or delay plans, so it's pretty normal to see everyone at different stages of life/career.\n\n\nAll that is to say that you shouldn't be self-conscious about yourself in comparison to someone else. Everyone is there to learn, and we learn partly by discussing things with each other, so don't hold back! You may connect with those students more easily than you expect.", "author": "torgoboi", "created": 1632510785, "upvotes": 3}}}
