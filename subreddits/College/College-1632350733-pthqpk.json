It\u2019s so weird, I knew she was going to die soon, she was in a lot of pain, she hated how she was living and was ready to go, but I am having such a hard time anyway. I thought I would be fine, so I didn\u2019t tell any of my professors. I have 3 exams this week and i\u2019m trying to study now and I just can\u2019t focus. Every time I sit down to study, I just go blank. I just stare at my computer screen, and when I manage to read my notes, I don\u2019t comprehend it. I always had this issue, but ever since she\u2019s died it\u2019s gotten bad. What do I do? If you went through a similar experience, how did you manage such a loss while in college?\nAlso note: I have been really lucky in my 23 years of life to never have experienced a death that\u2019s hurt me, this is the first one ever.", "author": "paige2222", "created": 1632350733, "retrieved": 1632946186, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdxjyzm": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pthqpk/has_anyone_had_a_family_member_die_while_in_school/hdxjyzm/", "text": "Sorry for your loss. I lost my mom two months before freshman year. Honestly I would say take time to heal and also talk to someone if you ever feel weighed down. You could ask for an extension on your exams. If that doesn\u2019t work try studying in short increments and not pushing yourself too much. It\u2019s normal to grieve and it sucks like hell but time helps with that.

Copy and paste it into an email.   INCLUDING THE QUESTIONS.  Yes, include the \"how do you manage such a loss?.\"\n\nNow, what the professor will do is probably refer you to the school counseling.  Why?  Because that's what we're told to do, and we're also scared that we'll say something bad that will make you feel worse.\n\nWhy I say to copy and paste your post rather than just \"notify your professor\" is that your post sounds earnest.  I don't doubt a single thing you've written.  \n\nI'm not saying \"play the professor for guilt points.\"  Not at all.  But there are two things -- first, the professor might have gone through the same thing as you, and actually have some helpful tips.\n\nSecond, the professor will check up on you.  (If you're on Zoom, turn your camera on.)  We'll notice when you seem distracted, and thought we'd never call it out, we (or at least I would) perhaps ask in private if you wanted to go over some stuff in class since you seemed distracted.\n\nThe key is that earnestness.  You're not just saying \"Hey, someone in my family died, give me some special treatment.\"  You're saying \"I'm struggling so much with the first death of someone I'm close to, and I want to do well, so do you have any tips on how to deal with this?\"\n\nIf your professor doesn't help you, this is what you should do:\n\nMessage me with the school you go to and the name of the professor.   Because I will literally go to the school, hunt them down and beat some empathy into their cold, cold heart.\n\nI had a student whose cousin -- who he was close to -- was murdered.  He couldn't drop out because he just knew he'd never complete college if he took a semester off.  We worked together, and he graduated.\n\nTake care, and I'm sorry for your loss.
