Which means that this test represents 1.5625% of my grade. Not only does this test which I have to pay $40 to take, it is over 100 questions and I have a 3 hour limit, which means I'd probably spend a solid 1-2 hours on it.\n\nI'm seriously considering just saying screw it I'm not going spend $40. Even if I do not take the test, I will still likely walk away with an A.\n\nHonestly, it just doesn't seem worth it to spend $40 to take a test that means so little to my overall grade.\n\nAlso if I decide to not take the test, should I be honest about why I'm not going do it or lie?\n\nSome things I thought of saying\n\n\"It represents 1.56% of my grade, and its $40 and my budget is tight and I don't feel the test is worth the money the $40\"\n\nOr\n\n\"I totally forgot to take it, I'm sorry I'll take the 0 on it\"", "author": "PGLiberal", "created": 1632553838, "retrieved": 1632946026, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hefaj1p": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pv1rzg/would_you_pay_40_to_take_a_test_that_will/hefaj1p/", "text": "If you're sure you'll end up with an A either way, there's no point.
