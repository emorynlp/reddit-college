  "title:": "Would you pay $40 to take a test that will represent 1.5625% of your grade",
  "text": "Situation I currently have a 96% in this class\n\nMy professor wants me to pay $40 to take a test, it does not matter what my score is on the test I will get 25 points for the test for taking it.\n\nThis my assignments total points are a maximum of 1,600. Which means that this test represents 1.5625% of my grade. Not only does this test which I have to pay $40 to take, it is over 100 questions and I have a 3 hour limit, which means I'd probably spend a solid 1-2 hours on it.\n\nI'm seriously considering just saying screw it I'm not going spend $40. Even if I do not take the test, I will still likely walk away with an A.\n\nHonestly, it just doesn't seem worth it to spend $40 to take a test that means so little to my overall grade.\n\nAlso if I decide to not take the test, should I be honest about why I'm not going do it or lie?\n\nSome things I thought of saying\n\n\"It represents 1.56% of my grade, and its $40 and my budget is tight and I don't feel the test is worth the money the $40\"\n\nOr\n\n\"I totally forgot to take it, I'm sorry I'll take the 0 on it\"",

          "text": "Its straight points, so my final for example is worth 250 points. My papers are worth 100 points. \n\nSo yea this test is straight up worth 25 points.\n\nHe wants us to take the test to see our general knowledge on business, economics, etc. Apparently this test is very important for business majors...\n\nI'm a computer science major and only taking this class because I have to for my overall program. But this will be one of the few business classes I take.\n\nSo my question is\n\nWould you be honest on why you aren't taking it? Or just take the 0?\n\nI think just not saying anything is the best way, he will see I didn't take it, give me 0 points and we move forward. I feel like if I tell him why it could potentially backfire.",
