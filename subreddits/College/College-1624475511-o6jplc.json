I couldn\u2019t have gone to community college for this degree, but if it was possible, I would have! It\u2019s cheaper to do community college and while it\u2019s not the same experience, that doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re getting what you need - hopefully a degree that allows you to perform the career path you want. Who cares how it\u2019s done?", "author": "Evenoh", "created": 1624478731, "upvotes": 3}, "h2sux4h": {"link": "/r/college/comments/o6jplc/i_wish_people_would_stop_shitting_on_community/h2sux4h/", "text": "Hey dude, college is college. My mom was like that with me and I didn't know why. She forced to go to Uni all 4 years and now I'm in major debt. And for what? Just to say I did it? I would've much rather done community college as long as I could before switching to uni. Keep your head up. Your education is yours and yours alone. Your diploma is all that matters! Keep going, you don't owe anyone anything but yourself.", "author": "texastoast134", "created": 1624475945, "upvotes": 119}}}
