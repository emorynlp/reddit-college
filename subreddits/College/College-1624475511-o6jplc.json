  "text": "before I get started, don\u2019t get me wrong I respect the hustle and I do understand that uni struggles and community struggles are different. \n\nAnyway, recently I rescinded my admission from a UC and decided to go with community. There were many factors that went into making my decision & I do recognize all the sacrifices I would be making by not going to a four year right away, but my conscience was way more content with community. \n\nThat being said, everyone that went to community first has supported me right off the bat (save for a few people). Everyone that is going to a uni (or has gone) had a lot\nof trouble understanding my decision. And that\u2019s cool, I expected that because everyone processes things differently, it\u2019s just why voice it to me? Like they\u2019ve pushed me to explain myself time and time again and continued to try and persuade me \u2014\nbasically just assuming my life runs around them and I need their permission. It\u2019s just so frustrating because eventually they\u2019re like \u201cya I support you as long as you\u2019re happy\u201d but after what?? Making me doubt myself and \u201cregret\u201d it?? I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just so frustrating how condescending it could feel and how whenever I have a convo about it (even with people in full support) it\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly defending myself & circumventing the stigma :/",

It\u2019s School you, your going to learn hopefully get some social mobility and if it\u2019s not a private school they all teaching the same stuff. That being said the more prestigious the school, the more you gotta figure out wth is going on and in my opinion community college profs are doing solid work and most work pretty closely with student with the smaller class sizes. Community college is also amazing in saving money and really figuring out wth you want to do and finding your self, most people switch majors all the time and also unfortunately drop out, which would be much more stressful at larger schools. Don\u2019t let others make you feel bad for decisions and tbh tell them piss off, not their life. And if you make mistakes in anything just learn from them and move on, that\u2019s life man. Best luck, really felt this as rn I\u2019m transferring to UC in the fall with 5 associates, a car paid for, and still a bit of savings. \u2764\ufe0f",

I'm sure you'll do amazing at the UC you're attending -- they're lucky to have you. \n\nAnd I feel you on the elitist thing. That was actually one of the biggest reasons I followed my gut because my sophomore year I crapped on my friend for dropping out and going straight to community -- and my reasoning? She would miss out on the high school experience. \n\nFast forward two years, she's transferring to an IVY league in the fall, I MYSELF didn't even get the high school experience I wanted her to hold herself back for, and I'm finding myself wishing I did what she did. I'm in her position now and I'm finding myself able to do what I wish I did so why not go for it ya know?",

It's all an effort to maintain that elitism.

All the teachers I had were really understanding, always let us get old versions of textbooks, treated us like adults since there is a wider age range in CC, and was just a generally more comfortable, accepting environment. And for me, a A average student, it was really easy. I also had been diagnosed with a couple anxiety disorders at the end of high school, and it was a good first step in college while I started therapy and medication, and stabilized myself. \n\nIf you don't do a major that will have a hard time transferring, CC is a great option for anybody I think.",

Funny thing is, they were in cc and severely judgemental about anything financial\u2026 I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that there will people from all sides of the equation (but definitely more from the uni-to-cc side, it seems like?) that will judge others for these things, but it\u2019s super important to make the right choices for you :) congrats again, and I wish you the best!!!",

I worked full-time through community college and paid for my community college with tuition reimbursement from my company. I found a program that was 90-30, that is, three-fourths of my credits were done at the community college.\n\nI paid $6,762.00 for my first 90 credits, and $13,027.19 for my last 30 (I have the receipts). My diploma is no different than the person that paid $52,000+ to attend the university for four years. I talked to people that had $70,000 dollars of student debt from attending for three and a half years. *Not me*. I graduated with no student debt.\n\nWhen I transferred, it was all my credits that transferred. So the drunken dumb stuff I did that hurt my GPA? Didn't transfer. I transferred and then graduated with a 4.0 GPA because those community college grades didn't count. When I went to apply for graduate school, guess which grades were weighted more heavily? That's right, the university grades.\n\nI'll be looking to teach at the community college post-graduate school. I'm an industry professional and can give back so much of what was given to me. Community college is an excellent step for getting out of the way what we all have to take anyway. Remember your English 102 class? Most are held in these huge lecture halls being taught by TAs. Mine? Taught by a guy that worked in the city communications office. He writes for a living, and he doesn't show up to class as hung over as me.\n\nI can continue to extol the benefits of community college forever. For anyone thinking about taking out loans for four years to get the \"college\" experience - please, I beg you.... don't. The \"college\" experience is a lie told to you by universities.",

I was able to transfer a bunch of AP credit and finish a semester early spending almost nothing out of pocket. A lot of people feel that community college is too similar to high school but I felt like it enormously helped me and my other friends who had more difficult life situations (parents, working full time, disabled etc) have more flexibility. Especially if you are/were planning to attend a University close to home, CC is much better financially and convenience-wise.  \n\nOf course, like all college/uni life, each person has different needs and desires. CC may not be for everyone but I do think that more people need to give it a chance.",

When I made the decision to leave the program and go to a cc, everyone told me that I was \"throwing my life away\". I could also sense that some of the magnet teachers were disappointed. Uhh, yeah. I didn't really know how to feel.\n\nTwo years later, I've graduated and am (currently) transferring to my state uni (umd) to pursue a bachelor's. Now I'm ahead of many of my peers in terms of credit and coursework. I've also saved a shitload in tuition.\n\nP.s. you might wonder why I chose to go to a cc when I disrespected cc. I didn't initially. When I got the ad in the mail about the program I threw it away. It was only after my dad picked it up from the bin and show me again did I reconsider it (was also really really unhappy in my high school).\n\nI still think about this whole thing. It scares me that I probably would have the same brain dead mindset if it weren't for my experience. I guess it taught me to carefully consider other people's situations and that more often than not, ones preconceived notions about something are usually wrong.",

When I was a senior in high school and I applied to a rather competitive university, I got rejected and I was upset because I thought that I wouldn\u2019t have other options and my family kept on acting like any other options I\u2019d take would be bad compared to what I planned to take. Then I realized that I could just go to community college instead. When I said I was going to cc, a lot of people told me that I was stupid, and not smart enough for a four year university. \n\nBut in reality, community college saves you so much money. It helps you not fall into exorbitant debt that many 4 year university students would. I\u2019m so grateful I realized I could go to community college instead and I haven\u2019t regretted it at all. I wish people could hear this, cause it\u2019s barely talked about.",

Might be harder to get into there from community college. There might be other examples, probably including my degree being something that isn\u2019t studied or taught in too many schools at all. But say you want to be an entrepreneur- do some awesome business work, find funding, become a \u201cshark.\u201d You can absolutely do community college for a business degree and it won\u2019t matter. Same for a huuuge list of career paths. \n\nUniversities have different vibes and when you invest a lot in tuition, the school tends to have a different experiences on campus but I\u2019ve seen community colleges with so many programs and clubs and even Greek life so I just don\u2019t see the down side to them unless, like I said, you want something that specifically requires a planned path. \n\nI\u2019m excited for you :)",
