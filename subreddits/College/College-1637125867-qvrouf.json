  "text": "I graduated in May 2020 with my bachelors in nursing and have worked at a hospital on a telemetry unit and now the ER, but I want to get out of healthcare. I have the opportunity to go back to college for 18 months without accumulating any more debt. However, I don\u2019t know what degree to get now. I\u2019d really love to do something that I like and that makes decent money. What are some things that you do or that you want to do with your degrees?",
