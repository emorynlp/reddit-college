  "title:": "My professor in \"IT Morals and Society\" is telling us not to add sources/references at the end of the 1500 word assignment",
  "text": "He says we should take information from the internet or from books, but if we add sources or references he will think we just copy-pasted a random research paper and will count it as plagiarism. (Because research papers have sources listed at the end, so if we add sources it makes it look like a research paper apparently). The irony here is amazingly thick, he counts adding sources as plagiarism while not adding sources is fine, and again, this is *IT Morals and Society* class.",

Also for some reason, at least 5-6 people asked him about it (same question each time but worded differently) within a 15-minute frame, and his response to each of them *but one* was that our score will be penalized if we add references. *Except* when a student worded it as \"Should we add links to the bottom of the page to show where we got the information\" and he said we can do that, but it's not mandatory. Which makes me very confused, does this professor not know what a reference means?",
