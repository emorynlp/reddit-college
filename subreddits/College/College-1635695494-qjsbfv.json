  "text": "Lab science class. The online class is online with at-home labs and a 1 hr 20 min zoom session twice a weeks The professor\u2019s reviews says she\u2019s extremely easy. The in-person class is a 3 hr lecture twice a week and he has good reviews but they say he\u2019s not easy. \n\nMy other classes don\u2019t have in-person options so I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be very lonely if I do all online. Then again, I haven\u2019t made any friends in either of my in-person classes rn\u2026I plan to do an internship so I also worry that an in-person class will make that more stressful to work around. Any insights? I\u2019m taking 10 credits total.",
