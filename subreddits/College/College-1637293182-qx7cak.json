      "text": "Hey! Indian currently studying in an American University in Singapore! \n\nCan I ask what you wish to study? Depending on your field, you can choose an extracurricular. In my experience, however, clarity of thought in your SOP matters a lot more than having 10 diff extracurriculars. Of course, having a relevant extracurricular will do wonders for your application. \n\nI suggest seeing if any of the universities on your list of prospective unis would be sending representatives to an education fair that you could attend. Honestly, it was the best way for me to assess my chances and gain confidence that I had a genuine chance. \n\nHigher grades will provide more opportunities for scholarships and financial aid, so definitely don't discard that. \n\nIf you have any further questions please don't hesitate to ask!",

              "text": "Yeah, giving the SAT early is a good idea! Also give your TOEFL/IELTS around your last year. They're valid for two years so you'll need to make sure they're valid when you apply. \n\nYou sound like a very clear kid, so that can be your selling point when you apply. You don't need a ton of extracurriculars, especially since in your field it's tough to get even internships or volunteer opportunities without an educational background. But just show this level of clarity of thought in your statements and you'll be good to apply!",
