  "text": "I've been interested in politics since 8th grade and I really want to hold an office position. My first pick major is political science and I'm trying to double major with something that compliments it. I've seen history, philosophy, and business. I don't really want to do a major solely based on history and I heard a philosophy major is kind of a hard-to-find-employment-in degree (no offense to anyone out there who's majoring, it's just what i've seen on Google). Do you guys think a business major would compliment well?",

              "text": "Assuming you're getting your masters, which you tend to need in politics, your bachelor's becomes largely irrelevant. Just like how in your undergrad nobody cares about what you did in high school and in high school nobody cares what you did in middle school. Your bachelor's just needs to be good enough to get into grad school",

      "text": "It's not likely you'll be able to run for office right out of college, so you should think about what kind of entry-level job and initial career appeals to you. Do you want to work on political campaigns or get a non-elected job in local government? Do you want to go to law school and then work in that field for a while? Do you want to work in finance or non-profit management? \n\nA business degree is a fine choice if you think you might want to work in a business field right out of college, but I don't think your college major will meaningfully impact your appeal as a political candidate in ten or fifteen years. If you do have an interest in working in business, I highly recommend you pick a specialized business major like finance, accounting, supply chain management, MIS, or operations, rather then business management or business administration.",

      "text": "Honestly, when it comes to adding extra classes to your schedule, choose the ones you are the most interested in subject-wise, because when it comes down to it, those four years are going to be a whole lot better if you are doing things you are interested in (your GPA will prob be better too). Whenever you are looking at a major, look at the actual classes your school is offering in those departments, it will help you decide way more than just thinking about employment. However, if you are just going off of complementing your major, I would look at the ones that have overlap in grad requirements (if your college allows it), it will make your life a lot easier.  \n\nAlso, as far as job competition goes --- get internships!",

      "text": "Actually it really depends on how you want to apply your degree after you finish. If you\u2019re interested in graduate school, a philosophy minor or major really helps with orienting your thought process for those tests like the MCAT, LSAT, GMAT, etc. Equally philosophy is a good major for those who intend to be lawyers or politicians because it is the *why* a law should be made/defended. It could be seen as a more \u201chumanitarian\u201d approach.\n\nHowever if you\u2019re not interested in philosophy as a subject or law school or any grad school, a business major is a fiscally responsible choice. Also if you are interested in business legislature, when you first enter the political arena, it could be of better use. \n\nI would say it likely effects you the most after you graduate because you don\u2019t have experience in any other type of work. So if you want to first be working in business and business politics then business is a good choice. Also, you don\u2019t necessarily need to double major to stand out.\n\nHave you considered international studies or foreign language as a second major/minor? This is also a useful skill.",
