  "text": "So I'm in this group project of hell. I'm pretty much carrying this whole project and I'm busy enough as it is, having an internship as well to take care of.\n\nI've written pages of text and I'm quite attentive to detail, organized all the texts to make it suitable for submission (and have it be called a research project in the first place), their sources were a mess and not even done in proper APA - fixed that too, and so forth.\n\n- One girl had multiple chapters(?) with hardly any text in it. English is not my first language. I don't mean paragraphs, but the things you see on the contents page. Any way, 2,5 chapters could fit in a single page. Also, a lot of it was plagiarized.\n\n- The guy was the biggest problem. I asked him to write the methodology and results chapters, which was the easiest part, as the research has already been taken care of, and he just needs to do the writing (purpose/aim, methods and reasoning etc). However, he didn't understand, and doesn't understand the meaning of methodology, let alone how to write one. He has no clue on what to do, even though I wrote to him in clear and simplified language, as he's from Spain. Instead of writing his part, he's now actually going on a little vacation.\n\nDo language students (in his case English) not know/learn how to write a research project?",
