His webcam is so bad and he sets it up in front of the white board but we can't read anything he writes because its so low quality. I've made sure its not just my internet because everyone is complaining about it. He mutes everyone during class so we can't verbally say it to him and he seems to ignore the chat and emails about it. I'm assuming he's teaching from campus, unless he has wall mounted whiteboards in his house, so I would expect him  to be using a university supplied computer and webcam.", "author": "DevilsHand676", "created": 1599090875, "retrieved": 1632947158, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1612, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g3yhsal": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ilikt8/what_to_do_about_a_professor_that_uses_a_nintendo/g3yhsal/", "text": "Definitely go above his head to the department chair.
