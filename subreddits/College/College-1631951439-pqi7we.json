  "text": "So I\u2019ve grown up around alcohol my whole life, it\u2019s very much socially embedded in me. I\u2019ve drank before, and it\u2019s no big deal in my family. But now I\u2019m in college and I really don\u2019t get the appeal of getting absolutely fucked up. I watch other people do it, and it doesn\u2019t seem fun. They end up completely black out drunk before midnight, and everyone else has to take care of them. Why? Idk if it is because I\u2019m so used to being around alcohol that I just don\u2019t care for it. I know it gives people confidence and a nice buzz but then all I hear while trying to clean up is how horrible they are feeling. \n\nI also find it very \u201ccringe\u201d or just straight up embarrassing when I see someone really drunk. \n\nSure it\u2019s funny seeing drunk people, but eventually I just get tired of it. \n\nIdk. I just don\u2019t see the appeal. However having alcohol with a chill time having fun and things like that is great. But the whole goal of drinking to be drunk\u2026 I don\u2019t get it.",

Ngl I drink most nights (I\u2019m an older student) and it kinda seems like the norm amongst my friends and coworkers. Nobody talks about it!! \n\n\nSorry didn\u2019t know what you meant at first. And yeah there\u2019s nothing classy about getting hammered. \n\nTruth be told if you avoid doing that often in college you\u2019ll have a more fulfilling experience. Nothing wrong with doing it now and again but habitually is bad. I blew my first shot at college cause of partying. Don\u2019t be like me.",

If I drink excessively it will fuck up my brain for about a week. So it was moreso just absolute annoyance that I was dubbed \u201cbaby sitter of the night\u201d before asking if that was okay.",
