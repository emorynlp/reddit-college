I\u2019ve drank before, and it\u2019s no big deal in my family. But now I\u2019m in college and I really don\u2019t get the appeal of getting absolutely fucked up. I watch other people do it, and it doesn\u2019t seem fun. They end up completely black out drunk before midnight, and everyone else has to take care of them. Why? Idk if it is because I\u2019m so used to being around alcohol that I just don\u2019t care for it. I know it gives people confidence and a nice buzz but then all I hear while trying to clean up is how horrible they are feeling. \n\nI also find it very \u201ccringe\u201d or just straight up embarrassing when I see someone really drunk. \n\nSure it\u2019s funny seeing drunk people, but eventually I just get tired of it. \n\nIdk. I just don\u2019t see the appeal. However having alcohol with a chill time having fun and things like that is great. But the whole goal of drinking to be drunk\u2026 I don\u2019t get it.", "author": "Surreal-Numbat", "created": 1631951439, "retrieved": 1632801511, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "comments": {"hdjgbk6": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqi7we/what_is_the_appeal_of_alcohol/hdjgbk6/", "text": "I think the taboo around it in the states has something to do with it.
