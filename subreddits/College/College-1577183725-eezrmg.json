Unfortunately by then my financial aid was already affected but I\u2019ll be sorting that out with them on Monday. Thanks everyone for your helpful responses, and happy new year. \n\n\n\nSo this is going to be long but basically I took communications over last summer & due to a screw up with admissions I wasn\u2019t able to enroll from the waitlist. My professor, being a nice guy, told me to just keep attending the class and then enroll next semester and he would put in my final grade at the end even though I would not have to attend. I ended up getting 100% in the class and had a really great time, prof is very chill and made the whole thing really fun for everyone. So flash forward to finals this semester and I\u2019ve followed up with him multiple times to make sure he is going to enter my final grade (A), even though I have not been attending this semester per our agreement. He assures me every time that he will enter my grade and not to worry. We email back and forth maybe half a dozen times confirming it. I even go in on the last day to check in and make sure he remembers and he tells me I\u2019m all good. So, finals end, and I don\u2019t check my grades for a week or so because I\u2019m busy with other things. I check my final grades two days ago to see he has given me an F. Panicking, I email him that there has been a mistake. No response. As a part time faculty member there is no contact information for him in the directory other than his email, and the campus is closed down for the holidays. I\u2019m very stressed because I have never failed a class before and the F has effected my GPA drastically. If I am unable to contact him until some time has passed, will he still be able to fix my grade? It\u2019s 2:24 am and I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m so worried that this won\u2019t be able to be resolved and permanently damage my gpa. \n\nTLDR my professor entered my final grade wrong, isn\u2019t responding to my emails to correct it", "author": "dollarstorefruit", "created": 1577183725, "retrieved": 1632802310, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 901, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fbzejok": {"link": "/r/college/comments/eezrmg/my_professor_entered_my_final_grade_incorrectly/fbzejok/", "text": "Just send an email or visit him when the holidays are over.

TBH, it should have been the first grade he put in. Does this prof not look through all of his grades before submitting them?
