  "title:": "My professor entered my final grade incorrectly, gave me an F, and isn\u2019t checking email because of the holidays",
  "text": "Edit: He got back to me today and started the forms to change my grade. Unfortunately by then my financial aid was already affected but I\u2019ll be sorting that out with them on Monday. Thanks everyone for your helpful responses, and happy new year. \n\n\n\nSo this is going to be long but basically I took communications over last summer & due to a screw up with admissions I wasn\u2019t able to enroll from the waitlist. My professor, being a nice guy, told me to just keep attending the class and then enroll next semester and he would put in my final grade at the end even though I would not have to attend. I ended up getting 100% in the class and had a really great time, prof is very chill and made the whole thing really fun for everyone. So flash forward to finals this semester and I\u2019ve followed up with him multiple times to make sure he is going to enter my final grade (A), even though I have not been attending this semester per our agreement. He assures me every time that he will enter my grade and not to worry. We email back and forth maybe half a dozen times confirming it. I even go in on the last day to check in and make sure he remembers and he tells me I\u2019m all good. So, finals end, and I don\u2019t check my grades for a week or so because I\u2019m busy with other things. I check my final grades two days ago to see he has given me an F. Panicking, I email him that there has been a mistake. No response. As a part time faculty member there is no contact information for him in the directory other than his email, and the campus is closed down for the holidays. I\u2019m very stressed because I have never failed a class before and the F has effected my GPA drastically. If I am unable to contact him until some time has passed, will he still be able to fix my grade? It\u2019s 2:24 am and I can\u2019t sleep because I\u2019m so worried that this won\u2019t be able to be resolved and permanently damage my gpa. \n\nTLDR my professor entered my final grade wrong, isn\u2019t responding to my emails to correct it",

TBH, it should have been the first grade he put in. Does this prof not look through all of his grades before submitting them? I am a middle school teacher and I look over my grades before I submit them. If someone is failing, I look into it, mostly to cover my own ass. But in college, financial aid may be affected, and OP seems very engaged in the process so it's obviously important to OP! Who doesn't at least CHECK their work email when they are off? WHO? What animal doesn't even LOOK? Call me overly conscientious, but I think a mere glance at the email wouldn't be asking too much.",

Many faculty have to enter hundreds of final grades and the interfaces often suck (ours does). There's a system to take care of it (an online form in our case) and it's routine. There's no reason to worry, but it will probably take a few weeks to be completely addressed.",

          "text": ">The faculty member's Dean will likely be available sometime either Dec. 27 or 30 if you want to call.\n\nPlease don't do that. This is a simply, common problem that does *not* need intervention by a dean. As a department chair even I generally don't get bothered with grade errors, but it certainly does not need to be dumped on the dean's plate-- who would simply ask his admin support person to email the same prof the student did.\n\nThis is not a big deal. It will be fixed in January when people are back on campus-- there's nothing to panic about.",

              "text": "While I mostly agree with you, I do want to add a slight addendum: students on fin aid, scholarships, or have other obligations for high grades. Sometimes they have strict deadlines and require the transcript be sent almost immediately or its already been sent if its internal to the college. Since the aid has to be re released (disbursed is the word?), they have to check all this stuff now-ish or right after the holiday. Even if the aid group is a little less worried, seeing an \"F\" followed by like \"academic probation\" or \"Fin aid has been revoked,\" can freak out the best of anyone.\n\nThat said if the prof agreed, and you have ut in writing, your solid. If verbally, its probably still okay. Just make sure to remind him after the holidays if you don't get a response (but be reasonable and polite).",

Even the people who are processing academic probation and financial aid for spring are not working this week on most US campuses. At mine there is literally nobody there other than a token security team and the boiler operators in physical plant. A series of increasingly panicked emails going up the ladder to the dean is just going to annoy people, not make anything happen any faster.",
