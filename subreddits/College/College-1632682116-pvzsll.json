I like to work with numbers and a lot of people tell me I do good in whatever I put my mind to and that I have a good work ethic. However, because Im just now thinking about majoring in business, I don't have much knowledge about it besides being in Future Business Leaders of America for two years in high school and taking one principles of business class. Will going into a business major teach you everything you need to know as you go into the major and ultimately/hopefully get a job?", "author": "alvkevo", "created": 1632682116, "retrieved": 1632945943, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heh9emh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvzsll/business_students_can_someone_major_in_business/heh9emh/", "text": "You don't need to have any prior knowledge about business in order to do well in a business major and then get a good job. \n\nIf you decide to pursue business, I highly recommend you choose a specialized business major rather than business administration or business management. The more quantitative business majors, including finance, accounting, operations, supply chain management, and management of information systems (MIS), are all pretty in-demand and should give you good job options after college.\n\nA specialized business major is a better pick because the best entry-level jobs in business are mostly in a specific business function, like finance, accounting, supply chain management, operations, or IT management. Employers want to hire people who already have some relevant job skills for those roles, so they try to hire finance grads for the financial analyst jobs, supply chain management grads for the purchasing jobs, and so on.\n\nYou should also know that internships are very important if you are going to major in business, and you'll be a stronger applicant for entry-level jobs if you complete at least one internship before graduating. Internships also often result in a full-time job offer, so that's another good reason to prioritize internships while you are still in college.", "author": "clearwaterrev", "created": 1632755153, "upvotes": 1}, "hef1b2w": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvzsll/business_students_can_someone_major_in_business/hef1b2w/", "text": "You have more business experience now than I ever did and I'm a business student with a 4.0.
