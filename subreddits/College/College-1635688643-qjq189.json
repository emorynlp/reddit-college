  "text": "Im from a small country so i wanted to be somewhere with loads to do and with a variety of places to go and full of opportunities to meet people and experience new things. I ended up going to a small city with not many places to go, not many international students and also i hate my course as well. I havent met many people except my flatmates, the city center is just so small and i dont even like studying what im doing. I just stay in my room all day and go clubbing with my flatmates in a smapl club in town but that is literally it. Nothing else. I cant imagine that being my life for 3 years... Im fairly talkative so im not some introvert and yes i have joined societies. What do i do?",
