      "text": "I know this may sound annoying and like something your teacher will say, but focus on learning how calculus actually works. Calculus can be very difficult because e people tend to memorize formulas and steps to solving a certain type of problem and then fail the exams when they actually need to apply what they learned. Convince yourself calculus is interesting and try to master the basics. Once you understand the basics at a level where you feel you can teach it, every other topic will make sense. All the topics are connected and are simply applications of calculus. Try to watch some more conceptual videos in YT rather than specific topic ones",

I could appreciate the way it worked, but I never enjoyed doing it. Cal 3 (the one with series and the different graph shapes like limacon or cartioid) always strained my lackluster math skills. It came down to working many more problems from the text book than you think you should have to. I also tried to look up the concepts I didn't really understand from class lectures. Full disclosure, I got a C in the class, but it was because I didn't work enough problems.\n\nIf you are talking about cal 2 out of 4, that one is basically cal 1 but more complicated. It's kinda like adding extra steps. That one comes down to working more problems and looking up concepts you don't fully understand.",

Because of this, and the fact it was the first time my Prof. had taught a remote, online class led to there being a lot of leeway in the grading and eventual implementation of curves. I didn't do most of the labs, used stuff like Symbolab for the HW and quizzes, actually did the two tests, and ended the semester with a C+ which was bumped up to a B due to a generous curve at the end of it (a lot of people had trouble with the remote lab access, so they couldn't do it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid I actually learn anything? No, but I did manage to mostly catch back up to my course plan that had to be put on hold after having to retake Calculus 1.",
