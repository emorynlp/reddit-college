And by the looks of it you probably wouldn\u2019t get in because you need a very high gpa which takes a lot of work and sometimes sacrificing fun. \n\nIf all you do is party and do the bare minimum for your studies you\u2019ll probably be at like a 3.1-3.3 gpa by the time you are a senior and looking at grad programs. On top of it, you seem to have no desire to get working experience during your college. It seems like you think college is a 4 year vacation and then the work starts, which is false. The work starts in college and if you plan on going to grad school then it\u2019s even more serious.",
