  "text": "I applied for a grad school but realized I won\u2019t be attending it. Decisions come out soon but there\u2019s an internship program at a different uni I\u2019m interested in but being accepted or enrolled in grad school would make me ineligible. I\u2019m not sure if this situation I\u2019m in would make me ineligible too.",
