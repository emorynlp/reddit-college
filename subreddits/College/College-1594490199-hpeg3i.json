Also make sure you guys right every due date down. Personally I use the app \u201cMy Homework Student Planner\u201d since I can write all my due dates down and it will give me a notification on the day of when my assignments are due so I can due that same day. It helps because I have a lot of doctor appointments because of my disability and I can easily forget if I have homework due if I don\u2019t have a physical reminder so that text notification is really helpful.\n\nEdit: The book \u201cThe Science of Self-learning\u201d is by Peter Hollins\n\nEdit Edit: Holy shit! 204 upvotes?!!! I don\u2019t deserve this many I just wanted to share some tips since I did whole year of online classes and can offer some advice but thank you so much.\n\nEdit x3: if you need help focusing while studying I recommend downloading the app \u201cForest\u201d. It\u2019s an that uses the pomodoro technique. Basically you set the timer in the app and watch a tree grow. If you take your phone off the forest to go web search or something like that tree will die and and you have to start over. Most people don\u2019t wanna see a tree die so it helps forces you to get off your phone and actually focus on what you are doing in that moment.\n\nEdit x4: If you have problems with retaining info then I suggest you write you notes in class on paper and then transfer to computer app such as Microsoft OneNote or Evernote. Since you are rewriting it you naturally will retain more of it.", "author": "Its_Rare", "created": 1594490199, "retrieved": 1632946796, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2104, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fz13vt2": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hpeg3i/tips_for_the_students_who_are_worried_about_their/fz13vt2/", "text": "Great suggestions! \n\nFor those looking to go to a university who knows how to do online learning right, check us out! https://bit.ly/39oIW08\n\n87% of American Public University students are working adults who need flexibility to keep learning, so our class format is designed so you can log in and work on your own schedule.
