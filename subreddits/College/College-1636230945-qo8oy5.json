  "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI've been living in an off-campus apartment for the last 2.5 months now. Whenever my roommate (there are 3 of us) buys something for the apartment, he tells us how much we all need to pay. The thing is, he never communicates what he is buying. \n\nSo far I have helped pay for paper towels, soap brushes, trash bags, and toilet cleaner. I get it, they are all communal use. The thing is, I buy things for the house too, dish soap, sponges, and toilet paper. I don't go telling all my roommates how much they owe me for each thing. \n\nThe last things he purchased that he wants us to pay for include absurdly expensive soap brushes ($2.50 cost for each of us), drain unclogger ($2.50 for each of us), and trash bags. I don't want to pay for the stupid soap brushes; I just bought sponges that are <$2 for a pack of 3 and do the same exact thing. I also think it is unnecessary for me to contribute to the drain unclogger because I don't dump any food down our sink (roomies tend to dump rice down it). \n\nI have just been going along with it and trying not to make mountains out of molehills. But I never agreed to split expenses like this and don't agree with stupidly expensive shit. \n\nSo, y'all think I just pay up and forget about it? Or say something? \n\nThanks, guys!",

      "text": "I'd just tell him that in the future, if he wants paid back for household items, he should consult you *before* he buys them so he isn't buying unnecessarily expensive shit you'll never use.\n\n\nOr, find ways to split it up that don't require money. Maybe everyone gets assigned certain items they buy, or you take turns buying them. In my house, we just take turns buying communal items with the understanding that we're gonna buy what's cheap. Then if someone wants weird expensive shit, that's their choice lol. If it's a weird one-time purchase, we'll agree on what we want and reimburse our share of it over Venmo, but that's only once we've said \"yeah, if you go get one of those, I'll chip in.\"\n\n\nYou don't want to start a fight or anything obviously, but at the end of the day it *is* your money, which is a limited resource. Plus, part of living together in a house is working with people whose go-to way of doing things is very different than yours, so setting boundaries and finding some kind of system is part of sharing the space.",

          "text": "> Or, find ways to split it up that don't require money. \n\nI think this is generally the easiest way to do it when you're living with someone. Rather than trying to precisely split tasks/money, you find the person most interested/best suited and then just have them do it all.\n\nFor example, with one of my college era roommates, he did all of the cleaning, I bought all of the household supplies and did the dishes/took out the trash.",
