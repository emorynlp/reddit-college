  "text": "Hi there,\n\nSo I'm a pretty avid reader/writer with a big interest in sustainability/protecting the environment and educating others. As the title states, I'm wanting to pursue this as my major for a bachelor's degree and then try to get a job as an environmental education specialist or a community planner; while I work on my fiction novels, which might being in money eventually.\n\nDoes this sound like a good plan? I'm a bit worried about I'd this field is particularly over-staturated but I can't really find any information on people with a dual major like this.",
