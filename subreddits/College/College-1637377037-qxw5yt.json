      "text": "As someone who is nowhere near 19 anymore, 1000k doesn't get you very far past 19 like you'd expect it to. The best course of action is to invest it wisely, pretend like you don't have it at all, and follow whichever path you would choose if you really didn't. This would likely set you up for a very nice future that you can continue contributing to.",
