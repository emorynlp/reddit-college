      "text": "If you\u2019re concerned, then wean yourself off of it. Swap a Red Bull for a soda, then swap the soda for a coffee, and eventually stop the coffee. Find a water bottle you love and whenever you want a drink go for that first. Then if you really are tired , try to get by with the least amount of caffeine possible \n\nIt is possible to get through college with limited caffeine intake. You just have to make sure your also sleeping a decent amount each night.",

I was tired for so long the week I started feeling better I had an appointment to see a Dr. For autoimmune(canceled it lol) \n\nSomething like 40 days. It was brutal. Now ive got a yeti mug. Im allowed that much coffee a day. That it.\n\nThe catalyst was my 33 year old coworker who went home, fell asleep on his couch and didn't wake up because his heart gave up. We were finding his half finished energy drinks around the department up to a week later.",

Your body is *not* made for that and it will catch up to you.  1 coffee a day, and then have the red bull for special occasions is what I'd aim for.",
