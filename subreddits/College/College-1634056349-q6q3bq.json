  "text": "I am a CNA in memory care at a nursing home. We had a full time coworker die unexpectedly and I took an 8am-11pm shift yesterday to cover because we\u2019re already understaffed and I couldn\u2019t in good conscience leave the residents without enough help. I stayed up until 6am after work studying for a midterm I had early this morning and the one I missed, I made it to the early exam and was absolutely exhausted afterwards and thought a nap would better prepare me for the next exam. My alarm didn\u2019t even wake me up, and I woke up on my own after the exam was over. I have no interest in lying about it, so I already emailed my professor explaining the exact situation pretty much the way I did here and adding that I really do care about the class (one of my major specific classes) and didn\u2019t mean any disrespect to him or the course by having something like this happen. I also said that I understood that this was my fault and would take whatever consequences come with being honest. \nThe exam is 25% of my grade so there\u2019s a possibility I can pass if I do well in everything else, but I don\u2019t know what will happen yet so I\u2019m trying to just stay calm until I hear back. I\u2019m really embarrassed about the situation, this has been my biggest fear since I started school. Has anyone had anything like this happen? Was your professor nice about it? And if they don\u2019t let me make it up should I drop the class or try to pass it anyway? \nI failed a class last semester because my cat dropped dead in front of me after he had a heart attack and my professor wouldn\u2019t let me retake the final later (40% of my grade) and I couldn\u2019t stop crying so I failed it. I do not want to fail another class\ud83d\ude1e",

It doesn't make much sense to try and pass a course when you would have to get a score that is unrealistic or mathematically impossible. I would also make sure I was not going to end up with a D in a course where I needed a B or C as a prerequisite for an upper level course, because at that point I would be retaking it either way.\n\n>I also said that I understood that this was my fault and would take whatever consequences come with being honest.\n\nI am doubtful they would not offer at least some level of recourse for you. Have you read through your syllabus or university/department policy for missed exams? Is there language in either regarding unprecedented situations or mental health issues?\n\nIf I got a firm \"no\", I would probably share the story with a university counselor or someone outside of that department who has the ability to give you an administrative exception for what you had gone through or refer you to someone who could do that.",

      "text": "There was a guy in one of my classes and he missed like 3/4 of the final exam, by oversleeping since he stayed up the night before studying. He showed up and the prof did not let him take it with the remaining amount of time. The prof told the student that they would talk after the exam was over. He ended up letting the student take the exam later in the day with no penalty. This doesn't really help, but just shows sometimes professors can be nice.",

      "text": "In your case, it's possibly illegal to leave work. It would be for nurses to leave, in that case. Plus, with COVID, everyone knows you there's a shortage of people in your work environment. It's not like you just stayed up all night drinking. With the past issue with your cat, it's unfortunate, but some people, and most employers, don't put value on the human animal bond. So, hopefully, you have better luck. If you don't, consider talking to your advisor. Actually, maybe shoot them an email. Sometimes, they can be your shaved knuckle in the whole.",
