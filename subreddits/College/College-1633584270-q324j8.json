      "text": "The types of sororities (and fraternities) you see in movies are traditional Greek organizations. They exist largely for the purpose of heterosexual dating and socializing, despite often selling themselves as altruistic.\n\nThis leads to some inevitable results. Such fraternities are almost invariably the places with the 'hot' parties and built around certain common activities (most of the football players will be one place, the business majors another, etc.). Such sororities tend to have a 'look' that means they're only recruiting girls who meet certain standards of attractiveness (and often peculiarly narrow ones).\n\nAt big state schools (particularly ones with competition Division I NCAA teams), these organizations are considered the 'top' - most competitive - Greek organizations and thus carry a certain cachet in the dating marketplace.\n\nHowever, at most schools you'll find non-competitive residential fraternities that are not part of this social structure. Unlike traditional fraternities/sororities, such fraternities are frequently co-ed.",

          "text": "Most of what you said is absolutely not true (aside from a select few bad actors).\nThe movies are very unrealistic for the day-to-day life. It is a lot of work to maintain the building, plan events, keep up alumni engagement, accounting, etc. This semester, my fraternity had two philanthropy events and we raised 10k for multiple sclerosis. The traditional social fraternities/sororities have had lots of LGBTQ+ members in the past. It is also significantly cheaper than living on campus a good chunk of the time. For a low income student, this system has been a godsend to me. Do your research before you post misinformation.",
