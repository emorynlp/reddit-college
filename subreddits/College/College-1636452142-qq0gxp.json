  "text": "Technically 3 courses but that's because our assignments are barely graded and they are like 3 points so I'm just waiting till my stuffs graded there. \n\nI'm failing Math with a 45 and Spanish with a 52. In math it's literally my exams, it's killing me I'm horrible at them but everything else I'm doing great at. \n\nI'm stressed as we have just a month left and I've been studying like crazy, I did multiple techniques and I was getting better then my grade got worse.",

      "text": "math and foreign language require you focus on the big picture not the details. Its obvious you are not doing the former. It takes a certain number of hours of study before you can see the big picture and you have not reached that many hours yet (not even close). My advice, if you can afford to without the silly probation or satisfactory academic progress appeal, withdraw the entire quarter and retake it the following quarter so that you can reach those number of hours.",
