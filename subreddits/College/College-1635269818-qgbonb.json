Most of the professors were/are actual attorneys so they treat the classes like we\u2019re in actual law school which makes it pretty tough. For my school as a whole tho, I would probably say engineering is the hardest. My bf is an engineering major and bro they are brutal w them.",

              "text": "I\u2019m gna use my introductory business law class that I took spring 2020 as an example. Like I mentioned the professor used to be an attorney so even tho it was literally an introductory class he had super high expectations. He expected everyone to have prior knowledge of the law before even getting into his class (which doesn\u2019t make sense since it\u2019s literally the first law class out of like 6 or 7 so of course if it\u2019s introductory a lot of ppl aren\u2019t gna know anything). He would give like 50-60 pages of reading each night and expect you to have read it multiple times and completely understand every single concept before even getting to class. And it was like law school in the sense that there was no hw at all. Your grade was solely based on attendance, midterm/final, and a few briefs. And he did a lot of cold calls and you\u2019d lose points if you couldn\u2019t answer so there was a lot of just teaching yourself and reviewing to make sure you were ready for class. The tests were always a mix of multiple choice and free response but like they weren\u2019t straight forward definition questions, they were scenario questions where the answer wasn\u2019t abundantly clear. He also graded extremely tough for the briefs and he wouldn\u2019t give much feedback as to why he gave that score so it was very hard to know what to improve on. I think like this style of teaching is fine for an upper division course and I\u2019d definitely do well with it now that I\u2019ve taken a few more law courses and know more but this was literally a lower division 200 level class that he was putting so much pressure on us. And this was during the semester where we switched to zoom in the middle so that didn\u2019t help either.",

The hardest class by far was physical chemistry just because it was so theoretical and it's such a small quantum level that most of us weren't used to thinking that and went into engineering to avoid thinking that. After that it really just depended on each person. For some people it was fluid dynamics for other people it was heat transfer for other people it was process control. The pre-program courses were also actually pretty difficult as well again because they were so theoretical such as multivariable calculus differential equations organic chemistry etc. At least for those of us with the engineering mindset courses with lots of computation and homework assignments were much preferable to something theoretical.",
