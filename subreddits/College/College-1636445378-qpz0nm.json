  "text": " Currently in the third semester of my A. S in criminal justice. Once this semester is done I will have one more and will get my A.S. I don't know how I have been doing it but I have been able to take 12 credits and maintain a 4.0 GPA. I am also a full-time law enforcement officer who works the night shift and a father of a three-year-old. I have no life and I can only work on my schoolwork on my days off at night time when my family is asleep. Any other people out there working full time and going to college?",
