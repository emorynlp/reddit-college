  "text": "There was an easy quiz I knew how to do. I'd used my notes on all previous quizzes and never had anybody comment on it. I used my notes again and now I'm getting brought up on academic integrity charges. They dont believe my ignorance cause nobody else used notes but I've been in multiple classes where it's common people have open notes quizzes but just dont use them, plus I dont pay attention to other people. Really sucks.",
