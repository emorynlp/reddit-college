  "title:": "Is it possible to apply to attend a four year college in the fall if you still have a summer class to take?",
  "text": "I am currently in community college and working towards applying to a four year school. I had all my ducks in a row and semesters laid out nicely. I was approved to go on school sponsored trip to Death Valley for geology (I am in VA, so this is a BIG trip), but the trip counts as a four credit class. Obviously it is one not necessary for the transfer, but would be amazing!\n\nSo, this does throw off my plan. I am in my first semester and am hoping to transfer for fall of 2023. I'll obviously survive if I cannot transfer until spring of 2024. \n\nMy question is, if I end up having to take a class summer of 2023, would I still be able to start four year college that fall? To clarify- can I apply for the four year school in spring of 2023, take that one class in summer of 2023, and still (theoretically of course) start the four year school that same fall?",

It's not necessary for the transfer. \n\nHonestly, even if it was, you'd probably be okay.\n\nEdit: When in doubt, call/ask someone who knows for sure. My guess is that'd be admissions at your 4 year school. You should ask them. But I'd be extremely surprised if your trip was a problem.",
