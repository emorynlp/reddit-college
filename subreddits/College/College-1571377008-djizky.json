Specifically, I attend an art school that\u2019s relatively rigorous in terms of workload. For the most part though I had been able to manage my work fine, but then midterms rolled in. I was pulling all nighters left and right for all of my projects and getting 0-2 hours of sleep almost every day. Today, I had a midterm in art history and I had the bright idea to once again, pull another all nighter. I thought I had the willpower to do so but I ended up passing out at around 7am and then waking up in horror at around 3pm. I had slept through all of my 37 alarms (Also apologies to my roommate I\u2019m trying to get better at it) and missed my midterm. I frantically emailed my professor and told him my situation and if there\u2019s a remedy to this whole disaster, but I have a good feeling he\u2019s not going to cut me any slack. I don\u2019t really know what to do at this point and if I should just withdraw from the class because the only grades we get are a midterm, final paper, and final exam. (the midterm is 25% of our grade haha end me) So if I get a 0 on the midterm is there really any hope for getting that up to a passing grade? Also if I fail a class does that mean I have to wait another year to graduate because I was a couple of credits short? I\u2019m honestly just confused and miss my dog\n\nEDIT: Got an email back from him and told me that I just have to deal with my mistake.

You sound like a very devoted student and thats all you need to succeed, use this as a lesson and learn from your mistake. Sleep and a full belly are the 2 most important things during a test, your brain needs sleep to retain information, otherwise your just cramming stuff into it as fast as possible till the test and then poof, you forget.\n\nI had a friend who got out of high school with the governors medal (its a thing in canada for like super good students) and now he\u2019s in college and he\u2019s in the same situation. He\u2019s putting way too much pressure on himself and study\u2019s 24/7 and its not really a healthy habit.", "author": "Bigthom63", "created": 1571400274, "upvotes": 4}, "f45vswb": {"link": "/r/college/comments/djizky/pulled_four_all_nighters_and_ended_up_sleeping/f45vswb/", "text": "I did the same exact thing and slept through my bio final, though my teacher let me take it with his honors section the next day.\n\nWorst case scenario you just take the class online over the summer or something my dude", "author": "TheMiniLiar", "created": 1571397581, "upvotes": 2}, "f45rz0a": {"link": "/r/college/comments/djizky/pulled_four_all_nighters_and_ended_up_sleeping/f45rz0a/", "text": "I know how projects can be and I know that sometimes your brain just can't get to working until its in crisis mode.

Find out how your school factors retakes into your GPA. At my school, if you fail a class and retake it and get say a B, then the failing grade, while still on your transcript, doesn't factor into the GPA at all and is completely replaced by the retake. If your school does something similar I would suggest staying in the class even if you don't think you can get the C. For one, who knows you might surprise yourself and pull it off, and two, if you have to retake it, it'll be really easy the second time around. Retaking it (or withdrawing and taking it later) absolutely does not mean it'll take an extra year or even semester to graduate. You could either take it in addition to the other courses you would normally have one semester (which yes, would make you even busier, but if you learned it pretty well the first time around it should be manageable), or you could take it over a summer. You could see if your school will accept transfer credits from any community colleges, and if those colleges offer it online over the summer as that makes it quite manageable both time and money-wise. Though having it transferred will probably make the GPA factoring even more complicated.

So say that you are an art major but you are not in the official art program yet. You need to research the requirements to get into the major and every university's art program has different requirements.\n\nFor example, some Universities have very strict programs and may not allow you to withdraw from ANY of the prereqs or give you a limited number of withdrawals or attempted retakes. And if you break the major requirements you may be completely barred from getting an art degree from the school and have to transfer to another school if you want a degree in the field. \n\nAll I'm saying is do your research before withdrawing a class.
