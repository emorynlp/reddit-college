  "text": "Hello! so, as the title hints at I am currently choosing between two colleges. I am absolutely in love with both of them and i can\u2019t seem to choose? I want to major in either computer science or polymer engineering. what would y\u2019all choose? \n\nCollege 1 (Southern miss) \n- Smaller campus \n- know more people \n- cheaper tuition \n- just as good program as other college  \n- vibe was welcoming \n\nCollege 2 (MSU) \n- large campus \n- will have many people from my school at this college next year in my program \n- double tuition cost \n- no polymer engineering \n- not great dorms\n- vibe was very serious and quiet",
