Well, that happened to me this morning at 5 am, but I wasnt dreaming, and I woke up halfway between the mattress  and when I hit the floor. \n\nFor reference, my bed is lofted more than 6 feet off the ground. I'm honestly lucky to be alive, and only sustaining \"minor\" injuries at that. Somehow I managed to land in one small area between multiple dangerous corners like my fridge and desk, and I didnt land on my head, but on my knees. My left knee took the full force of a 6 foot drop. It was busted open, and I believe I may have minor fractures in both knees. \n\nMoral of the story, please for the love of god use a rail; I know it's rare, so rare that the police officer that arrived at my dorm (after I called the police because I couldnt extend my legs) told me I was the first one he'd seen do this in his 35 years on campus.
