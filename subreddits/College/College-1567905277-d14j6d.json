  "text": "You know that weird dream sensation where you're in and out of sleep, and you feel like you're falling then jerk awake when you land? Well, that happened to me this morning at 5 am, but I wasnt dreaming, and I woke up halfway between the mattress  and when I hit the floor. \n\nFor reference, my bed is lofted more than 6 feet off the ground. I'm honestly lucky to be alive, and only sustaining \"minor\" injuries at that. Somehow I managed to land in one small area between multiple dangerous corners like my fridge and desk, and I didnt land on my head, but on my knees. My left knee took the full force of a 6 foot drop. It was busted open, and I believe I may have minor fractures in both knees. \n\nMoral of the story, please for the love of god use a rail; I know it's rare, so rare that the police officer that arrived at my dorm (after I called the police because I couldnt extend my legs) told me I was the first one he'd seen do this in his 35 years on campus. Be safe, take care of yourself, and please use a rail.",

I was sleeping on the top bed with no rail, while my roommates bed was perpendicular to my bed but under me, such that my head was above his bed but my body and legs were above the ground (so it kinda made a giant L shape). I don't remember clearly what happened but I definitely rolled off and fell to the ground, and my hip took most of the damage. But surprisingly it really didn't hurt too much and nothing got broken or anything. In fact I was so tired that the fall barely woke me up, I just stood, up, climbed back to my bed, and passed out again. My real question, the way our beds were set up, was how my head didn't land in my roommate's bed while the rest of my body had nowhere to go but the ground. I don't know if I would have survived that kind of fall.",

Rails and Guards by themselves are from about $30 to a really nice wooden style for around $150 with light googling.\n\nAlso noticed this article of interest.
