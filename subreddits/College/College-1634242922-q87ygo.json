  "text": "you have to have a parking sticker to park anywhere on campus from the hours of 8-4. visitors are allowed to park in any campus parking lots from 4pm-2am. i don\u2019t have a sticker but parked on campus from 5-8. i went back to my car and saw that i had a ticket that was given to me at 7pm. i called the school and they said \u201care you a student?\u201d and i said yes and they said i don\u2019t count as a visitor since i\u2019m a student so i have to pay a fine for parking on campus. so basically it would\u2019ve been free to park if i wasn\u2019t a student or if i had a parking sticker but they gave me a ticket for being a student. i just don\u2019t really see how that makes any sense?",

Our campus has a parking lot and it's typically full by 8am when the earliest classes start at 8:30. By 4pm the parking lot might be half full at best.\n\nIt doesn't make sense at all. Why should anyone else care if someone is parking their car in a campus parking lot during off-peak hours if capacity is not an issue.",

      "text": "Yeah those rules are just poor. We have resident student lots and commuter student lots, and guests have to park on the side of the road. Were you there just for class or a project/homework? I feel like you count as a visitor given the rules your school set up. I'd ask if there was a way around it given that it's your first offense and the rules are unclear.",

      "text": "Im not seeing how it doesnt make sense. It would be pretty poor form to require visitors to pay for parking, considering that they would likely be coming to the college to participate in something, like giving a speech or whatever. Students are required to pay for parking, if you dont have a parking pass then you get a ticket. Also consider that a visitor is going to take up a parking pace for like 1 day, and students are going to use the space for much morr than that. Yes, they can give you a ticket.",
