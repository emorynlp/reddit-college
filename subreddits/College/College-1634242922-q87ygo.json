  "text": "you have to have a parking sticker to park anywhere on campus from the hours of 8-4. visitors are allowed to park in any campus parking lots from 4pm-2am. i don\u2019t have a sticker but parked on campus from 5-8. i went back to my car and saw that i had a ticket that was given to me at 7pm. i called the school and they said \u201care you a student?\u201d and i said yes and they said i don\u2019t count as a visitor since i\u2019m a student so i have to pay a fine for parking on campus. so basically it would\u2019ve been free to park if i wasn\u2019t a student or if i had a parking sticker but they gave me a ticket for being a student. i just don\u2019t really see how that makes any sense?",

      "text": "It makes sense because students who have a parking ticket pay to have their car parked there. So it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them if others were able to park their car for free, even if it was just for a few hours.",

      "text": "Yeah those rules are just poor. We have resident student lots and commuter student lots, and guests have to park on the side of the road. Were you there just for class or a project/homework? I feel like you count as a visitor given the rules your school set up. I'd ask if there was a way around it given that it's your first offense and the rules are unclear.",
