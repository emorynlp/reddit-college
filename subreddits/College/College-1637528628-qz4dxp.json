  "text": "I wanna take this Spanish class next semester and I already took the prerequisite Spanish class however there\u2019s a another English class prerequisite which I haven\u2019t taken but will next semester, I emailed my advisor stating that I already have the one prerequisite and they didn\u2019t respond yet. Is there any chance I would be able to take the class? I can take the Spanish class and the English prerequisite as a co-requiste? I already have an A in the Spanish class I\u2019m taking now and If I can\u2019t take Spanish next semester I\u2019m gonna have to wait until next spring semester then\ud83d\ude10",

You need to discuss this with the chair of your school's Languages Department, as they - not the professor - will most likely make the call.\n\nIn some schools it is possible to take a prereq at the same time as a later course, but this is not a guarantee, so ask the department chair for further guidance.  Pretty much all you can do.",
