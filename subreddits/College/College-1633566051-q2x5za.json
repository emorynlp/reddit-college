  "title:": "How to Prepare Papers and Organise Notes for a Binder?",
  "text": "Hey guys, I just started my first semester at uni. So far I've been taking notes on plain paper, hoping to eventually place them in a binder. I'd like to organise my notes with a binder in the end, but I don't really like writing on plain paper without any lines and punching in holes on every paper. Are there places where I can get already prepared paper for this? Also, how did/do you guys organise notes yourself?",
