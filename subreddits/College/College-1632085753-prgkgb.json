I'm planning on double majoring in Poli Sci (or other gov/public policy-related major depending on the school) and international relations. At the moment, I would like to go to Law School and work as a lawyer for the government or some type of intelligence agency. \n\nI'm pretty set with choosing a Poli Sci or related major, but am not sure whether international relations would be a good idea.
