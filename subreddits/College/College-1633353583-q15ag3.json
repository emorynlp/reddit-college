  "text": "Medicine student. I own a desktop as well. Deciding between Ipad Classic/Air and MS Surface Go 2. Don't know which one I should take. I have nearly all my books as ebooks and need to be able to take notes easily/write in the actual pdf. Which one would you recommend?",

      "text": "I have the iPad air and I use it for all of my ebooks and notes! For taking notes and writing in the actual pdf it really depends on what apps you have. The standard Notes that comes with the ipad is easy for quick notes but you\u2019ll need to get a different app to write in a pdf such as Markup. A good note taking app is goodnotes or notability.\n\nI like the ipad because I own other apple products and switching between the two is seamless. The apple pencil is easy to charge but I needed a pencil grip for it. I like that the ipad has a lot of accessories making it so I can choose what kind of case I need and other things like that. The ipad also has a screen cover that feels like paper and helps make your handwriting neater. The apple pencil also offers pencil tips in case yours wears down.\n\nCan\u2019t speak on the MS Surface Go2, but my experience with an ipad has exceeded my expectations",

      "text": "I would go with the Surface. The apps that you use on your desktop will also work on the Surface. The Surface is more of laptop that can be use as a tablet. If you go with the Surface the new one come out this week. So I suggest to shop around, Some stores might be clearance out their old stock, so you could get it cheaper.",
