  "text": "I'm not sure whether college is the right move for me.\n\nI'm currently 22 years of age, working as a maintenance technician at a factory, Mon-Sat 1pm-1030pm \n\nI don't know if I'd have the time to pursue my schooling and do work as well, and I'm getting married in november. \n\nI'm intelligent, with a good work ethic. \n\nI don't know what field I would pursue; I've thought about surgeon, as I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life.\n\nI want to find a career I can make enough money to live comfortably and eventually invest my income into a path of financial freedom. (Have enough passive income/a business that I can be free from the confines of a job/hours of a job)\n\nAny advice?? Career paths that pay well? \nYears it takes to get the degrees for these careers?\nWhat's college like? Cost of college if I go to the college in my state? (I've heard going to college in a different state if you're not a resident can cost more)",

      "text": "My advice is to do something you like and take it slow! College is a long process especially if you tack on medical school to be a surgeon. Not to dissuade you of course, but they will ask you why you chose to specifically get your MD instead of operating on other levels such as nursing or PA. These are similar routes that you should research and these routes require less schooling than an MD. There are also roles such as surgical tech that can help you experience the operating room at a much lower level (although I can\u2019t speak on the pay).\n\nAccounting is not very flexible in schedule but it does pay well and you would have work from home opportunities. Accounting only requires a bachelors. Computer science can be flexible too and it can pay well depending on how you utilize your skills. \n\nCollege is hard. Just a lot of studying outside of the classroom on top of doing the assigned work. I would recommend just enrolling in one class and take it slow.  Any progress is better than none. And you have tons of time to decide what you want to do. You\u2019re also allowed to change your mind later in life too. And you can get into grad school regardless of what your bachelors is in as long as you have their pre reqs done. So really, you\u2019re not landlocked into a major or career for a while. And even still, you can apply your degree to a different career field too. \n\nLook up in state tuition for the specific college you want to go to as it varies between all colleges. But yes, in state is cheaper than out of state! If they give you the rates by credit hours, typically one class is 3-4 credit hours.",
