  "text": "Yeah I know I\u2019m most likely in the minority here, but I find online classes way easier to manage. I\u2019m mostly in asynchronous courses so I don\u2019t have to worry about attendance, which  helps.  When I had In person classes it was hard for me to keep up with strict attendance policies and attend every single class.  I also was really never effective in learning in class, I always had to do outside research and studying which is how I mostly learned my material, even since HS. \n\nThe only two problems I have with online classes are the lack of social interaction (with students and even your professor) and the fact that at times it can still be challenging to motivate myself.",

I don\u2019t like async, but scheduled online zoom lectures are ideal for me. \n\nI have some chronic health problems, and now when I\u2019m feeling sick I can just attend class from bed without any problem. If I\u2019m really not feeling well, I can turn my camera off. If I need a heating pad or one of my meds it\u2019s always there. And I never have to squeeze into an uncomfortable lecture deck \u2014 I can be at my desk set up which I have exactly how I like it. \n\nI also love all the time I save by not having to get to and from class \u2014 i just have a lot more time more than I used to and the extra free time is nice. Oh, and back to back classes are so much easier. Now I can go and make myself good food in between, or do all kinds of useful things instead of frantically running between classes. My room is actually clean bc i can straighten for a few min here and there during the day. And I don\u2019t get stuck on campus aimlessly between classes. I can cook myself a real meal during lunch, or take a nap in a hammock like I did today.",

      "text": "It has its pros and cons, I imagine.\n\nMy first year of college was a lockdown year. I have never even been in my university building, and I notice I kind of 'miss' the experience. Surely it's nice to watch lectures at my own pace from the comfort of my room, but part of the appeal of college to me is nice old buildings and fancy lecture halls. I was looking forward to 'the whole experience' if you know what I mean.\n\nOnline lectures have also made it so that my teachers don't know who I am. Nor did I manage to make any friends so far. Nobody knows me and I don't know anyone. I need to do a bachelor thesis from behind my laptop, without having access to the recourses my college would normally have available for me.\n\nAnother problem I have with online lectures is that they are more boring. It is tedious to listen to. And since I am already on my PC I feel inclined to also do other things (such as Reddit). I just cannot stare at a screen for 6 hours a day, but that is what it often comes down to.\n\nI have also noticed the whole online lecture thing has led to teachers not sticking to their schedules. \"Y'all are home anyway so where do you need to go\" or whatever their mindset is. I have teachers whose 1,5 hour lectures take 2 or even 2,5 hours. There was one class where I wasn't able to sit any of the lectures through to the end, because I had to go to work and the teacher was still going. I get that they don't need to worry about classroom availability or tight schedules, but I still have things to do. You can't just consume an extra hour of my day because you feel like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah: Long story short - it has its advantages. I do college from home, meaning I don't need to find an apartment, meaning I don't need to pay ridiculous rent fees. But boy is this a loss of quality.",

When I told the professor in front of the whole class (without naming names) she told me that all the professors knew that cheating was rampant and what could she do about it?  When I suggested not doing multiple choices quizzes with the answers in Quizlet, she said it would take too much time.  When I suggested it was more important that we actually learn the material than take multiple choice quizzes and tests, I was laughed at by half of my classmates who told me I was old and that\u2019s how school is done now.  I am in my 40s with a law degree.  No one I know cheated in law school.  You would have been expelled if caught and most of the exams were essays.  I dropped the class.  The Microbiology class was a prerequisite for all of the college\u2019s allied health profession programs.  A whole slew of surgical techs, ultrasound techs, LPNs publicly cheated on every single test....I just hope they never pass their licensing boards.  I called the college as well and left a message with the Dean of that program.....no response.   So, not a fan of online classes.",

For those who procrastinate online classes suck because they only complete things last minute. If they had pressure offline they would have been more productive. Besides it's my first year of college and I haven't even met my friends in person so it feels awkward. I am sure if the classes were offline I would have performed better in exams.

I had a hard time making myself go to class when it was in person, and then I was so insanely bored I couldn\u2019t pay attention. At home I can just get my shit done and be done with it.\n\nI\u2019m also the type of person that doesn\u2019t study. The more I study, the worse I do. I\u2019m actually kinda struggling with that in anatomy right now - it\u2019s the first class I\u2019ve been in where you can\u2019t really get by without studying (unless you\u2019ve taken it before/have the prior knowledge from somewhere else) and it\u2019s hard for me. Usually I\u2019m a read it once and it sticks type of person and I may review once right before a test but that\u2019s it. But with anatomy there\u2019s just so much I have to learn there\u2019s no way it\u2019s all gonna stick just reading it once. Which is another reason I didn\u2019t like in person classes, showing up only to have the professor spend 15 minutes lecturing and then telling us we had \u201cstudy time\u201d the rest of the period but if we left class we\u2019d be docked on attendance. It drives me insane even now in anatomy lab, except thankfully our professor doesn\u2019t care if we stay or not. But it is frustrating to make the drive only to have him tell us something I could\u2019ve read in our online portal and then say we can have study time or go home. \n\nHonestly I don\u2019t really get all the hate towards online classes but I also know generally speaking it\u2019s \u201ctraditional\u201d for the majority of people to do in person learning - most of us do it throughout elementary, middle, and high school, so it makes sense most people would through college and would be more comfortable with it because it\u2019s what they know and it still has some form of structure. We all learn differently but I feel like it gets a ton of hate. \n\nAlso I like online classes bc I can do a bunch of work when I\u2019m feeling motivated and then I don\u2019t have to worry about it for however long.",

On the bright side, my community college is split into 5 different campuses, and I kind of like not having to worry about whether a class I need is offered at the campus I go to (all of the music classes are only offered at one campus)",

Like today I overslept and managed to hop on the Zoom link so I didn\u2019t walk in the minutes late. Or if you have to work a lot and can\u2019t make it to class. Your professor may be understanding and put up zoom recordings of class or the prevention up online for you to look at.",

I don't understand a point of a class which is just multiple choice questions and lectures on information you could get from a book or a video. I've been learning things from home my whole life and none of that comes even close to what I was able to learn taking lab and field classes. Commuting is fine, I miss it. There's a really strong relationship between environment and memory and I wouldn't have been able to get the out of class work done had I not been able to take the bus to the library on days I didn't have class.",

But most of my classes weren\u2019t recorded so I had to view the live zoom sessions and I found that even for classes that were electives that I chose because they were interesting to me, I couldn\u2019t pay attention to them at all. I never skipped class when they\u2019re in person,  even if attendance isn\u2019t required, but there were classes I didn\u2019t sign into for months and just did the assignments from the syllabus. There was also something about break out rooms that I couldn\u2019t stand. \n\nI also had a professor who I suppose was going through something and did 0 lecture all semester. The moment we joined the zoom he would immediately send us to a breakout room to discuss questions he put in the chat. I hated it so much because it would be other students saying wrong answers but saying them convincing enough for other people to agree and then the one minute he gave groups to share their answers before sending them back would be where he said the answer. I prefer lecture heavy classes over classes that focus on group work/participation so this class was the bane of my existence. Even more so after he sent out an email saying students could report us to him for not being active in breakout rooms and we\u2019ll get kicked out",

There's a lab theory video, a lab method video, a lab manual, a data file, a powerpoint for each of the videos, and a file that explains what you need to do to complete the lab (literally just \"watch video A, download X, open file Z, etc.\" And instead of just sticking ALL the files needed in a folder called \"lab 3\", the professor sprinkles them out in different folders and sub folders all around the LMS.",

Honestly, I'll probably stick to what I'm doing now which is just being self reliant.",

They aren\u2019t supposed to party, they have to cook at home, they have to    *gasp*   create their own structure and routine. The number of people I hear talking about \u201cthings going back to normal\u201d is really annoying honestly. You\u2019d think that after a year people would just accept that this IS normal, at least for now, so you might as well appreciate the benefits of online classes and adapt your lifestyle to it. \n\nMark my words, if schools had OFFERED online/remote learning which allowed you to study from anywhere in the world, have a more flexible schedule etc. a few years ago, people would probably have loved the idea. But once you don\u2019t have a choice, human psychology is just like \u201cwow this sucks, X is better\u201d.",

I'm glad OP likes online classes and I know there are others who feel the same, but for me, this absolutely sucked. I'm a film production major and in person, hands on classes and film sets are so important to my study. I'm a senior and I couldn't produce a thesis film like I planned because the COVID restrictions weren't worth the anxiety. \n\nI've never been a partier, but COVID ruined my senior year in more ways than that. I'll never get to have a 21st birthday party with my friends, have a drink at the campus bar, go to Disneyland with my sorority. I lost my dream internship when we the pandemic hit, and I'll never get that time back. I understand how tragic the pandemic is and I'm privileged to be in the position I'm in, but it still sucks. \n\nOnline classes are inarguably a very different style of learning for people of any major. Some people, like OP, can thrive in an online learning environment. Some people can't adequately learn through a screen. Both are valid, the difference is we didn't get a choice in the matter.",

As a journalist it still blows \u2014 been hard to do photojournalism these days too. I can\u2019t deny that for certain majors the actual change is incredibly disruptive. \n\nI just know plenty of people who have struggled to adapt more than I would have expected and who keep focused on the negative aspects of the change. While there are negative aspects, I have relished the time that COVID has given me to improve myself, my apartment plant jungle, my personal routine and other things. It\u2019s really been a bummer, I miss piling people in the car to go skiing and things, I\u2019ve definitely been depressed, but I know I will miss this flexibility a LOT once classes return to in-person and I just don\u2019t see a point in complaining about it anymore. It is what it is, focusing negative energy on it honestly just makes it worse and harder to adapt. That\u2019s what I mean.",
