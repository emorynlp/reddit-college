I have never even been in my university building, and I notice I kind of 'miss' the experience. Surely it's nice to watch lectures at my own pace from the comfort of my room, but part of the appeal of college to me is nice old buildings and fancy lecture halls. I was looking forward to 'the whole experience' if you know what I mean.\n\nOnline lectures have also made it so that my teachers don't know who I am. Nor did I manage to make any friends so far. Nobody knows me and I don't know anyone. I need to do a bachelor thesis from behind my laptop, without having access to the recourses my college would normally have available for me.\n\nAnother problem I have with online lectures is that they are more boring. It is tedious to listen to. And since I am already on my PC I feel inclined to also do other things (such as Reddit). I just cannot stare at a screen for 6 hours a day, but that is what it often comes down to.\n\nI have also noticed the whole online lecture thing has led to teachers not sticking to their schedules. \"Y'all are home anyway so where do you need to go\" or whatever their mindset is. I have teachers whose 1,5 hour lectures take 2 or even 2,5 hours. There was one class where I wasn't able to sit any of the lectures through to the end, because I had to go to work and the teacher was still going. I get that they don't need to worry about classroom availability or tight schedules, but I still have things to do. You can't just consume an extra hour of my day because you feel like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah: Long story short - it has its advantages. I do college from home, meaning I don't need to find an apartment, meaning I don't need to pay ridiculous rent fees.
