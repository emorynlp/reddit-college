  "text": "At home I can take insults as jokes and can handle anything, I\u2019m an emotionally stable rock that gets things done and is a functioning person. \n\nEver since I started college, I feel like anything I perceive as negative gets me really down and most days I just want to get through the day and get some rest. I hardly ever do work because I feel so unmotivated. I don\u2019t understand why or how to go back to normal.",

      "text": "happens to me too when im under a lot of stress and not enough social interaction, i also get very snappy if im not paying attention to being nice in these situations. its probably the new environment and added schoolwork tbh. for me exercise really helps, swimming is my favorite but a long walk or a gym session will also do. other things you can do is talk to a friend and force yourself to have a true break to watch some tv guilt free, go to a party or play video games depending on what you like :)",
