  "text": "This is just pure curiosity and well.. me being immature back then. I\u2019ve said some mean things but never anything offensive. \n\nI\u2019m a junior in college and in freshman year, I used to get into useless online fights. I never said anything offensive during school hours or while I was on campus. Overall, I\u2019m not that type of person. Just petty. Just comments where I would call someone an idiot. I didn\u2019t go far into anything. And I just thought about it and now I\u2019m just thinking if someone was to ever see these things and try to \u201creport\u201d it, does anything bad come out of it?",

      "text": "No colleges do not do that unless it's really egregious but future employers and staff can see those posts so you might be burning bridges.\n\nIn reality when people are 'canceled' for their behavior online and withdraw from a university/college it's mostly on their own terms because of outside pressure.",
