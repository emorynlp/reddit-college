I will be completing my undergraduate degree this January and have already been exploring different jobs to refine my experience.\n\nI am currently working as an aide in a behavioral school (which is not where I want  be in the long run but it has given me good experience) and I landed a paid internship with my university as a Student Mentor. I also work for a finance company on the side from extra money and that has provided me with Microsoft office and clerical skills. \n\nWhat are some positions you worked after obtaining your undergraduate degree.",
