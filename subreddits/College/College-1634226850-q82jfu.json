  "text": "I'm really torn between my interest in the fields of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry. One can work with medication and the other cannot, one primarily relies on psychotherapy and the other hardly uses it. I believe both are useful tools and I think psychotherapy should be a first option if possible, but I recognize the benefits of medication within psychopharmacology. Especially in the now hot field of hallucinogens which extremely fascinate me.\n\nSo here are some things that interest me, and for lack of having insight of what really goes on in both fields I can't decide which to choose because I like the idea of psychotherapy and research/practice in medicine:\n\nMental Health; Depression, Anxiety, Trauma, ADHD, and ways they can be treated naturally and medicinally if necessary.  \n\nMarijuana administered during psychotherapy session to possibly promote openness and communication of the session.\n\nMicro dosing Psilocybin during physical therapy or even studying to temporarily increase memory and neuroplasticity in adults that has been lost with age.\n\nWhat are the definitive details of identifying with the self? If one was to completely change their face to someone unrecognizable, would they be able to adopt a new identity entirely? Do we tie identity to visual imagery and symbolism?\n\nWhy do we deny truth for the sake of our belief systems, and the implications of following through the denial despite the truth?\n\nHow can we promote pro-environmental change behavior amongst people and adopt a new perspective of caring for the planet and health of our communities?\n\nThe effects of Psilocybin on patients memory and behavior with Dementia.",

      "text": "Honestly I think you should consider which type of degree you want to pursue. Do you want to go to medical school? That\u2019s required to become a psychiatrist. Do you have the research experience for a PhD in order to become a clinical psychologist? It also comes down to money. If you get into a funded PhD you will have little to no debt from it, but med school will put you out for awhile. Psychiatry is my dream field but I just don\u2019t have it in me to pursue med school, too much time and money. I dislike research so a PhD isn\u2019t for me either, which is why i\u2019ve decided on a masters in counseling. Not my all-time dream job but the closest thing considering the circumstances!",

          "text": "I've definitely weighed the degree options, but I wasn't aware you can't receive the same type of funding in med school as you can with a PhD so that's definitely a heavy one to think about...I do enjoy research though but the issue is the research I find worthwhile is primarily involved with psychopharmacology which psychologists aren't allowed to work with, which is fine as long as I can do so within research and trials with a team. That is where I'm not sure if that is possible or not.",

              "text": "I feel you. I don\u2019t think med school offers funding like PhD programs but I think they offer scholarships/ full rides occasionally like undergrad programs. Psychopharmacology was my all time favorite undergrad course that i\u2019ve taken and I looked up careers and programs surrounding it but it\u2019s not so much of a career  and more of a certification that already licensed psychologists receive. We seem to have a lot of the same career interests and such. I hope you find a path that suits your interests well!",

                  "text": "I think after seeing the cost of med school and delving a little into what protocols they're trying to advocate with the FDA on psychedelic therapy, that a psychologist would be the best end all as you said I just saw the psychopharmacology certification. Also, I don't think it would be a practical setting for a psychiatrist to spend 6-10 hours with a patient taking up a room in a clinic or hospital. It seems the direction is: Recommendation of therapy by a physician/psychiatrist, and the session administered by a clinical psychologist.\n\nWhich actually works out perfect in the end for research purposes.",
