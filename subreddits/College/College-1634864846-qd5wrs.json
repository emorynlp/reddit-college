  "text": "This is such a pathetic question, but what is it like? I'm a junior and I do have some friends that I hang out with every couple of days, but I'd be lying if I said I don't somewhat envy those friend groups who all live together or who are constantly going back and forth between rooms and hanging out every free second they have and every night.",

It seems nice, I mean I had 2 friends and the 3 of us would hang out together sometimes, biggest friend group I've had but one time in college I hung out with a ton of people and it was fun, they weren't really my friends and I didn't know them too well, I stuck close to the 1 friend I knew the whole time but I thought, \"man this would be really nice to have all the time\" a bunch of people vibing together and having fun, you always have someone to do something with, I envy them too, it looks fun",

      "text": "You hang out every couple of days, I don\u2019t think other people hang out any more than that, like who has time for that? Unless you all live together but for a lot of people it doesn\u2019t work out like that. Living together also has a tendency to destroy some friendships. You sound like you have a good friend group if you\u2019re hanging out that often, savor this time. One of the really great things about college is the friendships, apparently it\u2019s so much harder to make friends once you graduate and most people never have friendships to the same degree. Enjoy your friends while you\u2019re all here together.",

At times, it was really nice. Just being able to hear a variety of opinions on things, the dynamic conversations, it was a lot of fun. But there was also some drama which was annoying. One person decided they didn't like another and then we could never all hang out together, only one of those two could be there at any time. There were a lot of hurt feelings and it sucked and really complicated things. After leaving I realized the majority of those people were not really my close friends. I only still regularly text one of them. But I do really miss it. Nowadays I'm mostly either by myself or with my girlfriend, and it is nice having a partner, but it's not the same at all.",
