  "text": "So I'm a freshman and I'm on my second week and I also just started working part-time. everything just so happened to be timed wrong as I got scheduled three days in a row and two of those days I had school so it snowballed to the point where I have about 12 assignments with 10 of them being overdue. Calling for any advice that's helpful but what have you guys done that has worked in situations like this and how do you guys manage your time? What mindset did you have when dealing with a bunch of overdue assignments?",

      "text": "managing your time can be done through google calendar and making time blocks for when to do assignments for each class and time blocks for when you work and your classes. if you have ten assignments that are overdue, i would let your professor know what\u2019s going on and kindly ask them if you can still submit the assignments late with points taken off bc it\u2019s better than a zero. this has happened to me a few times from genuinely forgetting to turn in a assignment and just being honest with my professors and it\u2019s worked but i can\u2019t speak for every professor",
