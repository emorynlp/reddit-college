Tbh, it's not on my list of desired program or profession someday, it's just the slot wasn't enough to accomodate all the qualified student on my desired program and im one of that poor soul, thats why I'm fucked up. But my department wont allow me to shift, coz there's a NO SHIFTING POLICY thing which nobody explain on us before we enrolled ourselves on that department. Nor I can transfer to other state university because the registrar put on hold the transfer credentials I requested, and probably most of the state u's are already starting so it's hard to transfer when the application period already ended. \n\nAnd so here am I. Opening the options of 'work'... But im afraid it'll be harder next yr to apply once I withdraw from my current school. As some state U's don't entertain students with dropped units. \n\nIs there anyone who can share their experience or enlighten me whats the best option to do right now. \n\nThank you in advance!", "author": "black__soup", "created": 1632488057, "retrieved": 1632800398, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
