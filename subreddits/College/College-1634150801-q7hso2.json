  "text": "So, I have to do a survey for my sex Ed class and asked my professor if I could do it online to get a wider audience and she said it was okay. If you\u2019re comfortable, please answer honestly! \n\nHere\u2019s the scenario: \nYou have been going out with a special person for some time. You really care for him/her and have a wonderful romantic evening. You\u2019re back at your place in private and both of you are feeling very affectionate. You realize that you\u2019d really like to have sex with this person (you\u2019ve not had intercourse with him/her yet), but you don\u2019t have any contraceptive available. As honestly and realistically as possible, what would you do in this situation?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Thank you guys for replying. This is super helpful and I appreciate you took the time to respond!",
