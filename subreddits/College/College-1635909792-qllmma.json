  "text": "I have to take some time off due to staying in another country for a year for work. I want to finish college but I am worried that being gone for that long will make me lose motivation to finish school. And also I will lose the momentum and study habits. Any advice on how you went back to school? It\u2019s hard for me because I\u2019m actually doing decently well in college and I don\u2019t want to take time off but it\u2019s mandatory that I have to",

      "text": "Going back after several years was an adjustment, since the routine and nature of the work is different. That being said, I found that I was *much* more motivated to do well. Going to college feels more impactful when it's a choice you make after some time away, rather than it just being the thing you've been told to do. I think skills like time management and communication with profs are also easier since you've lived as an adult with responsibilities.",

      "text": "I had way more determination and money saved up lol. I basically can concentrate 100% on school which is exactly what I need. Not to mention a lot more maturity. I dropped out with a little over 45 credits. I think that's a big part of what influenced my decision to return. If I had to do a whole 4 years I probably wouldn't have.",

      "text": "Nothing too different with my habits comparing my 20 yr old self by doing the work, memorize, and regurgitate. I have less anxiety in my 30s now than 20 yr old me complaining to a professor and praying for a grade curve to pass a class. Plus I don't care a lot of academic things like Dean's List because that means nothing to most employers.",
