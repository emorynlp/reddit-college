The answer to your question is \"no, you were not matriculated,\" but \"yes, you were enrolled.\"\n\nMatriculated means \"degree seeking.\" Since you were not seeking a degree at the institution where you took the class, you were non-matriculated. \"Enrolled\" means \"registered to take a course or courses.\" Since you were registered to take the course, you were enrolled.",
