  "text": "I've been getting frustrated by a lack of similarity between lectures and the assignments. I learn by examples. If I need to learn how to do something, like a certain process (which is what most problems are in assignments) then the best way for me to learn is to see the exact same type of process being done. but in this one class, the professor has examples, but not at all the same types of examples as what we're expected to do for assignments.\n\nAm I just being a whiner? Or is there validity to my complaint?",

You're going to college so that you can learn concepts that you'll be able to apply to random real world situations. If you need a professor to hand-hold you through how to apply the concepts, then you're not actually learning anything useful and your grade should reflect that inability to apply the concepts to novel situations.",

      "text": "The further you go along, the more that this is not the case.  My best professors were always assigning projects and work that either mimicked cases we would see in the field, or projects that would have to build off of multiple lectures and readings to be successfully completed. \n\nShowing examples of how to do an assignment is something you'll see in 100-200 level courses. In those cases, the assignment is something to reinforce a key process or formula that needs to be memorized. Or it's a very basic introduction to a subject. Anything you build off of that typically requires that you do your own critical thinking, and just copying examples deprives you of that opportunity. \n\nI think the only time I can think of where examples were critical were my grad school machine learning courses. We had alot of math and business majors, so coding in R or Python or even SQL/SAS was minimal at best (I couldn't code worth a damn because I was coming from journalism lol). Basic solutions needed to be shown in class to bridge the concepts, but beyond that we were asked to code on our own or find and adapt solutions from elsewhere.",

      "text": "Yikes, I'm surprised at the answers here. I'm non-neurotypical and find myself having to pour more hours into the assignment just to get a latch on the initial concepts and it burns me out of the subject entirely. Or, I find myself plugging more things into my schedule just to meet with a tutor and I put things off until I can ask about them, and it crowds my time management.\n\nMy pre-calc class was notorious for this. I can't think of a \"calculus-y\" example offhand, but let's say you're doing simple arithmetic and the professor spends the session dividing easy numbers, and then, on the HW, the first one divides by zero. Second one divides by a tiny decimal. I feel like its a confidence killer from the offset.  If its your first time seeing it, you don't know how to handle these special cases. My calc class, however, was taught in a reasonable way with a \"walk then run\" mentality and nearly everyone did well. My pre-calc class? Not so much. Most failed. It's not cool to dump these things off on the students and then blame the students, and that professor had a mentality like that. \n\nYour complaint's valid, and everyone has academic strengths and weaknesses. If you're asking for additional help, please don't feel like you need \"hand-holding\" through \"basic concepts\" like some have said here. And no, it doesn't mean you'll be a shitty industry worker; I can say from experience in industry that you're given all of the background knowledge you need to not make mistakes.\n\nIf its the accepted ethos of professors to teach like this... then that explains why a lot of people are burned out and depressed recently.",
