      "text": "Info: is it on campus or off campus? On campus is associated with the university so it would be more likely that out can break it. Off campus is when it is privately owned and not technically an entity of the University.\n\n\n if it is a binding lease you might be stuck paying it unless you relet (transfer the lease from your name officially) or subletter. (Lease the apartment under your name to a person who is renting from you).\n\nIf it is a month to month basis lease you could request and let the landlord  know you are leaving.\n\nTbh OP, a lot of off-campus housing were super predatory during the pandemic and made students pay when they left college when everything shut down. I've been in a binding lease and it sucked so much. Hopefully this is not the case for you.",

      "text": "Depends on the lease and the terms. Different landlords have different rules. Some will let you pay an early termination fee (most commonly 2 months rent and you lose security deposit). Some let you find a subleaser and all is good. Some will try to fill the apartment early and charge a small fee to you. Some will say no way and that\u2019s that. Your lease should have a clause on early termination",

Evictions are when the landlord forces their tenant to move out for lack of payment or something else, like serious damage to the rental. \n\nThe OP's lease may say something about a fee to break the lease early, and if so, they just owe that fee and nothing negative will end up on their credit.",
