On campus is associated with the university so it would be more likely that out can break it. Off campus is when it is privately owned and not technically an entity of the University.\n\n\n if it is a binding lease you might be stuck paying it unless you relet (transfer the lease from your name officially) or subletter. (Lease the apartment under your name to a person who is renting from you).\n\nIf it is a month to month basis lease you could request and let the landlord  know you are leaving.\n\nTbh OP, a lot of off-campus housing were super predatory during the pandemic and made students pay when they left college when everything shut down.
