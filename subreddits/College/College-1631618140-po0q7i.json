Anyways, yesterday I went to sleep at 10, and my goodness I feel so energetic right now, definitely sleeping at that time lol",

      "text": "So one thing that might have attributed to this is the fact that our REM cycles when we sleep are \\~90 minutes long, and waking up during a REM cycle has been shown to lead to increased grogginess and worsened mood during the day. So going to sleep earlier may have given your body the extra time it needed to finish a REM cycle and have you wake up during the light sleep in between. Or I'm reading too much into this and your body just needed more sleep since seven and a half hours usually isn't enough for stressed college kids. \n\nAnyways, I'm happy for you and wish you luck in adjusting to a new sleep schedule, that's usually the hardest part.",

Your organs also recover and rest at specific times relative to your personal biological clock, so disrupting that can cause quite a lot of damage over time.\n\nOther tips include make sure to exercise a bit every day to get your circulation going like running water that's cleaner, and having the window open a bit close to your head where you sleep. Both will also help your sleep quality.",
