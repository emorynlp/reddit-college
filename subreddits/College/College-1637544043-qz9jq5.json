  "text": "I started college at the beginning of September and I took 17 hours as a wildlife biology major. Everyone told me it was too much and now I'm realizing that. I'm getting the end of the semester slump where finals are coming up, I have an 8-9 page paper that I've had knowledge of for 3 weeks that I haven't even started on, and I have a presentation tomorrow. I wanted to get the advice of people who have been in college a bit. I have As and Bs in all of my classes although a couple are bordering on high C. My question is, is it normal to skip classes (I've only skipped English 3 times and math 1 time but it was days where we weren't doing anything important and could be done from home) and also is it normal to skip presentations? I've also missed a couple of assignments and been late on a few, but nothing that hasn greatly effected my great. Is all of this normal or am I over worrying as usual? Any advice or tips or knowledge is GREATLY appreciated.",

I'm just getting my footing and right now I'm just trying to make it through this semester. Next semester I have 14 hours so I'll be able to put in more effort. Thank you for your answer.",

              "text": "Try to take a breath. I was in over my head my freshman year too. Took 20 credits (mistake) and it was in all the classes I wanted to get over with. I ended up okay. If it\u2019s not within your direct control then it\u2019s not worth the thoughts in your head. Finals season will be over before you know it. Maybe try going for a walk to clear your head so you can get some work done for the night, might make you feel a little bit more at ease. Good luck.",

      "text": "My #1 piece of advice is to show up 100% of the time. Go to all of the classes, do all of the assignments, and do all of the readings. Participating 100% of the time is like 75% of the battle with college. \n\nThat being said. Do what is best for you at this moment. I skipped 1/3 of my classes my first semester and I wish I hadn\u2019t. But, it might be better for you at this moment to skip a day of classes and devote that day to writing your paper. \n\nTake care of yourself.",

          "text": "Yes, that was my mindset going into college and I think I will stick with that when I get in more serious classes. I'm not skipping important parts of classes. The only times I've skipped have been MyMathLab day once on a Friday because it's online homework that she just wanted us to come in and do but I live 40 minutes away so I don't want to go for one class when I can do it from home. The other times were in my English class because the professor has the beginnings of dementia and she drones on for two hours about the exact same couple sentences and it's not mandatory to go since she posts it all online anyway and at the time I had a nasty ear infection so I just couldn't bring myself to go in. If we had been going over important, or even non important but essential notes/etc in any of these classes I would have gone, it's just hard to go when you live far away and you Know you can do it from home.",
