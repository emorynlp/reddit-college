  "text": "Which one would look the best compared to the others?  \nI have an A.A.S in cyber security currently, and will be graduation in a Bachelors in Business.\n\nTo get the minors it would be:  \n3 classes of a Cyber sec course \n\n2 Classes for the Information science\n\n3 for accounting minor\n\nNow, I also wouldn't be opposed to stitching on the IS minor to one of the other two to make it a full semester just for that. But originally I went into business with the idea of majoring in accounting not just general BUS, but this will most likely not be the case. Also, I am more interested in working with computers now than accounting but enjoy both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any input!",
