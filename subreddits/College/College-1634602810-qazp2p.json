  "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm going to Santa Monica Community College to transfer out a year later. I need to find housing.\n\nI am able to get a regular apartment but I want to save money because I plan to pay cash for community college and regular university. \n\nDoes anybody know a way to find housing in cities made for students? \n\nAny advice is much appreciated!",
