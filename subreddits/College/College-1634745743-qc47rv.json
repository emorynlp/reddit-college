  "text": "Hello,\n\nI hope whoever is reading this is doing well. I'm a major in Finance BBA, and I intend to start a business in the next few years. However, I know people that have degrees in music or something unrelated to business and are able to have successful businesses. So I'm asking for whoever has a business, is it necessary/helpful to have a finance degree? I love business and definitely will start my own but I really want to be a psychology major, and if it is possible for me to major in psychology and still be successful in business, that would be awesome.",
