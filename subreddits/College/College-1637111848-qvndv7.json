  "text": "I, like many college students, am a professional procrastinator. I can normally put off a large paper up until a few days prior, and do very well.\n\nI have a 9 page paper due Thursday, and I currently have about 5 pages done. Typically, writing 4 pages in 2 days would be incredibly easy. However, I feel so incredibly under the weather right now. Body aches, fatigue, sore throat, etc. I'm probably going to see a doctor if I start feeling worse. I've been trying to write all day, but I just feel so tired and fatigued that I can't bring myself, mentally or physically, to write right now. I want to ask for an extension tmrw if I wake up and still feel like crap... but my problem is that we've known about this paper for 2 months now. I know, I know. \n\nIs it even worth it asking if I continue to feel too sick to write? Or do you think she'll say no, considering how long I've had to write?",
