  "text": "I am a junior at a private university and I am currently applying for an internship as it\u2019s required to do an internship before I graduate. For this internship, I need to upload a resume and an essay in PDF form. I am struggling to figure out how to convert word documents into a PDF, as well as edit a PDF without  paying $14 a month for Adobe. I know it\u2019s not much money, but as a broke college student who is paying a lot of money to go here, I really don\u2019t want to have to do that. I was wondering if anyone knows of any free PDF programs?",

Hit \"Print\" and it should let you save the file as a PDF to a folder of your choosing.",

      "text": "In Microsoft Word, click File, then Save As, and then in the File Format bar there should be an option for PDF.  Type in whatever name you want for the file and hit enter, and you're done!\n\nSmall tip - choose a file name that doesn't have any spaces or punctuation marks in it, because sometimes computers have a hard time handling files with characters like that in the name.  So instead of calling your resume file Some Firefighter's Resume.pdf, call it Some\\_Firefighter\\_Resume.pdf\n\nGood luck.",
