  "title:": "Can I get into umich, UNC, or wisco with a B- on my senior year quarter grades?",
  "text": "I applied to UMich, UNC, and wisconsin OOS EA without knowing my quarter grades (only get sent to EA schools). I got a B- in AP Psych (my other grades are A in physics and 2 choir classes & A-\u2018s in AP stats, AP music theory, and calculus & one B+ in English). I don\u2019t have any grade lower than a B+ (and very few of those) on my 9-11 semester grades. With a 33 ACT and good extracurriculars, will this B- significantly lower my chances of being admitted? (Btw I applied UMich LSA, and Wisconsin human ecology). Thank you so much!",
