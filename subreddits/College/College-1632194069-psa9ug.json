You *might* struggle a bit with statistics, but after that, most of the calculations you're going to do in econ is going to be done in statistical software like SPSS or STATA.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, even though economics (or finance) is a lot more math heavy compared to other social sciences, we only really do a little bit of calculus and statistical modelling.  I might be biased, but I think econ or finance is a strong choice. \n\n\nI really hate marketing and business (used to take business administration before switching over to econ), so I don't think I can provide any valuable input on that front, sorry!", "author": "ctherranrt", "created": 1632196085, "upvotes": 1}}}
