  "text": "I am an older student that just transferred to a big state university who\u2019s student body is mostly aged 18-22. I turn 26 tomorrow and am a junior. I made some mistakes in life and am trying to make up for them now by getting my degree. \n\nI just went to a club meeting today and someone asked how old I was. I told her my 26th birthday is tomorrow and she said \u201cyou do look kinda old.\u201d That hurt. I\u2019m also like the oldest person in all of my classes and I feel really insecure about it. Tbh wearing a mask kinda hides it but someone noticed and I feel bad. I have a successful career as a CNC machinist and work full time on the weekends but I\u2019m committed to get my degree to get into management or different jobs. \n\nAm I too old to be doing this kind of stuff? It\u2019s really been bugging me. \n\nThanks for listening.",

I participated in mostly engineering clubs and honestly that's how I got my job and my network of friends. Very cool on the cnc machinist, I would have picked your brain for hours on builds.",

I\u2019m here because of the labor shortage and semi conductor shortage. I got a job offer I could not refuse and moved. Getting my degree is something I\u2019ve been working on since I was 24 and they agreed to let me work weekends. Just being the oldest person here still weirds me out. Maybe it\u2019s something I need to get used to.",

Failed out due to immaturity, drugs, mental illness, and alcohol. I went to trade school at 20 and got a decent career going but I want to make more than 53k a year. I started regular college again at your age online. Since I work weekends I\u2019m in person at a huge flagship university and I feel so weird. Also feels like I can\u2019t relate to anyone. I feel really alone here.",
