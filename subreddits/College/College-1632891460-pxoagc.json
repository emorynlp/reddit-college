I turn 26 tomorrow and am a junior. I made some mistakes in life and am trying to make up for them now by getting my degree. \n\nI just went to a club meeting today and someone asked how old I was. I told her my 26th birthday is tomorrow and she said \u201cyou do look kinda old.\u201d That hurt. I\u2019m also like the oldest person in all of my classes and I feel really insecure about it. Tbh wearing a mask kinda hides it but someone noticed and I feel bad. I have a successful career as a CNC machinist and work full time on the weekends but I\u2019m committed to get my degree to get into management or different jobs. \n\nAm I too old to be doing this kind of stuff? It\u2019s really been bugging me. \n\nThanks for listening.", "author": "VoiceofReason541", "created": 1632891460, "retrieved": 1632945394, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heph9qg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxoagc/too_old_to_participate_in_clubs/heph9qg/", "text": "I was an older student too.
