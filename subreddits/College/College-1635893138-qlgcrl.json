  "text": "Hi guys, My fianc\u00e9 will be coming from overseas to America as she just got approved for her visa. She has just completed her dental internship in her home country and got her BDS. I was wondering if you guys know what is the best route to take for her to become a dentist in America. She also wants to know what are the mandatory documents and paperwork she would need to bring with her to attend a university here (transcripts, recommendation letters, etc.). We were looking at UPenn and some universities in the New York area? Thanks",
