  "title:": "My friend is a second year IT student who seems miserable. What potential majors can you think of worth exploring (based on his traits I\u2019ll explain below)",
  "text": "He started in engineering, which was horrible, he nearly failed calculus, so he pivoted to IT. All the while my friends and I are like \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen you remotely interested in IT, or coding when you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nMy friend is a very cultured, creative, type B personality. He enjoys music, film, writing, and is passionate about these subjects. I don\u2019t want to see him wasting time so unhappy for no reason \n\nBut as a second year reality starts to sink in. The longer he waits, it becomes impossible to pivot \n\nI don\u2019t personally believe music or film majors are viable unless you have specific career goals in mind, ones I know he doesn\u2019t have. He even says he\u2019d never do these majors and wants to be practical\n\nWhat other majors might you suggest, just vaguely, that are lighter but also interesting or lead to interesting careers? Help me brainstorm",

                      "text": "Yea since he's really interested in arts related topics, graphic design is a good one. Really don't know much about the major, but I know many people who are majoring/have graduated with it and they're doing fine and are happy.\n\nHowever, make sure to do research beforehand, because I hear it's declining in jobs but I'm not sure since I never looked at it. Also it's good to research so you know how the pay is, job prospects, etc.",
