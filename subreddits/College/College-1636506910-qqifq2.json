  "text": "I've been at school for five years and failed and dropped alot. I dove into a major immediately decided not to do it and waste basically 20 credits. I went to my hometown uni and went through a deep depression since everyone in my house was either selling or using and I could not handle the pressure of it all. I failed my sophomore semester and took a break. I decided to keep going and moved to a completely different state and decided to go to a local community college. the first quarter was a rough start but I started getting the grooves just getting gen eds under my belt. then covid hit and screwed my entire schedule I didn't do bad but routine was destroyed. I transferred to an actual school in Washington and went absolutely insane the second semester not talking to anyone for months during quarantine while trying to focus on my grades. I finished with only one class being done with. now post covid, same deal and I'm failing this semester. I started getting back to a normal studying schedule but its kinda too late at this point. should I keep going? I have another 2-3 years to go with actual degree classes and it all seems so much to handle. I don't want to stop but I don't know if its a waste of time or not. I also got a diagnosis of some form of bipolar disorder but my meds are definitely helping me get on a routine of sleep and no more ups and downs as much. I'm 22 going to be 23 here shortly",

      "text": "You can never be in college for too long. College is not a race to see who graduates firsts. Everyone graduates at the pace which is most realistic and sustainable for them. \n\nI read on here once someone who took eight years to get their bachelor's. They were working and taking care of their family while simultaneously enrolled part-time. \n\nSo it doesn't matter how long it takes you to get a degree, just that you get one if it truly matters to you.",
