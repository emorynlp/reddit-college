  "text": "I have the chance to go to online colleges for the degree I truly want, they just opened up recently for these courses online, but they're at a different college. Online college would be a better fit for me because I don't have a car of my own yet and other scheduling reasons. I would transfer but transfer students have a very low acceptance rate at this school and seeing how it's a different major I'm highly unlikely to be accepted.\n\nSo I figured I'd ask the people of reddit what advice they have for me. Drop out and re-enroll or wait and transfer?\n\nI have a Pell grant cause I'm poor and was was also worried this may affect my eligibility in the future, money is an issue.",
