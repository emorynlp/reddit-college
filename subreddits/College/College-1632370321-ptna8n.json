I live off campus and I\u2019m 30. My problem is how to find a social circle. I was doing well at my junior college when I tried theatre. However, we\u2019ve all moved on and I don\u2019t have that social circle anymore. After my ex and I broke up, my circle dwindled to maybe two people who I don\u2019t see regularly. I find it really hard to make friends with my peers. Most other non-trads work or have spouses and kids to take care of. Everyone else is in their late teens or early twenties. I try to get to know people and I end up dealing with a lot of rejection. I\u2019ve been trying to find clubs or student organizations but the info is outdated and not kept up. Any advice? I\u2019d like to make more of my senior year.", "author": "GingerMarquis", "created": 1632370321, "retrieved": 1632800834, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
