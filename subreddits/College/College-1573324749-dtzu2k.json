Which isn't much and I didn't think I was supposed to make close friends after such a short time. But it seems like everyone's getting into close friendships with each other. I feel left out. I really like them and I would love to be their friends, but I don't know how. It doesn't seem like I can invite them anywhere. I mean.. Why would they want to meet me? We aren't close enough to invite them out for a coffee or a drink. At first I was like okay this will change and I'll get used to this feeling. Well I'm not getting used to it, it's getting worse. I'm constantly worried that they're together somewhere, having fun, and leaving me out. I knew this shit is getting serious when I saw two of them together in an Instagram story and got close to a panic attack. Any ideas? How did you manage to make new friends?", "author": null, "created": 1573324749, "retrieved": 1632802716, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 642, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f7coelz": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dtzu2k/how_do_you_get_close_to_new_people_at_college/f7coelz/", "text": "Just put yourself out there and introduce yourself early on.

This semester I am sitting at a table with a group of people and we are all friendly with each other. You just gotta put yourself out there more. Talk to them and ask them to do something with you. You have to start somewhere. I just get into groups with people and we start to talk and I start to know them more as the semester goes on.

It seems so natural, people making friends and all, but it takes effort. Be critical with your choice of friends too. College can be very eye opening keep your morals and only hang out with people that will keep you on track to graduate. There is probably a counselor on campus that you can talk to about FOMO who will help you with some more friend making techniques.

I was completely lonely my freshman year, and I\u2019ve been jealous of everyone for seemingly finding friend groups so quickly. As I met others, I learned that others went through this as well. So many people understand what you\u2019re going through.\n\nI highly recommend clubs and school jobs. Those are the two places where I was able to click well with people. I didn\u2019t rly find classes to be effective because a lot of people have the mentality of just being present and then going home. But there may be smaller classes / group project-oriented classes where you have a higher chance of making friends.\n\nStart off by just being present. Attend club meetings, sign up for a job, be there for classes. Be nice and friendly with people, make yourself known as a welcoming person. Ask people to study together, or ask people if they\u2019re interested in hanging out over the weekend. Chances are, there will be someone who wants to get to know you more who will be willing to make time for you.\n\nDon\u2019t get discouraged by rejections. I\u2019ve asked someone to hang out with me for an entire term and it never worked out - she always had an excuse. People like that aren\u2019t worth your time, don\u2019t fret about them. Stick with the people who make sure to make time for you. Likewise, make time for people you care about.\n\nIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t have friends until later in college.
