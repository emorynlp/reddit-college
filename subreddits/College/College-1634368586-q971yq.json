  "text": "Hi.  I\u2019m an accounting major. \nI ended up choosing that career because of several financial benefits.   I have passion for languages.  I heard Accounting is language of business.  I thought it would be the same concept. \n\nNow that I took my first class. I ended up hating it. The teacher sucks.  The subject is boring and difficult. I fell asleep and my classmate woke me up during class. I failed my first exam.  So embarrassing. \n\nI\u2019m planning to change my major  next summer.  Advisors are too busy right now for spring 2022. I think best time to talk to them is in the spring. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do.  I\u2019m very confused.   A career that provides decent salary is very important to me.  I\u2019m not sure if I can do this mentally in a long run.",

      "text": "Consider linguistics or international business/law/relations. That would involve learning a direct foreign language.\n\nSometimes language skills are useful for the logic in computers but before you sign up for a computers class or major, try to learn on khan academy (free) to try it out.\n\nThis answer sucks but Money will come if you are good at what you do, and you will only be good if you enjoy the subject. Languages can be used in a wide variety of settings and skillsets which can make it lucrative. Combine language with another subject you are interested in perhaps",

I think people who enjoy accounting tend to be people who enjoy working with numbers, solving puzzles, and like rules-based systems where there is always a correct answer.\n\n> A career that provides decent salary is very important to me.\n\nThere are lots of other business fields that offer good job prospects and high salaries. Have you taken any other business courses, like finance or supply chain management? Do you find business interesting in a general sense?",
