  "text": "I'm an engineering major and I'd like to get a new device for college. I don't know much about computers so i figured I'd ask. I've used windows/Android forever, so i don't think I'm changing anytime soon. I wanted to know:\n\nShould I get a single touchscreen laptop/surface that's portable, or should I get a tablet and a laptop? I'll also use it to take notes.\n\nShould I get a higher end Laptop, or where should I aim for? Gaming laptop sort? I would likely have to take it across (fairly) long distances.\n\nBased on the above, are there any in specific you would like to recommend? \n\nSorry if my English sounds weird.\nThank you so much.\n\nPs. I'd prefer to grab something by black Friday, so I'd appreciate suggestions for that too.",

For engineering, you'll likely need something with a dedicated graphics card for compute (although I'm not entirely sure; not an engineer).\n\nThose kinds of laptops usually aren't 2-in-1s, so if you want a touch screen to take notes, look for a tablet.",
