I would recommend you email their customer support via your student email address so that you can get the premium at the discounted student rate for a yearly subscription.",

      "text": "I use [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) and Grammerly premium. \n\nGrammerly is good for helping with Grammer and clarity however Hemingway helps with wordy sentences and syntax issues. If you use both it definitely helps my writing. \n\nPearson Writer is more affordable (I think it\u2019s like $30 for a year) and just as good as Grammerly.\n\nAdvice: Please utilize your schools writing centre. They want to help you.  I found they are the best source for helping in humanities courses. (Coming from a History major). Also revise revise revise (have at least 2 drafts before you settle with a final copy) and write in google docs (their syntax and grammar checker is much better than word) \n\nGood Luck!!",
