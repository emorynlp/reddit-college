  "text": "Hi! I'm a third year college student from one of the top universities of Argentina, but I'm a bit lost about my future. My current gpa is 9.05/10, but I had a tough semester and it might drop to 8.89/10. \nAlso I'm starting an intership in Visa next year and I'm planning on working full time after college for one more year before applying to grad school. I also have a quite international background, as I've been living in three different countries due to my dad's job, and I can speak 4 languages (idk if this helps). I've been doing 3 courses that I gained from a Bank competition (does this count as self improvement?) But I'm a bit insecure about my gpa (and how it may turn in the future), and wanted to ask here what are my chances of getting accepted into a good grad school, such as ESSEC or HEC?",
