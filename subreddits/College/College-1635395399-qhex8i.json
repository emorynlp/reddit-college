  "text": "To start I only have 13 credits this semester and I\u2019m doing decently in all my classes but I want to get my 2 Cs and BCs to at least a B. However I\u2019m not great at time management or keeping on track. I\u2019ve been pretty swamped for the past week with midterms and I\u2019m seriously burning out. My energy levels are pretty low all the time, it\u2019s the depression, so pulling all-nighters are difficult. \n\nWhat time strategies or schedules have worked for you in a way that won\u2019t exhaust you?",

      "text": "Do you work? Are they online classes? I do 13 hr online and I divide the classes up by day. Big projects fill up the other time. Day doesn\u2019t always work. I also have low energy and mental health issues. I inevitably work six days and put off certain stuff here and there. But EOW I\u2019m all caught up. Also, I keep a Note in my phone of all of my assignments for the week. I delete them as I go. Look into an ADHD evaluation, my meds changed everything. Same with my husband. Undiagnosed ADHD had him working at a restaurant, medication put him in a highly skilled and paid job working six figures within five years. We had both dropped out of college the first time; now I am back and making straight A\u2019s. I don\u2019t work outside of the home but I have two special needs children. I can tell you, without medication I couldn\u2019t do this. Like I said, just chop it up into smaller, easier achievable goals. Then it\u2019s not so overwhelming",

          "text": "I only work on the weekends but my job is labor intensive so obviously I\u2019m tired when I get home and I have maybe an hour or two do homework. I do have ADHD and I do receive accommodations from my university but I\u2019m medicated anymore because it wasn\u2019t helping me and I can\u2019t really afford the medication anyway. It\u2019s more the volume of homework I have going on in such a short period of time. This week alone I have 2 exams, 2 quizzes and 2 papers so I\u2019m studying a lot.",

              "text": "If you tried every ADHD medication and none worked for you, I would suggest getting reevaluated. ADHD is commonly mistaken for other issues. Things like Adderall and Vyvanse usually help everyone, even people without ADHD. It gives them a huge boost of energy but for me, I can focus and manage my time appropriately. Of course, I have other things like autism and PTSD that bring other difficulties. My school provides \u201caccommodations\u201d for these and they\u2019re worthless. Online workloads are difficult. Like I said, dedicate a day to each class or break it up into smaller pieces. Whatever is easier for you. Two days of hard work, one day of absolute rest, and four days where you fit in bits and pieces. It sounds like the depression is really weighing you down; possibly you can address that? I do therapy and medication. Either way, I would definitely go down to 6-9 credit hours next semester. 12 is a full course load and it\u2019s ok if you need to slow down a bit while you heal!",
