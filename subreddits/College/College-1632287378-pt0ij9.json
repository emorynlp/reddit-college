After lectures, try to recall as much information you can before those memories decompose. \n\nDepending on the class, exams are only half or a quarter of your grade. There will invariably be massive projects or coding tests that will weigh heavily on your grade.", "author": "unbecoming___", "created": 1632299092, "upvotes": 4}}}
