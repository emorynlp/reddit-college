Electives make me feel of place because either (a) they consist of lower classmen that still treat college as an extension of highschool. Or (b) if it is upper level, I am likely the odd one out, because most people are of the major that the class is meant for, so things don't come as easy to me as the rest of the class and im not used to the learning style/professors that most people in the major have adapted to\n\nBut again, this can def depend on your major.
