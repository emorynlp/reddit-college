  "title:": "I hate being passionate towards my career",
  "text": "I absolutely hate that I have such a huge passion for this career and no matter what, I just seem to be facing a billion obstacles in the way, telling me to simply give up.\n\nMy high school never let me do work experience in a nursery (daycare for people not in the UK) because the teachers believed I had too much on my plate already. I didn't, those teachers always assumed I was being beat at home (birthmark under my eye) and my quiet nature meant that I was obviously being tortured in some way. It always annoyed me that I never had that experience. \n\nThen a couple of years ago, I get accepted into a college course to study childcare. The teacher doesn't seem to like me despite me being at the top of my class but everyone says its just because it's college and apparently college is different. Naturally, I put it out my mind, study extra hard and stay at the top of all my classes. I was literally number one and took every single extra support class to ensure I gave myself all the studying I could get.\n\nI finish that year of classes and move up into the second year. We finally have nursery placement. Students are supposed to get mentors and I didn't get one until 3 weeks later which meant I was 3 weeks behind on paperwork. My teachers in college complained that I had to communicate with my mentor more despite not having one, no way to communicate her etc. Finally, I get given a mentor who doesn't like me, doesn't teach me anything and overall, just sinks my mood.\n\nThe student I'm with? She absolutely hates kids and skips days of placement because she's either hungover or is going to get her nails done. She gets given an amazing mentor who is showing her literally everything! She's getting a billion more opportunities and all I can think is simply, what the hell? That's so unfair, I study my ass off, come into placement 30 minutes early everyday to help the teachers set up the classroom and even offer to do paperwork etc and this is my results? The student has stayed off a few times because she can't be bothered and recently?\n\nMy college teacher demands an online guidance session with me. Guidance is only for people who are falling behind. The teacher says she's not happy with my quality of work despite me telling her why there's not been work to give in. She complains that I should stop taking days off to which I tell her that she's mixed me up with the other student. She looks confused, says oh, and then gives me into trouble for literally nothing and tells me to use the right policies in the future as it would impact the nursery I'm working at. She then acts all nice and says its good that me and the student are both people who JUST STARTED the course THAT YEAR so we have something in common.\n\nI awkwardly tell her that I was in her class last year and she just says oh, looks confused and asks my name despite it being under my camera on webcam, then says nothing after after and starts saying her goodbyes.\n\nI had a total of 2 teachers last year for my first year of college. She was my main teacher. She didn't even remember me at all.\n\nThen only a couple hours ago, she sends me my grades for one of my assignments. Now, this one, I'll admit, I completely forgot to attach my reference sheet, so it's missing one entire page which is at the end. She comments on it and says that the work is correct but I'm missing a reference page. \n\nThen she says this.\n\n\"In the future, please listen carefully to the instructions given in class. This will mean that you are required yet another guidance session if this keeps up. Listen carefully in class with your camera on and please consider this course more serious as this will impact your qualifications and how you are able to succeed as a nursery teacher. I understand that direct entry can be overwhelming as others may have more information, but please use the college library books to do extra studying if this is the case. Listen more to instructions in the future and none of this should be a problem, thanks\"\n\nAnd I'm just kinda shocked because...what? I'm top of the class, why do I need more guidance? Cameras on? Mines is never off! I Listen well in class thank you! Direct entry? We just went over this, I was in their class LAST YEAR ASWELL!\n\nI mentioned all of those factors to her in a polite message, asking her if she mixed me up with someone else again. She said no and yeah, I'm honestly ready to scream at them. \n\nHow come I'm the one putting in all this effort and I'm also the one being pushed to my negative limits? It's like the teachers all want to push me to madness or something! I can't do anything right apparently because as soon as anyone finds out next have zero experience working with children, they give me weird looks and tell me that im not in the right job. \n\nOn top of that, on Monday, I've got an important teacher coming out to assess me to see if i can pass being a nursery teacher. I have no idea what I'm doing because I'm asking everyone questions and their response? Ask your mentor! I can't ask my mentor, she doesn't seem to want to help me with this. I stand near the other students mentor to eavesdrop whenever I can to get extra information because I'm learning more from her than I am my own mentor. \n\nIm furious that I try hard and my efforts are basically wasteful. I could literally not show up to class and they'd probably think I was in that day, my college teachers and my nursery teacher both. Obviously I won't, but I'm at the point I wanna just scream!",
