  "text": "I am a first year first semester college student and have discovered I do not like what I am studying. The only thing I\u2019ve ever been interested in is history/political science especially international relations and really want to pursue a job in that field. I would even go into a Ph.D program if needed. I am a member of the horatio alger association and will have very little debt after 4 years and may get additional money for grad school. I am still super worried about job outlook as my school isn\u2019t prestigious, but it really is what I\u2019m passionate about. Any advice?",

Some sort of engineering?\n\nNot sure this applies to you, but I switched to the thing I was passionate about (physics) for the BS and plan to get an MS in the thing I think will get me a job (computer science).  I\u2019m not discounting working for a while and then going back for a PhD in physics or biomedical engineering (another passion).",
