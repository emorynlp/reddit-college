  "title:": "Fear of Being Unqualified After Graduation",
  "text": "I'm a graphic design major in community college and plan on transferring to a 4 year university. As of late, I've been horrendously anxious over being unqualified after graduation and am wondering if anyone else can relate.\n\nI'm terrified that these future programs won't prepare me and that I'll stay stagnant with my designs. I'm scared that I'm being left behind and that others are improving at way faster rates than me. It's a dumb anxiety but two years of specialized teachings towards my major don't feel like enough for some reason.\n\nDo you all feel severely unprepared for a professional career and that you haven't learned all that needs to be learned?",
