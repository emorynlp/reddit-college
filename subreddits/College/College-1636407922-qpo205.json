  "text": "I\u2019ve been presented with the opportunity to work at this job that is closer to where i live and is willing to give me a higher wage than where i\u2019m working at right now. \n\nThe thing is, i know many people who work there who tells me that the environment is just \u201ctoxic\u201d in a way that they lowkey take advantage of the good employees and over work them way too much. i would get this job to have a higher income, especially because im a college student who needs to pay off loans. \n\nThe job I work at now has amazing people, amazing managers and my close friends work with me. This job is very far from my house. gas prices are just HORRIBLE, and i would be filling up my tank every week. I dont get that much hours either.\n\nI guess this is just a case of good environment vs good wage. any thoughts of what i should do? which job should i choose?",
