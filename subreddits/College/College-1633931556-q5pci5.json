  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman in college rn and it\u2019s been killing me literally. I am already failing chemistry and i have no hope for even being able to bring that grade back up. and i can never get anything above a C on any of my Spanish quizzes. I don\u2019t know why i can not do well in school when i\u2019m highschool i was a straight A student and school came easy to me. I now realized that i am stressed and i am just trying to get by in classes. I need help with suggestions on how to improve study habits and fix my grades and overall well being. I also commute everyday with 8am lectures that i typically miss because of that. I hate this semester. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.. any comment helps!!",

      "text": "School was easy be used high school was easy. \n\nAsk your teachers for advice on the best ways to study for their class. Go to office hours, seek the tutoring center, and use outside sources for additional help on content you\u2019re confused on. Khan Academy is a great resource for  chemistry. Also study my making quizzing yourself through practice tests and flash cards. \n\nAs for your lecture. You just have to wake up and go even if you don\u2019t want to. I too have an 8am lecture and granted it\u2019s a 20 minute commute, I still make it a habit to wake up at 6am. Just push through this semester, and make a reminder to not choose earlier classes next time if you have that option. \n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up though, freshman year is an adjustment period. I\u2019m currently in my first semester and have had to change my studying habits completely. \n\nYou\u2019ll get into the swing of things soon enough.",

      "text": "Mmk, you\u2019re not a failure. Is this a rough semester for you? Yes. This semester doesn\u2019t define you though. Transitioning from highschool to college is rough for a lot of people who were straight A students. I was a straight A student and I\u2019m fighting for my life in human anatomy right now \ud83d\ude02  That\u2019s why schools have resources for you to use. Go to SI sessions if you can, go to a tutor session, contact your professor, make a schedule to study and push yourself to be disciplined, and start away from distractions. Some things to consider would be to drop the chemistry class if you\u2019re failing it and retake it if you can and maybe thinking about the major your going for. In terms of Spanish, YouTube some Spanish videos/songs. Make the process fun for you and flash card it as much as you can. Most importantly, time to wake up and get up early. You have to make it to your lectures. Make it a point to do so no matter what. Next semester, if you can, avoid 8 a.m. classes. Biggest takeaway is that you\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re being challenged right not to overcome poor studying habits and preconceptions that learning is passive. It\u2019s not. Trust me, I\u2019m still learning this lesson. You\u2019re going to get through this!",
