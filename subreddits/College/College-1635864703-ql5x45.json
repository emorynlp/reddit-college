  "text": "As a first generation college student going to an out of state school I\u2019m struggling with making close friends. I\u2019ve been putting myself out there through clubs or club sports, but for some reason no one wants to hang outside of those. Is this normal? What should I do? All I want is a girl best friend, but right now I only feel like an outsider.",
