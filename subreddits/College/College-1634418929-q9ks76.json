  "text": "Most of the people I know at my university keep going home every weekend. Therefore the university tend to be pretty dead during the weekend. Most them says they go home to see family, high-school friends, and to do laundry. Which is all alright, but this is not really a option for me. I simply don't have these thing at home, nor is my home life that good going back to anyways. What are some of the thing I could do during the weekend? How can I find people in a more similar situation too me?",

          "text": "If you don't mind me asking, why do you go home every weekend and what do you do? It just such a foreign concept too me. Last year I live 30 hours away from my parents and even now where my parents moved a little under an hour away from me, it never really been a good option for me. I don't even call there place my home. I don't have any friends there, nor is there anything to do there in that small town. It kind make me jealous that they have a place they want to go back too. So it kinda pains me when everyone leaves.",
