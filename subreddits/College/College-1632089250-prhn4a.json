I doubt many people know people who work in ethics as a career, but I do know someone, an MD, who is involved in medical ethics as a member of a disciplinary board in his profession. If you want to be involved in ethics in the criminal justice system I am not familiar with any specific careers, but I believe it's likely that your major/minor choices would be a good start. Philosophy is probably a better choice than psychology because ethics is a branch of philosophy.\n\nIf you're sure you want to do ethics but aren't dead set on doing criminal justice ethics, I would consider trying to get into healthcare ethics because a quick google search indicates to me that those jobs are likely significantly more plentiful than ethics jobs in criminal justice. However, you should definitely do more research on your own and try to contact people in the field for advice.", "author": "HumanDrinkingTea", "created": 1632092086, "upvotes": 2}}}
