  "text": "I started at my local CC under General Studies AS, I was \"giving it time\" I guess to figure it out but I am now 90% positive I want to major in Computer Science. I'm only entering my second semester but I want to take Programming Fundamentals I to see how I like it, I'm really interested in programming and want to learn more about it. Is this ok? Or should I just focus on the pre reqs needed for the AS? Should I also see advising to declare for a CS degree? I'm confused on this whole process but I really want to take a class related to my major on top of some of my pre reqs before I transfer.",

      "text": "I'd say if you think that CS is the direction you want to go, talk to the CS advisors at the school you're going to transfer to. They would have the whole flow chart of classes you have to complete and be able to tell you what will and wont transfer credit wise. If you're not worried about that leap yet, just take the class, see how you like it, and worst case it probably counts towards some requirement if you choose not to pursue CS.",

I'm looking at multiple schools to transfer to so I'm not sure which one I'd need to get in touch with but I appreciate your advice as I should just speak to those people to help get me on the right track.\n\nThanks for your reply.",

              "text": "Seconding looking at your transfer school's requirements. I took all my lower div compsci courses in Java when I should have done C++ if I wanted to transfer to one of the universities I'm very loosely considering. (I'm mid career though, so I'm pretty sure I'm not going to apply to this Uni though, so not catastrophic for me) Nobody really warns you about this shit.",

      "text": "Honestly I think one of the best things you can do at a CC is take a class you think is a potential major or career choice. I feel like that\u2019s the best way to try things out and learn what you like and what you don\u2019t. You might take the class and love it, or take it and rethink the whole idea of it as a major. I\u2019d say go for it! Like others have said you can always get in contact with advisors from schools you want to transfer to, and just from personal experience, always double check what the counselors tell you because sometimes they mess things up.",
