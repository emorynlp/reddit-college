We picked the topic and had to make a at minimum 5 page paper using 4 sources (1 having to be a psychical book) that we found. \n\nThe papers were assigned at the beginning of the semester and we were allowed to resubmit the paper to get a better grade (if we chose). Last week on Monday I submitted my copy of the paper to see what my professor thought and to see what needed to be worked on it. He handed back papers yesterday (Monday the 15th) and asked me to stay after class to talk with him, I am doing well in the class (B/A or 3.5) so I didn't think anything of it and that maybe he just wanted to discuss a critique in person to get his point across. \n\nHe handed me my paper and said \"the language and style you used in this paper is not something I normally see out of a college student, like this wasn't typed out by a person if you know what I mean, it doesn't feel or look right to me, I am not going to jump to any conclusions but my two thoughts are either you plagiarized this paper or your a really above average writer.\" I was shocked, speechless actually. Some backstory (if this helps at all) I wrote a another paper for the same class and professor earlier in the semester and got a 4.0 on it, same language of writing, same style of writing, same everything. \n\nHe gave me the paper back and said \"here, look it over and see what you can do to it, I don't really want to report you for plagiarism or give a 0 for this assignment.\"\n\nI took the paper back and took it home with me, stared at it and was just like \"what the fuck was that?\"\n\nI reviewed the paper for plagiarism on Grammarly and it came back with a 4% match, I am so confused now.\n\nWhat did my professor see that I didn't? Is my writing style really that \"odd\"\n\nI'd like to hear what you guys/gals think.", "author": "ImpulseDecider", "created": 1555436784, "retrieved": 1632947984, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 606, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"el4s8sg": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bdwvpk/professor_raised_a_concern_that_i_might_have/el4s8sg/", "text": "A little warning, if your submit a paper into turn it in and then resubmit it the entire paper will light up as plagiarized.

She told me I had to have cheated by copying a book.  I told her I had written it myself but she did not believe it. I was a good student who always worked hard and got As and this traumatized me.  She insisted I bring all the books I used to class.  After going to library to recheck them out, I could not get them as someone  else had them. I felt so guilty even though what she said was untrue.  I had no way to prove my innocence. I told her I could not get the books but that I had written it.  The bitch said ok, I\u2019ll give you a B because the paper was torn crooked.  It made me feel like I had been robbed. \n\nI bet this professor suspects because your writing is better than everyone else.  So many people do just cut and paste from the internet. But if you did not, go talk to the professor.  \n\nThis happened to my husband as well.  He is now a professor himself.  But as an undergrad he was accused of it because his paper was so good that his teacher did not think a freshman could have written it. He told him if he did write it, it was the best paper by a freshman he ever read. \n\nAt least this guy believed him after talking to him and gave him an A plus. \n\nIf you go talk to him and show him your thought process how you came to your ideas and maybe show him other writing you have done then maybe he will be the type that believes you.

For example, one time, it was because I knew one of my students translated an academic paper that was published in German.  Another time, it was because I knew the student did not write the paper but had her graduate student boyfriend (who I knew) write the paper. \n\nWe had a fairly sophisticated plagiarism detection software program where I taught.  Since about 2005, every student term paper for that department had been submitted and was compared against that.  We could also compare the papers to other papers that students in similar classes had submitted at all levels (undergraduate through graduate) at the universities who subscribed to that service.  \n\nGrammarly is not the software we used. The software (this was in 2011-2015, when I was teaching) was not flawless, however.  It yielded a lot of false positives because it used several different methods to detect patterns in writing based not only on linguistic congruity (basically, the degree to which a set of words are similar to another set of words, which is what Grammarly uses); but also analyzed the degree to which the word usage, style, and syntax were consistent throughout the paper, or varied.\n\nSo, for example, let's say you were a good student and you wrote 70% of your paper, but you got lazy and then paraphrased without citing a source and you were careful enough to change a minimally adequate number of words that there wasn't more than 20% similarity between your paraphrasing and the underlying source.  Our program would still detect the consequential change in your linguistic usage.  We could detect that fairly well.\n\nThis software was expensive, though it was pretty popular at the time and I know the company is still around.  It might be what your school is using, and it may be that your professor doesn't know how to interpret the results.  On the other hand, it may well also be that you're an above-average writer whose proficiency exceeds that of a typical undergraduate.\n\n(Note: in my experience, most undergraduates, if not all of them, are not very good writers.)\n\nMy advice to you is that if you did not cheat, to resubmit the paper as you initially wrote it and without changes.  You might relate to your professor that you are confused as to why he thought you were cheating, and explain to him how it was that you wrote the paper.  Another thing you might do is offer to submit the native format document with the original metadata that includes editing time, if there is any ongoing concern.\n\nMetadata in a document is important because good tech people can figure out the number of keystrokes that were involved in generating a document; it can itemize the document's changes at various stages of development based on auto-save functions; and it can show how long was spent, over how many days, working on the document (assuming you weren't copying and pasting your final draft into a new document).  Metadata can also trace a document to a specific device, and match up the keystrokes to a particular device, created by a particular user account, at a particular time.  This information, competently interpreted, is proof that you did the work yourself.", "author": "theoryofdoom", "created": 1555465924, "upvotes": 8}, "el2cpoh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bdwvpk/professor_raised_a_concern_that_i_might_have/el2cpoh/", "text": "Obviously we don\u2019t know what he saw, we didn\u2019t read the paper nor do we know you.
