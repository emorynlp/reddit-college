  "text": "I\u2019m not sure how to word this, so I\u2019ll just explain: my mother had a heart attack two weeks ago that left her in the hospital for 3 days. Since I\u2019m the only one living with her that can drive, that means that I had to drive her to and from the hospital. I knew I was going to miss 2 sessions of one of my classes, so I contacted that particular teacher a day in advance. She told me it was totally fine, nothing to worry about, etc. A few days ago, she has me wait till after class (all online) to tell me that I\u2019m going to be having 2 points taken off my overall grade for having missed these days. I told her that my mom had a heart attack (again), and she just said that there\u2019s no excuses. What can I do to get these points added back to my grade/get justice for this? How is this fair?",

Try and show these to your professor and talk with them again and if that doesn't help definitely talk with the dean of students.",

      "text": "If the issue is with grading and you can\u2019t resolve it with the professor, the next step should be the department chair (assuming you have proper documentation for everything). Absences and points for those absences are usually at the sole discretion of the professor, but it all depends on institutional and departmental policies as to whether excused absences can override said discretion. As others have said, the dean of students may be able to help with documentation and advocacy, but they cannot do anything about grades or override a professor\u2019s decision. That occurs within the department.",
