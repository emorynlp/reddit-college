  "text": "Intro: My statistics professor seems to have an issue with me, and it\u2019s reflected through his grading. I am a straight A student in his class. Most of the class is made up of grades that are calculated by a computer (generated grade), as all of my homework and exams are done on a computer based software. I get no less then 90% (A) on these assignments and exams. \n\nHowever, the moment my professor is able to grade some of my work on his own, such as assignments that he assigns without the use of the computer, he constantly deducts points for stupid ass reasons. The first incident occurred when he trashed my entire statistical report (that even scholars told me was acceptable) because of two minor issues. However, when I reached out to him, he was like \u201cI was grading late and I kind of exaggerated a bit.\u201d The grade was fixed. \n\nThe second incident involved a 15 point assignment where he deducted 5 points from the entire assignment over a spelling error. \n\nThe third incident was today. I am working on a statistics project, and I wrote a nine page report that was technical, clear in its reasoning, and followed all directions. Everyone else got their grade, all 100/100 points. Not gonna lie, some of their papers were worded incorrectly and not at all thorough. I even gave help to these people, and they implemented some of the information I included in mine in their paper, and got a 100. So here comes my paper. Graded 50/100. And the entire paper was marked up and down, scrutinized to the most extreme extent. I asked my peers, and none of them had their papers scrutinized and marked up the way mine was. It was just mine. I had enough. I emailed the teacher stating that I overexert myself for his class and spend 20 hours a week just to ensure I do everything the right way. I asked if I was being too \u201cdetailed\u201d in my paper, as my paper did have a lot of details whereas other students did the bare minimum (using some of my advice). \n\nHe threatened by asking me if I wanted a zero instead for complaining about the 50.\n\nWhat the fuck is this? I never bring up race but is it race involved? What would you do? I am trying to ace all my prerequisite classes to get into a competitive nursing school and I have this jackass fucking up my chances. Out of twelve students who do the bare minimum and hand in messy work, my work is scrutinized and trashed most of the time. Im sick of this.",

The way to get what you want is to always take the high road and \"kill them with kindness.\" Once you start sending nasty emails, you bring yourself down to their level and start looking just as bad or worse, and that's the sort of thing that bites you in the ass in the end. As hard as it is, it's important to stay professional 100% of the time in these sorts of situations. No one gives a shit how hard you \"exert\" yourself, and you just come across as full of yourself when you write an email like that. Don't do that. Always write emails with a humble and professional tone.",

      "text": "Ask other students if they would allow you to have a copy of their graded work, as you should show someone over your professor what your grade is vs other grades and the comparison. This could especially be helpful if several people would let you use their work for this.  His boss can look on the grading platform and see all 100s and a sole 50 and do a comparison. Do you have the email detailing how he graded you poorly the first time because it was \"late\" and how he trashed it?, so you have a bit of a pattern going on with proof of the first time, hopefully",

This would imply OP\u2019s work would also be accurate, and he says he put more effort into having a quality piece of work.\n\nCould OP be lying? Yes\n\nDo I think they are? No\n\nWhile effort does not necessarily translate into quality, it\u2019s often a part of it.
