I had to send my current in progress transcript, and once the semester ends I also have to send my official transcript to the new school. Good luck!",

      "text": "First of all, don't \"unenroll\" until you know you've been accepted. Other than that, there should be either an office or a website that you can lookup to send transcripts. It'll probably cost you $5-10 per transcript you send, and you can choose physical or digital and official vs unofficial. Just search for [university] transcripts and that should get you there.\n\nYou basically just follow the same application process you did in high school, and once you've been accepted you may want to talk to your college's advisor and they can direct you who needs to know that you're leaving.",

              "text": "If they require them, yes. However, depending on how many credits you already have, it may not matter. When I transferred schools, for anyone with more than 30 completed college credits, they didn't care about your high school test scores or transcripts at all. But I'm not sure if that is standard across the board or how far along you are.",
