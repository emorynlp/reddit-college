Over the summer I have been having a lot of fun doing CS and software engineering-related stuff. Especially getting to know how to build websites and mobile apps. As a current economics student, I love the field but I don't want to go into a job doing something like accounting or such. I think I have realized I need to make a career change into CS/SWE because it's something I like and am passionate about it.\n\nThe problem is it's my second year (sophomore) at a CC (Community College) and I have to start submitting my applications for UC transfer. Currently, I am taking every prerequisite I need for transferring into economics, but only have taken one class for CS (Intro to C). I need to take some more classes and I don't think I'll be able to get every class in for transfer. If I do, it will take me an extra year at CC. Honestly, I just want to go to a real UC and meet people/ finally get away from home.\n\nI know that for SWE, not everybody is a CS major. I was just wondering whether it would be wise to take an extra year to study CS and transfer, try to go into a UC and switch majors, double major/minor, or study economics.", "author": "TheFortunesFool", "created": 1632853863, "retrieved": 1632945429, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
