  "text": "It occurred to me that I might not pass Anatomy with a B (which is what I need for prereq nursing). I currently have a 67% thanks to the online system giving up on me and making me miss the lab exam. Prof won\u2019t let me retake it.  I calculated and I have to get near perfect scores from here on out to get a flat B in the class. Should I do go through with this? Should I stay in the course despite the big chance of ending up with something lower than a B? My school is offering Excused Withdrawls so should I simply retake it next semester?",
