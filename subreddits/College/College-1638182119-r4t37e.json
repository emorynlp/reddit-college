  "text": "Freshman in community college (though failing my classes) \n\nMy mom has issues with alcohol so last year got a Dui , 2 car accidents, and some broken ribs as a result. \n\n\nShe still occasionally drives drunk and I get INSANELY anxious. Like, I will be internally freaking out the entire weekend and not sleep for days in a row if she goes out. Even when she doesn\u2019t go out drinking, I\u2019m freaking out wondering if she will, since there\u2019s a good chance she will. \n\n\nOh yeah , and when the warmer months come (it\u2019s still cold rn) her drinking problems get way way worse. So this is only the beginning of this years problem. \n\n\nAside from that, someone that lives with me has SEVERE, untreated mental health issues. Last year they got into a few physical altercations with their significant other who visited occasionally ; locking them in rooms, hiding their keys to not let them leave. Breaking and throwing furniture. Both times my family member ended up pushing, and then beginning to choke them. Their S.O was screaming out my name for help each time and I had to pull my family members hands off of their necks. \n\n\nIt hasn\u2019t happened again but I\u2019m still not over it. I wish I was mentally stronger but I still worry it will happen again. A few months ago their SO broke up with them again and I freaked out, especially because the break up was taken back and he started staying **more** often. I spent a month and a half barely sleeping or doing schoolwork (again, my fault) \n\nIdk I just get so nervous when they\u2019re together and he stays way longer now. Their break up is what originally triggered all the physical stuff. Aside from the violence i am **constantly walking on eggshells** because as I said earlier my family member has severe issues, many revolving around cleanliness. Sometimes my mom will critiquing something my family member does and I\u2019ll have to quietly say \u201cno ,no\u201d and shake my head/ change the subject s as to not upset my family member\n\nIt\u2019s not that I think they\u2019ll get physical, I\u2019m worried about what they will do to themselves if they feel like a burden to us  (which they basically called me because of my cleaning not matching their standards) \n\nI have my own mental struggles too, but they\u2019re exaggerated tenfold being here. I have poor coping mechanisms (SH) and want to work, save for a year, move out and then start considering school again. \n\n\nI\u2019m just so anxious here.",
