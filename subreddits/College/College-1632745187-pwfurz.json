Try giving yourself time to adjust, don't go home the first weekend, set a goal to stay for a month, until fall break, or thanksgiving,  depending on how far away your are.  Everything is new, and it's both exciting and overwhelming. Try and find some balance in it. Keep going to class, try eating in different dining halls if your school has them. Some food options will be better than others. Keep an eye out for activities that interest you, even if you are going alone, sports events, concerts, museums. There are usually activity fairs, and call out meetings for clubs within the first few weeks of school. The atmosphere on a campus really changes within a few weeks once things start getting busier. It's also okay, to let people at home know you miss them. Instagram and video chat with your family and high school friends. A lot of college students ask for frequent pictures or videos of their pets. My dogs have an instagram page. Some people have comfort shows they like to watch, (good place, great british bakeoff, schitts creek, ...)  Don't spend all your time in your room alone, but it's okay to take care of yourself.", "author": "fawkes_fiesta", "created": 1632749311, "upvotes": 1}}}
