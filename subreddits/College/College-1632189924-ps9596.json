  "text": "I keep going through these phases of productivity and laziness. My first year of college was awful. Had an average of 1.9 by the end of the year and moved and got initiated into a fraternity. The last month tho I became extremely productive and aced my exams, resulting in me not failing 3-4 classes. I continued this productivity when I went home by going to the gym, investing and researching stocks, creating healthy meals, reading self help books left and right and studying them from around May through June. Once July hit, I fell into another hole, and spent the rest of my summer staying inside, eating like crap, and constantly playing video games. From July to late august, I put almost 500 hours into this new game I started called rust. Once I was halfway through august, I started becoming extremely productive once again, grinding all my possible assignments for the new semester, going to the gym and all the other stuff.  I turned from a 1.9 student to having an average of 102% in all my classes after the first month. Now it\u2019s near the end of September and I\u2019m recognizing myself sipping back into my unproductive cycle, where I just do nothing and procrastinate all the important things all day. I really really dont want to slip and fall into this unproductive cycle again, but I don\u2019t know what to do as I feel that it\u2019s happening to me and I just can\u2019t stop it. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips? Is this a normal thing?",
