  "text": "Wow.   I never knew that I would be in one of the classes. The first thing he   does is talk about how the first exam had B average and second exam   mysteriously has F average. Turns out this man gave the exact same first   exam to the previous year class. It seems almost the entire class of   less than 20 students had the first exam and what they thought would be   is the second exam.\n\nSomehow I   never knew and nobody cared to help me out. I guess making zero friends   and spending my days in a library ended up saving my career and was   worth it after all.\n\nBut is that   allowed? I thought that classes need to have certain grade averages or   curve will be mandatory. I assume almost the entire class now received a   0 on the exam is bad for average class GPA or are those students not   included?\n\nAnd lmfao at how he gave the second exam right after withdrawal/ drop date.",

      "text": "Too funny, but it's a myth that classes need to have a certain grade average or mandatory curve. Totally up to the professor in most settings. I know one professor personally whose grade average has been a D for his entire 25 year career so far. He warns the first day of class that his exams are so hard that they absolutely will make some people in the class cry.",

      "text": "There is no policy that says exams have to be curved, and in this instance, it seems that a lot of people failed because they chose to try to cheat using prior exams and they didn\u2019t actually prepare like they should have.\n\nFinal course grades might raise an eyebrow or two if someone has several semesters of high failure rates, but that would be a conversation with the department chair at most (unless the admin micromanages and insists that classes need to be forced into a certain grade distribution).",

      "text": "So long as the exam assessed material covered in the class and the professor presented the information adequately then its perfectly OK. Professors are under no obligation for the class to get a certain grade (in theory). They have to teach and assess, it is the students' responsibilities to earn the grades.",
