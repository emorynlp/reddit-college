  "text": "Wow.   I never knew that I would be in one of the classes. The first thing he   does is talk about how the first exam had B average and second exam   mysteriously has F average. Turns out this man gave the exact same first   exam to the previous year class. It seems almost the entire class of   less than 20 students had the first exam and what they thought would be   is the second exam.\n\nSomehow I   never knew and nobody cared to help me out. I guess making zero friends   and spending my days in a library ended up saving my career and was   worth it after all.\n\nBut is that   allowed? I thought that classes need to have certain grade averages or   curve will be mandatory. I assume almost the entire class now received a   0 on the exam is bad for average class GPA or are those students not   included?\n\nAnd lmfao at how he gave the second exam right after withdrawal/ drop date.",

I know one professor personally whose grade average has been a D for his entire 25 year career so far. He warns the first day of class that his exams are so hard that they absolutely will make some people in the class cry.",

At college the student is probably a lost cause for the professor (good luck stuffing not just calculus but also remedial algebra *simultaneously*, when it is impossible to meaningfully grasp calculus without algebra, likewise for writing essays when the student can't form meaningful sentences and paragraphs), so they also pass the buck. The instructors are pressured to lie to students about their incompetency by giving them passing grades to satisfy them and everyone else.\n\na possible result is the student coasts through and graduates with a degree for which they haven't really earned. the other possible result is that *the buck stops with a professor*. And then that student fails miserably because the professor upheld the standard. This is usually limited to a few students because admissions does a decent job screening for good students, but at open enrollment institutions (or virtually open enrollment, for colleges with a 90%+ admission rate), it is possible to get entire classes that aren't actually educated enough to pass the course.\n\nso in your corporate model, if a lot of people missed a *single* question, it's probably your problem. But if a lot of people miss a ton of questions, enough to fail the course/module, it's probably HR doing a bad job of screening clearly unqualified candidates.",
