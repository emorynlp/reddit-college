  "text": "Hey, I was planning on going to PA school after getting a degree in cogsci neuroscience and possibly minoring in compsci. In case PA school doesn\u2019t work out, what jobs could I get with this major (I\u2019m a freshman in college so technically nothing is set in stone yet, but I\u2019m leaning towards this as my major). Thank you!",

              "text": "that is true. neuroscience + a comp sci minor sounds like it could lead to opportunities in that field, though. If you're seriously considering the minor in CS, maybe see if you could do a double major in it instead, if you would want to go that route.",

                  "text": "The reason why I\u2019m not inclined is 1. I\u2019m not the best at math and have zero coding experience 2. My colleges CS program is ridiculously hard so it will be tough for me to maintain a good GPA 3. I need to also fulfill PA school prereqs on top of both major requirements and get clinical hours which will be virtually impossible if I major in both which was why I decided to minor in compsci instead. Ik a compsci major with a cogsci minor would probably be better off but I just don\u2019t think I can handle compsci as a major in general.",
