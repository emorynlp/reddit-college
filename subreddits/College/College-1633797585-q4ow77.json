  "text": "Hey all, I am a Post-Bacc student in Washington State, going back to school to get a degree in Environmental Studies (1st degree was ELA Education), and I\u2019m not eligible for grants via FAFSA because of my Post-Bacc status. I am reaching out here because I am hoping to not take out any more loans than I already have, and have hit a dead end trying to find a way to fund my second go around at a BA. I am already signed up for work study, but it is only covering about 1/5 of the costs for this school year. Just looking for some advice, or resources, that may point me in the right direction. Thanks!",

      "text": "A post-bacc is different from a second bachelor's. It's usually a couple courses, mainly pre-reqs, that would prepare to enter grad school. Post-baccs do offer merit scholarships, but there is likely to be little funding overall for post-baccs and second bachelor's alike because you already have a bachelors. You did the thing already. Any money a school have will be prioritized for students have haven't yet done the thing. \n\nMy advice, take some community college classes or self-teach and self-certify.",
