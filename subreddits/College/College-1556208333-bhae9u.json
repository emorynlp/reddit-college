He skipped class in order to sleep in all day. He self-harmed. He became desperate for companionship and tried to pursue relationships not only with borderline strangers, but also members of our close-knit friend group. All in all, it was a very uncomfortable thing to witness all year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, he's met a guy on Tinder from the next state over, and things have been moving fast for them. They're planning on meeting up, barring the difficulties that come from the fact that neither of them have cars never mind their licenses. Overall, I'm happy for him, if not for one thing; numerous times when they call, my roommate has repeatedly said that they're guaranteed to have the room to themselves whenever they want, and that he has no issue kicking me out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were at any other point in the semester, I really wouldn't mind and I would happily give them their privacy. But this upcoming Monday marks the first day of finals week. I don't so much mind giving them a couple of hours to themselves as I could just go to the library, but I'm not keen on sleeping at a friend's room the night before a final.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice on how to talk to my roommate about it? I basically want to affirm that I am genuinely happy that he found someone new, but I'm not about to place his relationship before my final grades.", "author": "bakedpotatowcheezpls", "created": 1556208333, "retrieved": 1632947988, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 605, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"enobnea": {"link": "/r/college/comments/bhae9u/am_i_wrong_for_not_wanting_my_roommate_to_have/enobnea/", "text": "The room?
