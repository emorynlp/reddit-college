  "text": "I'll be.going from Florida to Michigan for school, my roommate is already apprehensive because of Florida's high cases and stuff. Understandable. She wants me to quarantine in my room for two weeks and may be exoecting me to not spend time in the kitchen either, idk. In case the worse extreme happens, what recommendations do yall have for food to keep me full? I should prob invest in a microwave I can keep in my room. Is it OK to have it on a plastic wood or carpet floor, or a dresser? Thank you for any help you can provide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Whoa, I had no idea this post blew up. Thank yall so much. She is fine with me using the kitchen it turns out, I asked her.",

This is an apartment. I personally understand it since she's been in the apartment but ehhh. I think they're mad that you essentially affirmed that overreaction by voicing the same sort of panic and affirmed the idea that just because I'm from a high risk area and roommate is not, I need to quarantine way more than her. Which people don't agree with. They don't want me letting my roommate dominate my life, which I'm concerned about too. I don't think you had poor intention but I think this is the reason for the hate. I appreciate your concern\n\nAlso, UofM!! :D",

I know all of this requires a microwave but it\u2019s a good investment, especially considering the fact that a lot of off-campus apartments in the old fourth ward don\u2019t come with microwaves.

      "text": "Mom here: lots of things marketed at younger kids need no refrigeration & come in individual serving sizes.\n\nThere is \"shelf stable\" milk that does not need to be refrigerated before opening. Horizon organics brand has a 6 pack of school-lunch size milks (intended market, young kids) that comes with attached plastic straws, available in chocolate or regular. I've seen it as recently as a 6 months ago - I bet they still sell it.\n\nSo you could have cereal in a paper or styrofoam bowl, with the milk being one of the Horizon individual shelf-stable milks.\n\nAlso aimed at kids for school lunches:\n\n- snack-pak puddings (shelf stable): choc flavors taste good, butterscotch okay (some find it too sweet), \"unicorn\" or other weird flavors (pink/blue) are nasty\n\n- Fruit cocktail (plastic ones kids can puncture easily & leak!)\n\n- jello (if shelf stable).\n\n- 10 pack of Individual chips\n\n- Granola bars\n\n- Cereal: the  8 or 10 pack minis variety pack\n\n- Spaghettios (not-so-bad room-temp)\n\nNon-kid marketed items:\n\n- summer sausage in small size (shelf stable before opening) \n\n- wonder bread (doesn't mold, no crumbs)\n\n- mustard (can go without refrigeration)\n\n- ketchup packets\n\n- chocolate bars (high in calories/fat; will fill you up): avoid sugary \"candy\" bars, look for milk or 65% (semisweet) or dark (and add variety with some having almonds, orange, etc)\n\n- almonds: plain to eat with chocolate\n\n- canned ice or cold brew coffee\n\nFitness foods:\n\n- power bars\n\n- kind bars\n\n- protein drinks (meal replacement) - some taste disgusting, and it is easy to tire of them after two days: so taste one first before buying a 12 pack!\n\nA convenience store (7-11; gas station food section) or food aisle of 99c store will have many things:\n\n- individual wrapped muffins (cheap, convenience style ones are shelf stable)\n\n- canned nuts, flavored (wasabi; honey roast)\n\n- slim Jim sausages\n\nIf you have very hot water:\n\n- obviously ramen\n\n- individual oatmeals\n\n- avoid individual just add hot water! soups (look like individ. oatmeals) are DISGUSTING\n\nLast, I would recommend fruit for a break from all the processed food, and to vary textures: apples and oranges last longest. \n\nAnd very last: cereal and the Horizon Milk minis are probably your best option. I feel like I could eat cereal exclusively for two weeks; can't say the same for power bars or slim Jim's!",

              "text": "Oh, I'm so glad!\n\nHang in there. It's gonna be a weird year for all of you college students, but it will get better. There were college aged kids in WWII and those who were home not fighting got through it (even if gap year or two) and eventually all the young adults & colleges got back to a better situation. You will get through this too.\n\nAnd please, despite many indignant comments here, I cannot urge you strongly enough to be gentle in your judgements of your new roommate and the request to quarantine. This is a very scary time for so many of us. You do not known his or her backstory, family situation, health history. \n\nI'd rather almost that you (if you had to choose only one of my advices), that you not follow the food advice list & be hungry & cranky for two weeks but have a good relationship with your roommate, than that you would be offended by their request for you to quarantine and so have good food but start of wrong with your roommate!\n\nYou could handle poor nutrition or bit of hunger for two weeks.\n\nMuch more difficult to handle bad roommate vibes for a year!\n\nIf I was you, I'd post a redditt request that you have to quarantine as you are coming from hot spot states, and ask redditt for ideas on how to get to know your new roommate who will not be quarantining (non hot spot). If you are a gamer, maybe you and new roomie can play online...? If not, maybe ask roomie for a Skype or Zoom or FaceTime to talk about what the campus is like? Sorry if sounds cheesy: I'm so much older than all of you!! So not wise to nowadays spcifics socializing. But I think it would really be in your best interest to make a big effort to get along with your new roommate.\n\nMy years of work, roommates, and other times where I get thrown together with strangers has proven GIFTS go a long way (sad you have to buy comraderie or friendship, but true!). \n\nIf I was you, I would send a message to future roommate thanking them for letting you know what he/she is comfortable with (honestly, it really was a good move as opposed to passive-agressively avoiding you!!) and assuring you have ordered food supplies & will strictly quarantine, and then...I'd tell new roomie you are really excited to be living together and you'd like to have a gift shipped to the dorm/apt that SHE (he? idk?) would like. Ask if an electric teapot or Keurig or milk frother is what she would like? Or if they have a Keurig or Nespresso, could you send coffee pods? Or a room decor items (like a school spirit posted or pennant, or a school logo glass or coffee cuo)? Or if she would prefer & could tell you her (his?) shirt size, offer to buy her (him?) a school t-shirt. I'm serious. Spend 30-75 bucks and it will make your entire year better. School bookstore could either ship item, or if you are on campus, call, explain you are quarantining, pay over phone and ask them to hold the item for roommate to pick up.\n\nGood luck!\n\nYou can do this!!!",

I see why it can seem unfair and controlling but given the context, it makes way more sense. I prob won't miss out on much anyway, seeing I'm not great in party settings anyway (half deaf introvert nature, wanna preserve the hearing I have left) so I don't last long in them. I don't intend on going to any this year. XD\nI will consider and ask roommate about what she might want, Thanks again for the advice!",

If you test negative, have no symptoms and minimal contact with others, your roommate should be considerate of your needs so that you can at least use the kitchen. Still mask up and keep distance for a while, for her comfort and both of your safety.\n\nAlso invest in some disposable gloves for the purpose of cleaning. Put on a fresh pair of gloves after you're done cooking, clean and disinfect everything you've touched/used, and properly dispose of the gloves and non-reusable cleaning materials, and wash your hands again before eating. You could ask her to leave, or stay in her room while you prepare food and clean the areas you've used, and she should be expected to do the same amount of cleaning when using the kitchen.\n\nSocial distancing is a group effort, it's not a burden to be placed on just the individual members who \"might be infected,\" everyone has to take equal responsibility for it to work. If she isn't quarantining herself for those two weeks as well, she's just as much of a risk to you and others as you are to her.",

                      "text": "Stock up on lots of fruits and veggies that don't require cooking. Tomatoes (especially green tomatoes) and cucumbers make great snacks, ultra delicious when the tomatoes are crisp and cold. Cold cuts (personally, I splurged a lot on good cold cuts like boars head because all that pre packaged stuff has a lot of preservatives and it's not the best) are great if you want sandwiches since it makes for a quick and easy meal. \n\nIn the pre corona times, my roommates and I during my freshman year didn't get a long at all and a large part of it was because they were hoarders. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't the cleanest person in the world but at least I never left the kitchen a mess and would do my laundry quickly. I once had one of them leave their wet clothes in the dryer and a load that was yet to be washed inside the washer. Shithead left for the whole weekend and didn't care, so I ended up packing all of her shit in garbage bags and left them at her door, unwashed and for the load in the dryer, I left it soaking wet no fucks given. Not my fault she couldn't keep track of her stuff before she left for a 3 day weekend.\n\nI was so disgusted by them that I ended up moving all my stuff from the kitchen to my bedroom and I relied exclusively on the microwave for heated foods, a blender for smoothies (15 bucks for a cheapy one at walmart), and an electric kettle (about 20 bucks at walmart for a good one) so that I can still make instant mash, mac and cheese, and of course, ramen. Veggies, cottage cheese and jellies, fruits, sandwiches with quality cold cuts, yoplait yogurts were staples in my fridge. Also would be good for you to look into freeze dried fruits, edamame chips, healthier varieties of chips if you're more health conscious (I didn't care, all the walking I did on a hilly campus burned off the calories of the not so healthy chips as did scraping my car of the snow and ice in the winters) because who doesn't love snacks? \n\nHope all of this info was helpful!\n\nEdit: completely forgot to mention to invest in a mini fridge like I did (65-70 at walmart for a decent sized one). Corona or not, always a good idea to have in your room if the dorms allow it so that you can keep stuff you don't want to risk your roommates eating in there, keep refrigeration mandatory meds in there and other things as well that you don't want them getting into. I consider it a worth while investment no matter what.",
