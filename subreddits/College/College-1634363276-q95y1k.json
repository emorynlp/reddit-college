  "text": "I'm struggling a lot with organization and being able to study. I have exams literally every week and it feels like I'm stuck underneath a sea. Being this behind makes me feel like it's impossible and I'm letting down my parents so I try to study and can't bring my mind off this for more than 10 minutes. My sleep schedule is also inverted which makes it so much worse cause I get mentally prepared and it's already dark out so I feel like I'm out of time.",

      "text": "Does your school have any resources? Most do, and you're paying for it so you should use it! They should have some counseling services available. If you have something like adhd making life harder they'll have advice/referrals for that too.\n\nAlso, there's a bunch of good TED talks about study skills and keeping organized. Watch some and take notes of things that sound helpful to you.\n\nHas your sleep schedule always been off or has it become that way? Melatonin is your friend for falling asleep on time. No screens before bed (hard, I know) and light when you wake up, etc.",
