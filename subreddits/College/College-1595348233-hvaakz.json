My first freshman semester I moved to a college where I new nobody, and felt extremely alone. It also didnt help thay my longterm girlfriend broke up with me, and I didnt have any motivation to go out and meet new people. Over winter break I made myself promise myself that when I got back, I would force myself to go out and meet new people, and get involved. My campus was small aswell (around 2500 students total), but the first few days I met some students in my major that had a lot of similar classes, and I took the initiative to talk to people. \n\nMaybe the most suprising thing is that you are \u201cnormal\u201d. Every single student feels like they are an outcast, and even I myself was thought of as stuck up, but in reality I was just very quiet and nervous about what other people thought of me.\n\nThe best advice I can share and what truly helped me was to realize that EVERYBODY is uncomfortable. Everyone is thinking about themselves and their own personal image. If you want things to change and to meet new people, you need to take the leap and initiate things, and just be an open, honest person to people.

A few thoughts:  \n1. Friends are often made when you're doing something alongside each other (classmates, coworkers, etc). See if there's anyone you're already connecting with via an activity such as the gym or class and see if it is something that can grow into a friendship outside.\n\n2. It seems that many people have suggested tapping into resources/groups at your university. But what about outside your university where you could connect with people who aren't also students? Maybe you could become active in a church, join a kickball league or become a regular at a restaurant or coffee shop in the city. You live in Manhattan - there are millions of people around you you could connect with!\n\n3. Since so many things are virtual right now, why not embrace/build upon that for social connections? You could join a facebook group or a virtual book club or a Meetup group. You could try dating apps or friending apps (I've made a lot of good friends on Bumble BFF) and have virtual hangouts which could hopefully fulfill your social life. You could also have a virtual friendship by DMing someone on social media or using your campus's online learning platform to connect with people. (FYI - I met my fiance on Instagram. I also made a really good friend in college because I sent him a DM on Canvas and we connected from there.) You could even conduct like group study/homework sessions with your classmates this fall.\n\n4. When you want to do something social, think about how you could be the leader/creator/host of an event. I always see people having wine night or dinner parties and think - ahh that's so fun I wish I could go. But I forget that I could host my own Super Bowl party or invite someone to a picnic, etc. I don't have to wait on other people - I can be the organizer!\n\n5. Since you referenced your visa, I'm wondering if you're an international student (which might not be the case). But if so, I think it's important to recognize that friendship/social life is cultural and your experiences with having friends might be different than some of the practices in the US. I think it's important to have a group of friends who are different from you but also have a safe group of friends who are from the same cultural background.\n\n6. Lastly as many have already said on here - what is even normal? You have to be yourself and be true to you! It sounds like you have a lot of things going for you especially with your fitness and travel. While I appreciate you wanting to also have friends, you have to embrace and acknowledge the special things you do have in your life. I had friends in college but was always a bit different/independent from them. After college, I ended up living abroad, advancing in my career, and heading in a completely different direction than they did and I am so grateful for all of the risks that I have taken. I probably wouldn't have been so bold in these decisions if I was concerned about keeping or losing my friends. Keep working on trying to meet people but also value and prioritize your own life and success as well.\n\nWishing you the best!!\n\nI'", "author": "thestudentcollective", "created": 1595368843, "upvotes": 2}, "fyt6cl1": {"link": "/r/college/comments/hvaakz/how_can_i_become_normal/fyt6cl1/", "text": "I had a completely opposite experience as you but I feel that I could still try to give some advice. \n\nUnlike you, I tend to be quite social.

Be different. If you have a talent, express it. People are attracted to uniqueness. Don\u2019t use it to show off, perhaps use it to express more of you and use it to help others. \n\nFinding the right group is hard, but a lot of times we overthink it. A lot of people are pretty lonely, or feel as such, in college. A lot of us are just afraid of breaking the ice or being the first to make an advance.

My freshman year was a huge low for me. But actually part of the reason for that is because I was trying to be someone I'm not. As others have stated, to hell with being \"normal.\" If you want to be a better person, go for it. But the idea of trying to be \"normal\" for the sake of making relationships can take a toll on you.\n\nAlthough I'm sure you've heard it a bunch, sometimes friend groups take a while to form in college. And it is true that you may find some really good friends a couple years in. I (prospective junior) still don't have any friends at school but I know that if I try to be someone else/be \"normal\" I won't be me. After all, if you're not being your authentic self, will your potential friends really be able to get to know you? I'm sure you would want them to just be themselves, so you should do the same.\n\nI'm not a very outgoing/social person, but I can say it's very good to know your boundaries. Don't do anything that makes you terribly uncomfortable in trying to make friends, but maybe try and push yourself a bit. Show up to events, hang out in common areas, others mentioned things about FB/snapchat groups. If that is out of your league (which is kinda the case for me lol), just occupy yourself with schoolwork and hobbies. Friends will come with time.

I think a lot of people are feeling a bit stircrazy and in need of friends \u2014 so hopefully that\u2019ll ease some of your concerns. I also didn\u2019t talk to anyone except my brother and professor my first year. (While I didn\u2019t mind too much, it definitely  makes it harder later to take initiative to make friends). I\u2019d recommend trying to be in public places more (as safely as possible). If it isn\u2019t school orgs, then like maybe your school union/student center. Consider getting a job on campus that requires team building (i.e. at the gym, as an office assistant). That probably helped the most because it forced me to talk to other people (and friendships/favours budded from there). \nAlso, this is a shitty advice but especially in your first few weeks of the fall semester and find something to talk about. Compliment their shirt, note that you overheard something and wanted to just make note. (I.e. i heard you guys talking about a scary movie\u2014 and was wondering what you recommend). It\u2019s cheesy. It\u2019s difficult said vs done. I know I\u2019ve heard RAs recommend leaving your door physically open when you\u2019re around. It might lead to awkward exchanges, but as someone who\u2019s deathly afraid of approaching other people (especially confident/pretty people) it really helps break the ice. Make it about them, or make it about something you share (i.e class), and with time if YOU and THEM both want a friendship it\u2019ll come. I say this last part because I know there are also people who are just here to be here and will leave once they\u2019re job is done. They have a mindset of friends are nice, but I\u2019m not in the emotional capacity/busy to have some. Don\u2019t take it to heart. It\u2019ll save you from feeling lonely or like you\u2019re not wanted (when in reality they just don\u2019t have friendship in the forefront of their mind).  Finally, again cheesy but considering that you\u2019re in a big city you\u2019re probably not alone in feeling lonely. Maybe using social media to go on \u201cfriend dates\u201d would help get you that initial interaction required to make friends. My friend uses Tinder to meet anime friends (legit no strings attached). She would attend other school clubs, because she just wasn\u2019t around the demographic of those like her. (I.e. anime peeps!) Even though my brother recommended this friend to me, and I knew we had a lot of similar interests I really dragged my feet to go even say hi because she seems so confident/busy/had friends. \n\nAs my best friend now she often tells me my brother tried to convince her to do the same thing but we both were too nervous, but I think putting yourself in those shoes of \u201cbeing the confident one\u201d to approach someone really helps.

You might have the same characteristic, so consider being more conscious about this and walking around with a small smile on your face.\n2. If you haven't already, try your hand at joining a few clubs and organizations. It can be something that you're already interested in and/or have participated in the past, or something entirely new. For instance, it seems you developed fitness as a passion. You can look into joining a fitness class or workout group, or maybe participate in some intramural sports.\n\nBest of luck!

Check out for your class of 202x groups. \n\nMaybe you can start a groupchat / snap group  because \u201cthis would be a nice way to get to know people during covid, and because classes are online\u201d", "author": "SHAKEHENALDB", "created": 1595350122, "upvotes": 310}}}
