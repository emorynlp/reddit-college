  "title:": "Roommate Brings girlfriend to dorm room to sleep over constantly",
  "text": "I just wanted to ask, is it normal if roommate brings over girlfriend to sleepover every weekend?  I'm getting a little annoyed with it and they even sometimes go into the week as well.  However his girlfriend lives far away so can't just come for one day and I understand that they want to see each other. Is it worth trying to talk with him about it or since I have the chance should I just switch rooms.  If it helps our college has rules against this for only 4 days a month with roommates permission but I don't want to be an asshole if this is normal and might just try to move rooms.  The only problem is I don't know who I'll get and other then this my roommate has been nice.\n\n&#x200B;",

That way you are also able to trade off each week if you eventually want to do the same thing and have someone over.\n\nNothing is preventing them from seeing each other during the day and they are also able to make other arrangements like an airbnb if they really want to be together for a few days.\n\nI wouldn't try to get another roommate simply because this is too common of a thing to assume you will avoid with the next one.",

But, if you have an apartment style dorm where you each get your own bedroom then it\u2019s none of your business who\u2019s in his room tbh. I live in an on campus apartment and my boyfriend is over a lot but he\u2019s always in my room and never uses the living room TV, eats anyone\u2019s food, or anything else in the shared spaces. If guests are able to go in to your private room and not cause any disturbance I don\u2019t think a roommate has a right to complain.",
