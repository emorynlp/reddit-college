  "text": "I thought it closed monday not saturday. \n\nProfessor won't let me make it up.\n\nI had in A in the class, now highest I can get is a C. Now I have 3 Cs total in my academic career.\n\nTried asking about extra credit, professor said \"read the syllabus\" although all the syllabus says is that there is extra credit and not how much or what it is.\n\nI have to apply for Grad School. With a C in a major course, I'm fucked.\n\nI hate my life.\n\nEdit: Never mind, I rechecked the syllabus and even with this missed test I can still get a B. It's not an A but at least there's still a chance for me to fix things.",

In the eyes of graduate schools it is perfectly acceptable, and maybe even desired, to be able to demonstrate growth as both a person and student. For example, they will ask about it and if you can point to later math classes with a better grade you can talk about your growth during that time. \n\n Academically, as long as you are Learning the material you will be fine. I would take this opportunity to figure what it is you're struggling with and practice that. Is it not doing enough problems? Try doing some more (I read on a subreddit a great quote a few days ago that said \"Math is not a spectator sport.\" Meaning that you have to actively participate and do the work). Is it the wording of the questions on exams? Practice reading past exams or talk to your professor about how to decipher them. Is it the concept of calc II? Find other sources to learn from that fit well with you. Sometimes you really need to see concepts presented in a different way to understand it. \n\nEspecially if you're going to be using calc in the future, classes or work, I'd suggest slowing down and focus on learning. The grades will come with that, not before, and so will a good mindset for future classes.",

      "text": "missing an exam and then asking for extra credit is typically not a good way to gain sympathy from a teacher. It comes off in their head as  \n\n\n\"Hey, I was irresponsible and missed your test because of x, y, and z. Can you pretty please give me extra credit for being irresponsible?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich I mean, to be fair, is basically what it is. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said if you continue doing well in the class and do everything else to the best of your ability, and get noticed because of this, then you'll have a better chance at getting the opportunity for a curve and/or extra credit. \n\n(Not a teacher, have worked with a lot of teachers though, and this is what I'd expect them to say). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, you can just drop the class and try again. GPA doesn't really mean anything after college anyway.",

Straight As really don't tell a story and a lot of good grad schools like success stories.\n\nYou can contextualize any poor grades in your application. I was considering several top 20 schools before I decided I didn't need a masters. I have an F and a D on my undergrad transcript. My story is that these were during the first two years and that the last two years are much better. \n\nSince this was during the last year you can't use that same strategy. But you can work to demonstrate how commited you were to extra work like projects, volunteering, or independent research during this semester. You want to make it look like you took on a ton of stuff and were ambitious, but it was just a little more than you could handle at the time. And above all else I would not keep talking in a way that diminishes yourself or looks like an apology. I don't think admissions likes that sort of talk.",

However, I still ended up with a B in the class.
