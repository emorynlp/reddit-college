  "text": "Some are international, some are one semester study abroad in the country types, some realized my school is actually shit, I myself am looking to transfer.\n\nI didn't expect the heartbreak of soon being so far from people that I've come to love. I'm anxious the world will hurt them in areas where we can't lean on eachother like we have been. Some are going back to places with high gun violence and racism, all of us are going on to create something of ourselves. I've been hit with a wave of depression with the realization that no matter how great these next days will be, I'll have to say goodbye and hope the next time I see them is soon. \n\nThis semester and my school is so shit but they made it okay. I hope they'll be safe and we can visit eachother soon.",
