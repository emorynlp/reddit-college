  "text": "I\u2019ve had a pretty crappy past 1.5 years in college mentally and I\u2019m a sophomore currently. I text my mom a lot of the day but she doesn\u2019t always text a lot back because she\u2019s working. We call every night before bed. I feel like it\u2019s too much based off of how much others call home but at the same time it\u2019s a habit and I love talking to my parents and we are very close. Just interested to hear what others have to say.",
