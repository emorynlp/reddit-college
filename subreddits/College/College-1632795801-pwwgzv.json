I haven\u2019t gone to college at all yet, but within the next couple weeks I\u2019m going to be applying to a few universities in the UK through the program Study Across the Pond. I want to study Zoology/Wildlife biology. My options are Roehampton, Aberystwyth, Chester, Derby, South Wales, and Swansea. Does anyone have any advice for me or have any experience with these schools or this program?", "author": "atomatoflames02", "created": 1632795801, "retrieved": 1632945509, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
