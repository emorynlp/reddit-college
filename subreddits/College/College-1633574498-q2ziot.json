  "text": "I\u2019m a 4th year in college and I feel like recently i have been feeling trapped in my major which is Studio Arts. I keep telling myself \u201ci\u2019m in too deep to change it\u201d, \u201cthis is my fourth year and i have finished the majority of classes i need to almost graduate.\u201d but just thinking about this degree and from all my peers saying \u201coh what are you going to do with it\u201d has been on my mind pretty frequently. currently i\u2019m thinking whether or not to finish the degree and graduate or stay in school for extra 2 years and switch to a biology degree",
