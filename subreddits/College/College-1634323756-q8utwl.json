  "text": "I decided to change majors during my sophomore year of college. I was a bio major hoping to go into med school, but I decided it was not my path, and I switched to statistics and data science. \n\n\nI chose that major because I like maths and I enjoyed basic statistics. I\u2019m taking upper-level classes, and although my grades are good, I find the lectures boring and have no idea what my professors are saying most of the time. The analysis and coding aspects are fun, but the lectures are boring.",

      "text": "I'm a grad student in statistics. I love the field, I love the theory behind it, and I love applying it. But I'm with you on lectures. It's one of those \"that's just the way things are\" type of things. I mostly zone out during lectures and read the book and learn everything in my own time, tbh. As long as you're capable of doing that, it's no big deal if you don't learn well from lectures. In real life, you'll have to teach yourself a lot of shit anyway, so it's good to get used to it early, lol.",
