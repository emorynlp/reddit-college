  "title:": "Considering Switching Majors and Transferring",
  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore biochemistry major. I initially wanted to pursue pharmaceuticals (specifically creating and dispensing drugs) or even going to pharmacy or medical school. I was content with being a biochemistry major freshman year because I saw there were many career paths I could pursue and the coarse load wasn't bad. However, now that the classes are more concentrated on actual biochemistry, I'm now really disliking the biology-aspect of the major and am missing the math and chemistry oriented content since it started to lean more on biology theory and life organisms, which I'm dreading. I also don't want to do any more extra schooling either (graduate school is my absolute limit).\n\nNow I'm considering switching to chemical engineering, as it applies more math and chemistry and I'm interested in manufacturing and chemical production (which I wanted to do with pharmaceuticals in the first place), and it provides many diverse job aspects I've been interested in (pharmaceuticals again, biomedical, cosmetics, food science, etc).\n\nNot only that, I'm also planning to transfer and go to a school close to home. Here's the issue. The school I'm applying to for the Spring doesn't have a chemical engineering program. I'm also considering applying to transfer for fall of my Junior year since other schools I'm interested in don't have spring transfer applications opened, but my mom has been pressuring me to come home for school as soon as possible (she's paying the bills after all).\n\nThis has been really stressing me out. I want to graduate on time, pursue a degree that I'm happy with, go to school closer to home, and try to comply to my mother's wishes.",

      "text": "I'm a freshman biochemistry major who had wanted to be a dentist. Long story short I figured out that wasn't what I wanted to be anymore so now I'm making the same choice you are. I am thinking of transfering to engineering as well but it would mean graduating in 5 years instead of 4 and the thought pains me. The only reason being that where I go to school engineering is a 4 year in program and the extra year of tuiton and not \"graduating on time\" stigma messes with me. I want to say just remember it's your life, you only get one shot at it. Don't make the easy choice and send yourself down a path you will be dissatisfied with later on. If you don't want to go to secondary school it may just be best to take the plunge if it means more satisfaction as a whole.",

          "text": "I\u2019m not sure how your whole situation is, but graduating in 5 years instead of 4 really isn\u2019t so bad. In fact, if you look it up, many college graduates don\u2019t graduate in 4 years, and some even take up to 6 years. It\u2019s very common for people to change their majors and have to take extra classes due to that. That \u201cstigma\u201d won\u2019t matter at all in the long run when you have a family and are working several years later. I\u2019m likely going to have to consider that route too and graduate later (hopefully 1 extra semester). Just as long as you know you\u2019ll be happier switching to another major than staying in the one making you dread, it\u2019ll be all worth it. That one extra year can completely affect how you\u2019ll live the rest of your life.",

      "text": "BS in biochemistry here, there is a lot more math and chemistry that goes into the degree plan and courses than you may think. \n\nTo begin all your classes will go into introductory biology because it\u2019s crucial that you understand these concepts before getting into higher level courses where work becomes more theoretical and research based.\n\nIf you are adamant about switching to chemical engineering I implore you to look into the course work required for this degree. It is an engineering degree after all, not necessarily a chemistry degree. You will not be heavily focused on chemistry (of course you will take basic intro to courses) but instead, the focus is on mathematics and physics. Don\u2019t rush into a decision and think it through so that you really understand what it is you\u2019re going into.\n\nHave you thought about just being a plain chemistry major?",

          "text": "I really don\u2019t mind the math and physics it\u2019ll take. I enjoy solving difficult problems and applying logical numeric thinking, the insane amount of memorization and theory for biochemistry was something I didn\u2019t expect and don\u2019t like as a whole (something I admit I should\u2019ve understood sooner).\n\nI did think of being a plain chemistry major, but again a major like that would need more schooling to even land a decent job, but even then the available jobs for chemistry isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for either. \n\nTo add on, I\u2019m starting to like the possible job prospects for chemE. There are many industries I could work in (food, cosmetics, drug, medical, even pharmaceuticals) and it\u2019ll focus more on the chemical processing and manufacturing of it, which is what I intended to do with biochemistry. I know that biochemistry can lead to engineering jobs too, but the list for it is very narrow. \n\nA very big reason why I\u2019m considering switching is that I just don\u2019t have the passion anymore. Life science is really not what I\u2019m interested in, but materials and chemicals are what I like. It sucks but like many other college students, I lost interest in my major and am finding more fulfillment in another one. At least I\u2019m glad that I figured this out my sophomore year and not later. \n\nAs a fellow BMB major, can you tell me what you like about the major and what you intend to do with it?",
