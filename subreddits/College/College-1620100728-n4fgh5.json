This semester I took ochem 1, calc 1, and physics 1, all of which are notoriously hard classes and they were all online because of covid and therefore low quality with high expectations. I\u2019ve managed to get all A\u2019s every semester of college up to this point but as you can imagine, this semester was extra hard. I was hanging on to a B in all three classes for basically the entire semester and fighting tooth and nail just to keep it that way. But I managed to get my physics grade up right before the end of the semester. And then I studied my ass off for the calc final and ended up doing really well on it, and our final exam grade would replace our lowest test grade (which for me was like a 58). Ochem was what really shocked me. All assignments graded put me at an 87. She did say she would curve our final grade but I didn\u2019t think it would do anything for me, but it brought me up to an A. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this happy in my life. All that blood, sweat, and tears I put into those classes actually paid off and I\u2019m gonna graduate top of my class!\n\nEdit: wow I did not expect this to blow up like this. Thank you so much for all the nice comments! I will say I\u2019m kind of a perfectionist and trying to get into med school so getting straight A\u2019s is probably more important to me than it really should be. Wouldn\u2019t recommend because I had a fuck ton of anxiety this whole semester and now I\u2019m in therapy lol. I\u2019m transferring to a four year university this fall to finish my bachelors and I definitely don\u2019t expect that I\u2019ll hold onto that 4.0 streak, but I\u2019m really happy to have achieved it for just one more semester, especially since I had given up on it a couple of weeks ago.", "author": "yuxngdogmom", "created": 1620100728, "retrieved": 1632947178, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1533, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gwzq9gf": {"link": "/r/college/comments/n4fgh5/just_got_my_final_grades_back_and_i_got_all_as/gwzq9gf/", "text": "Congrats my guy, I took those last semester and got As as well.
