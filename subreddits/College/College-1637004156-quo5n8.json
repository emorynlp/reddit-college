Plus they dont have any reason to be invested in your presentation, they\u2019re just busy fretting over their own presentations or zoning out on their laptops on another tab looking focused. As long as you dont set off any fire alarms, they most likely wont care nor remember. Sorry I couldn\u2019t give much solid advice, I hope the best for you",

I tell you this right now I get nervous and want to walk away every time before I step on stage. here are my tips that help me \n1. know the material it boost your confidence not having to read it on the spot or stumble through it.\n2. less words on visual aids they don't know what i am going to say so I cant mess up the words they don'tknow them.\n3. no one wants to see you fail so the crowd is already on your side so you have 80+ hoping you do good.\n4. if its a stage you won't be able to see pass the 3rd row.\n5. that moment is your time. you control the room say nothing its quite say something its and you are the only one talking. you control the time, spacing, and rhythm of the room. \n6. at the end if the day who the fuck are these people? they're nobodies, you family is still your family, friends are the same, dog still going to do the happy dance when you get home. so who cares what they think you lose nothing and can only gain. sorry about the spilling it's 3am and I am falling asleep.",
