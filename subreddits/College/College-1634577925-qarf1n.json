  "text": "So I just found out my school emails weren\u2019t showing up in my inbox and this teacher just said it\u2019s unacceptable that I wasn\u2019t replying ....I\u2019m this close to lashing out at her. So close. And I\u2019m trying to multitask and email a tutor to ask for help so my zoom pfp shows and.... she\u2019s resent annoying about it. I even asked people in the class in the message and she goes off at me like I\u2019m hogging the attention. Someone replied to me tho. Real simple.\n\nI\u2019m already getting red flags from her but the class is hella easy\n\nLike for gods sake one student asked to repeat question and she acts NO",

      "text": "You could withdraw and take it again next semester, hopefully with a different professor. But you\u2019ve already paid for the class so it really just boils down to whether or not your prof has a vendetta against you. If everything is multiple choice and not subjective, you should stay if it\u2019s super easy. If you have to write papers, it could cause trouble if she doesn\u2019t agree with you or becomes very nit-picky about things. Sorry that you\u2019re going through that bullshit.",

          "text": "Yeah it\u2019s the easier class that\u2019s essential ingredients: emotions regulation.\n\nTalks about how certain aspects of life stresses you and the effect on your mood. I just plan to pretend I\u2019m following her rules bc she see,s to like it when students follow her every rule. \n\nI really want to lash out at her and give her a stern lecture in front of the class but in holing it in. Barely, tho bc she goes off at me in front of the class.",
