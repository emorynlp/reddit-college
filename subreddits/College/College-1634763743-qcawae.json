  "text": "My professor recently told me I might fail his class due to attendance. I told him my lack of attendance was due to a family death, recovering from surgery, and a viral infection. My grade is low but not as low as he says because he hasn\u2019t graded everything even though I\u2019ve told him this. I\u2019m afraid that if I say outright \u201cyou have not graded this so you\u2019re wrong\u201d that he\u2019ll purposely grade it low. The low grade comes from a 3 point weekly reflections of the weeks I wasn\u2019t able to be there, a total of 2.5 weeks. I believe I can get my grade back up if nothing else comes up to disrupt my life but I think refusing to understand that a student has gone through a lot in 1.5 month span is quite annoying. My other professors have been understanding and willing to work with me, but not this one. I might take it to the dean if he refuses to grade my 20 points paper I turned in a month ago. \n\nI\u2019ll be completely honest I have a bias against this teacher. I do not like him whatsoever for a number of reasons. I\u2019m ready to keep up with the class for the sole purpose of giving him a scathing evaluation.",
