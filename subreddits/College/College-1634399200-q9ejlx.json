  "text": "Hi everyone, Im a sophomore in college and recently transferred. I attended my freshman year at a state school however due to covid it was all on zoom and I stayed home the whole year. I realized how much money I saved staying home and decided to transfer to a local private university who gave me enough scholarships that it cost the same amount as being on zoom at the state college.\n\nThis university is relatively small with only around 6500 students, and most of them are commuters like me. Because of this I feel like I kinda just go to school for a class and then go home every day. Because its a heavy commuter school most people do the same. However, I want to make friends and do stuff on campus etc, but I feel like being a transfer student is making it even harder on top of going to a commuter school. \n\nOf course I have \"friends\" in classes but Im not sure I want to hang out with them outside of school and I want to meet new people. Any suggestions? Im not even really sure about frats and clubs or even how to join them as a sophomore. \n\nNow that my first semester at this school is halfway over Im kinda upset that I still don't really have any friends. \n\nAny advice? Thanks!",
