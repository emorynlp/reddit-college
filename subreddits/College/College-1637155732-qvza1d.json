  "text": "I'm currently a senior in high school and I was wondering if I should double major in Social Work and Psychology. The career path that I am looking to follow is a Social Worker or a CPS worker. I spoke to my counselor and she said that it's really up to me but i genuinely don't know if it's worth it. I really just need some advice on whether or not i should do and if it's worth it. Thank you !!",
