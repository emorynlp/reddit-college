  "text": "I have been looking into computer science programs at lots of schools, and this school is still on my list, probably in the top 3, but I wanted to hear from others about this school. Is the campus decent? The food? Dorms? That sort of thing. Any advice would be appreciated. If you know of an affordable school (probably out-of-state tuition, unless it is in Iowa) with a good CS program please let me know, articles on the internet are often biased so I want to hear from actual people.",
