  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m here to share with you all and hopefully get some advice on what to do with my situation. I am currently in my junior year in college with a major in computer science and every since we\u2019ve had online classes, my work ethic just cease to exist. In my firs year, I was an excellent student. I used to do all my homework, never missed a class and used to study/learn outside the classroom. When COVID pandemic hit, I started to procrastinate a lot, like a whole lot. In my sophomore year, I was still a good student, did all my homework and tried to not miss to many classes and maintained my 3.8 GPA. Now, this year has been different, I haven\u2019t been in class since the classes started in august and I may fail one of them because when I wanted to catch up, it was too late to do it so I am 100% sure that I won\u2019t be able to pass it. I also feel like my coding skills are non existent. I feel like a failure, what should I do?",
