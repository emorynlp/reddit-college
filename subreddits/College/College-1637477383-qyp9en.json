  "text": "My school (in N.Y) is offering college courses that would provide us an associates in liberal arts. Credits will be from Mercy College and it will be taken junior and senior year. I was assured I wanted to take them but not I\u2019m rethinking it as\u2014\n\n1) I want a freshman experience I do not want to start as a junior in college. I feel like I won\u2019t be able to network and connect as well and be jumped into college with people older than me all around that I won\u2019t be able to reach out to.\n\n2) I\u2019m interested in Communications/Journalism and aiming for Syracuse, mFordham, Northwestern, N.Y.U, Columbia, a SUNY that specialized best in that. Private universities are less likely to accept dual enrollment from what I understand and I\u2019m aiming to go to a private university. \n\n3) My Principal said she\u2019s trying to get a more prestigious university to take college courses from and she\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019ll be on a college campus taught by actual professors. My school is in a small low-income neighborhood as well that tends to be disorganized so I\u2019m not getting the certainty I want from these potential college courses.\n\nAre these not valid reason or should I think more about my decision to leave?",

      "text": "Depending on the potential extra work load, I don\u2019t see the harm in still taking them just in case. I may not be understanding how the school systems work on the East Coast, but some of the classes could cover some GEs in college depending on the class and school. I wouldn\u2019t count them out if you haven\u2019t applied to any colleges yet since a lot can change in a year or so. Just my take",

She\u2019s still experiencing that \u201cfreshman experience\u201d because she\u2019s new to the college culture despite her degree. And she will still be attending four years of school because she has ADHD. The advantage is that since her gen ed classes are out of the way, she can take more courses tailored to her degree program.\n\nJust because you may not take certain classes if you enter college as a junior doesn\u2019t mean your experience will be that much different. Even if all credits are accepted, you can still stay in college for the traditional four years. It will give you the advantage of taking up more courses relevant to your degree. Or you could always double major with another you are interested in. \n\nDon\u2019t limit yourself just because you fear you\u2019ll lack certain experiences. As a freshman myself, I wish my school had a dual enrollment program. I just want to get my gen ed classes over with. The only classes I enjoy, calculus and programming, are the only one relevant to my degree.",

But keep in mind she graduated with an associate\u2019s from a performing arts high school.\n \nAnd when it comes to ADHD, everyone\u2019s experience will be different. All I can say is if you take medication, stay on top of it. My friend is currently struggling and behind with her classes because she has stopped taking her ADHD meds. \n\nApply for disability accommodations even if you don\u2019t need them. If you find yourself struggling with it during the semester, they\u2019re good to fall back on for assistance. And also don\u2019t be afraid to reach out to your professors and let them know what you\u2019re going through. Or request extended deadlines. My friend\u2019s professors were understanding enough to give her extended deadlines so she wouldn\u2019t fail.",
