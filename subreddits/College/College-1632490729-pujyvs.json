      "text": "I'm an introvert and I love my public speaking class. The key for me is to view the audience as impersonal. My introversion isn't so much social anxiety as awkwardness when meeting people / talking to strangers. \n\nLooking at the audience as a single entity, not a person, helps. Don't talk to them, talk to yourself as if you were across the room, and focus on your delivery instead of them, and instead of looking at them look between them at the desks and walls. Nobody will be able to tell you aren't actually looking at people, especially if you are moving and being animated, which is part of focusing on delivery.\n\nMy method for preparing is to think about the topic and what I want to say, then take a video of myself ad-libbing a speech. I use that video to write an outline, and shave off any rambling and stumbling. Write the outline in the same way you talk, and instead of writing a literal script, write a series of the points you want to make. Then keep taking videos of yourself speaking and the more you repeat the better you get, and as you go take note of when you say something in a way you like. \n\nIn effect you are simultaneously writing and memorizing your speech, and writing it in the way you naturally speak makes it a million times easier to remember it. Plus, the process of repetition helps you polish things and find new, better ways of getting your point across. By the end you'll have memorized all the important parts and how to effectively get them across, and that will make giving the speech a lot easier both in action and by easing your nerves because you're prepared.\n\nSometime soon I'll be uploading a video where I use this process to write and give a speech for my class and if you want I'll send you the link.",

For example, our last one we had to do was a commemorative speech and since I love basketball I did one for Kobe. I get extremely nervous before presentations and stuff, but once you start talking it gets easier in the middle. The time had to be around 5 minutes and I kid you not my time was 8:24 (both of Kobe\u2019s jersey numbers).",
