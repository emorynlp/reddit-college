  "text": "I am desperate to become a better exam taker. I know the content, it's not a matter of simply studying more hours. I just came out of an exam and the more I think about it, the more I realize I made dumb mistakes. At one point I read a question wrong, at one point I got two definitions (that are poorly named imo) backwards. It's incredibly frustrating because I'm getting Bs in classes I know I'm capable of getting As in. I will take any advice, videos, books, tips, really anything would be super helpful.",

Then I start answering only the questions I know first. This gives me confidence and helps me remember info I thought I didn\u2019t know. Hope this helps!",
