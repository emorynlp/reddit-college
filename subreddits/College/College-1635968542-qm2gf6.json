      "text": "It\u2019s just like going to the gym. You can\u2019t rely on motivation to get through every workout because you won\u2019t always be motivated. Just like you\u2019re disciplined to go to the gym, you must be this way towards class. You just push yourself and go.\n\nAlso, do you have a history of depression? Depending on where you live, winter is approaching which means more people are starting to experience seasonable depression.",
