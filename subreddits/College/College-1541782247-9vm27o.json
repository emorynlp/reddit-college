  "title:": "My Grades Do Not Reflect My Effort or Confidence",
  "text": "Midterms absolutely rocked me. I was an A+ student in high school. I was going strong with all my projects, homework, lab reports, etc. I studied hours every day. I went into my midterms with complete confidence. But two of my midterms were shockingly below average. A 71% in Calculus and a 64% in Chem. It's not an unfixable situation, but I don't know what I did wrong. Walking into and out of the exam room, I felt completely confident in getting an A. I had studied a week in advance for both tests. I went into office hours frequently. I pay attention during lecture. I do the homework. I don't understand what I did wrong?\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle solution. I just want tips from people who may have been in the same situation.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who gave helpful comments (which is just about everyone). I'm writing down everything you guys are telling me and preparing for my Chem midterm next week.\n\nEdit #2: I took another Chem Midterm and got a 90. I took a lot of the advice on here to heart. I prepared a week in advance, so I had questions for my recitation teacher. Then as it got closer I began a study group where I taught other students in my dorm who were also really struggling. The last step was just hard studying. Thank you to everyone who helped and for the people of the future, keep at it.",

At my school, the general engineering classes were used to purposely weed people out. For starters you already have to take 17+ Credit hours. So imagine having a bunch of useless classes that have nothing to do with your major all packed in 1? It can get rather messey. \n\nAnd chemistry is one of those courses. I took Chemistry with a guy who was UCLA and made his tests insane. As if anyone was actually going to use his class later on. So don't think it's you, it's most likely your lazy research professor or your general schools objective to cut the fat. \n",

Your first semesters in college are great for learning what techniques help you best to study.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat works best for me (and seems to be pretty effective across the board) is making cheat-sheets from my notes and studying. A cheat sheet, for me, wants to be concise and to the point, and I make a habit of NEVER copying my exact notes straight onto a cheat sheet but rather arranging the notes/rewriting them in my own words. \n\nAs I am preparing for an exam in a subject, I gather up all my cheat sheets and make a sheet just for the exam, typically even more condensed than the individual sheets are. Then I run problems (over and over and over and over again) until I'm confident. Right before the exam, I pull this sheet out and try to be sure that I've looked at formulas I need to memorize and the like.\n\nHelps to run one or two problems a day. If you've got a test coming up on 7 math sections, for instance, try to do at least one problem from each section every day in the week leading up to the test. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA note: Don't skip a whole section because you feel confident about how to do it. At least look at one or two problems and run them through. Sometimes, you remember the concept well enough that you feel confident but then when it comes to running through the actual problem, you forget something about set up or such. ",

Active listening and reading vs. passive, for example. Not just reviewing notes before an exam, but engaging notes as part of a study routine. Not just writing down a few words the prof puts on the board, but using something like Cornell notes to ensure you are thinking about them during and after class, and again in review.

They never want to admit that they curve because they don't want people to slack off or conspire to do poorly or etc. \n\nOnce you start getting into advanced classes things like really low class averages and the highest score on the exam being < 70% are probably going to become more common. If you want to stay sane you have to look at the bigger picture. That's why professors will usually share grade distributions and the class average. Lots of times how well you are doing in comparison to the class is more important than the number of points you got on the test ",

They go into college overly confident and not really understanding the difference in the way the classes operate and do poorly.\n\nMy tip for studying for any math course is start by going through your notes and listing out every piece of important information onto a separate piece of paper. Obviously, you're only going to be able to do this if you took good notes, so do that. After you've created this formula sheet, start doing practice/homework problems until you feel like you really understand how to do the problems. Then start doing them without the practice sheet. Rinse and repeat until you can do any of those problems without looking at the sheet.\n\n",

University tends to attract the best and the brightest, so a 70% (especially in an upper-year course) might be more of an accomplishment than you think. Also, if you need a high GPA for grad school, be prepared to take occasional bird courses or strategically drop the ones you know will go poorly. Finally, profs can have *wildly* varying expectations between courses: I've gotten 80s by coasting through some classes, and low 70s fighting tooth-and-nail in others.

You'll use the concepts from those courses throughout college and in your career.\n\n2. Those courses, like many seemingly \"simple\" or \"foundational\" courses you'll take, are intended to weed out students who aren't prepared for the rest of their academic careers.\n\n3. Those courses are supposed to teach you how to think. Yes, you can perfunctorily find a derivative without looking it up, and you can recite the second fundamental theorem of calculus from memory. But that doesn't mean you can *apply* what you know to solve problems. Your instructors are looking for you to prove that you can think critically about a problem, approach it using a method that will most likely lead to a solution, and only once you've done the hard work will they look for your answer. The same applies to your chemistry class, and just about every class you'll take in the next several years.\n\nPoint #3 is the least obvious, and it's the one I think most often leads good students to failure.\n\nWhen you take mass and energy balances, you'll use the concepts you know from calc and chem, but you'll also be required to think critically about problems and show you can approach them in the right way. You can't just ad-hoc together \"well, flowrate is in units of liters per second, and I can find the volume of the pipe to cancel the liters and end up with seconds to find out how long it takes the reaction to proceed\" because first, you'll get the answer wrong, and second, you aren't approaching the problem the right way.\n\n**Finding the right answer isn't just about getting the math and physics and chemistry right. It's about showing how you know you're using the right math and physics and chemistry.**\n\nBefore you start solving a problem, write down what you know and what you're assuming. Is the function continuous and differentiable? How do you know? Is acetic acid strong or weak? How do you know? Is the system a Carnot cycle or a Rankine cycle? How do you know? Are you using the Langmuir isotherm or the Freundlich isotherm? *Why?* In the catalytic reactor you're operating, how long is the reaction mixture in contact with the catalyst, what does the flow profile look like, how does temperature change how the reaction proceeds, and how the hell can you take the area under a curve of arbitrary units and figure out what the conversion was? These are the kinds of questions that won't necessarily be explicitly asked on exams and paper prompts and lab reports, but you'll have to answer them anyway.\n\nIf you want to get good grades in engineering school, show the grader you're thinking like an engineer.",
