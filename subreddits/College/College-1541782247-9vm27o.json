I was an A+ student in high school. I was going strong with all my projects, homework, lab reports, etc. I studied hours every day. I went into my midterms with complete confidence. But two of my midterms were shockingly below average. A 71% in Calculus and a 64% in Chem. It's not an unfixable situation, but I don't know what I did wrong. Walking into and out of the exam room, I felt completely confident in getting an A. I had studied a week in advance for both tests. I went into office hours frequently. I pay attention during lecture. I do the homework. I don't understand what I did wrong?\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle solution. I just want tips from people who may have been in the same situation.\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who gave helpful comments (which is just about everyone). I'm writing down everything you guys are telling me and preparing for my Chem midterm next week.\n\nEdit #2: I took another Chem Midterm and got a 90. I took a lot of the advice on here to heart. I prepared a week in advance, so I had questions for my recitation teacher. Then as it got closer I began a study group where I taught other students in my dorm who were also really struggling. The last step was just hard studying.

Previously I had thought myself as a great student like you. If I'm gonna offer advice I would say set up some study groups with classmates in addition to your normal study schedule. If your convinced that you did better than your grade reflects you can go and discuss the test with your professor. I gurantee they will show you what errors you made or gladly fix your grade if they messed up.\n\nBest of luck in your college career!", "author": "Galizar", "created": 1541783380, "upvotes": 3}, "e9d9yu3": {"link": "/r/college/comments/9vm27o/my_grades_do_not_reflect_my_effort_or_confidence/e9d9yu3/", "text": "Are you a freshman? Biggest thing that I noticed transitioning into college was you had to actually know the material front and back to get an A in the class. Good grades in high school reflect more of a \u201cI take school seriously\u201d type of attitude rather than actually understanding the material they are teaching you.\n\nAll you really have to do it forget about it and move on.", "author": "itsPebbs", "created": 1541783304, "upvotes": 366}}}
