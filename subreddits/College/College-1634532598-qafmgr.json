  "text": "I don't enjoy college I have multiple disorders including autism and depression and history of homelessness and addictive tendencies I have teachers that grade if you miss below 7/10 everything is self taught in the classes because I'm online and I have trouble reading and memorizing everything \n\nI hate it and I hate my life because of it, here in pa college is expensive more than any other state for a state that can fire you at will without any unions, and you fail teachers act like you paid for a service and then didn't appreciate or utilize it enough so you have to pay again \n\nIn reality it's a game of memory and rigged questions where you have to cite book by book with no creative freedom for intellectual ideals that can at least engage you more and show you understand the core premises yo be able to do your future career\n\nYou can't make it without a degree financially in this stage of failing capitalism, I see teachers in my classes all the time going on break and you're supposed to worship them like they're a hero when in reality a lot of them don't give a fuck if you're on the brink of suicide because of their rigid ways either pay them more so you're not a McDonald's worker or fucking kill yourself\n\nSchool makes me want to die and when I do I hope the capitalist pigs and Karen teachers who rig the system at least get sent a message",

      "text": "Honestly, take care of yourself first. Put yourself first and then maybe come back to college after everything is all set. The one issue is you must have a backup plan, there are plenty other routes besides college or shit, go down to part time college for the time being, cut yourself some slack. Life isn\u2019t a game to rush, experience other things, especially the things that make you happy.",
