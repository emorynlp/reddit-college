I was online freshman year for context now in person. In high school I had a decent friend group with about 7 of us that I had known since elementary school. Rn in college I can confidently say that I have like maybe 3 friends but scattered in classes that I don\u2019t hang out with after. I\u2019m also friends with my suite mates ig but I have no friend group. Most ppl made friends fall of freshman year and pretty much stuck to those groups and because of that I\u2019m having a very hard time making friends. I\u2019m not even antisocial rlly like I talk to lot of ppl in class and stuff. At this point I\u2019m prolly just gonna give up and just do school. I\u2019ve tried joining clubs and stuff and again like ppl r already friends with ppl they met last year. Classes are kicking my ass this year I\u2019m studying to be an actuary and I\u2019m basically in all math classes and it\u2019s stressing me the fuck out. I don\u2019t even like what I\u2019m studying honestly I\u2019m just doing it for the money cuz I have no interest in learning or school and I don\u2019t want to major in some liberal art field where i have to get a further education to find a job since I\u2019m not even passionate about anything education wise. I\u2019m Lowkey depressed too like ever since the pandemic started I\u2019ve not been myself. I usually cry myself to sleep when my roommates aren\u2019t here. I want to definitely just wanna  get the fuck out of college and start working and make money. Does it even get better like all the posts ppl made totally hyped college for me and I kind of just realized that\u2019s only the case if ur a basic white girl or some frat guy.

The comment telling you to take a year or two off was a good one. You're not ruining your prospects by doing that. Both of my parents make good money at about the same amount, and one has an MBA while another barely graduated high school. College doesn't automatically give you a good paying job, just like not going to college doesn't automatically make you a broke loser. Take a semester off, find a job you like, see what happens. Maybe switch your major if you want to stay in college. You're young, you've got plenty of time.\n\nEDIT: it's my dad who doesn't have a college degree, and while it took him a bit longer to get where he is, he's now an associate director of a large tech company.

It's perfectly fine to not have too many friends. Too many kids in college are way too concerned about hanging out and partying every night and they're the same ones begging their professors for extensions on assignments or for extra credit near the end of the semester. A lot of these friend groups will go their separate ways after college too.
