          "text": "To be fair it\u2019s because learning a language requires more than just learning it in a classroom setting.\n\nPeople are more likely to master a language when they teach themselves because they immerse themselves in their studies and constantly integrate that language into their day to day life. \n\nYou need to do more than just memorize key terms. You have to constantly be practicing by writing, listening, and speaking. And the language you are trying to learn needs to be incorporated in to your day to day life (like watching a tv show in that language). \n\nMost students just never put enough effort into actually enthralling themselves into the language they\u2019re learning, which is why their comprehension remains limited to elementary terms.",

      "text": "Actually this is how you learn a language. You have to build vocabulary at the beginning and memorise as many words as you can. Of course you have to do much more than just that but at the beginning you have to learn a lot of new words to be able to build even the most simple sentences. After learning them you can start to understand the language and build sentences, but you never really stop learning new words",

I speak six languages ( only 3 fluently but I\u2019m working on the others) and I hate learning the vocab but without that you can not learn a language.
