  "title:": "Incurable burnout is hitting hard from this semester",
  "text": "I don't know if any other colleges have done this but my particular college got rid of all breaks, and just extended Thanksgiving break. My semester pretty much consisted of never-ending content all the way to Thanksgiving, get a week off, then 1 week of content, 1 week of review, 1 week of finals. Since Thanksgiving my semester came to a screeching halt as far as content, I literally have school 1 day a week. \n\nThis in mind, I still have 0 motivation at this point. I have 1 week left and while I have been studying some, the \"finals nerves\" that I normally have are just not there, it doesn't even feel like anything is coming to an end. None of this really feels real, I just know after months of papers, exams, clinicals, group projects, one thing after another after another with no break, I just want to forget college exists.",

Didn\u2019t take a break off until Fall 2020 because with COVID I definitely couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I did the summer semester though so hopefully that balances out. If you can, see if you can take the spring semester off. If not, what I do is give myself rewards for getting things done. Like a piece of candy, a funny video, etc. And once you\u2019re done with finals please treat yourself! If you do have some kind of break after finals, think about what you can look forward to. But at this point, maybe emails profs, and try your best. Burnout is super common but is definitely a bigger problem because of COVID.",

          "text": "The thing that sucks about American schooling is that it\u2019s only about the money, and we see that now more than ever. When we get to high school college starts getting pushed on us because you need degrees for certain careers, and so you pick a college, and it\u2019s super expensive. Normally it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, because in-person you\u2019d get your money\u2019s worth. But online it\u2019s a whole different story. You\u2019re still paying full tuition (mine was almost 20k) to sit on your computer while professors who weren\u2019t trained for online courses try to teach. No office hours, your peers don\u2019t feel like talking to you, you\u2019re on your own. Then, for some reason, they took away our Fall and Spring break and tried to cram 16 weeks of material into maybe 12, without reducing the workload. You\u2019ve probably noticed that a lot of college age people in America have mental health issues, and usually colleges offer free therapy, but that was taken away when the campus therapists stopped answering their emails. So, you couple the pre-existing issues with the pressure to get all your work done in 12 weeks, AND make good grades, all while stuck in your house, and it wears on you. That\u2019s why a lot of people have been dropping out. The material itself isn\u2019t hard, it\u2019s the way in which you\u2019re being taught, and the way classes are set up and stuff like that. I ended up dropping out this semester to work on my mental health. I plan on going back when they fix how they operate, I don\u2019t have 20k to spare every year. I hope that helps a little bit in understanding - and I hope school\u2019s going well for you!",

I don't believe in comparing schools because 1. I don't go to your school, you don't go to mine, no way we actually know what it is like in the other person's shoes, and 2., if I take 18 hours in classes and have no job, that will be easier most of the time than someone taking 15 hours and working 40 hours a week to support themselves. \n\nMy whole point was basically this: It is hard to stay motivated when I don't even feel like I am in college when all my classes are online, and with less time to do the same work, and no breaks, it only adds to the burnout, and frankly, it fucking sucks.",

But Thanksgiving was always a big deal to me being an American. And we only had like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday off for Thanksgiving which was like three days and then boom, we had our last week of classes and finals now. Some professors also gave me such a short time or notice to finish homework and would email out the homework so late, not even give us feedback on it, and won't even grade the homeworks on time, so I don't know how I did in the class or if I did something right or wrong before the final test. \n\nI feel like my family and friends who aren't in my school are so quick to assume that college with covid isn't difficult since I go to a state school as opposed to a top tier or an Ivy League, but it is pretty difficult. This pandemic also goes to show that the $240,000 price tag for a college degree for four years in some prestigious private institution is NOT worth the money, especially when we're remote & at home for almost a third semester next year.",

I had a few days in between each session (2 sessions per semester).\n\nSomehow I didn't start burning out until Fall Session A. I hated myself/school throughout this semester; I had to force myself to read/watch the lectures, do the homework, study for the tests, attend the Zoom meetings, write the discussion posts...I ended up doing all-nighters every week this semester, for essays/projects. \n\nThe day after I finished my finals, I was so exhausted that I kinda zoned out the whole day. I had been going almost nonstop from mid-January to December 4th.\n\nNext year I'm taking either Summer or Fall off, or reducing my course load in those two semesters by half.",

Maybe you're not ready for a full load yet. Instead of quitting all together which I mistakenly did after high school, I should have reduced my classes to 1. That would have been better than not going to school at all. Then when you feel ready and motivated you can increase it to 2, 3, etc.\n\nWhat's driving you to go to school right now? Do you have a long-term goal? I would start thinking about that. That really helps. If you're not internally motivated like myself, I would think about all the things you want to buy that you maybe can't afford right now. Maybe you want your own house, a better car, a better computer, etc. Look up jobs in the field you want to get into and how much it pays, all that stuff. Get excited.\n\nI would consider online classes as an option too. I know some people prefer going in person, but I think online is miles better. Homework/quizzes/tests are generally due at the end of the week, most classes I've taken online don't require zoom (just discussion posts), and it's really at your own pace. It's great. You can do homework in your underwear. Not sure about others but I just kind of want to get school over with and don't care to chat with my teachers or students in person, or take a test in person. It's so much better online.\n\nWhat you're feeling is normal though and sounds like you don't know what you want or maybe you're depressed from overwork. Do you have anything you really enjoy outside of school? I've been really into a game which I tell myself I can play after I finish all my hw. It makes playing it feel more rewarding.",

It's very hard to motivate yourself when there's some asshole professors cramming new content two days before a final (without me even knowing that beforehand).

I literally have been piggybacking, chegging, and googling (do not do this is bad, never on anything closed notes) to get through the term because I've been so burnt out since week 4 I couldn't make myself go to class.\n\nI've been thinking about it a lot. I find that the part that is missing for the is the *social reinforcement.* Many times last year I would be talking to people in my majors, bouncing ideas and subjects off them in casual conversation between classes to the point where everything makes sense. If I wasn't getting something, I could ask them to hang out and we'd go over their notes. It's much harder to do that with everything being online because instead of being in a learning environment where people gravitate to community learning, you have you actively break out and seek other people who want to zoom call on a particular subject. Learning online is black and white, you're either plugged into learning, or your focused on other life stuff. Go to class, fuck around at home for a bit, do homework, relax at home. There is no go to the library and hangout, it's only grinding alone and it fucking sucks.\n\n(2nd year engineering)",

My experience this semester is that I am taking harder classes, while studying an entire semester for a certification test that has a pass rate of 72%, I am the president of an honors society that requires lots of attention and meetings, I am also apart of the nationals swim team at my college this semester, yet my grades this semester are a multitudes better than last semester and the penultimate semester\n\nWhat is so challenging about this for most college students? I see so many people saying they are failing classes because it is so hard. In my experiences, you have to actually try to fail a class. That\u2019s not meant to be condescending or anything. That is a legitimate questions and I would love to hear your take on it",

Maybe I'm not the smartest, but I'd consider engineering to be a fast paced major, and with having to do all the in person exams before thanksgiving, the pace became unbearable. \n\n\nLimited hours everywhere. Tough shit if you want to study at the college library at 9:30 pm. Apparently covid comes out at night.  Tough shit if your entire neighborhoods internet is trash too. \n\n\n\nNot having to be accountable for being in a classroom. Not having the social pressure to keep you from browsing the internet or goofing off. Much more difficult to make friends and connections. I mean sure, I still saw them but it wasn't the same \n\nMy orchestra went from one big ensemble to three ones, that only meant once a week physically distanced.  Morale went down. \n\n\n\nReally the worst for me was being almost chained to a desk for hours, and being unable to walk to and from class and interact in the real world. I was already bored with pretty much any lecture except math, and without the stimulus of being in person, it was almost game over for me. I walked around and did pushups of course, but it wasn't the same. \n\n\nAlso when I was on campus the administration had the bonehead idea of laying off a lot of the food service workers for some reason, even though there was record freshman attendance.  So the lines were long like the soviet union, and everyone looked miserable, blanked stares and feet shuffling six feet apart. Food sucked too because it was a bare bones kitchen crew. \n\n\n\nIn short, what made this semester especially difficult, at least for me, was the unfortunate side effects of bureaucratic attempts and policies to hopefully mitigate the virus. \n\n\n\nI do agree that employeers shouldn't care, as their priority is to find someone who can do the job first and foremost.",

You know, with my certification exam there are 32 units of study, 64 tests, 32 exam, 8 mock exams, 1 practice exam, 1 final, and 1836 practice questions. The exam only has a 72% pass rate, despite only needing a 70% to pass. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s stressful? That\u2019s on top of the 16 credits I am taking, the club I run and all the events and meetings that come with it, my social/dating life, and being apart of college sports.
