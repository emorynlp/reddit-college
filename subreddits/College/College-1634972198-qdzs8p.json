  "text": "So as the title says, I\u2019m struggling with this. I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve been in school for two months. I\u2019m trying to conquer my shyness, but it seems like I don\u2019t really fit in well (I\u2019ve never really fit in well throughout middle and high school). I met a bunch of people during orientation week, but other than one person I didn\u2019t really reach out (and neither did they). One person I felt like I connected to and I have their number\u2014so should I reach out to them? I really wanted to get to know them, but we didn\u2019t have time to really sit down and talk. It also seems that going to club meetings is hard bc I\u2019m a commuter and when I do go, I feel out of place\n:( Also, does anyone have general tips for someone who\u2019s kinda shy and quiet? (Note: I\u2019m not into parties or stuff like that). Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "i think you should for sure reach out to that on person i am sure they would really appreciate it and would love to hear from u :) don\u2019t be hard on yourself, not everyone meets their best friends in the first year of college honestly not even their sophomore year so you just gotta give it time but i promise you it\u2019ll eventually happen wether it\u2019s from classes, people that live in the same building as you, clubs, work, or even going to the library. i know it can be hard reaching out to people or trying to socialize but i promise you there are thousands of other people in the same boat as you so there\u2019s no harm in talking to random ppl bc you never know if that\u2019ll be your best friend !!",
