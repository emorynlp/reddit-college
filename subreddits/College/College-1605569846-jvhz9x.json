Even after emailing the department chair, I got absolutely no response. I keep receiving the emails from that class, and looks like that the professor have not decided to report the cheaters.\n\nI emailed the Dean, and he got back to me asking for the necessary info. I sent him everything I had. Let\u2019s see how it will go now.",

So at least don't give out all the info you got from now on. Just give them something so they realize you got some good stuff,  more importantly, they'll look into it as long as they know you got more to this.",

I didn\u2019t press that issue earlier because I had been overwhelmed with the internship hunt and the coursework. In that email, he just addressed the typical college related policies and news. I skimmed through the email and saw the last paragraph that addressed academic misconduct. Reading that made all the negative emotions resurface, and I thought \u201cF**k it, I am emailing the Dean\u201d.\n\nEdit: what made me angry was that all those cheaters didn\u2019t not get punished. They are going  to make up for their cheating with in-person oral exams. Really? That\u2019s what the professor decided to do? If they have cheated once, they will cheat twice. They are going to keep cheating their way to graduation, and then they will compete with me with their inflated GPAs? While I was busting my ass to get good grades?",

This is very time-consuming and laborious for your professor, so you can rest assured s/he is taking it seriously. What is frustrating for you\u2014 that the cheaters will get away with it\u2014 is equally frustrating for your professor. I speak from recent personal experience. However, your professor wants to make sure the cases are airtight. Worst case scenario is to have them challenged in conduct court and for the professor to lose. By this point the professor would probably have invested 40+ hours in this cheating incident alone, over and above the usual class prep/grading/cheating mitigation.",

Why did I waste 2 days to prepare for one of his tests, while instead I could have been preparing for the interviews? Why are those students allowed to get away with cheating? They just got caught, and that\u2019s why they are doing the oral exams. It\u2019s highly possible that they will cheat again. What pissed me off was that one of the possible cheaters asked the professor to make the students, that had spread the rumors about cheating, also \u201cpay the price\u201d and do the oral exams with them for wasting their time. How audacious do you have to be to pull off stuff like that?",
