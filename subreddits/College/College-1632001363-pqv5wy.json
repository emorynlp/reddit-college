I'm already failing all of my classes due to the insane workload and difficulty of assignments, I've met a handful of people but I'd argue to say they have made the situation even worse by showing me I might not actually meet anybody I have stuff in common with and or would actually want to hang out / be friends with. On top of all of that I am EXTREMELY bored. And I'm not even staying in my room all day. All college has taught me so far was that I'm going to fail in every single aspect of college including academics and socializing. My parents are going to kill me once they find out that I want to drop out, and even I don't want to drop out because it means I am destined for a mediocre life and awful job choices, but there is no way I force myself to suffer for 4+ years only to probably fail all of my classes along the way.\n\nWhere do I even go to drop out? Who do I contact? Will I get any sort of refund?", "author": "Throwawaysecrets24", "created": 1632001363, "retrieved": 1632801519, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hdeupwt": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqv5wy/how_should_i_go_about_dropping_out/hdeupwt/", "text": "I think you should talk with your academic advisor and sometimes getting a mentor can help you.

Will a college degree help you reach those goals? If not, then dropping out might make your life better, as long as you devote yourself to achieving those goals. \n\nIf you do need a degree, then consider this: college is vastly different from high school, and everyone who enters college gets hit by that realization pretty hard. The workload is supposed to be hard and demanding. This is higher education, and you are an adult now. You need to except this fact. But don\u2019t worry, many people struggle in their first year because they are learning how to navigate the college landscape. My advice is: don\u2019t give up, seek out tutoring, put yourself out there if you want to make friends, and don\u2019t take classes that aren\u2019t required for your degree/you get no enjoyment out of.", "author": "JupiterRocket", "created": 1632004542, "upvotes": 2}, "hdduh37": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pqv5wy/how_should_i_go_about_dropping_out/hdduh37/", "text": "Have you thought about dropping some classes?Or living off campus instead of in dorms?
