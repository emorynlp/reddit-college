  "title:": "Accused of academic misconduct that I never did and I feel like I am losing the case here",
  "text": "I am a postgraduate student here. Apparently, I got accused of academic misconduct for coding (Collusion). The project is an individual assignment. The accusation is that I copied/shared my code with one of the undergraduate students which are from another course which I never did.\n\nThe lecturer told me to provide evidence to defend myself. So the first point I gave him is that he encourages us to use external resources on the internet and use his lecture to help with the coding and of course I have provided all the references that are not my own work when I submitted my work and gave it to him. Secondly, I have explained all my working steps for the code and how I reach my conclusion. The third point is that I have never posted my code anywhere on the internet or GitHub to be viewed or used or exchanged my work with anyone. The fourth point is that I have never discussed my work with my postgraduate friend let alone that I have never discuss it with undergraduate students. I know no one from the undergraduate course (even postgraduate course) and never have the opportunity to be in contact with them since I am working on my project alone from another country (Thailand and the Uni is in the UK). Therefore my main evidence or my defend is that I never worked or even talked to the person or anyone else about the project nad I know no one FROM undergraduate course.\n\nAfter I sent my defend to my lecturer, he said that he think there is not enough evidence and still think there are academic misconduct and have forward it to AM panel. URGHHH!! In the email, he said to find direct references for the similarity code and provide more evidence BUT I GAVE ALL MY EVIDENCE AND CANT GIVE MORE. and I was thinking if I provide the references that I never used in my code then I am committing poor academic misconduct that I never commit (poor academic misconduct = no references).\n\nSo at is point I don't know what to do.. should I provide the reference for the AM panel or not? should I stick to it since I am being honest with everything and I don't know what to do next and very stress about it since I have never copied or shared my work with anyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n EDIT1: just did my academic panel meeting today. From my perspective - I feel like I didn't do that well and didn't explain that good about my working out because one of the panels was looking confused and having a wtf face when I tried to explain my working/method of doing the work and giving the online resources. \n\nFrom the SU perspective - she said that I look confident when speaking about my method of doing the work and showing evidence, she said got nothing to worried about, everything is looking good. \n\nTomorrow the panel will email the result. hoping for the best.

It might be better to have someone there to say \"wait a minute there is a lot of false positives with plagiarism checkers\", or \"there is a lot of very similar structures in programming\". It obviously depends on how you conduct yourself in front of the people that you talk to, but pissing someone off here should not be your worry; because, to the dean or the head of the school or department this is just business; talking to them is (or atleast was) something encouraged if you were having problems with a teacher or class when I was in college.",

      "text": "I have been on both sides of  this situation as both a student and teacher. I have been falsely accused, made incorrect accusations, and had students correctly charged with academic misconduct. This is my advice assuming you committed no misconduct.\n\n1. Present a positive attitude through the whole thing. Do not get defensive or accusational, it will upset people. You need faculty to see you in a positive light for them yo act in your favor. Faculty are not \"wrong\" and you are not \"right.\" Faculty \"may be mistaken\" and you \"did your best to follow the provided instructions.\" See? If your professor wants to escalate things do not fight him, just say you're sorry he sees things that way and you'll have to prepare your information for review.\n\n2. Get all your documentation together. All notes you made, all communication with faculty, syllabus and assignment rubric, etc. Have it all available to present your case. Only offer documentation when it is requested, dont drop 60 pages of material they don't want to read. If it is relevant it will be requested.\n\n3. Be completely honest and do not lie, people will be able to tell. Even if it is something that will get you in trouble, the lie is worse. Present things as they happened, do not exaggerate. Do not talk about things you heard from other people, only your experiences.\n\n4. Dont act like this professor and this panel are the final say in things, they are not.  If things do not turn out in your favor, do not throw a fit. Say you're sorry they came to that decision and start looking into the academic misconduct appeals process, your institution must make this public. You can either escalate the situation or do what I did and accept the 1 year of probation and after completing it charge the department with misconduct.",

I think your other points are super important, especially #4.\n\nIt just seems like they've left OP in the dark about what evidence would be sufficient in their eyes to prove their innocence. I would recommend to OP to reach out to an academic advisor or a department head about the situation seeking guidance, especially citing what information they have already shared regarding their innocence in the situation.",

              "text": "Eh, I disagree to an extent. I went to a private school, and while there are specific references to the school \u201cowning you\u201d in the handbook, they generally will listen. Maybe I was just lucky, and at a smaller school in my case:\n\nI was accused of \u201cdisrupting the peace\u201d and misconduct after a third-party account of a disagreement between my friend and I. At first, I printed out the entire student handbook and made a case as to how I didn\u2019t violate these rules. I went into my hearing with the Dean ready to fight and plead my case.\n\nBut when I got in there, it hit different. Instead of coming out with \u201cI didn\u2019t break your silly rules,\u201d I took the approach that it was a big misunderstanding. That sure, there was a disagreement, and it got heated. But I insisted that the third party account was not correct and that if given the chance, my intentions were to mend the friendship and change my habits.\n\nInstead of the typical punishment - a minimum of one semester suspension - I got put on disciplinary probation for the remainder of the semester (which was fortunately cut short due to Covid). I think that coming out ahead of things and admitting your shortcomings while committing to doing better is what they\u2019re looking for. To quote a professor in a different circumstance, \u201cnobody wants to give you a zero.\u201d Nobody wants to kick you out, punish you, etc. it\u2019s a school, and they want you to learn.\n\nSorry if I rambled, it kinda became a stream of consciousness as I kept writing. I hope it\u2019s helpful, if anything to say that you have a chance in this, just cooperate but stand up for your side of things",
