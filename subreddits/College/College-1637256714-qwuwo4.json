  "text": "I am in the process of trying to find some internships for this Summer, and have a few different avenues I am looking into with some exciting opportunities. However, I am beginning to realize that not all opportunities are created equal, but that it can be hard to tell in the beginning. I'm studying business, so I know that internships can play a huge role in future job offers/grad school applications. So... what is your advice for deciding which internship to accept? What do you look for? What are some red flags?",

      "text": "If I were looking, I would be focused on a couple things.\n\n1. Company influence and post-intern hiring policy. The bigger/more influential the company is, the better your networking opportunities are likely to be. There are exceptions, but working with more people means more connections to make. Do they have a track record of hiring interns after school or give them some benefit in the process?\n\n2.  Will I be learning anything actively useful and not just getting coffee and making copies? If they knock number 1 out of the park this is less important IMO. If it's not clear, then at least I can take away some relevant experience if nothing else.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't care about pay, but that will depend on your situation. Some people say that's a deal breaker, but it really depends. If it means the likelihood I get a job I want after school is significantly better, that is worth taking a small hit now.",

      "text": "First, apply to everything you find. \n\nSecond, ask good questions during the interview. \n\nI would always ask about future opportunities, do they allow you to work into the academic year? Ask what an interns day might look like and what tasks you\u2019ll perform. Ask the interviewer what they love about the job or company. \n\nI had an interview with a company last year and they literally only told me things that I wouldn\u2019t be doing because of the pandemic: \u2018Oh our interns normally get to work on our annual festival event! \u2026wait but you won\u2019t be able to this year.\u2019 The list kept going on and on and it didn\u2019t seem worth it at all. I asked about future opportunities, none. All the people I met were relatively old as well, and that\u2019s not always a bad thing but you could tell they were apprehensive to new ideas. Definitely a red flag in my book.\n\nEnded up finding a company where everyone was so happy to work. They were all really friendly and interesting to talk with. They offered future opportunities, including being hired on after graduation. An interns day was no different from a full time associate, with the exception of being overseen by more people. Pay was amazing, and interns got benefits! I discovered most of this without even needing to ask questions because they were very excited to share all the great things the internship offered. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s pretty easy to tell if its a dead end, not so great internship during the interview process alone.",
