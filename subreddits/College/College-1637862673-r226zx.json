          "text": "I live in a super diverse place (NYC-metro) but if there's one group I always forget it's the native Americans (it's not that I don't care what they think, it's just that there isn't a huge population of them in this area so I don't get to hear their opinions). Point taken. I guess we aren't all united about Thanksgiving being a positive \"American\" holiday. \n\nSo much for finding something that we can all \"unite\" around. To be fair, Jehovah's Witnesses are against holidays altogether which means that it would literally be impossible to find a holiday for \"everyone\" but it'd be nice if we could have *one* day a year where we can come together and forget that we all hate each other.",

Seems like a pretty neutral holiday to me. Plus, it brings in hope that maybe this year will be the year we all stop hating each other, so it has some level of a symbolically positive message.",
