I feel like I could get sent home again any day now because of COVID and with the election coming up, things are probably just gonna get even crazier. It's tough worrying about the normal college things like classes, work, social life when the future just seems so uncertain.", "author": "BotherTurbulent2058", "created": 1599584750, "upvotes": 592}}}
