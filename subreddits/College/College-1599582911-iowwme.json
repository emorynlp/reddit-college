  "text": "I\u2019ve been doing online college for three weeks now and I\u2019m moving in September 14. During this time I\u2019ve been feeling almost like nothing, like I\u2019m in limbo or in a universe I don\u2019t belong in. I know we\u2019re in very odd times but even still it seems so strange to exist. Nothing that\u2019s happened feels like it was meant to happen, days go by so quickly and I\u2019m losing track of what\u2019s happening in my everyday life. Hopefully moving in will mitigate some of these feelings. Please comment if any of you feel the same way.",

I pretty much just wanted to shut the world out and watch Netflix documentaries. \n\nYou're doing great, it's very normal to feel this way, because it is NOT normal what is going on. Even some of my most put-together friends/family are struggling right now, because they are very much the straight-line, A to B, \"OK what's next\", full the schedule to the brim, type of people, and have never deviated. Deviation from your \"normal\" sends a shock through the human brain, and not even that, the entire world! We're all programmed this way.\n\nJournal, if you can, or like. I find it fascinating, that one day I will be able to look back to something I wrote, during a pandemic, et. al. and recount what I survived through. (Albeit, spending a few weeks hiding under a rock). I saw your post, looking for something else, and I just felt like I had to respond/reach out. I get it... You're not alone <3 *virtual hugs*",

It's a very real problem that can lead to a slow drift into abyss, and I hope this helps. \nGood luck!",

I've been doing online college since March (I also took summer classes) and for the first few months it was kinda fun, but I started a new program at a new college today and it doesn't even feel real. I haven't met any of my professors or classmates, and it's really bizarre because I'm in nursing school, which is usually such a hands-on program. I'm only going to see them every other week for a few hours in person. even our clinicals are online. it's just bizarre. I know I'm still getting a quality education but it just feels eerie",

      "text": "Perhaps your mind is just kind of putting things on hold until you're out of your temporary situation - till you move. One thing I've tried to practice and remind myself throughout 2020 is to be present. People say things like \"let's take a shot at 11:59 Dec 31, 2020 and never speak of this again\" in the sense that we hope 2021 is better. Why not focus on being present though and focus on what is good now? I recently got into a new band which introduced me to a Japanese proverb \"Mono no aware\" basically meaning \"the awareness of [impermanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence) (\u7121\u5e38, *muj\u014d*), or transience of things, and both a transient gentle sadness (or wistfulness) at their passing as well as a longer, deeper gentle sadness about this state being the reality of life\" ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono\\_no\\_aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware) )  The band took the proverb to say that we watch these days pass by and let's say 5 years later we look back at them only in memory remembering all the good times. If we're present though and acknowledge what's good now, we can presently live the good times. I know this is a very hard concept and a poor time to talk about it, but all the same perhaps now is the best time to talk about it.",

Staying motivated can be hard, especially when you spend basically all day in front of the computer. I've been doing online classes since March and for the first few weeks especially I was depressed as hell. I've been pretty depressed a couple times since too, and ofc whenever I was feeling that way I just stayed inside not doing much. What's made me feel better in this time has been changing up my schedule in little ways, and staying relatively active.\n\nI go on walks most evenings (when I don't work), sometimes just for like 15 minutes, sometimes for an hour or so, some days I go walking in the nearby woods. I change up the games I'm playing every few days and the things I'm listening to so life isn't too too monotonous. I do a couple push ups or pull ups after most times I go to the bathroom, just to get a lil  bit of upper body workout. I stop to go out in my backyard for a couple minutes every now and then. I'll take some time in the morning to read outside some days before I start gaming for the next 4 or 5 hours. \n\nJust little things to keep a bit of diversity in my days......

Sometimes motivation is hard to come by during this time and I want to get ahead on things, but I feel like I get easily overwhelmed despite not feeling like I'm doing enough. Especially with my anxiety, there are times where I just... do not feel great. Something that has helped me though is writing down good things that happen each day. I think sometimes things can feel monotonous, but genuinely writing down good things in each day shows that each day is different and will bring a good thing - even if it is just eating your favorite thing for dinner or whatnot! I feel like using stuff like Google Calendar has also helped to keep me organized and on track because I keep the reminders on and it helps to let me know when certain things need to be done.",

I haven't heard from any clubs I joined previously, maybe I should email or text them? Well, they never contacted me when we switched online, so why get involved now. Activism? I've been in that for all summer and such and nothing has really happened. \n\nI am in my seventh semester yet still feel like my classes are very intro, but my degreeworks doesn't show any alternative classes I can take- I need like 7 more credits for my minor, 15 more for my major, and no classes required for the degree are offered rn it seems. I'd talk to my advisors or faculty like they say, to use them as resources, but what's the point? \n\nIt just feels so strange. And then I look for jobs online and nothing pops up, or is way overcompetitive- how can I get a bar tending job when almost all bars are closed, so even a part time listing can ask for three years experience, and I have zilch? Should I even still be in college when everything seems like on the brink of a huge disruption?",

What even are my goals anymore? \n\nMy advice is just try your best. Do what you can, but don\u2019t overwhelm yourself.

You concentrate on your school work during the day, and throughout the week you think of going out on a date on Friday, or your friend's wedding at the end of the month, or buying your first car soon.\n\nGraduating and starting a career are distant thoughts that are just kind of vaguely assumed while you focus on imminent short term goals and distractions. We struggle to overcome the monkey brain that is desperate to achieve what we want in the near future.\n\nBut now, everything has changed. Many of our lives has been reduced in many ways --- namely in the removal of social lives or even modest assumptions about what the next period of life will entail. The unpredictability of the future destroys our easily held notions of what is going to happen to us.\n\nIt forces us to confront the basic, terrifying idea that we don't know what will happen to us and that we aren't in control. During more normal times, most of us can push that to the back of our minds and occupy our thoughts with all the trappings of social interaction, short term goals, and the intricacies of modern life.

Can\u2019t go shopping or anything fun in indoor spaces cuz of corona, can\u2019t do outdoor activities like hiking cuz of smoke. We\u2019re really just confined to our houses now. Also, if your air quality is bad, places like Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot sell smoke masks. I recommend buying some ASAP because they sell out quick when wildfire season peaks. Stay inside, keep all doors and windows shut, and if you\u2019re driving, recirculate the air. Also, keeping your blinds closed all day is depressing, but it\u2019s more depressing to look outside and see smoke. So personally I keep mine closed. \n\nI\u2019ve been in school during evacuations before (pre-pandemic) and I think I prefer it when they close school. A couple years ago, the state\u2019s deadliest wildfire forced most colleges in NorCal to close for about a week or two. We didn\u2019t extend the semester; the professors had to revise the course, so when we came back, it was like everything crammed into the last few weeks. It was hectic but still better than when I had to evacuate and school was open. I remember I missed an assignment deadline because we just had to pack our stuff and leave immediately, so I forgot my laptop. You can\u2019t think straight when it\u2019s an emergency evacuation. \n\nBut even if you get warnings ahead of time to evacuate, you still can\u2019t really focus on school because you\u2019re thinking about your house and whats gonna happen, checking the news 24/7 for updates, and planning in case of worst and best case scenarios.",

Stress is the worst for focus.\n\nGood call on smoke masks. I have a respirator with a HEPA filter but it's a bit intense for all-day wear, that's for sure.\n\nBut seriously, staying in during the pandemic was already eating my brain. Good luck out there, and I hope the term gets better for you.",

I relate very much, days go by so quick with me just doing homework all day and studying and then the next day it\u2019s the same thing I barely have time to do anything I would like. I have always been a good student as well getting A\u2019s and barely any c\u2019s during my whole college career so far (I\u2019m in my junior year), but this online experience is not the best. I\u2019m not trying to just complain abt the whole experience because I have saved a lot of money not dorming or commuting but my social aspect of life is disappearing. Also, these professors are doing the bare minimum at least in my case and don\u2019t seem to care abt there students experience online or grades.",

I watched history documentaries, and some inspirational speakers on youtube, and it gave me prospective, that this is not something that is new, it is just now we have technology, and the ability to communicate with lightning speed. (Positive: I can respond to your comment and say \"hey you, I was feeling the same way, this is what helped me\" etc... but, sadly, Negative: We are force-fed so much information, being on the laptop all day, and Tv's, is not good for us at all. It used to be a super hippie-dippie thing to say \"need fresh air\" but its really just a biological thing.)\n\nAt the end of the day, It seems, if you're not altering your brain with neurotropics, or whatever it is that silicon valley is doing in order to be putting out so much, yet taking so little time to do basic things like SLEEP, and EAT... it's very off-putting. I gave birth, and the first month after my child was born, I was being tortured in ways the government actually still uses to this day. SLEEP DEPRIVATION, and poor nourishment. Hardly had time to cook a proper meal... sleep was a joke, and I LOST it on my partner several times, and was willing to consider just walking away from it all (of COURSE not... after a good 2-3 hr nap I was better), but Isolation, sleeplessness, and malnutrition will do things to us that are just plain horrible. \n\nsorry... bit of a rant...",
