About a month into college, I realized the new friends I'd found there were the exact same kind of people, same interests, etc. They weren't inherently terrible people, but I made a conscious choice to go out and meet different people and made some really awesome friends\n2. Every college student will ask this, often as a freshman, when the semester gets close and their grade is tight. \"My grade is so close to the next level, can you just round it up, I'll do extra assignments or something?\" Professors and TAs really hate that question and I've never heard of a professor actually doing it, it's just not fair to all the other students who get the grade they get.",
