I\u2019d suggest you read more recent scientific journal articles that the professor authored if you want to learn more about what they\u2019ve been doing in the field.",

          "text": "Thanks for taking the time to answer my post. \n\nThe thing is, my professor's profile pages on the college's website are pretty empty and without a biography or the institutions they've attended. Plus all of my professors right now have been awarded their PhDs within the past decade. Anyway, I just wanted to know if it is socially acceptable for a student to request something like that. I don't know if you're a professor, but is it something you would mind sharing with a student?",

I would tell them, though, that I\u2019ve moved on from what my dissertation was (completed in 2017) and published many papers since then, so it would be better to look at my Google Scholar or ResearchGate page.",
