  "text": "I\u2019m currently a 1st year in the middle of fall semester. I chose to stay in my city and go to a local state school for 4 main reasons: \n\n1. I couldn\u2019t decide on a major and didn\u2019t want to waste money with no goal in mind. \n\n2. I wasn\u2019t ready to move away from home. \n\n3. The cost. College is not cheap and I wasn\u2019t accepted for any of the scholarships I applied for. \n\n4. COVID. Being at home for a year made me miss out on a ton of things I loved about the city, like my job. I wanted to stay to make up for it when things started opening up again. \n\nI was accepted to a few far away schools in my state and I turned down all of them. I was trying to think financially and responsibly smart. Moving away would only put more debt on my family than necessary and I would be fine to live at home. However, I am starting to feel the doldrums of choosing to stay local. At first, I thought it was awesome. I was in awe with the big campus and welcome events and free stuff handed out. I liked the fact the schedule was so flexible and I could study wherever I wanted. I was hanging out with a couple friend groups, both old and new. However, they dissipated after the first month or two as the school year set in. \n\nI guess my current school is decent, but the student life at my school is really dead. I went through high school keeping to myself and not really participating in social events there or making many friends. I was really hoping that would flip in college. Trying to change this, I hung out with the friend groups and attended rush events for a sorority. There aren\u2019t many social events at all, and I\u2019m honestly so caught up in my schoolwork and personal things it\u2019s hard to get out and make the most of it. \n\nThe sorority I tried to join didn\u2019t give me a bid. I have only made one solid friend so far. The clubs are killed off because of COVID and I\u2019m not interested in intramural sports. I\u2019m feeling discouraged, tired, and regretful. \n\nI honestly wonder if I would be better off at a school known for good student life and feeling super inserted into their community. I chose the practical side over the chance of experience and now I\u2019m regretting it.",

      "text": "Honestly college is expensive so I respect your choice. Many students feel like this even When they do move away for college. If you do transfer, I would look into trying to be an RA because that often covers the cost of your housing and sometimes a stipend, but then u prob would be able to get a job and you would have that as a job. And if you go to another in state school it could be similar tuition price. Or you could try to do this at your current school if you want to get more immersed in the campus life",

      "text": "We have the same exact experience, I got accepted into the New School but turned it down to finish my degree at a college in my home state. Big regrets, but I\u2019m thinking about getting plugged into things at my old community college. There might be off campus events or colleges in your city that host things of interest to you. Hit those up maybe, might be helpful but we are definitely in the same boat.",
