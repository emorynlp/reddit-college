  "text": "i just began a double major in econ because of interest/good career prospects. right now im starting off in macroeconomics and math for econ (calculus basically). while i find econ really interesting and am doing well in macro, i\u2019m struggling a lot with being thrown into calculus after not doing math for years. i barely passed my first math for econ midterm. as a student with a nearly 4.0 gpa, struggling this much in college is new to me.\n\ni\u2019ve been to university tutoring and office hours and i do all my work/study/attend lectures but i haven\u2019t been able to get the 1-on-1 undivided attention i feel like i need to master the introductory theory, which makes me nervous for the rest of the major. \n\ndo you have any resources/advice/tips/honest reassurance for me to get through this and feel more confident about my classes? would be much appreciated",

      "text": "Hi, I'm also an Econ double major (Econ and Math), I'm just a Freshman, but I hope I can help you somehow!\n\nMath is all about practice, I know you already know this at this point, but try doing as much Calc practice questions as you can. But not only that, try to understand WHY things are the way they are, then solving problems won't be an issue.\n\nIt looks like you already know the solution for your problem: 1-on-1 guidance. I don't know how TAs work in your school, but can't you schedule an appointment with them beforehand to go over some your questions?\n\nThat leads to another important point: Ask as much questions as you need to! In High School I was so scared of Math, I'm still surprised I decided to major in it, but now that I'm doing it I don't only want to \"pass\", I want to understand, and what has been helping me the most is asking a bunch of questions to my TAs. My school offers Calc office hours with TAs from Monday to Sunday from 9AM to 9PM, and I've been attending it almost every day, and thanks to that I'm now able to do Calc stuff I never would be able to 5 months ago. So definitely try arranging an 1-on-1 appointment with a TA if possible, that will make Calc look crystal clear to you!\n\nNow some resources that I find really useful for both Math and Econ:\n\n[https://openstax.org/](https://openstax.org/) (Economics and Math)\n\n[https://courseware.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/11](https://courseware.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/11) (Math)\n\n[https://leanpub.com/](https://leanpub.com/) (Economics and Math)\n\n[https://khanacademy.org/](https://khanacademy.org/) (Economics and Math)\n\n[https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/](https://brilliant.org/daily-problems/) (Math)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/reading) (Econ)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/comments/2mkmk0](https://www.reddit.com/comments/2mkmk0) (Math)\n\nGood luck in your studies!",
