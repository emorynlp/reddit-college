Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn\u2019t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I\u2019m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it\u2019s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don\u2019t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren\u2019t my cup of tea and I\u2019m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. \n\nI was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I\u2019m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I\u2019m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it\u2019s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I\u2019m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. \n\t\nI guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?\n\nEdit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo\n\nSo I have done research, I\u2019m okay with the average annual income and I know that it\u2019ll be tough to start out with but it\u2019s that way for almost everyone so I\u2019m expecting it. I\u2019ve been looking into internships, however as far as I\u2019ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I\u2019m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. \n\nI\u2019m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they\u2019d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that\u2019s a sort of double hit. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.\n\nEdit2: I don\u2019t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. \n\nAs someone mentioned, a degree isn\u2019t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like \u201cyou\u2019d actually make money in stem\u201d is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won\u2019t be easy either way, and I\u2019m not in school to have fun, I\u2019m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I\u2019m already feeling burn out and miserable I don\u2019t want to waste all that time and money. \n\nI\u2019m fully aware of what I\u2019d be getting into both ways.", "author": "Cpt-Casual", "created": 1576118496, "retrieved": 1632947892, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 705, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fantfs7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e9hk82/im_18f_not_interested_in_a_stem_major_anymore_and/fantfs7/", "text": "I'm studying media informatics. You might be interested in that.  \nThis way you learn all the computer science stuff plus some artistic things like Photo/Video/Audio editing, 3D-Modelling and how video- and audio compression works.  \nI wanted to study something related to media, because I was into video editing and ended up with Media Informatics. And I really like it. It's tough, it's brutal, but also super interesting. I'm also very interested in 3D-Modelling (even though not as much to try to get a job in the industry, because it seems to be super fucking hard and I'm not artistic enough for that). And I was lucky enough to be accepted to a practical course in 3D-modelling in Maya, then a 3D-modelling course in Blender, and now a practical course for game development using Unreal, C++, and the new version of Blender 2.8 (which I wanted to have a look at anyway).  \nSo, I definitely got my fix of media-related stuff in my studies. And I love programming. What I don't like is math, because I'm just bad at it.  \nNot everything you learn in computer science will be something you enjoy, but you should find at least something interesting in most of the classes.  \nBTW: When I started, I almost failed my first introduction to programming. It was after the second semester, where we had a practical course, in which we were programming a larger project in a group, that I got good at it. And ever since I got hooked and have been programming for years in my free time. So, maybe you just need some time to get used to it.  \n\n\nAnd with a degree in media informatics, I bet you could still get into Animation/Modelling.  \nYou would have the security of a STEM major, making your parents happy, being able to do 3D-modelling, maybe get into animation/modelling, and on top of that have the security of knowing you will find a job as a computer scientist, if 3D doesn't work out or doesn't interest you anymore.", "author": "Tuomas90", "created": 1576250185, "upvotes": 1}, "fan405g": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e9hk82/im_18f_not_interested_in_a_stem_major_anymore_and/fan405g/", "text": "Major in something you can tolerate and then do the art as a hobby.\n\nAs a women in stem you have a huuuuuuge advantage when it comes to things like jobs, internships, support, etc.", "author": "_BearHawk", "created": 1576222902, "upvotes": 1}, "fami2hy": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e9hk82/im_18f_not_interested_in_a_stem_major_anymore_and/fami2hy/", "text": "I encourage it.

Unless you have 100% commitment to pursuing the arts with every fiber of your being don't do it.

Art classes are infinitely more interesting and enjoyable.  I am struggling through enjoying all these initial CS classes even though I am getting good grades and I KNOW I am good with computers.  My shitty teacher didn't help.  I pretty much had to teach myself how to do everything.  I figure I just have to buckle down hard and get through the boring stuff which is what I wished I had done the first time around.

I figure at least the skills I learn will be useful if I ever for example need to know a little Python for something.  I may end up going pure math or physics because I have always enjoyed both since I was younger.  Take a couple of other intro classes (engineering, etc.) and see if something sparks for you.

I make $33k at my current job (in a low cost of living city and state). My master's degree will cost me less than $20k which is in loans that I will pay off as fast as possible. As an academic librarian I should make about $55k per year. So worth the investment. \n\nMy advice would to be look at a major that allows you to be creative but gives you a base skill to sell to employers and you can tweak what jobs you apply to from there. For example the base of an English degree is being a good communicator, that has taken me really far. For you maybe get a marketing degree and a minor in some kind of graphic design then you could apply to do commercials/logos/social media stuff for big companies.

If you can\u2019t make a living off it or it isn\u2019t directly related getting paid (study math, but do something else, but get hired because math people are ideal for your job) then it\u2019s a hobby.

Income averages are important but what you should be more concerned about is employment rates and how difficult it is to get a job in your field. Having a lower income is nowhere near as large a problem as getting out of college with x amount of debt and THEN realizing the industry is saturated in your area and you can't get a job at all. I think the best way to get a good understanding of this is to talk to upper level students or people who are in the field doing what you'll be doing in 4 years. Not sure how you'd contact people like that but its an idea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data  structures and algorithms just aren\u2019t my cup of tea.\n\nNo matter what field you pick, it will contain something you may not like. Love robotics? You need math. Love the ocean? You need bio. Love art? Well I'm not sure what the obstacles there are but they are there. Don't write off a career path because there were obstacles. Don't let those obstacles defeat you.\n\nFinally, remember that you can easily transition from a degree in computer science to work in digital media and/or art. It can be an asset because the fields overlap in exponentially increasing ways.
