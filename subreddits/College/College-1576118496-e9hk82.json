  "title:": "I\u2019m (18F) not interested in a STEM major anymore and I\u2019m scared to tell my parents",
  "text": "So I\u2019m just about finished with my first semester at University, and my current major is computer science. Well we took the final for the class, submitted final projects, all that jazz and my overall grade has ended up being a C or C+. Usually this would be fine to pass a class however for this intro class we need a B to move on. Now I already wasn\u2019t a fan from like the third week of school, and now that I have to retake this class I\u2019m just straight up not having a good time, and when looking at the next class it\u2019s basically the same concepts being taught again, and I really don\u2019t want to do this kind of stuff three times. I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data structures and algorithms just aren\u2019t my cup of tea and I\u2019m bored and not performing as well as I had hoped. \n\nI was looking through what my university had to offer and I saw something I\u2019m really interested in,  creative media and animation. I already draw and I\u2019m teaching myself how to use blender in my free time and that just sounds way more enjoyable as something I could do as a career. Except like the title says, it\u2019s not a STEM major, and ya know the cliche of starving artists...but I really much rather do something I enjoy rather than what I\u2019m being expected to do despite the average pay being less. \n\t\nI guess I need help with figuring out if this is a risk and/or just something stupid and if I go through with it how do I tell my parents?\n\nEdit: adding some info cause of repetitive replies, no hard feelings yo\n\nSo I have done research, I\u2019m okay with the average annual income and I know that it\u2019ll be tough to start out with but it\u2019s that way for almost everyone so I\u2019m expecting it. I\u2019ve been looking into internships, however as far as I\u2019ve seen they are looking for upperclassmen so I plan on using the time now to building up a portfolio and learn as much as I can inside and outside the classroom because i really want to do this. I\u2019m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love. \n\nI\u2019m currently receiving financial aid, however my parents have said they\u2019d help me pay it back, but they threatened if I failed  I would be on my own. So that\u2019s a sort of double hit. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m prepping as much as I can for both short term and long term goals.\n\nEdit2: I don\u2019t plan on studying typical art where I sit down and paint, I specifically want to go into 3D modeling/rigging that could be used in animation and games. \n\nAs someone mentioned, a degree isn\u2019t going to guarantee a job in anything, yes there is high demand for different things but I think looking at this like \u201cyou\u2019d actually make money in stem\u201d is unfair.  Again,  I realize that it won\u2019t be easy either way, and I\u2019m not in school to have fun, I\u2019m here because I want to learn, I played it safe and went into CS because I already had some experience with programming, but if I\u2019m already feeling burn out and miserable I don\u2019t want to waste all that time and money. \n\nI\u2019m fully aware of what I\u2019d be getting into both ways.",

      "text": "I'm studying media informatics. You might be interested in that.  \nThis way you learn all the computer science stuff plus some artistic things like Photo/Video/Audio editing, 3D-Modelling and how video- and audio compression works.  \nI wanted to study something related to media, because I was into video editing and ended up with Media Informatics. And I really like it. It's tough, it's brutal, but also super interesting. I'm also very interested in 3D-Modelling (even though not as much to try to get a job in the industry, because it seems to be super fucking hard and I'm not artistic enough for that). And I was lucky enough to be accepted to a practical course in 3D-modelling in Maya, then a 3D-modelling course in Blender, and now a practical course for game development using Unreal, C++, and the new version of Blender 2.8 (which I wanted to have a look at anyway).  \nSo, I definitely got my fix of media-related stuff in my studies. And I love programming. What I don't like is math, because I'm just bad at it.  \nNot everything you learn in computer science will be something you enjoy, but you should find at least something interesting in most of the classes.  \nBTW: When I started, I almost failed my first introduction to programming. It was after the second semester, where we had a practical course, in which we were programming a larger project in a group, that I got good at it. And ever since I got hooked and have been programming for years in my free time. So, maybe you just need some time to get used to it.  \n\n\nAnd with a degree in media informatics, I bet you could still get into Animation/Modelling.  \nYou would have the security of a STEM major, making your parents happy, being able to do 3D-modelling, maybe get into animation/modelling, and on top of that have the security of knowing you will find a job as a computer scientist, if 3D doesn't work out or doesn't interest you anymore.",

You are determined to do what you want to do and there are paths to make it work if you are determined.

      "text": "I was an art major the first time I went to school.  Unless you have 100% commitment to pursuing the arts with every fiber of your being don't do it.  I spent most of my adult life moving from one job to another and being an administrative assistant for most of it.  This time around I am a computer science major.  Art classes are infinitely more interesting and enjoyable.  I am struggling through enjoying all these initial CS classes even though I am getting good grades and I KNOW I am good with computers.  My shitty teacher didn't help.  I pretty much had to teach myself how to do everything.  I figure I just have to buckle down hard and get through the boring stuff which is what I wished I had done the first time around.  Now I am 42 and probably won't even have my associates until I am 44 because I have to work full time and THEN I still have to finish my degree.\n\nAlso, my ex husband has a degree very similar to what you are looking at.  We met when he was going to school for it.  He was working as a hotel desk clerk when I met him.  Almost 20 years later and he is still a hotel desk clerk.  \n\nI am not saying you should necessarily do CS if you absolutely hate it but a lot of people get degrees in other STEM fields and then take online certifications later if they need the programming skills.  I may or may not stay with CS myself but I am going to give it another semester or so to see if things start getting better.  I figure at least the skills I learn will be useful if I ever for example need to know a little Python for something.  I may end up going pure math or physics because I have always enjoyed both since I was younger.  Take a couple of other intro classes (engineering, etc.) and see if something sparks for you.  People put so much pressure on students who are first starting out to declare a major and stick with it.  College should also be about finding what you are good at but also with realistic expectations about the job market.",

I know everyone on here is talking about money issues you'll experience and that is valid, but this degree is the REST OF YOUR LIFE.\n\nI started medical school and realized after 3 years I hated it, but I never switched because I was scared of what my parents would say and I was scared of money. Now I have my degree, but I am miserable. I work a job that has created more anxiety than I could ever imagine and have fallen into some pretty intense depression. I don't mean to throw myself a pity party, but please learn from my mistakes and change your course if you don't like it. \n\nMaybe take the next year to do more general education to decide what you really want! Maybe animation is it, but possibly switching to a community college that offers a lot of under grad classes can give you an idea. My sister started her degree as a medical doctor three years after me and she hated it, but instead of sticking it out, she switched degrees. My parents were always very strict about school and also saved up for our schooling so they were paying for it. I thought FOR SURE my parents would be very angry with my sister, but they fully supported her once they realized she couldn't see herself being happy or successful in the medical field. \n\nIf I could go back to my 18 year old self, I would change completely what I chose to go to school for. It's hard to make the decision of what you want to do for the rest of your life at 18, and you were granted a huge blessing to see after this first semester that you don't like your choice and you still have time to change. \n\nYou've got this!! If you need any advice please feel free to PM me. Good luck!",

      "text": "So I kind of did the same thing. I thought if I worked hard enough at it, I could get a Chemistry degree through sheer effort. Turns out, you have to have some kind of base understanding to pass the first Chem class. So I failed that my first semester and knew I needed to find something else. Like you, I had strength in the arts (specifically reading and writing), so I changed to an English major. I have a BA in English with a focus on Technical Writing. I had a job lined up for two weeks after I graduated and I'm still at that job. I'm currently half way through a Master's to be a librarian. If you want to look at the cost side of my experience we can break it down. I went to a large state school, paid in state tuition. My parents paid for my bachelors and I did it in 4 years. I make $33k at my current job (in a low cost of living city and state). My master's degree will cost me less than $20k which is in loans that I will pay off as fast as possible. As an academic librarian I should make about $55k per year. So worth the investment. \n\nMy advice would to be look at a major that allows you to be creative but gives you a base skill to sell to employers and you can tweak what jobs you apply to from there. For example the base of an English degree is being a good communicator, that has taken me really far. For you maybe get a marketing degree and a minor in some kind of graphic design then you could apply to do commercials/logos/social media stuff for big companies. You would get to do art and be creative but also not be a \"starving artist\". You could take short term graphic design jobs while in school to build a portfolio. \n\nJust some thoughts",

They feel undereducated, they\u2019re not happy with their chosen career, etc. \n\nDon\u2019t feel like you have to get everything done in 4 years, either. That\u2019s obviously cheapest, but college, the learning (I\u2019m a huge nerd, don\u2019t mind me), it\u2019s the most fun ever. The real world, with the bills, and the responsibilities, not so much. \n\nIf you love animating, then do it! You will get the work done to make that your career. You\u2019re already doing stuff outside of school to get better at it, you\u2019ve been researching internships and salary. That\u2019s more than most students do until their junior year. \n\nAnother important point I would make is this: once you switch your major, make sure to make good relationships with your professors. Go to office hours, ask questions, all that. If you need a recommendation in the future, they\u2019re just right there, included in the cost of your tuition. \n\nGood luck with your education :D",

You need to find the intersection of what you're interested in, what you're good at and what will be in demand when you graduate.\n\nEvalute your competition and the minimum technical proficiency necessary to succeed in the CS or animation programs. If you're just starting as an artist you could be up against far better artists. You don't want to be near the bottom if you want to do well in the program.\n\nIf necessary, take time off to get your skills in the middle of the pack at least. Get 2 jobs: work a part time job and save money to pay for college. The less interest you have to pay on loans the better. The other job is artist/animator/programmer/computer geek. Commit to putting in 4-6 hours a day to develop your skills. The more diverse skills you can bring to the table the better. You need to go hard if you want to get a decent paying gig once you're done school.\n\nYour parents need to look at the big picture. If you're not happy with your major you're less likely to complete the program. The worst case scenario is being saddled with debt, no degree and no job prospects. They could end up paying in the long run.\n\nMost 18 year olds have no clue what they want from life. One year in the real world, working for minimum wage, paying bills, being able to afford nothing and putting up with all the BS being an adult entails will help you appreciate college and hopefully encourage you to put everything you have into becoming successful.\n\nIt took me a while to accept gap years are a good idea. They are. Offer to pay a reasonable amount of rent to your parents. The rest of your $$ goes in the bank or against existing loans. As long as you're in debt you don't have the luxury of luxuries. Sorry. Real world. If your parents are nice, smart and financially stable they'll put your rent contributions into an account and give it back to you later to help you on your feet.\n\nDon't forget to invest in your social life. Make sure you hang out with friends, participate in extracurricular activities, take time to explore life outside school and work. Mental health is a big deal. Don't isolate yourself. Be a good friend and encourage others to be a good friend to you. Makes the world a better place in general.\n\nLastly, don't lie to your parents. That's just plain stupid. You need their love and support, and they need yours.",

College is set up for you to engage in four years of exploration and intellectual curiosity, discovering both what you love and who you are. If you are not enjoying the road that has been carefully paved and painted and lit up for you, DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY.\n\nIt\u2019s a little known fact that *most* BA degrees, when paired with key job prep classes and internships, can land you FANTASTIC jobs after college. I\u2019m a history and creative writing major, which to most of my parents\u2019 friends sounds like I\u2019m throwing away my entire potential to have fun in college. But I\u2019ve simply looked at many friends who\u2019ve done the college thing + statistics for majors in jobs and realised that it\u2019s totally doable. I spend my semesters enjoying what I\u2019m studying and spend 1-2 months in the summer working at a company. I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy the internship all that much (although my last one was a ton of fun), but 1-2 months of this per year is better than 6-8 months. So honestly, do what you want to do because THAT is what college is for. Take advantage of the opportunity you have to learn anything you want from highly skilled people for the next 3.5 years, and worry about the next 60 after that.\n\nAs for your parents\u2014I\u2019m indian American, which means I deal with constant pressure from an extended family that contains dozens more than just my parents, but of all of these, my mother is still the loudest. And yet I came to the realisation that at some point I have to make the decision that I believe is right for me, not the one that my parents think is right for me. Telling them is the hard part, and you\u2019re just gonna have to bite the bullet on that. But I really hope this helps.",

I hate math and I hate having to follow little nitpicky rules so Python understands what I'm trying to do. It didn't help that the professor was so bad the poor TA had to try and save us...I failed still.\nI was interested in the other parts of CIT but I wasn't allowed to skip programming. \nNow I've transferred schools and I'm doing Communication. I don't know yet if I actually want to stay in this major but I do know that it's more me, I think. I still kind of wish I could possibly minor in IT because IT is different than compsci. I wanted to do CS in high school but I realized computer science is a lot more math, theory, and in depth than IT, which is IMO more useful unless you plan on being like a hardcore computer person. IT is good for most jobs out there. Communication is good, as I've been told. Idek though. \nI'm an INFP and I like helping people kind of so maybe computers are a secondary skill rather than a primary one. \n\nIf you can, look into IT...its much different. \n\nPersonally I think being creative is good but don't get yourself into debt you cant get out of. Comm is a good creative major that will have some decent job possibilities. If you minor in tech you'd be even extra valued by companies.",

But after this semester I did terrible in my intro to CS class and calculus and have found I really hate doing this kind of work. I've brought up the idea to my parents and all I keep hearing is how I'm giving up a sensible career for the equivalent of painting caricatures at amusement parks. Over the break I'm going to do a lot of research and prove the job market, then have a talk with them about what I'm trying to do. I hope it all goes well for you with this, I know how frustrating it can be dealing with this :(",

If it's any consolation, you at least have a more planned out idea of what you want to dothan me; right now I'm just stuck at \"yeah probably not this\".\n\nI can't give any concrete help because I too don't know how I'd ever bring this kind of thing up to my parents, but I remember hearing an idol of mine say something along these lines before and it's really stuck with me: \"If you can show your parents that you can be successful and profit from (x), that'll likely be enough to earn their support.\" They support you right now not necessarily because they believe you'll come out with a CS degree, but because they believe you'll come out *successful*...which to them right now just looks like a CS degree.\n\nIf you want to animate and you can build a portfolio, find that internship, get those offers however small they seem, find those niche scholarships, etc. your parents shouldn't have any reason to fear anymore. Of course, that depends on your parents; worst case you'll be forced to go it solo, or suffer through CS until you can afford to support yourself. Either way, it'll be an insane grind, like it always is going against the current. Good luck though, I wish you the best.",

      "text": "While I don't have much experience in gaming industry (I'm a regular off-the mill software engineer), I encourage you to continue your passions in the free time, even if it doesn't directly align with your studies. If your passion and studies are 100% at odds, I'd recommend following your heart: tooling is useless if you don't need it and studying a subject you hate is not a very fruitful endeavor.\n\nIt just so happens that I do find algorithms exciting, so let me try to infect you too a little. Whatever you do with computers, eventually you will run into computation bottlenecks and you'll need to reason about performance and pick the best tool for the trade-off at hand. That's kinda what algorithms and data structures are about: they give you tools and some understanding to reasoning about those issues. Without those tools you'll be a bit like walking in the dark: you might still find your way, but it'll be longer and sometimes you'd be completely lost.\n\nFor example, if you have a loop within a loop in your code, you know that implementation is O(N\\^2). Then you can see if O(N\\^2) seems like a reasonable runtime for the theoretical algorithm your code implements: if it is, implementation is probably, if you expect O(N) then it's probably worth investigating if you can spot the better implementation. Without the theoretical knowledge you wouldn't be able to do any of this and would only be able to tell that code is slow.\n\nIf any of what I wrote above perks your interest, then maybe the issue is not the subject but the delivery. Back in my college I had a terrible professor teaching Operating Systems and that's a hole in my education that I regret to this day, even though I find virtual memory and other OS aspects fascinating. Another issue could be a lack of hands-on gratification. That could be addressed by trying to implement structures/algorithms or elect more hands-on heavy classes down the road.\n\nI'd also encourage you to reach out to your adviser or a professor you trust and ask for their advice in your conundrum. They may be able to help you craft a more media art oriented version of the Computer Science degree or adjust the course work.\n\nHope it helps.",

Great.  \n\nNow let\u2019s assume you want to be an artist.  For my situation, I would say, ok, go ahead, but I\u2019m not going to pay for it. I know too many people who study art who can\u2019t make a living off that.  If you can\u2019t make a living off it or it isn\u2019t directly related getting paid (study math, but do something else, but get hired because math people are ideal for your job) then it\u2019s a hobby.  Hobbies are fun, but done on your own time and in your own money.\n\nBack to your situation.  Have you considered taking a break, working for a bit?  College racks up bills quickly.  For that money, you could get quite a bit of experience to see if you really want to continue.\n\nThere are several paths to get to a job you like.  For many jobs, college right after high school is only one of them.\n\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "> I\u2019m perfectly content with being able to survive comfortably and do something I love.   \n>  \n> I\u2019m okay with the average annual income \n\nIt sounds like you see a job in your field as a guarantee after you complete university, but this is very dangerous to assume even if you were staying within a STEM program. Income averages are important but what you should be more concerned about is employment rates and how difficult it is to get a job in your field. Having a lower income is nowhere near as large a problem as getting out of college with x amount of debt and THEN realizing the industry is saturated in your area and you can't get a job at all. I think the best way to get a good understanding of this is to talk to upper level students or people who are in the field doing what you'll be doing in 4 years. Not sure how you'd contact people like that but its an idea. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I loved robotics and cyber security in middle/high school but data  structures and algorithms just aren\u2019t my cup of tea.\n\nNo matter what field you pick, it will contain something you may not like. Love robotics? You need math. Love the ocean? You need bio. Love art? Well I'm not sure what the obstacles there are but they are there. Don't write off a career path because there were obstacles. Don't let those obstacles defeat you.\n\nFinally, remember that you can easily transition from a degree in computer science to work in digital media and/or art. It can be an asset because the fields overlap in exponentially increasing ways. If you wanted to go from art to computer science you'd have to re-enroll or take a massive pay cut.",

What you could do is to take some art classes as free electives to experiment. If you like it, talk with your parents first and show the results/grades to show your interest in changing majors.

      "text": "This is something a lot of students can relate to me, myself included.  My father would constantly tell me I would be homeless and a hooker if I did not major in STEM.  So, I forced myself to take classes and major in something I did not like.  However, I when I finally realized that I was the one footing the bill I realized that I need to be happy.  So, I changed my major to writing.  I hope to get a master's degree in it and be able to teach.  But, let me stop talking about me.  I have noticed that I am happier and my mental health has been getting better.\n\nMoney is not everything, sure it's nice and can buy nice things, but you need to do something that you enjoy in life.  Ask yourself why are you majoring in this?  Is it for the high salary or is it something you are interested in?  Yes, your parents are helping you, but being interested in the major is important.  Money should not be the reason to major in something.\n\nAny debt will be in your name, don't waste it on something you dislike.\n\nPersonally, I would sit down with my parents and explain to them what is going on.  Tell them that you are not happy with STEM and you have tried to get interested, but it isn't your calling.  Tell them about how this new major makes you excited.  Remember, your parents do care about you (at least I hope so) and want the best for you.  However, remember that this is your future not their's.",

All of us who did regret our choices so far. \n\n5 years after graduation none of us have jobs in our field, and with unemployable degrees, we\u2019re struggling to find jobs that pay enough to make ends meet at all. Retail is a common theme.\n\nMy advice: look at job sites in the areas around where you\u2019ll likely live. Be realistic, after college you\u2019ll probably stay around your college or where your parents live for the first few years at least. In those areas look at sites like indeed, glassdoor, monster and other job sites for entry level jobs in animation in the type of job you\u2019d like to have. \n\nNow, aim your education toward what those jobs want. They want people who know how to do X, Y and Z? Make damn sure you know how. Don\u2019t pursue classes in animation because they\u2019re fun, pursue classes in animation that will get you hired. (My friend took a lot of for-fun art classes to \u201cbroaden horizons\u201d that aren\u2019t applicable to what animation companies want.) Remember, you are in job training, and you won\u2019t get a second chance like this.\n\nHope this helps.",

It has its origin in the attempt to discover first principles \u2013 'those universal principles which are the condition of the possibility of the existence of anything and everything'.The liberal arts, also known as the seven liberal arts, are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (liberalis, \"worthy of a free person\") to know to take an active part in civic life, something that (for ancient Greece) included participating in public debate, defending oneself in court, serving on juries, and most importantly, military service. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric were the core liberal arts (the trivium), while arithmetic, geometry, the theory of music, and astronomy were the following stage of education (as the quadrivium).Liberal arts today can refer to academic subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics, and social and physical sciences; and liberal arts education can refer to overall studies in a liberal arts degree program. For both interpretations, the term generally refers to matters not relating to the professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/college/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Learn photoshop. One should try to pursue what he/she enjoys while also being competitive in today\u2019s market.",

If you have some actual strategy to make money with your passion then absolutely dive in headfirst. \n\nOtherwise if it's too hard to monetize your passions, then do what you are good at which the qualification \"as long as you dont hate it\".\n\nBut what you're saying is right too. It's not about doing what you love so much as leveraging what you are good at to have a position you enjoy somewhat.",
