  "text": "i have a random roommate from out of state this year and we don\u2019t really talk at all and she has some really weird behaviors that i\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s normal for roommates to do. \n\nthe biggest one is getting naked. whenever she has to shower she gets completely naked right in front of me before putting on her robe. and it just shocks me every time. i would never even do that in front of my closest friends, let alone a random roommate that i don\u2019t know. it\u2019s just so weird TO ME. it\u2019s like really uncomfortable and i don\u2019t know how to react. i\u2019ll just be watching tv and i look up and her butt is right there. \n\nis this normal? is this like a geographical thing? or a household thing? i never did this growing up\u2026.\n\nedit: guys, i don\u2019t know why i\u2019m getting downvotes. i\u2019m not mad at her or this situation at all. yeah it\u2019s a little strange to me, but i\u2019m not going it do anything about it. i was really just curious if this was a common thing outside of where i\u2019m from. i grew up in a household where my parents really weren\u2019t there much. spent a lot of time on my own. my roommate on the other hand is from a very loving, upper class family from a private school. was just wondering if this is a common experience among others! i\u2019ve only experienced one type of location/household before.\n\nedit pt. 2: i don\u2019t understand the rude comments. i am not hating on her, i am not planning to talk to her about it, it\u2019s not a problem for me. i was simply curious if this was common for other people. i see now from the comments that it\u2019s pretty normal. no need to be rude to someone who hasn\u2019t experienced the same things you have. \n\nedit 3: I AM NOT ASKING HER TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT. I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF THIS WAS A COMMON THING I NEVER EXPERIENCED.",

How else would I try on some clothes? Literally how else would I go shower? I\u2019d also sleep in my underwear. They sound normal and you sound really weird and closeted here. It has nothing to do with you being poor and her being rich. If someone suggested to me that I stop being naked I would be like I literally live here and we have the same parts. Also I\u2019ve seen my friends naked several times? We change together and try on clothes in the same dressing room. We talk about how we want to skinny dipping. It\u2019s literally not weird. You are though",

Depends on who you're speaking to, really. I noticed that in general a lot of Americans have issues with nudity, but *personally* I've been raised in a more open household--One where I was allowed to walk around butt naked or like if I was with friends it was okay for me to see them naked if they were also girls. This is actually really tame, and doesn't seem like a huge issue to me seeing as she's trying to get into her robe right after. Things might have been similar for her. \n\nBest course of action? Talk to her. Tell her it makes you uncomfortable. She might be annoyed, she might think that *you're* the weird one, but in the end she knows your boundaries. I don't really reccomend going to a RA or anything though. It's her dorm just as equally as it's yours.\n\nHey with the right tone you guys can have a funny bonding conversation about the customs back at your homes.",

The bathroom connects to another room so they could come in at any moment so the only place one could change privately was the shower which was just a small curtain.

And this is coming from someone who is also a bit uncomfortable with nudeness. \n\nAlso, do you guys live in a shared dorm room? If that's case, assuming she's simply trying to change before getting into her robe, I'd give her a bit more slack. I remember I used to try and hide when I changed in front of my roommate and I would try to keep my towel on while changing underneath and it was just difficult. I eventually said fuck it and just changed quickly even if meant me being naked for a minute. I'd you're in one shared room, there's is the reality that someone might see someone naked.\n\nBut again, totally depends on what's happening here. Not enough info.",

Some people are more comfortable than others when it comes to nudity. If it really bothers you, talk to her and see what she says, but I wouldn't automatically expect someone to change their ways about it especially with it being a share space. It's just kind of the reality of living in a dorm room, some elements of privacy do go a bit out the window.",

I\u2019ve heard of people walking around naked in their apartments w roommates before but usually they have the wherewithal to at least warn them ahead of time and ask if it\u2019s cool. I would approach her at a time when she\u2019s fully clothed and just let her know that it makes you uncomfortable to see her naked and if she could dress in private in her room or the bathroom. If she doesn\u2019t listen then definitely speak to someone about it (RA, etc). \n\nI totally laughed out loud at the \u201cwatching tv and looking up to suddenly see a butt right there\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but in all seriousness, your concern is valid!",
