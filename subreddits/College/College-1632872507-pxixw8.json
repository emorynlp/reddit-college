I noticed that in general a lot of Americans have issues with nudity, but *personally* I've been raised in a more open household--One where I was allowed to walk around butt naked or like if I was with friends it was okay for me to see them naked if they were also girls. This is actually really tame, and doesn't seem like a huge issue to me seeing as she's trying to get into her robe right after. Things might have been similar for her. \n\nBest course of action? Talk to her. Tell her it makes you uncomfortable. She might be annoyed, she might think that *you're* the weird one, but in the end she knows your boundaries.
