  "text": "It sucks that every office has every call to them go to voicemails and emails take a week long to get a response. As of right now, this is how things are looking for me at school.\n\n\\- Roommates are required to wear masks when in their rooms -\\_-\n\n\\- People from other dorms can't come into your dorm and vice versa\n\n\\-Automatic suspension for people who party (lol)\n\n\\- If you decide to go online, you lose your housing assignment and will be homeless in spring\n\n\\- If you go online, you're on your own. You have to contact each professor and find out how they are doing online classes.\n\n\\- Dining halls, fitness centers, everything are closed. Daily life will be Room, Class, get food, Room.\n\n\\-The best part is that there are 39 people on my floor this year and we have 2 bathrooms for all of them!!!!\n\nThere are so many other things but it's just going to make me sad lol. I wish I could do this semester online but my school is making it so difficult that it's not even worth it. What are your schools doing? \"Additional details will be provided in the coming weeks\" is my school's plan and I wanted to know if your schools have better plans for this fall.\n\nEDIT: Btw, my school never sent out an official email saying that there is an online option. I only found out that we do by emailing an advisor and asking if there is an option.\n\nTheir plans for bathrooms are - basically extra cleaning and mask to and from bathroom\n\nSeems like everyone is in a similar boat as me and time will only tell. I wish good luck to everybody and hope that everyone stays safe.",

      "text": "My college has basically admitted they don't have a concrete plan, especially as far as housing goes. Yesterday, actually, I heard from someone whose parent works in admissions that the school made deals with local hotels so students could have singles because we don't have enough on campus. I know we'll have to wear masks on campus (not sure if we'll be required to do so while in dorms) and that visiting other dorms will be limited (although I wonder how exactly that'll be enforced because that would require more security especially at night). Also apparently dining will be more/mostly take out. I really don't know how they're going to enforce everything as far as living on campus. I go to a small school so it's going to be hard because we already have such a small campus. I'm predicting it's going to be a mess lol, especially when it comes to partying on weekends because that all happens at houses off campus, which my school has no control over, and even if they did, I doubt the students would follow any rules. I genuinely have no clue how this year's gonna happen.\n\nLuckily (or maybe not so luckily), I signed a lease in January before everything went down. Only 2 out of my 5 classes went fully online so it isn't too bad, but if all of my classes go fully online it's gonna kinda suck to be paying rent when I'm not required to be in the area. At the same time, though, I like having my own space and I've been in my childhood bedroom since March so I appreciate the opportunity to be someone else lol. Also luckily all of the rules for living on campus and the precautions they take for the dorms won't apply to me, so that's a bonus and has put my mind at ease since I won't be having to share a bathroom with many people/worry about coming into contact with so many people for the entire day.",

      "text": "For some background: I attend a small, prestigious, VERY RICH (seventh-highest endowment per student of any college in the United States) liberal arts college in the northeast. The college is extremely residential; 97% of students live on-campus, and all students are guaranteed on-campus housing all four years. Living on-campus is an important part of social life. Here is what\u2019s happening:\n\n- First-Years, sophomores, seniors who studied abroad last year, new AND returning transfers, and international students invited back. Seniors doing a thesis which would be very hard/impossible to do without off-campus materials, students with circumstances that make remote learning very difficult, and any student who feels they have extreme circumstances that require them to be on-campus were allowed to apply for permission to return. \n- All students are living in singles \n- All students required to wear masks everywhere except their dorm rooms. \n- All students have the option of continuing remote learning, and all faculty + staff members have the option of returning. Virtually all classes can be accessed by students who continue studying remotely.\n- ~2/3 of classes in a \u201cHyFlex\u201d mode, where the class is taught in-person for everyone on-campus and people off-campus can tune in simultaneously. ~1/3 of classes fully remote, as a result of classes with over 35 students (not very many of those) and professors who opt to teach remotely. \n- Students don\u2019t have access to dorms other than the ones they are living in (and they are not allowed to go into other dorms) \n- All areas will be frequently sanitized \n- Student-To-Bathroom ratio reduced to 7:1\n- All students will be tested twice a week, there are multiple hundred quarantine/isolation rooms across three dorms and two local hotels (including one the college owns) for only 1200-1250 students on-campus\n- Students are not allowed to leave campus except in emergencies or to pick up prescriptions/something of that nature (all students must notify Student Affairs and develop a plan; they are putting a convenience store in the campus center to minimize need to travel off-campus)\n- You can\u2019t gather in groups of more than nine. \n- All students have to physically distance and wear masks everywhere\n- All students must download a contact tracing app\n- Dining is on a grab-and-go model where you place your order in advanced and select a pick-up time\n- There is plexiglass virtually everywhere where contact between students and faculty/staff is necessary, etc. \n- 20 outdoor tents equipped with special technology for classes, since the virus has a much harder time spreading outdoors (this is why we did not see significant COVID-19 spikes with the BLM protests, but we see many cases pop up from bars). All students encouraged to study, socialize, and eat outside with friends.\n- Classes starting two weeks earlier than initially planned, ending the week before Thanksgiving. Reading Period (week of no classes before finals) + Finals Week held remotely. This allows for them not to have to deal with the logistical issue of sending all students home and bringing them back, and allows for outdoor interactions to be maximized (much less time in cold New England weather).\n\nAnd I do think there will be measures to prevent students from breaking the rules besides honor code, because they have invested so much in reopening (they have taken $110 Million from the endowment, which is roughly $60K per student), and hired many individuals to help keep campus life safe, that I would think they have invested too much to have it all thrown away by students who break the rules. It would have been much cheaper for them to have just continued remote learning entirely or open without precautions and deal with a potential lawsuit later. They have hired several nurses/doctors, a contact tracing manager, several contact tracing professionals, and an infectious diseases expert.",

A lot of it could be our HyFlex classes, because I read in an Inside Higher Ed article that most universities rejected it because it cost roughly $8K PER CLASS to implement.\n\nAlso, they are partnering with an outside organization called 2U to significantly increase remote learning quality, so that could also contribute to it.",

They're scheduling classes so that they're held from 7am-9pm every M-F, with the possibility of dipping into Saturday if necessary.\n\nI'm a little pissed about this because I only have 3 lecture classes this semester, and only 2 are on campus. They already shortened classes to give us 5 extra minutes traveling between classes, which is great. I'm mad because my 2 classes on campus already have an hour of separation between the end and start time, so I don't know what else could be done without screwing up my schedule completely. If anything major changes it could impact my work availability and availability for practicum field work that still needs to be assigned. Changes are supposed to begin in 2 hours and I'm pretty worried tbh",

Firstly, all classes are gonna be in person (but they said they could possibly make some hybrid classes part online part in person), they did mandate masks but only in public, they\u2019ve been very avoidant of the question about how people in dorms and stuff should stay safe. They mentioned that students are gonna have to take a daily survey about any possible symptoms (there\u2019s no way to enforce this or to make people not just lie). They said if you get it that you have to quarantine but that would be hard in dorms. They also have not mentioned anything about parties at all and people sure as hell aren\u2019t gonna be masking up there lmao. A lot of people on my college\u2019s subreddit believe that they\u2019re gonna have in person classes for a few weeks just so they could bait us into paying full price then move everything online. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen then there are gonna be big spreading events, halloweekend is gonna be the worst. Students from colleges all over the state and some out of staters coke to my school for Halloween, not to mention that thanksgiving break is just a few weeks later where people will take it home or maybe even bring it back for the 2 weeks we come back to school till winter break. It\u2019s gonna be absolutely awful honestly. But Oxford seems confident the vaccine they\u2019re working in will be done in September and mass produced by oct-nov so I guess we\u2019ll see",

      "text": "My school finally sent out its full (and mostly-complete) plan, and IMO it's looking about as solid as it could be without just going fully online.\n\n- We're not required to wear masks in our own dorms (seriously what on earth!?), but masks are on anytime we're outside them, whether that's in a common area, somebody else's dorm, or even outside if we're not certain that we can maintain a six-foot distance.  The exceptions to the mask rule are when we're actively eating (the dining hall will be open, but with severely limited capacity, extended operating hours, and an expanded to-go option), or in certain classrooms which are large enough to keep a six-foot distance (There's only like three of those on-campus though, and they're generally pretty packed when class is in session, so I suspect this won't be as helpful as it would be otherwise.)\n\n- All classes are in-person by default, but people with high-risk medical conditions have had the opportunity to inform people about them to get their classes switched to hybrid or fully online, with the Provost determining if a class needs to take further measures as the semester continues.  Students are expected to be in-person as much as is safely possible, though.  \n\n- The campus library and the various lounges are all staying open.  They haven't said anything about the fitness center, but I could honestly see it going either way.  They're also setting up a bunch of outdoor tents for an additional place to socialize.\n\n- We'll be taking our temperature and submitting a screening checklist every day before leaving the dorms.  I don't imagine that the checklist will actually do much, but the mandated temperature screenings will make me feel a little safer assuming somebody's actually keeping track of who's doing them and who isn't.\n\n- The college is providing hand sanitizer and Lysol wipes for us to clean our desks and whatnot with before and after classes - I'll appreciate this more if it's actually enforced, but honestly I feel like it'll be pretty 50/50 as to whether or not a professor cares enough to bother with it.\n\n- All students are being told not to come if they've been in contact with someone who's tested positive in the last two weeks (unless they got a negative test), and are being requested to self-isolate for one week before returning.  Students from the most highly-infected states must have a negative test result from within 7-10 days of returning to campus, and must self-isolate from the time the test was conducted to the time they arrive on campus.\n\n- As with a lot of other schools, our schedule has been compressed; we're beginning the semester a week earlier than was planned, they've eliminated fall break, and we're all going home after Thanksgiving to do finals online in the first week of December.  This one is honestly the worst part for me; three months straight is going to *suck*.",

Masks are required everywhere besides the dorm rooms. If you test positive, you have to quarantine in another building for two weeks. Tested periodically throughout the semester. Gym is closed as of now and dining hall will be limited capacity.\n\nHonestly, I think my college has been pretty good about coronavirus. Around 80% of my college is from NY and NY as a whole has been doing very well with case numbers. I am cautiously optimistic that I'm going to have an uninterrupted semester. The combination of going to a small school in a state with good numbers is giving me some good vibes.",

However, reading the other comments here, some schools seem to be putting much tighter restrictions and closures in place, and at that point I think I'd just take the semester off, or even the whole year. College only lasts a few years, and I want to get the most out of it that I can, and there's a certain point at which it would feel like a waste to me - a waste of time, money, and happiness - to be spending a whole semester or whole year in college with none of the enjoyment that is supposed to come with it. I'm not going to college so I can sit around in my dorm all day, and I wouldn't be going to college if the most I could get out of it were comparable to the least.",

      "text": "You should just go to a community college. It doesnt sound like you will get any college experience over there so there is no point shelling out thousands for a restricted and isolated time. Just make sure you credits transfer. \n\nChances are, if someone over there gets sick they may shut the whole school down and it will just be a repeat of spring semester. I was lucky because I was already living at home going to a community college and honestly the only difference between my quarantine education  and my university friends is that mine is cheaper.\n\nI dont want to scare or discourage you, but I dont want you to waste money on a terrible college experience and end up getting sick by some chance anyways.\n\nRight now, my community college is giving us the option hybrid classes. Because its a community college only like 6-10 students will be in a classroom social distanced with masks. Then the other half show up another day while the other half watches online. This is mostly for the science lab students, technical students like welding and stuff, and maybe dancing and other stuff thats hard to do at home. Non Stem classes like history and english the majority are online with one or two hybrid courses, in case one absolutely cannot function in an online class. All hybrid courses have virtual lectures, though I often find myself struggling to pay attention.\n\nCurrently, Im a student tutor there, so I tutor virtually through zoom. Took some time getting used to, but hey, it works.\n\nTo wrap things up I say seriously consider going to a community college. Like even in social terms its better, because its not like you live there. You can do whatever you want inbetween or after classes because the RA will not be watching you (Since there is no RA!) Mind you we are in a pandemic so dont go crazy, but if you social distance, wear your MASKS, and be mindful you should be okay.\n\nTips: Take stairs to avoid touching elevator buttons and standing in a covid petri dish. Bring disinfectant wipes, you dont know how healthy the guy sitting in your seat previously was. Bring an extra mask just in case you lose or drop yours. Wear gloves when necessary, like if im walking down the stairs i must absolutely hold on to the stairwell so I dont trip and die not sure about you. BE CAREFUL AROUND BATHROOMS, like touching stall doors and handles, and entrance doors. HAND SANITIZER! Becareful around your friends, you dont know where they been, its not like everyone is being careful or else Covid would not be this bad in the first place. If you have barely been outside like me then I recommend practicing or going over how you will function outside (like getting gas, shopping, etc), not sure about you but I havent done any of these since March when I was allowed outside my neighborhood unsuperivsed\n\nHey, im starting my second year of college this fall. I know decisions like these are not easy. I wish you a smooth as possible college year and hopefully spring or next college year will be lit.",

At the very least they're limiting dormitories to one person per room--although, given how contagious covid is that wont do jack shit if a cluster begin--and limiting in person operations to only 1,200 a day? Don't worry though, they're supplying all students who return to campus with a free thermometer--hopefully the rectal type--and expect them to self diagnose symptoms.\n\nOkay, so now that I've explained the plan which wont work. Where I live we are currently accepting COVID patients from two separate states because they're both going full blown YEEHAW instead of listening to professionals. We are slowly depleting ICU capacity and will likely result in a shutdown again. My university made this \"plan\" such that they can just \"shutdown\" and blame it on the governor. They're making it look like the professors have the decision but that decision must be passed onto admin for \"approval\". This is their \"plan\" to shift the blame and hopefully get away with a quick money grab.\n\nSo to sum it up, there is no plan for the virus. They had 4 months to implement better telecommunication and utilize innovation to ensure students can return in the fall. They're trying to act like we're so \"strong\" or \"resilient\" but overall they spent more time describing how their budget is being cut instead of having a legitimate plan.",

My ultimate goal in double majoring in these two subjects is to become an epidemiologist, which is someone who studies the spread of diseases.
