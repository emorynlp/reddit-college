He was just at his computer and also working on stuff at his lectern. He looked kinda pale, but I thought nothing of it. Just as I was finishing the multiple choice questions, he collapsed and was holding his stomach. A couple of us ran over and tried to help. I\u2019ll never forget that scene. He was saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not telling you guys.\u201d and other variations. I didn\u2019t hear what he was saying because I ran straight to security begging for help. \n\nOnce we got there, another prof told us the truth. He has pancreatic cancer and didn\u2019t want to admit it. He\u2019s 63, and pretty healthy. It kinda makes sense because he kept adjusting his suit jacket while teaching because he was developing stomach bloating. It\u2019s been on my mind ever since. I\u2019ll hopefully see him in the morning. \n\nHas anyone ever dealt with this? I\u2019m scheduled to have him next semester.

You woulda thought he was a janitor and not a professor tbh, from the way he dressed to the way he talked. You could tell he lived an interesting life before he decided to go back to school for physics. We got tight because I felt a little like an outsider to all of the STEM students and I could tell he felt like an outsider with all the STEM professors.\n\nI ended up taking physics II with him the next semester (spring 2020). The weeks leading up to spring break I could tell his health was going a little downhill and he was talking to me differently. Pretty much told me he was dying. Idk who knew but it seemed like I was one of the only people he had told. The last thing I said to him was \u201csee ya in a week\u201d as I turned my exam in and left for spring break.\n\nCOVID got real halfway through that week and we never came back from spring break. 2 weeks later online classes started and he couldn\u2019t keep up since he hardly ever used technology.

Ultimately, the department took over our class and our assignments were split up and graded among other faculty. \n\nHe got sick towards the end of the semester. At 96, I felt bad that his final days teaching were spent on Zoom and that he would likely die with the world looking like this. He seems to have rebounded from his health issues, but they\u2019re not longer allowing him to teach full courses.

There have also been a couple of more minor collapsed-in-class incidents, too: twice now I think I\u2019ve had kids just pass out (and admittedly I was that kid once when I was an undergrad), somebody else had a seizure, handful of people with panic attacks, etc. Now that I\u2019m tallying it up it\u2019s actually been quite a few, geez. \n\nI got lucky with my own profs, I guess?

They're still human like us and get sick, but I noticed most don't take off at all during the semester or much at all.
