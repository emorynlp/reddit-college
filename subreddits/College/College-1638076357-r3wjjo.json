  "text": "First year in college here! It\u2019s been a wild ride. Dealing with some mental health issues, talking to people for the first time since quarantine, and of course classes, it hasn\u2019t been an easy go. I have four classes this semester, two being A\u2019s, one being a B, and one a C. The C class, my philosophy class, is one I\u2019m really worried about. I went into philosophy not knowing about it and wanting to try something new, but I soon realized philosophy is just not for me. I cant do the big analyzing that my professor expects us to do, and I just don\u2019t come to the same conclusions that he does. I brought up my concerns about my grade to him a month or so ago, and he reassured me that closer to the end of the semester more grades will come in and bring my grade up. Except, that hasn\u2019t happened. We\u2019ve had assignments, sure, but he just hasn\u2019t graded anything. I\u2019m trying to give him the benefit of the doubt because he got very sick for a few weeks as did I, but I hate having to worry about this so much. I have a meeting with him on monday because I asked if we could make a plan to finish off strong, but I\u2019d like to go in knowing what to say or ask. Any advice?",
