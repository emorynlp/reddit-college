She 100% agreed that this was not right, and she has informed me that my school will handle the situation. I want to say thank you to everyone; I initially was unsure of what to do in this situation but the majority of you all encouraged reporting my professor, which I believe is the right choice.",

You aren\u2019t allowed to send out a list of marks at all, even if you use registration numbers rather than names. Each student must be emailed their mark individually. I lecture in Ireland and we have a clear policy on this. Personally, I think that the only person entitled to know your mark is you - this isn\u2019t a competition, it\u2019s education. The public return of marks only happened to me once as an undergrad: we agreed afterwards that we didn\u2019t like it, I spoke to the lecturer, and he apologised the following week. Never happened again.",

I emailed him and he claimed it was department policy not to release actual grades. I ended up getting a B. What a douche. \n\nI still thought his teaching was pretty good so I recommended my girlfriend take a class from him five years later. Apparently he had gotten so bad that she passed the class with a C+ having gotten something like 21% on the midterm. If she hadn\u2019t passed it would\u2019ve set her back a year due to prerequisites.\n\nAnd one more thing, in the class I thought I had failed, the one time I was a few minutes late to class apparently he must have told everyone that we could have a cheat sheet on the midterm, because I showed up being the only person without one.",

Depending on her response you could also bring it up to someone else higher up. There\u2019s also a slim chance that she might not have realised that students would feel uncomfortable with her sharing their grades, but I doubt that was the case",

Let\u2019s see how your professor likes it when they\u2019re the one to be exposed.\n\nPS: Even if there\u2019s no way to hide your name, DON\u2019T WORRY. Prof can\u2019t fail you further, and even they do, THEM RECEIVINNG CONSEQUENCES IS MORE IMPORTANT.\n\nI\u2019m really angry.",
