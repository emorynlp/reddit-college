Im Native American doing a Native American studies masters program. But I don't have a tribe nor grew up on the rez. everyone ignores me. one of my bosses is being extremely stand offish towards me. I feel there's a camaraderie with growing up on the Rez but I didn't. so people don't include me in things.\n\n I didn't know what race I was for my whole life. I was so excited to take the DNA test and find out and finally have a people/race. then I realized they don't care about me.  Also they rep one tribe more than others despite saying all indigenous are welcome. they play favorites when it comes to tribes. \n\nits only the 3rd week of the semester and im feeling so isolated and alone. also my job says Its not guaranteed that Ill be able to get  thanksgiving OR Christmas off. I miss my family so much. I want to cry every day. im thinking of going back home and trying to get into a closer school that will actually welcome me. or maybe give up on my masters and get a job.\n\nwhat should I do? please. im so alone and homesick.", "author": "thatchthepirate", "created": 1632045973, "retrieved": 1632801427, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"hdho0au": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr57vu/not_being_respected_and_thinking_of_going_home/hdho0au/", "text": "I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm not indigenous or native American. I am biracial and I have experienced serious racism as a kid from different parts of my own family though. So all I can say is keep your chin up- be civil. Finish what you have started if you can manage it. I think ultimately you will regret quitting your program when you look back on this. If this Master's degree is your passion do not let them quell it. Try to get some mental health help from your school resources if you can and try your best to mix with other groups to find some good friends. You need humans on your side and if you can't find that in your immediate vicinity look elsewhere to emotionally support you.
