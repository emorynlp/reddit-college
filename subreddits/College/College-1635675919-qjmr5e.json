Also is grammarly Premium worthwhile?\n\nI used it in one section of my assignment and it registered no plagiarism however a second text of mine registered 23 unreferenced sources but i wasnt able to see these w/o paying.\n\nAny tips? I want to make my assignments as plagiarism free as possible but also on a broke budget.",

      "text": "You shouldn't ever need a plagiarism checker if you're doing the work without copying. Also, I'd recommend Grammarly simply for its spell check and grammar correction capacity. I've used it for two out of the three total assignments for my course, which got me A's in both. In my experience, people can have horrendous grammar and organization; it helps.",

Their claims of \u201cdeep searches\u201d and \u201caccuracy\u201d are false because 99% of my work came up with no matches. \n\nAs long as you didn\u2019t copy work from other sources, paraphrased well, and cited both paraphrases and quotes, the potential for plagiarism shouldn\u2019t be a worry.",
