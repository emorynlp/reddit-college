  "title:": "Is my professor denying my accommodations or was it just awkward phrasing?",
  "text": "I have a chronic stomach illness that I have accommodations for. They are: the ability to take a break/leave class and come back, and I have flexible attendance. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI finally got my accommodations a few weeks ago, but regardless, I have been extremely good about attending my government professor's class this semester (he offers 10 unexcused days, I used one before accommodations) and I used my first accommodation day last Monday. I'm sick again today and I emailed him about an hour before class (my advisor told me at least thirty minutes before) to let him know and ask what I should go over to be aptly prepared for Wednesday. He emailed me back within five minutes saying this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs it happens, I am currently accommodating another student so you can log onto the Collaborate session and participate from there. If you do so, I will count your attendance. If not, I will count the absence as unexcused unless it requires a doctor's visit or your symptoms are similar to COVID. Or, if you want to fail the wellness screening which will initiate a COVID accommodation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have to go to the doctor for my accommodation absence to count, and I don't have COVID so I'm obviously not getting tested or failing the screening. But, I do understand that attendance flexibility can be a tricky thing for a professor. So, what can I say in response to this? I'm attending online today, and I'm glad to have the option, but I guess I feel like I should say something to him about my accommodations because of how he phrased everything? I can't even tell if what he said technically violates my accommodations, and he's typically a chill guy so I don't want to immediately bring it up with the Disability Service. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I should email him and remind him that I have accommodations, but I can't even imagine how I would phrase that and I'm not even sure if I should. Should I just leave it?",

      "text": "It is usually best to approach things with the assumption there is a misunderstanding rather than being accusatory. I'm assuming your accommodations allow you to opt out of online attendance as well, but you are choosing to attend anyway? A good formula for approaching this would be to:\n\n1. Start off by greeting the professor and state you are enjoying the class, want to succeed, and understand that attendance is necessary for this.\n2. Remind them that you have accommodations in a non-accusatory fashion, as if they honestly forgot.\n3. State that you accommodations relieve you from online participation. You do not have to explain WHY they do, nor should you.\n4. Again state you wish to participate and succeed in class, which is why you are in attendance online, but because of health issues you sometimes may not be able to.\n5. Thank the professor for their attention and understanding\n\nYou should probably discuss this with either the department chair or disability services. The professor may be a nice guy, but the response is not acceptable. Maybe they just need a reminder.",

      "text": "I would tell him. You may have to at some stage anyway if you need to take some more time off. Just be polite and friendly, as like you mentioned, he may not know or may just need to be reminded :) \n\nI would say something like \u2018good afternoon/morning professor, thank you for your reply. Due to a chronic health issue, I have been granted accomodations to leave class and have flexible attendance in my classes when needed. I am happy to provide evidence if needed.   \nI will still do my best to do all work and be in class when possible. Thank you for your understanding.\u2018 \n\nif he refuses to accept this, then seeing the disability services would be a good idea. Goodluck !",

      "text": "If you get 10 unexcused days, you get them regardless of accommodations.  Everyone gets 10 days (which is rather generous).  Your unexcused days count the same as everyone else.  The difference being if you need more, you can probably have more.\n\nSecond - clarifying with your professor (like he may have shot off a quick email so you could make the other session without having all his records immediately accessible, he may have made an honest mistake) and talking like an adult human to the other human in the equation hardly ever goes amiss.\n\nDisability office is going to tell you to do that first anyway.",
