  "text": "In order to graduate (in 3 weeks), I had to take a test that has no bearing on my gpa and is admittedly not comprehensive or indicative of academic performance. We're not told how we scored, but if we're in the top 10%, we'll get notified at some point that we get some distinction thing attached to our graduation title. I only learned about the test and the honorifics after ordering graduation announcements, thinking that my class ranking and GPA were what determined those distinctions or highest honors or whatever. This is something that really matters to me and it is really bothering me that I don't know how I did and that something so arbitrary determines those honors, not our actual performance across the entire program.",

It's not that much more work to send one extra email, so we're not sitting here wondering for weeks.",
