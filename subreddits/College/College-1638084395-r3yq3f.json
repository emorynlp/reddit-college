      "text": "It seems like it\u2019s that time of year, there\u2019s been quite a few posts like these popping up in this sub. It\u2019s natural to feel disappointed about failing a course. It sucks, and I speak from personal experience. You\u2019re not the first student to fail and you won\u2019t be the last, everyone will experience a failure in one way or another in education. You\u2019re not alone. Heck, I\u2019m currently also stressed about my courses and if I might fail. What helps me is to remember that at the end of the day, it\u2019s just a class. And while that might feel like the only thing that matters, it\u2019s not. You\u2019re just in the thick of college stress, which is understandable since as a student these classes are your life. But classes can be retaken, majors can be changed, bad days or even semesters happen, and odds can be beat. Don\u2019t give up on yourself for one or even five failed classes. It\u2019s just a class. Pick yourself up, you got this",
