  "text": "for my school, we were just told we can go to the gym without making an appointment. We still need to do the campus pass stuff, temperature check, etc but we aren\u2019t stuck there for an hour tops. \n\nAnd now we have various stations. We don\u2019t have a dining hall this semester only takeout, but we\u2019ve transitioned to them occasionally having make your own bars, like a wing bar or a make your own donut bar.\n\nI do think they\u2019ll lift more restrictions next semester but anything\u2019s possible.",
