They all live on the same floor as me in my dorm and when I asked one of them about housing he said that he doesn\u2019t know what he wants to do or who he wants to live with. And now since my roommate is apart of the apartment deal I don\u2019t know what to do. It feels awkward and I keep on tearing up when I think about cause it stresses me out. Also being in my dorm now just reminds me that I have no clue what I\u2019m doing next year.", "author": "14475553", "created": 1632632128, "retrieved": 1632800280, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {}}
