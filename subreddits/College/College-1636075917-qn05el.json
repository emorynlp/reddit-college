  "text": "I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just in my college or if it\u2019s like this everywhere but why are people so apprehensive about sharing notes? I\u2019ve been in 2 classes where we have an independent student discord (no professor monitoring) and whenever someone asks for notes no one replies. I\u2019ve posted notes a couple times, it takes like 3 mins to snap a few pics.\n\nIt\u2019s really not that hard, do people not wanna do it cuz \u201cI had to suffer thru class, I\u2019m not gonna help you cuz you didn\u2019t suffer\u201d cuz that\u2019s kinda petty, it doesn\u2019t take anything away to share notes. It\u2019d make more sense to pool together notes so we can pick up where there\u2019s holes in each other\u2019s learning, work together and beat the system.\n\nIdk I\u2019m just wondering what the mindset is, it\u2019s very minor I just get really perplexed as to why people do the things they do",

If you want information, come to class and obtain it. No one spoon feeds me the key concepts, I learn that by going to class. I\u2019m not going to give someone notes just because they don\u2019t want to go to class, cause news flash, no one wants to go.",

      "text": "Idk I've never been one to be stingy. If I can help, happy to. I had a couple classes where the whole lecture class (maybe around 100 ish students) would contribute to a group study guide for exams. It was super nice. Then I had other classes where people were stingy with notes.\n\nEditing to add: it's not harming me in any way to help others out. They still have to study and retain information and it's not extra work for me to let them take pictures of the notes",

      "text": "There is no reason not to give someone your notes. People sometimes miss lectures and you can never tell if they genuinely couldn't come to some lectures or are slacking off. Everyone gives their notes to friends but are apprehensive about giving them to strangers which I find selfish. Being socially incompetent shouldn't fuck over your academic success so I try to help people as much as possible.",
