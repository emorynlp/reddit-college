  "text": "Does anyone else really struggle with vague essay prompts? I know that my ADHD obviously has a lot to do with this, but it is causing a not-so-great start to my freshman year. Does anyone have any tips for coming up with ideas when the prompt is really broad and/or vague? The current example of this for me is \"discuss how microaggressions impede the way(s) we communicate\" for a Liberal Studies course (It's a gen. ed and while the professor is really chill and I love the class, these two-page 'response' assignments are going to tank my GPA. Also I know I'm biased as a psych major, but I really do not appreciate having to use MLA formatting. I understand that this is a LBST class, I've just gotten so excited about APA \ud83d\ude2d)\n\nAnyway, any general thoughts on how to research or come up with or whatever for ideas when a prompt is really broad and general would be so, so appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Not vague, open-ended. That's the word I was looking for, but for the life of me I could not think of it last night \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

      "text": "The problem with well defined problems is that, outside of Academia, *they don't exist.* Like it or not, we live in a vague world where nothing is cut and dry, so you'll need to get used to responding to vague and unstructured problems eventually. I'm sure you'd rather do it within the insulation of the academic world rather than your first day on the job. \n\nAs to your point on MLA, get used to it. Being asked to use multiple formats is *also* something you'll need to get used to. Not everything you do will be exclusively within your field of study, which means there will be alternative requirements set out for you.",

      "text": "I don't think that's a vague prompt ; it's open-ended , but it's about specific topics.  You'll hopefully have some examples from course material.  If the goal of the assignment is for you to think through and evaluate the connections, then that prompt is as clear as you're getting. \n\nYou can also ask your instructor for topic approval. Like, \" I was thinking of focusing on the ways that misgendering a person, even accidentally, can cause a person to fear for their safety- do you think that's a good fit?\" \n\nAnd of course, always frame it as \" I'm having a hard time understanding\" rather than telling an instructor their assignments are unclear. Don't wanna poke their ego issues too much.",
