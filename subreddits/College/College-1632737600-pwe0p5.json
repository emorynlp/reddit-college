I'm taking a philosophy foundation course, and it uses Canvas as the main medium. So, I had a 4 sentence paper due, and umm...I procrastinated all weekend and started doing the paper early morning when it was due at 3. Usually, it's easy for me to do it in around 2 hours, but I just couldn't for the life of me find an argument to refute (that was the assignment).\n\nI finished my assignment like a minute before the deadline and was happily submitting it when google docs said that my sync was not on and I was offline. Lost some of my progress, and had to write it again, so I got a full 5-6 minutes late. The assignment closed, and I couldn't submit it. I emailed my TF the doc, but I have a feeling that the Prof and the TF are quite anal about things like this. This paper counts for 2.5% of my grade, so how fucked am I?", "author": "Cinnabonbutterfly03", "created": 1632737600, "retrieved": 1632800212, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"heibyig": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwe0p5/can_someone_please_tell_me_how_much_this_is_going/heibyig/", "text": "2.5% ??
