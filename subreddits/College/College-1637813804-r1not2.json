There, you\u2019ll learn about a variety of things and be able to refine your area of interest. Some schools don\u2019t have any sort of \u201ccore\u201d curriculum, but it can actually be helpful to get some sort of core education.  Knowing a little bit of English reading/writing skills is often helpful.",
