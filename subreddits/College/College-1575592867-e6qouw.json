  "title:": "Would it be weird to give a campus store worker a Christmas gift?",
  "text": "EDIT 2: May you stumble across this post at a later time, or if you were at all wondering how this turned out, I posted an update here: https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ed27re/update_i_gave_the_older_man_who_works_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf \n\nThere\u2019s an older man who works in the campus store I frequent. He\u2019s so friendly and bright all the time, and always greets me (and others, I presume) as \u201cfriend\u201d, like \u201chi friend!\u201d or \u201cgood to see you again friend!\u201d It\u2019s always very heartwarming.\n\nWould it be weird to get him a gift, like a gift card? I don\u2019t like giving gift cards, but I don\u2019t know much about him and I feel like a gift card might make more sense in this situation. \n\nBut would that be a weird thing to do? Should I just stick to a card, or would that be weird too? I\u2019ve had a really, really rough time transitioning to college, but he\u2019s basically always the positive interaction I can count on. Sometimes I don\u2019t even really want anything from the store, but I\u2019ll buy some candy just because he\u2019s a nice guy.\n\nEDIT: wasn\u2019t expecting this many comments! (I realize there aren\u2019t that many but... still). I think I\u2019m gonna go with the idea of a mug filled with candy, although I\u2019m really busy so I\u2019ll just go with a small gift card for some coffee if I don\u2019t have time before Christmas. I\u2019ll post an update in a week or whenever, thanks everyone!",

It would be a great token of appreciation and probably make him feel really great :D you could maybe bake a cake/cookies (bc homemade stuff is always nice haha and like, maybe it's been a long time since he's had something homemade? Lol) or just buy the cake/cookies. The mug idea is great too :D also, a card of some sort just makes the whole thing wayyy better. Don't forget to include something about how he's helped/why you appreciate him.\n\nTbh, this reminds me of how two of the staff/groundsmen at my school died suddenly due to being run down by cars. They were always so helpful and friendly and I'd known them my whole school life! I never got to say goodbye or thank them :(",

You can also make it with water or milk with your preferences. And best of all, you can decide how strong you want it (for those who don't want too much sweet.)  I would love a mug filled with dark chocolate kit kats, don't get me wrong. I just know most times I offer a sweet, an older person takes one and says it's too much. Just sharing my experience with that. \n\nGift cards can be good too.",
