He\u2019s so friendly and bright all the time, and always greets me (and others, I presume) as \u201cfriend\u201d, like \u201chi friend!\u201d or \u201cgood to see you again friend!\u201d It\u2019s always very heartwarming.\n\nWould it be weird to get him a gift, like a gift card? I don\u2019t like giving gift cards, but I don\u2019t know much about him and I feel like a gift card might make more sense in this situation. \n\nBut would that be a weird thing to do? Should I just stick to a card, or would that be weird too? I\u2019ve had a really, really rough time transitioning to college, but he\u2019s basically always the positive interaction I can count on. Sometimes I don\u2019t even really want anything from the store, but I\u2019ll buy some candy just because he\u2019s a nice guy.\n\nEDIT: wasn\u2019t expecting this many comments! (I realize there aren\u2019t that many but... still). I think I\u2019m gonna go with the idea of a mug filled with candy, although I\u2019m really busy so I\u2019ll just go with a small gift card for some coffee if I don\u2019t have time before Christmas. I\u2019ll post an update in a week or whenever, thanks everyone!", "author": "coolfishes", "created": 1575592867, "retrieved": 1632802509, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 870, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f9vhtm5": {"link": "/r/college/comments/e6qouw/would_it_be_weird_to_give_a_campus_store_worker_a/f9vhtm5/", "text": "Dude working a job where customers get me gifts is one of the greatest feelings.
