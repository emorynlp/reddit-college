      "text": "I graduated last year but wanted to weigh in with some advice. \n\nHold yourself accountable. Don\u2019t make excuses to professors if you fail to make deadlines due to bad time management or bad habits like a poor sleep schedule. Don\u2019t be a teacher\u2019s pet for the wrong reasons. If you go to see a professor regularly to make excuses, that\u2019s a sign your being irresponsible and need to rethink how your dealing with school (and your relationship with that professor). \n\nDon\u2019t overload on extracurriculars. I\u2019d say 2-3 is enough. Choose maybe one that would look good resume and a second you\u2019d actually enjoy.\n\nDo Internships. Most entry level jobs prefer experience now. This time is precious, don\u2019t wait to look for internships. \n\nHandle the newfound freedom responsibly. Get your work done on time, get on a reasonable sleep schedule, look into possibly getting a part-time job for spending money and don\u2019t be a spendthrift with your parent\u2019s money. \n\nMost importantly, enjoy it. This time will go buy fast. Find a social circle and make some good memories with them, or at least as much as you can during a pandemic.",

I'm not saying not to stay up super late with roommates playing league or not to binge watch your favorite show, but I think it's really important to explore and experience as much adventure as you possibly can during your time in college. Don't be afraid to go get lunch with friends, explore the nearest big city or go to the beach. There's only so much time that you have to be able to consider yourself as a student; take advantage of the time that you have and try to appreciate all the time you have",

I\u2019m glad to almost be done, but I feel like I\u2019m going to fail my boards because it was hard.\n\nAs for freshman and sophomore\u2019s, i think it made people feel isolated. I didn\u2019t really talk to any body and make friends the first 3 years, I showed up, learned, then went home. But I know a lot of people make friends in college\nFrom my perspective I think the only thing that was missed was in person classes and being able to socialize.",

      "text": "There are so many good comments, here are just two pieces of advice I haven't seen:\n\n1-- Find out if there is a local domestic violence victim agency, and skim over their services. There are so, so many ways they can help, and you don't want to be scrambling when you're in a situation (someone flashes you in a parking lot, you or a friend think their drink was drugged, someone is harassing or stalking or abusing you, or god forbid, you or someone you know are raped or sexually assaulted). You want to know who you can call and what they can do BEFORE an emergency. They typically offer tons of services-- support groups, advocates who can come with you to the hospital or court, hotlines where you can safety plan, confidential shelters. Services are FREE and they want to help. \n\n2-- Keep your head down in class. I was argumentative and sassy and my grades suffered. College professors can have massive egos, but you're paying to be there, you're paying to have those grades on a transcript. Just keep your head down, regurgitate whatever your professor wants you to write down as the correct answer, and do your own research and critical thinking when the stakes are lower.",

I deeply regret not exploring my college town more.\n\n2) You ever see Yes Man? Do that as often as possible. Just show up to shit. There's too much I regret not doing and nothing I regret doing. Take any and every opportunity available cause it can and will lead to something cool.\n\n3) Keep making friends. I've got people I've been tight with since freshman year, but I have equally deep relationships if not deeper with people who I met as recently as this past year. Meet as many people as possible and keep in touch with the ones worth keeping. \n\n4) Your freezer is your best friend. 30-40 bucks at BJ's or Costco nets me dinners for close to a semester. Chicken and pork are cheap and defrost pretty easy. Walmart brand garlic powder, chili powder, etc, is pretty cheap. That's at least one healthy, nutritionally dense meal a day, all semester, for the same price you'd spend eating out 3-4 times. \n\nTLDR: Eat good, stay safe, do shit.",

My whole 4.5 years I rarely went to campus for anything else.\n\nI feel it's nicer to have online courses when you want better control of your schedule, asynchronous is great for that, but I think I personally learn better in a classroom. Also, labs are 1,000% better in person. \n\nDepending on your experience, you'll probably do better or mildly enjoy the in person experience more. On the other hand, some may hate it and sign up for online the first chance they get. If you're into campus stuff, or think you might be, you'll likely enjoy it. If not, you did not miss much lol",

      "text": "Try to go out and do things outside! Touristy things, hikes, city center. Or just going out and experiencing life, take time away from school and work as much as you can. That bring said, having chill time is essential too. I worked 2 jobs and went to school full time most semesters in undergrad, but I tried to go out and do something at least once a month, taking a whole day off and doing something. \n\nAlso, doing as many activities as your school offers that you can. I was lucky my university always had some event planned, and it's more accessible than going out of town a lit of the time. You can also meet people, and experience the university culture.\n\nTry to make friends in your major! You will have a lot of the same interests, you'll be closer on campus for some classes - makes it easier to meet up - and it's great to get feedback from someone in your major.",

      "text": "wall of text incoming sorry.\n\n**get a professional email now.** ***firstname.lastname@service.*** maybe some numbers in there. itll do you well when looking at internships/jobs later. Don't use your university email to apply for positions, you might not have access to it after you graduate.\n\nDoing well in classes\n\n* Go to class. I skipped more than my fair share of classes, and wish i hadn't. Sure for larger classes the prof wont remember you weren't there. but for upper level classes of <50 people? you bet theyll remember. Also, you are paying to be there.\n* Do the assignments. If you think you know the material, do the assignment anyways. It might show up verbatim on an exam down the road.\n* Go to office hours, and participate in class. When I was a TA, you know what sucks? not having class interaction. it gives the professor no indication what they are doing is good for the class. Odds are, if you've got a question, someone else in the class as the same one. If you dont fell comfortable in classes asking questions, go to office hours.\n* no shame in getting a tutor, i spent a number of hours in the math lab/writing center.\n* See if the international version of a text book exist. or use the previous versions if possible. This might not work for classes that have online portals (mathmatica, peirs, etc...) and which case you are SOL. I found this tapers off once you are in 300-400 level classes.\n* Set aside time to study, and find what works for you. you might need 10 hours a week for one class, and less than an hour for another. but set aside study time each week. Its better to study a little be each day/each week, then try to cram for an exam the day or two before.  Study groups can help as well, you might get a topic and help some one else that needs your explanation, or vice versa.\n* The rubber duck test always works. If you dont have a study group, explain it to an inanimate object (hence the rubber duck). I found the best way for me to learn something was try to teach it to someone else. Also helps for public speaking.\n* Try to find a place outside of your dorm/apartment for studying. It makes it where \"home\" isn't as stressful, and you separate out those two aspects. The past year of working from home has taught me the benefit of having a separate \"work space\" from \"relaxing space.\" My campus library was open till 3am every day, and 24/7 during exam weeks. Also, you can always find an open class room.\n* **keep your notes.** I still go back an look at notes for work stuff. If you dont think your notes are organized. Do what i did. short hand notes during class, then that evening or after class if you've got a break, rewrite into a coherent way. Do the same thing at the end of the year if youd like. I have every single one of my major classes in a spiral bound with a table of contents. Really helped out when i was a TA. I highly recommend [kokuyo campus notebooks.](https://www.amazon.com/Kokuyo-Campus-Smart-Ring-Binder/dp/B0066LZLEC) and refills/dotted paper/blank pages are available.\n\nGeneral life/social life\n\n* everyone is different, and not everyone will like you. and **that is okay.** People in the same major can make great friends/study partners.\n* Internships are great, try to get one. **DO NOT PAY FOR AN INTERNSHIP, NOR GET AN UNPAID IF YOU CAN HELP IT.** if a place says pay some money to get our supplies, training, whatever. its not worth your time, or is an outright scam. unpaid internships are wack too. This somewhat applies to national collegiate groups as well, they generally don't matter, and Ive never had an employer ask about it.\n* i tried to have friends over once a month to play games/chill. harder to do in a dorm, but maybe a local cafe will let you have a room for a few hours, or find an empty class room.\n* if you want to join the bar scene/greek life. do so, but dont make it your life.\n* take showers and do your laundry for the love of god. please dont show up to class post-workout with all the sweat. its just as distracting as 4 day old unwashed BO. You dont need to wear makeup or be sparkly clean, just dont show up stanky. Beyond those 2 things, literally no one will care what you wear/ look like. \n* if you've got a kitchen, its easier to do dishes as the come up then let them sit and do them at the end of the week. Besides roaches and maggots are gross.\n* Learn to cook if you are able, its generally cheaper and healthier than D-hall. plus its an easy way to make friends/ SO's. Nothing is more attractive than a free *good* meal. Id be happy to share some meals/recipes that I've cooked/continue to cook.\n* start a budget if you dont have one already. If you've got a job to pay the bills, this is great life advice for now and later. If someone is footing your bills for now, great for you, its good to know how much you've got to work with for food/beer/whatever. Being able to know you've got an extra 20 bucks to splurge with is great.\n* If you live off campus, but relatively close (\\~4-5 miles) get a bike, and wear a helmet. Its a great way to get around campus, run to the store, whatever. And you wont have to deal with parking, almost all buildings will have a bike rack right near the entrance. A helmet is important though, I got hit once by a student not paying attention when leaving a parking lot and it saved my life. I had an electric bike, which while pricey did make it easier to get around town. Long boards are another option, and your campus police might have a cheap gps tracker to rent/buy if your bike happens to get stolen.",

However, respect each other and set boundaries.\n* This is not like high school. Everyone is independent and too concerned with themselves to notice you unless you go out of your way to do something. \n* Also the college experience is overrated. Unless you actively seek to be a frat/sorority party animal, it's pretty mundane overall. Don't go in expecting to be the party animal. BUT this is also the age where high school social norms fade away and people are more comfortable expressing their hobbies - so you may be able to find a new friend group that shares a common interest.",

However you need to be realistic with what you ask because at the end of the day, it\u2019s their room too. If your roommate is on speakerphone and you have an 8 AM class, see if they can get headphones or just go downstairs. \n* Unless you need to support yourself or it can lead to more advancement, don\u2019t get a full time job because it\u2019ll be stressful and you\u2019ll have virtually no free time. If you need spending money for stuff like ordering out, there\u2019s other ways. Get a part time or something with flexible hours. \n* If you\u2019re having hookups, be sure to tell your roommate ahead of time, if only out of politeness and so they don\u2019t walk in on anything. I learned this from an RA, but if you do anything while they\u2019re in the room and they don\u2019t know about it, it can count as sexual misconduct because they technically didn\u2019t consent. L\n* I\u2019m somebody with OCD/anxiety disorder and depression, and counseling is important. Only be warned that at many schools, counseling is often booked up or they give mostly short term solutions. If you\u2019re stressed about a particular class or if you\u2019re grieving they help in that regard, but if you think your problem is bigger than that, see if you can find a therapist in the area or if they can recommend you for one. \n* It\u2019s easy to go from casually drinking at a party to having a drinking problem. Know your limit and never drive under the influence. \n* When you first meet your roommate, be honest. And don\u2019t just say \u201cI\u2019m messy\u201d because chances are your definition varies from your roommate\u2019s. For example, I\u2019m messy. By \u201cmessy\u201d I mean I\u2019m a slob who doesn\u2019t know how to budget my time, but if you say it\u2019s an issue, at least let me know because chances are I legitimately forgot; I don\u2019t leave food out however. My initial roommates were \u201cmessy\u201d clean freaks so that led into a lot of problems. \n* You will change when you get to college. When I first started dorming, I thought I was gonna be a social butterfly and leave the door open to speak to people. But as I started attending classes, I realized I was always surrounded by people, even to use the bathroom, so I found being in my room by myself for an hour to be a virtual luxury.",

A good group of friends is like a rock that can help you through college both academically and socially because even. If you\u2019re an introvert like me, everyone needs someone they can depend on. I still keep in touch with my friends from undergrad over Discord and we have been planning times we can see each other in person again. \n\nThe same goes for classes. Don\u2019t let pride stop you from going to the professor either after class or during office hours and admitting you are confused. If they are a good teacher, they will help you. Even shitty teachers were able to point me in the right direction before. \n\nAlso, if you have problems like test anxiety, ADHD, etc. don\u2019t be afraid to ask about accommodations. They saved my ass starting in Junior Year. \n\nIn addition, remember that on campus housing is way overpriced and finding an off campus option within walking or bussing distance is usually for the best. And exploring campus, finding study nooks, and exploring the town around campus for hangout spots and cool shops is a lot of fun. \n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid to do something dumb and fun once in awhile. College is prime time for it because once you\u2019re interviewing for jobs, everyone expects you to be professional all the time and it is boring as hell. So get your wacky haircut and cool piercings while you have the chance, depending on your field of course. \n\nOne last thing: you are not your grades. You are not your GPA. You are a person who is going to school to learn new things. And you wont learn anything if you don\u2019t take care of your physical and mental health first. Slow down and have fun when you have the chance. And remember to eat more than Ramen. Your body and mind will thank you. \n\nThis is all the advice I can think of ATM. I hope it helps! Good luck in school!",

Go to your schools Career Center and ask them to help with your resume. Not everyone is able to take unpaid internships or move cities for the Summer for the best internship opportunities (although do that if financially possible) but the Career Center can help you make the best resume with whatever work experience you have. \n\nLastly plan your time wisely so you can get work done and still have time to go out. I graduated a year ago so I know the social scene is a lot worse when you aren\u2019t in a college town.

              "text": "True. If you are going into your junior year and senior year for in-person, you might be disappointed that you didn't have your fair share of partying. Although it sucks, it isn't worth it to get addicted to the party culture ESPECIALLY in those years since you are that much closer to graduating and putting yourself out there in the real world. So take this time to fully get prepared and learn to utilize all the resources your university would offer to put your best step forward. The other users have already mentioned it but basically grades, experience, professional connections, etc. so many of these will be in full throttle and set up even better when going back into in person so be sure to focus on things that will help you the most (you will surely thank yourself much later that you did so).",

While some are pretty much copy-paste of the classes online, some professors like to divide you into groups and have you discuss it yourself or have an assignment due every time you see you in person. Like instead of having your assignments due at the end of the week, they may be due Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nAlso, before covid, several colleges in my university would attempt to attract new students by occasionally giving out food. You could often get a free meal from them as long as you showed up.",
