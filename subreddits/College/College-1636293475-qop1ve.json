  "text": "So I'm trying to figure out what course I want to study. I want to work in research in the future and this seems like a good way to save time. This Biomedicine course is at a UK uni(Aberdeen to be exact) and I'm not planning on staying here after it's done. Would this be considered a Masters degree in other countries? Or is it better to do it the usual way?",

      "text": "It is beneficial in certain career paths. For example, my school does a 4+1 program. You get your bachelors your senior year while also starting your masters your senior year and getting it 1 year after you graduate. This does ultimately save you one year as a masters degree is typically a two year program. \n\nFor my career path, which is elementary education, getting a masters degree wouldn't be so beneficial early on because most schools wont hire you with a masters degree right off the bat because that would entitle me to higher pay and over qualification. It is better to get your bachelors, begin teaching for a couple of years, and then go back and get my masters. If there is enough money in the district, most of the time, schools will pay me to get my masters. \n\nAs for someone in your field of study, it sounds beneficial to get both your bachelor's and your master's. I could be wrong on the other hand, so it may be wise to ask professors their opinions and maybe your advisor. \n\nHope this helps",
