  "text": "I used to be doing so well. I had a 3.93 GPA in my two years at community college. I transferred to university this semester, and my mental and physical health went absolutely down the drain (unrelated to transferring). I have struggled so much with personal health issues that school has hardly been worth thinking about.\n\nBut I'm really needing to think about it now. I thought the disability apartment in my school would make it to where I could make up exams later, but I just discovered that that actually isn't the case, meaning all the exams I've missed, I won't be able to make up.\n\nMeaning I'm screwed.\n\nEven if I get a 100% on every exam and assignment for the remainder of the semester, the best grades I can get are 2 Ds and 1 C. (Already dropped my 4th class a few weeks ago.)\n\nAnd apparently my GPA from my former college won't matter when it comes to scholarships/grants, only my GPA from this new college will matter.\n\nWhat do I do? I'm already overwhelmed as it is, this is making things so much worse.\n\nIs it better to drop my classes to save my GPA? Or is it better to get Ds and a C? I think I'm financially screwed either way.\n\nI have an appointment scheduled with my academic advisor, but it's not for another week, and I'm stressed as hell in the meantime.",
