My daughter started at Texas Tech this August. The decision on her fafsa was't finalized till after she started. I know all the financial aid departments are working through backlogs, and we had to submit additional information a couple of times. \n\nI remarried in 2020. I've read about how a new spouse's financial information counts for determining. My wife has savings accounts for her younger girls for school and musical instrument purchases and repairs. We disclosed this, but it's not as if we can dip into this money. Also, between a move, effects of covid, and job market differences, we made almost 20k less in 2020 than in 2019. We weren't married in 2019, but were still required to submit those tax document. I'm filling out a special circumstance but not sure how to maximize it's impact. Is there a succinct way to convey all this?\n\nFinally, I have a payment agreement with the IRS to pay off tax debt from a failed business. Would submitting this info help with fafsa since both are arms of the federal government?", "author": "VladamirHugo", "created": 1632090847, "retrieved": 1632801445, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdiu0x9": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pri3hv/parent_fafsa_help_remarriage_and_irs_payment/hdiu0x9/", "text": "Probably best to talk to TT directly with nice concise explanations you provided. \n\nFAFSA is basically one way communication through documentation. Maybe a CPA can assist with line-by-line filing assistance? \n\nNo pathway to get FAFSA to adjust recommendations, but school can offer need based-aid with exceptional circumstances.", "author": "roguezebra", "created": 1632091945, "upvotes": 2}}}
