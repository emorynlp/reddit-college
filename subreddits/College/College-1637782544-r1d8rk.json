  "title:": "Struggling with bad grades due to depressive episode",
  "text": "I am 18 years old and am enrolled in a community college where all my classes are online. I\u2019ve found the transfer between high school and college to be very difficult on my mental health. I lost contact with a bunch of friends due to them enrolling in universities. I was embarrassed about the fact that I stayed in my hometown and went to community college even though there is nothing wrong with it and that my social life was slowly withering. I had all A\u2019s in the beginning of the semester and was motivated to do my work so I can transfer to university quickly. However, my depression started to eat me alive. I never left the house, barely even could get out of bed, my body would be in so much pain constantly, and I\u2019d cry almost everyday. It was unbearable. The exercise I was doing everyday I stopped even taking walks and I was slowly getting back into my old habits. After taking a trip with my family in order to help regain my mental health, I am just now starting to slowly change things for the better.  I am going to get my permit so I can start driving and taking myself to my college for future semesters. However, I feel an extreme overwhelming sense of dread about all the assignments, exams, even midterms that I\u2019ve missed due to my depression and I am afraid that I will fail all my classes this semester. I know that if I fail I\u2019ll take a huge hit and stop all the progress I\u2019ve been making and be even more depressed than the beginning. I am trying to work on everything else in my life for the better but I am finding my grades to be difficult to improve even with me doing current assignments. I honestly feel helpless and don\u2019t know how to manage this situation.\n\n(I also have been trying to find in person therapy but it\u2019s been difficult finding any available therapists let alone ones that do in person visits since covid)",

I think the best thing to do is meet with a counselor, do the best you can to finish out the semester (no life your assignments), and just prepare to do better next semester. I hope all goes well for you in your school life and personal life!",

I was trying to tell OP to basically finish out this semester and just get all the work they can get done out of the way. I also forgot to mention to actually communicate with their professor about their situation. They also should meet with a counselor and get on the right track for next semester.",

In this subreddit the meta advice I see for when students are questioning their program/school in general is very cheerful and is basically just persevere, continue, keeping going... \n\nI can understand why though. you don\u2019t want to give up too early. There\u2019s also the argument that no education = poverty. At the same time you shouldn\u2019t keep doing something you don\u2019t like with the expectation that it\u2019ll get better. \n\nIf OP is facing mental health challenges that are impacting school there\u2019s no shame in taking time off to better himself so they can return stronger. It\u2019s up to them to decide what they want and what they need.",
