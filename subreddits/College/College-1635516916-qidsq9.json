  "text": "I am a college freshman, and I took IB HL math in high school. I got a 7 on the IB test, and I was really excited to have earned some college credits. However, my college just considered it to be elective credits and did not give me any Calc I credits. I have asked them about it, but they say IB HL math does not have enough hours to earn Calc I credits. I am very annoyed because IB math was hard, and I had to work for hours to earn a good grade in the class. Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do?",

      "text": "Don't be annoyed. Now you'll be able to relax a bit in Calc I while everyone else works their asses off.\n\nAlso, anecdotally, I know that many schools don't accept IB/AP credits for their Calc classes because many of those students-- even the ones that did great in high school-- go on to fail the versions taught in college. As intense as it is in high school, it's still often even more intense in college and allowing students to skip Calc I is a recipe for higher fail rates. \n\nThe bottom line is calculus is hard. It's usually even harder in college. Take Calc I and allow yourself to breathe a bit.",
