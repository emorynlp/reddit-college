What does this mean?", "text": "For context, a tech college I went to 2 years ago , I ended up owing a couple hundred (but due to the pandemic I couldn\u2019t pay it , and couldn\u2019t get a student loan to cover it.)\n\nSo tonight I log on to that tech school\u2019s website and login to my personal account, and under \u201cpayment history\u201d it shows in June 2 things in the same box : \n1: APR grant \n2: discharged debt \n\nI hadn\u2019t applied for a grant nor have I gone to that school since 2019. \n\nDoes this mean my debt got sent to collections, or that they outright forgave it? \n\nIf it was discharged and it DOES mean something bad, could I be ineligible for financial aid at a DIFFERENT university for not paying my old college before it became discharged ?", "author": "No-Back9291", "created": 1632465757, "retrieved": 1632800451, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "comments": {}}
