  "text": "I have no legal background at all, but there is a lot of misconceptions going around about the package. That being said, even there is a chance that what I'm saying is incorrect, and if presented with new, correct, information, it will be edited.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Same info, but more clarifications available at /r/taxes\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/fq71lw/stimulus_check_faqs_3272020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\n\n**EDIT 2:** For those who are rightfully claimed as dependents, age 17-24, your parents will NOT receive a $500 bonus as you might expect. I urge you to email your senators and representatives, so this does not happen again in the future. I have personally emailed Jim Banks, Todd Young, and my representative in Indiana. Go on their websites, and use their contact forms. Reps and their office will actually read your email (this is their job and it helps their votes). You might think your one email or vote doesn't matter, but it does. It is better to do something than nothing in this scenario.\n\nYou may be able to benefit from the stimulus package depending on how you're supposed to file. There are many different news sources outlining the requirements. The absolute best way find out specific requirements would be to wade through the hundreds of pages the bill contains. I have tried, but failed to understand it.\n\nAs of now, the New York Times's FAQ has good answers: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\nWhat is in the bill, is not a partisan issue. Please check multiple sources for the best information. My hope is that people who qualify for the money, will be able to get it, as I personally qualify as a independent filing college student.\n\n\n\n**Bill Highlights From NYT**\n\n\"**How large would the payments be?**\n\nMost adults would get $1,200, although some would get less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment would be an additional $500.\"\n\n**Comment**: This actually does exclude certain college students who are filed as dependents, as your parents won't receive an extra $500. It is under the assumption if your parents provide you with more than 50% of your finances, they will bail you out.\n\n\"**Do college students get anything?**\n\nNot if anyone claims them as a dependent on a tax return. Usually, students under age 24 are dependents in the eyes of the taxing authorities **if a parent pays for at least half of their expenses.**\"\n\n**Comment:** If your parents do not pay for at least half of your expenses/aid you with financial needs, do not allow them to claim you as a dependent. It is a very common practice for parents to claim you as a dependent, even when they should not. It is my understanding that some parents who do not provide financially for their children will do this so they can get much more money. Doing so is tax fraud. \n\nThe net gain of them for them claiming you as a dependent through tax credit is often much higher than you would get by filing independently. So, if you have a good relationship with your parents, and they support you, do not file as independent. \n\nYou ay also able to change filing statuses from previous years. FAFSA usually considers you as a dependent in terms of financial aid even if you file as independent with the IRS. This does not disqualify you as long as you file independent with the IRS. For example, I am estranged from my parent, file independent with the IRS, but I still have to submit my parent's taxes for FAFSA.\n\n\"**What year\u2019s income should I be looking at?**\n\n2019, if you haven\u2019t prepared a tax return yet, you can use your 2018 return. \n\n**Comment**: Many sources say 2019 first, and then 2018 if you don't have a 2019.\n\n\"**What if my recent income made me ineligible, but I anticipate being eligible because of a loss of income in 2020? Do I get a payment?**\n\nThe bill does not help people in that circumstance now, but you may benefit once you file your 2020 taxes. That\u2019s because the payment is technically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year. So it will depend on how much you earn.\"\n\n**Comment**: This may be useful info for students who graduated in 2019 and work full-time. Unfortunately, you won't get the check now, but at least you still get it.\n\nBest of luck in these weird times!",

I personally filed wih H&R block as they have good UI and it is free for me and they do this for you. I would just choose the cheapest option. You just have to select the AOTC in your efile. Try e-filing and you\u2019ll be able to confirm it before you submit.\n\nBecause my parent\u2019s income is at poverty level, my college covers me entirely. As such I can claim AOTC on my return but I do not get any credit because they consider scholarships (rightfully so). Note that I file as independent even though FAFSA needs to see my parent\u2019s taxes. Hope this helps.\n\nThis source says you can claim it by yourself or have it claimed for a dependent: https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/taxes/articles/the-american-opportunity-tax-credit-what-to-know-and-how-to-use-it\n\nIt is also explicitly said here: https://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/taxes/articles/what-tax-credits-do-i-qualify-for?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app",

Now it's all fucked up and I don't get anything. People are saying this bill is for the truly poor and needy but... it's not. It's for anyone who makes less than $75,000 a year which certainly includes lots of people way better off than me at my shitty retail job. But looks like I don't deserve anything.\n\nI feel like if you have a job \u2013 no matter what \u2013 you should get SOME amount of money during this time.

The government isn't literally handing out free billions no questions asked to companies. From what I've read, it different than that.\n\nThe next bill will likely exclude dependent college students again unless people take action or find an actual reason to exclude those specific students. Precedence plays a very crucial role in the passing of bills, so they'll likely copy this one again and modify it.",

Just look at all the conflicting information redditors are providing. I am deeply saddened about this kind of stuff and how much willful ignorance or non-backed evidence claims are made.: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fppc7v/oc_where_the_money_goes_in_the_us_senates_2t/\n\nPlease check these links. I encourage you to be more open to new information being presented. Since I am being downvoted which I don't mind, I am assuming who is reading this is not bothering to educate themself. https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/fppc7v/oc_where_the_money_goes_in_the_us_senates_2t/flmml3h/\n\nAs one redditor stated in one of the threads\n\n\"\nYou fundamentally don\u2019t understand the difference in these categories. It\u2019s not as cut and dry as the graphic suggests. \n\nThe bailouts to large corporations are actually guarantees to either purchase debt or extend credit with the idea being that the companies pay most of this money back. \n\nThe money given to individuals is straight cash, not a loan of some sort.\n\"\n\nAll of these reasons is why I suggested him to take a look.",

Background info, 23y/o full-time student and worker making roughly 29k annually. \n\nNow with that being said, I followed up with my mother, and she spoke me to me and said she did not claim me at all in either years. No where did she put my name down or claim dependents. I marked my self as a dependent because it became a habit since i've been doing my own tax returns since 10th grade, making checking the dependent box a thoughtless choice, until now. My mother told me in 2018 that she does not need to claim me anymore since it would no longer be beneficial for her nor I, guess I forgot about it when it came time to file..\n\nI just amended my 2019 tax return, and am now getting a State return, I was award Student tax credits, and am getting more from my initial federal return too, all by removing that silly mistake of checking 'Someone COULD claim me as a dependent'. Only thing I have to do now is send my amended return through the mail. \n\nWill my original filing make me ineligible for receiving stimulus since my mother did not claim me, even though I marked that 'I COULD be claimed' ? Or, will my amendment fix my issue and allow me eligibility.",
