You might be able to get money.", "text": "I have no legal background at all, but there is a lot of misconceptions going around about the package. That being said, even there is a chance that what I'm saying is incorrect, and if presented with new, correct, information, it will be edited.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Same info, but more clarifications available at /r/taxes\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/fq71lw/stimulus_check_faqs_3272020/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\n\n**EDIT 2:** For those who are rightfully claimed as dependents, age 17-24, your parents will NOT receive a $500 bonus as you might expect. I urge you to email your senators and representatives, so this does not happen again in the future. I have personally emailed Jim Banks, Todd Young, and my representative in Indiana. Go on their websites, and use their contact forms. Reps and their office will actually read your email (this is their job and it helps their votes). You might think your one email or vote doesn't matter, but it does. It is better to do something than nothing in this scenario.\n\nYou may be able to benefit from the stimulus package depending on how you're supposed to file. There are many different news sources outlining the requirements. The absolute best way find out specific requirements would be to wade through the hundreds of pages the bill contains. I have tried, but failed to understand it.\n\nAs of now, the New York Times's FAQ has good answers: https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-stimulus-package-questions-answers.html\nWhat is in the bill, is not a partisan issue. Please check multiple sources for the best information. My hope is that people who qualify for the money, will be able to get it, as I personally qualify as a independent filing college student.\n\n\n\n**Bill Highlights From NYT**\n\n\"**How large would the payments be?**\n\nMost adults would get $1,200, although some would get less. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, the payment would be an additional $500.\"\n\n**Comment**: This actually does exclude certain college students who are filed as dependents, as your parents won't receive an extra $500. It is under the assumption if your parents provide you with more than 50% of your finances, they will bail you out.\n\n\"**Do college students get anything?**\n\nNot if anyone claims them as a dependent on a tax return. Usually, students under age 24 are dependents in the eyes of the taxing authorities **if a parent pays for at least half of their expenses.**\"\n\n**Comment:** If your parents do not pay for at least half of your expenses/aid you with financial needs, do not allow them to claim you as a dependent. It is a very common practice for parents to claim you as a dependent, even when they should not. It is my understanding that some parents who do not provide financially for their children will do this so they can get much more money. Doing so is tax fraud. \n\nThe net gain of them for them claiming you as a dependent through tax credit is often much higher than you would get by filing independently. So, if you have a good relationship with your parents, and they support you, do not file as independent. \n\nYou ay also able to change filing statuses from previous years. FAFSA usually considers you as a dependent in terms of financial aid even if you file as independent with the IRS. This does not disqualify you as long as you file independent with the IRS. For example, I am estranged from my parent, file independent with the IRS, but I still have to submit my parent's taxes for FAFSA.\n\n\"**What year\u2019s income should I be looking at?**\n\n2019, if you haven\u2019t prepared a tax return yet, you can use your 2018 return. \n\n**Comment**: Many sources say 2019 first, and then 2018 if you don't have a 2019.\n\n\"**What if my recent income made me ineligible, but I anticipate being eligible because of a loss of income in 2020? Do I get a payment?**\n\nThe bill does not help people in that circumstance now, but you may benefit once you file your 2020 taxes. That\u2019s because the payment is technically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year. So it will depend on how much you earn.\"\n\n**Comment**: This may be useful info for students who graduated in 2019 and work full-time. Unfortunately, you won't get the check now, but at least you still get it.\n\nBest of luck in these weird times!", "author": "Jazure", "created": 1585321613, "retrieved": 1632802539, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 867, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fnuy9en": {"link": "/r/college/comments/fpyhag/coronavirus_stimulus_does_not_necessarily_exclude/fnuy9en/", "text": "if your over 18 and still live with mommy and daddy you dont deserve money.

Your parents won't get the $500 tax credit for a dependent, but you'll get the $1200 relief funding.\n\nDiscuss with your parents, obviously, but you want to file your taxes ASAP.\n\nAlso don't forget to file the American Opportunity Tax Credit for an extra $1000 even if you had no income (assuming you didn't get scholarships that covered everything). You'll need to download your Form 1098-T from your school's website, but whatever tax service you use will essentially fill everything out for you.\n\nI use FreeTaxUSA and it was an incredibly easy process.", "author": "_Eggs_", "created": 1585325324, "upvotes": 87}}}
