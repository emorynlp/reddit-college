  "text": "Hi everyone! So currently I\u2019m having an existential crisis. I\u2019m in my first semester of college and unsure of my career goals and major in general. I am taking 15 credits and a few of these classes have been pretty difficult so I haven\u2019t even had much time to think about what I want to do or major in. I decided to go to college right after to high school because I believed it was the norm and that I would fall behind plus my family\u2019s expectations, but I realize my mind wasn\u2019t made up enough for this decision. I also feel I need some time to heal emotionally as I haven\u2019t been very emotionally stable. \n\nI wanted some advice on taking a gap semester. Has anyone done this? Supposing I will be productive (building skills/probably gaining work experience) during this gap semester, how will this break affect my chances of grad school or employment in the future around the time I graduate? I have a scholarship that allows me to take a gap semester without losing it, and as I live with my parents I\u2019m not paying anything at all so there are no financial consequences.\n\nAny advice would be very much appreciated.",

      "text": "No! Weather you can\u2019t handle it for mental health reasons or unsure about something if you think a gap semester will help you DO IT! \n\nMany students don\u2019t graduate in 4 years as well. If you have to explain it to grad school or jobs just explain you wanted to take a step back and evaluate your decision. Also, don\u2019t put a grad year or when you attended on your resume once you leave college (it ages you and sets you up for ageism) \n\nDon\u2019t go through life on societies timeline. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are when you graduate.",

I\u2019m going to be 24 when I graduate college and almost in my 30s when I graduate from grad school (trying to decide between a PhD or Law School) \n\nI took 2 gap years between college (mental health).\nYour going to succeed if you put yourself first.\n\nGood Luck!",
