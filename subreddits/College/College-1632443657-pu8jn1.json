  "text": "Freshmen here. I followed everyone\u2019s advice on trying to make friends like joining clubs, leaving my door open, saying hello to people in my classes/labs, going to games, etc. but I\u2019m still alone. Everyone told me how fun college is and how it was the best time of their life but I\u2019ve just been miserable the whole time. Is there anything else I can do bc I hate feeling like this",

      "text": "The best thing that ever happened to me was just mentioning blank event and then somebody/me asking \u201cyo would you come explore blank event w me?\u201d And then once we were doing stuff together, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t. If you vibe with someone, keep asking them to do things. At some point, if they ask you to do stuff too, that means they like you enough, too. \n\nAlso, still don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s been a month. Some people take up to a year to find the friends they want (also keep in mind that some ppl don\u2019t have a true \u201csquad,\u201d for some people, they like having two friends here, one friend there, etc.) It sucks to just have to wait for the best people, but that is kind of the story of adult life sometimes. You will find good people, though. In the meantime, get support from high school friends and your family if you need it. It\u2019ll all be okay.",

And also for some reason people don\u2019t respond to their Instagram Dms like I\u2019m trying to make friends and dm you because we have similar things from when they posted on the school Instagram class of page and they just don\u2019t open them and leave me on sent for weeks when we had an actual conversation going and vibing \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80I literally can\u2019t spend anymore time like this\u2026",
