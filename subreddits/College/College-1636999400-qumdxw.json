  "text": "I\u2019m nearing the end of my first semester of and I really hate it. I just went into engineering because that\u2019s what everyone expected me to do and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I\u2019m not able to do most of the work because I just don\u2019t care and so I\u2019m failing basically every class. I also think I\u2019m depressed so I guess that that also probably contributes to it. I don\u2019t want to take next semester but I\u2019m worried that if I drop out now with all of my terrible grades I\u2019m not going to be able to get back in if I want to go back in the future. I would appreciate any advice.",

      "text": "Go to a local community college until you know what you want. It's cheaper than a 4-year school and most of them have agreements with nearby colleges so you are guaranteed a position (after x specific classes, usually gen-eds that you need anyways). Depending on where you live, courses may be less rigorous.\n\nIt's easier to justify a gap year than a failed one. Don't fuck up your grades, and if that means taking a break, take a break. Alternatively, since you're only a freshman, don't worry about being an \"engineering major\" and instead take random classes that sound interesting. You'll never know what you want to do until you follow your curiosity down the rabbit hole.\n\nAlso, try joining clubs. It's motivating to be around like-minded people with similar interests.",

      "text": "My freshman year of college, I got into a bad car accident. It screwed up my short term memory. I would go to class, be there the whole time and then walk out and couldn't remember a thing. I dropped out to give my brain time to heal and didn't want to keep failing my classes. I tried other things now 15 years later I am going back and it wasn't difficult to get back in. Just difficult to get back into the swing of classes and studying.",
