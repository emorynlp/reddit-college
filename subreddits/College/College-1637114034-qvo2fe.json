  "text": "First year physics major here. As of recently, I\u2019ve been really struggling with handling the workload from my courses and I\u2019m at the point where I feel too burn out to do any more. I can\u2019t help but to feel frustrated with myself, regardless of how much tutoring I receive or studying I do. I\u2019ve had a really shitty semester, mostly due to feeling extremely sick for over a month now (sinus headache, sore throat, fatigue) and have been missing many classes because of it. \nMy professors try to be helpful/understanding, although they\u2019ve been cranking out work left and right and I can\u2019t keep up after missing so many lectures. And despite all of the complaints about my confusion, my grades are decent (A\u2019s and B\u2019s). Maybe my hopelessness is just a result of flunking my second test and I could simply chalk it up to that\u2014 I\u2019m not sure. I always did poorly on exams in high school and was a straight A/B student. However, tests are weighted differently in college, so good homework grades can\u2019t guarantee passing classes. \nHas anyone else experienced burn out like this before? What should I do? Everyday feels like I\u2019m dragging my ass across a floor of sandpaper. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m miserable or not because I\u2019ve loss all sense of emotion. No joy, sadness, etc., it all feels as if I\u2019ve shifted into a plane between reality and nonexistence. I have clinical depression, anxiety, and ocd that can and will affect my day-to-day life. I go to a small liberal arts college in a small quiet town and there\u2019s nothing to do here, so it\u2019s not like I can go out for a night to cheer myself up. I can\u2019t tell if the source of everything is from my poor study habits, bad time management, depression or physical illness. Any advice will help at this point, I\u2019m just trying to make it to thanksgiving break.",
