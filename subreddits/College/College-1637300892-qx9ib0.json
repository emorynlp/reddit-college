  "text": "First off I apologize for the long post, it\u2019s my first time posting and having a place I could express my thoughts. \nFor as long as I could remember, my mental health has not been the best. It didn\u2019t help that through my grade schooling I had very few friends and was considered odd or weird. I learned to adapt and blend-in to survive the social aspect. Though the academic part was always easy, so easy I wouldn\u2019t do some assignments because it was overly boring. I could have graduated with a 4.0 but couldn\u2019t stand the thought of talking at graduation. \nI\u2019ve always been called smart or intelligent, but I\u2019ve never believed it or felt that way about myself. I don\u2019t see myself as brighter than the average Joe. Usually the things I\u2019d say that were \u201csmart\u201d seemed like common sense to me. I have been made to feel (in my opinion) less than or not adequate enough, which definitely plays it\u2019s roll as much as I wish it didn\u2019t affect me. \n\nHowever, when it came time to choose and college I had many available to me. At the end of the day, I decided to not attend as I didn\u2019t see the point in going into so much debt for something that could potentially be worthless. I doubted that I could succeed. I didn\u2019t even know what I wanted to do, and still don\u2019t know for sure what I\u2019d like to be. But I do feel like I\u2019ve let myself down in a way. Like I\u2019ve cheated myself out of an experience to learn and connect with others. \nFast forward to today, I struggle with depression and thoughts of ending things everyday. I feel like having a goal or challenge to work towards would be beneficial. However, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve waited too long and lost too much to be able to attend. I\u2019m about to turn 24 next month and hate the direction my life is going right now. Is it too late to change course? Could I keep up with my classmates if I did decide to go? Or should I simply try to find purpose in my current career field?",

      "text": "It's never too late to continue your education.  I'm 45 and recently returned and am about halfway through my second year at a community college (I flunked out due to mental health issues when I was younger and just not being ready for college in general).  I'm going part time and paying as I go so I don't have massive students loans when I graduate (my school offers payment plans for the semester). One of my professors is currently working on getting his Ph. D. and if I had to guess I would say he's at least in his 70's (he started working for a govt Agency shortly after it was formed in the early 1970's).",

I think it\u2019s mostly a self conscious thing at this point, I rarely do anything that I\u2019m not sure what the success rate might be. It\u2019s probably a fear of failing or finding out that I am, in fact, not smart enough for college",

              "text": "If you decide to go back don't push yourself too hard the first few semesters.  I took one class that I knew I'd be interested in subject wise and that it wouldn't be too difficult to see how I would do and slowly built up my course load over a few semesters.  I usually try to take one or two classes that I feel will be easy for me subject wise along with one that I know I may struggle in.  I figure that way I'll hopefully only being stressing and pulling my hair out in one class and it won't be too much for me to deal with.  If you feel you aren't doing well in a class then definitely speak to the prof immediately and go over your options (stick it out or withdraw before you'd get penalised and do whatever you need to to be prepared when you retake it).  Sometimes you just have to say to yourself \"I wasn't ready for that class yet but now I know what to expect and will be ready to do well next time.\" Also, there's no set timetable to finish and get your degree. If it takes you 10 years there's absolutely nothing wrong with that so long as you are happy with your progress.\n\nAs I mentioned, I initially flunked out of college because I was suffering from depression, anxiety, and untreated PTSD and the extra stress just made it worse.  I got my head together and returned after nearly 10 years off.  I also have a friend who has several mental health issues (depression, anxiety, BPD) and she recently started going to college as well and feels as though it's actually helped her mentally because she's no longer \"sitting around doing nothing and is working towards something.\" She feels like she is now working towards a goal to better herself in the long run and has been doing all online or virtual classes at her local CC.",

                  "text": "Thank you for that, it does help bring some peace of mind. I spoke with an admissions advisor today at a state university that offers completely online degrees. Though the program I want to get into requires in person classes once I\u2019m there. She recommended that I do something similar where I take one or two classes per block since I work well over 40 hours a week.  \n\nI think the biggest obstacle right now (other than the work load) is my mental health. I suffer from similar things that you spoke about. I was finally diagnosed with inattentive ADHD earlier this year, along with some co-morbidities of depression and anxiety along with that diagnosis. I absolutely dread doing presentations, reading speeches to others, or just interacting with people in general; which is part of why I never went in the first place. But I enjoyed the part of your friend saying that it did help her mentally, and that\u2019s what I hope happens for me. \n\n\nFrom your own experience, do you have any other advice you could give me?",

                      "text": "Just take it step by step and be aware of how your mental health is doing (I know that's difficult at times to see).  It really helped me to set up a schedule specifically for school and I use the myhomework app to enter all assignments, quizzes, and tests and the dates they're due which help me to not forget or miss anything (I have ADD as well and take Straterra when it's really affecting me) and it really helps to see the work for all my classes in one list.  \n\nI'm like you when it comes to presentations in class, I'll sometimes be up the entire night before vomiting due to anxiety. It's slowly gotten better the more I do it and my confidence has increased.  I'm still dreading taking my required communications/public speaking class. It might help to stand up in front of a camera and video yourself practicing your presentations and then watch it to see if you want to change anything.  Also, try to volunteer to go first if given an option.  So far I've really lucked out and only had to do two presentations and felt relieved when I saw other students having the same issues I felt I was having.  \n\nMost classes you will have little interaction with others unless it's a lab class.  Even group projects seem to usually be someone assigning everyone a task and they all submit their work to that one person who then compiles it together into the final submittal. \n\nI'm sure you'll be able to do good in school.  It sounds like you need to build up a little confidence which will come as you get used to attending classes and how things flow.",

I don\u2019t suppose a community college could give me a comprehensive experience for that? The other downside I face is the lack of available community colleges around me. The closest college is an LDS University. I don\u2019t really want to go there as it\u2019s private and I don\u2019t live to their standards, nor do I share their beliefs. \nI suppose my overall goal is to find a field where I feel I\u2019m beneficial while still working in something I have a passion for. Right now, being an automotive painter pays the bills, but it\u2019s mind-numbing work. Nothing really in depth that I have to use my head for. I\u2019m good at what I do, but the passion isn\u2019t there. I just feel college would be my ticket to something higher.",
