  "title:": "My roommate smells like literal death and it\u2019s time to be mean about it",
  "text": "I live I a frat. I joined spring and by the time I was initiated this kid was my only option for rooming. \n\nLast semester I spoke to him 3 times about his hygiene and how he smells. The first and second time I made sure to be very polite and not to hurt his feelings. He said he\u2019d \u201ctake care of it\u201d and just bought candles and febreez. The problem is his shower and laundry habits, which are essentially nonexistent. \n\nThe third time I spoke to him I was really pissed off with him. I told him it was atrocious and I made him do his laundry, change his sheets, and shower. It was better for a week or two. \n\nEveryday I wake up and leave to brush my teeth. When I get back, there\u2019s this overwhelming smell of a mix between feet, Asshole, and BO. I am sick of it. He\u2019s lucky I don\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore or else I would be a lot less patient. \n\nI think today I\u2019m going to be brutally honest with him. Maybe even mean. I\u2019m out of options here. My house eboard won\u2019t get involved. All they will do \u201cmediate a conversation\u201d between the two of us. I can have a conversation on my own. This kid needs to be told that no one likes being near him because his stench is nauseating. \n\nAnyone got any tips or something? I\u2019m at the end of the rope with this kid\n\nEdit: after talking to the eboard, were gonna talk to him and make sure he\u2019s not depressed, and if he is I will point him in the direction of help if he is available to it. Thank you for all the responses.",

I was opening the window up so I could breathe but he was saying  \"bro it's cold\" and made me shut it down always, I didn't want to break his heart and never told him that he smelled but I did try to get him to take a shower which he said no. I am so lucky that he unregistered from the dorm and left. Otherwise I might have had to tell him just like you did. As a tip for your problem, I think you can't change people, he will keep smelling forever, so if possible report him and get a new roommate. Otherwise you will never make him change his hygiene.",

The point wouldn't just be to have the conversation (since, like you said, you can have the conversation on your own). The real point is to have this discussion be \"official\" and subject to a witness. The former can act like an extra kick in the butt, the latter is so you can cover your ass, in case he turns out to be an asshole and tries to make something up later.\n\nI also suggested escalating because a house e-board really doesn't have that much power.

Being mean will probably just make the situation worse, frankly.\n\nYou could talk to your frat about a different room or something, or tell them that you literally cannot deal with this and that you\u2019re gonna have to look for an apartment/room in a house.

He just hang somewhere to dry it in our room (quite small room actually). After three days using it, our room smells like hell. I'd lived with him for about six months and I suffered from terrible headache and was gradually loosing my mind.\n\nWhat I learned from this experience was getting a private room if you can afford. There's miserably slight chance to be matched with a roommate you'd like. It's nearly gamble to be honest. Moving in together with friend you already know is much better. Don't just simply apply for a university dorm without knowing who'd become your roommate. You might be loosing your mind to try saving some pennies which is obviously bigger loss.",

My personal hygiene is equally rigorous. \n\nStill, when I went through something really difficult recently I fell into a situational depression and I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to get out of bed to use the bathroom, much less shower for 3-4 days at a time when normally I\u2019d shower twice a day. I\u2019d wear the same clothes every day because I just didn\u2019t even give a fuck anymore. Normally I can\u2019t stand feeling dirty but the depression can make you stop caring. \n\nIf you think that is the case, please just be a friend and push him to take care of himself and be there alongside him. You never know what someone\u2019s breaking point is and how close they are to it. A gentle approach of kindly telling him what to do and helping him do it might be your best chance if that is the situation. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, maybe it\u2019s time to seek relocation.

Most likely the reason he doesn't take care of himself is low self esteem and lack of feeling any value of himself. You haven't said anything about his behavior aside from the laundry and showering but even if he seems cocky or arrogant, this is likely just a defense. It sounds very frustrating to deal with honestly. \n\nI'm a very head on approach sort of person so I'd be asking questions like : *Why don't you care enough about yourself to care for yourself in the most basic ways? Do you realize others will treat you no better than you treat yourself?* If you wanna get extra about it, ask him what he would do *if he saw a very good friend going on like this? Wouldn't he want to help them?* \n\nI don't think being mean about it will solve anything. He doesn't care to do things for you, he's got to care to do things for himself. And if he is suffering a very low self esteem issues being mean about it will only make it worse. He would benefit from counseling. \n\nGive him a small place to start. \"How about you shower today, and change your sheets?\" If you're feeling extra compassionate help him with the sheets and laundry.",

My being able to find *anything* within 2 minutes of looking at Craigslist means if you spent a week or knew where to look and when to look, then it's not rare to find those prices.  There are places-- ie NYC, SF, Boston, etc. where yeah $500 a month isn't reasonable, but college towns in the middle of the country?
