I joined spring and by the time I was initiated this kid was my only option for rooming. \n\nLast semester I spoke to him 3 times about his hygiene and how he smells. The first and second time I made sure to be very polite and not to hurt his feelings. He said he\u2019d \u201ctake care of it\u201d and just bought candles and febreez. The problem is his shower and laundry habits, which are essentially nonexistent. \n\nThe third time I spoke to him I was really pissed off with him. I told him it was atrocious and I made him do his laundry, change his sheets, and shower. It was better for a week or two. \n\nEveryday I wake up and leave to brush my teeth. When I get back, there\u2019s this overwhelming smell of a mix between feet, Asshole, and BO. I am sick of it. He\u2019s lucky I don\u2019t have a girlfriend anymore or else I would be a lot less patient. \n\nI think today I\u2019m going to be brutally honest with him. Maybe even mean. I\u2019m out of options here. My house eboard won\u2019t get involved. All they will do \u201cmediate a conversation\u201d between the two of us. I can have a conversation on my own. This kid needs to be told that no one likes being near him because his stench is nauseating. \n\nAnyone got any tips or something? I\u2019m at the end of the rope with this kid\n\nEdit: after talking to the eboard, were gonna talk to him and make sure he\u2019s not depressed, and if he is I will point him in the direction of help if he is available to it.
