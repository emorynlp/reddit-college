  "text": "credit wise i\u2019m finishing my sophomore year of community college. my transcript is made up of almost all A\u2019s and 2 B\u2019s. This semester however, i have completely lost all motivation. I don\u2019t even care about due dates anymore, i don\u2019t turn in work and i have just been watching my grades slip. All of my 3 classes are online and not even through zoom, which is a big issue for me as i have quickly realized that i need to be in a physical classroom setting to learn. Anyway my question is, is it too late for me to pick my grades back up? And how can i get my motivation back? \n\nTDLR; i lost motivation and stopped turning in work. my grades are bad and i want to know if it\u2019s too late to maintain my gpa",

Review the course withdrawal regulations for your school.  If eligible, and if salvaging a course isn\u2019t possible then withdrawal may be a good option to protect your GPA from classes you\u2019d have to repeat anyway",

And the earlier in your undergrad career the less they care.  \n\nI suspect the stressors of Covid will make it even more common and less of a problem to explain.  People generally appreciate that you were self-aware enough to deal with it appropriately, even if that means taking a break",
