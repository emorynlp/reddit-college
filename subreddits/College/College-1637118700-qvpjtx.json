  "text": "My classes are still remote, so I've been doing online school for a really long time and it only recently started to effect my productivity. I used to love how it was all online, since I saved so much time from commuting. I've never had much of an issue with productivity, although I used to procrastinate sometimes. I always got good grades. But the past few weeks I've found is so difficult to study at home. When the pandemic first started, me and my sister took an unused room in our house and turned it in an office. So, I do have a desk to study on and at first it was absolutely amazing. And I still love the office, but I just can't seem to get any work done in there anymore. I tried to study in the dining room to have a change of scenery, but it didn't make a difference, so I thought it was maybe my house. Studying in the library helps so much and I get so much done. The problem is I can't always be at the library (it's not always convenient or possible). So I need to find a way to get myself to study when I'm home, does anyone have any tips?",
