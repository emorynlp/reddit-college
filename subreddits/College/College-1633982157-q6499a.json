  "text": "I just finished my first week at university as a freshman. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was about 14 and it always badly affected my school performance. Even though I feel like I'm in a better place mentally than I was a year ago, I still have a hard time finding enough energy to keep up with everything that's going on. I've just been feeling really overwhelmed by all the classes and new people. I feel like I often have to choose between spending energy on paying attention during the lecture, doing all the homework and talking to people. I've always struggled with social anxiety and going back to being around people all day after the pandemic break makes me very nervous and uncomfortable even though at the same time I hope to make some friends and go to parties. I really wish I could have a hybrid lecture schedule, where one week I go to uni and one week I spend at home with online classes. \nI can't seem to find the balance, I enjoy the majority of my classes but the social interactions are already taking a toll on me.",

      "text": "Honestly feel the exact same way. After the pandemic it feels like so much energy is required to do such easy things that we always used to do. I became so comfortable being by myself that by the time it ended i felt like i really wanted to talk to people, but at the same time it was just easier to not talk at all. All i do in class now is try and not fall asleep cuz i don\u2019t have the energy to do anything. I honestly feel like i have more energy at night now cuz that\u2019s when i can completely be myself without having any stress during the day. I used to match everyone\u2019s energy but now i my mind is filled with a bunch of stupid shit that doesn\u2019t even matter because i just think too much.",

      "text": "It depends on what your future plans are. If you plan on going to Grad school for example, your grades are pretty important. But if you just plan on getting an undergraduate degree, your grades don't matter that much. \n\nAbout halfway through my time in College I realized that my grades just really didn't matter. I didn't plan on going to Grad School and I would still get my degree even if I had a C average. So I stopped stressing so much and started having more fun. I didn't graduate with the greatest GPA, but I still graduated and got my Degree. I didn't have a single employer ask me what my GPA was, and I still ended up getting decent job offers. \n\nMy advice would be to prioritize grades/a social life depending on what your future goals are. If you plan on going to Grad school or being a lawyer, focus more on your grades. If not, have fun. Don't stress about it so long as you graduate.",
