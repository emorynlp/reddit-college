  "text": "Basically the title. I am a senior in high school and can\u2019t decide whether to major in psychology or business. If I went the psych route I would have to get a masters because job paths are limited without it, but I might not make a lot of money. Business could get me a lot of money with only a bachelors, but I don\u2019t know. Thoughts? Opinions?",

      "text": "I\u2019m a double major and i major in psych. If both biz and psych are what you\u2019re interested in and your desired college offers a double major, then take it. But I\u2019d caution against doing psych as a single major, unless you\u2019re rly SURE that you have aspirations of becoming a licensed and practising psychologist in the future - which takes years as you\u2019d need to go to grad school and eventually initiate further studies. Without grad school, it would be extremely competitive to secure work experience as an assistant psych or something similar along the lines of that. \nBusiness as a single major on the other hand is more practical, and you probably wouldn\u2019t have to spend thousands on your masters or doctorates as you\u2019d most likely be in the workforce after having your bachelors.\nOtherwise, you could choose to minor in psych or take up a double major/honours as mentioned.",
