  "text": "I'm kind of at a loss of what to do here. I've had back issues for many years but recently as of two ish weeks ago it's been getting really bad to the point where sitting at a desk for 50 min causes me a lot of pain when I stand, let alone 4 classes in a row 3 days a week. Some days I'm in so much pain I can't get out of bed to go sit at my computer or go to campus, some days I'm fine. Whatever the problem is also seems to sometimes trigger some UTI-esque symptoms leaving me stuck in the bathroom.\n\nThe first time I had to take off class I didn't know this would be an ongoing issue, and I let all my professors know and they were very understanding, but it's been happening so often that it feels like I would be making excuses to be emailing them that much without a doctor's note. I do have an appointment scheduled to look into it, but I can't predict what days will be bad and get a note every single time. \n\nI only ask because 3/4 of my classes care about attendance and I know I'm losing small points here and there for not going, plus missing out on material. \n\nAny help, college resource advice, or personal experience is appreciated!",
