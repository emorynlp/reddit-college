I've sought out my high school advisors, parents of other students, and even admissions counselors to help me, but I have been largely unable to get straight answers or relevant advice, so Reddit, here I am. \n\nI have credits from almost every source out there: AP, CLEP, Dual-Credit, Community College, and some credits from a public university. I won't go in-depth into how I've obtained all of my credit, but I can make a separate post detailing it if anyone would find it interesting/helpful. With that being said, I'm in a bit of a tough spot. I've always had my eye set on transferring to an online university, most of which accept up to 90 credit hours and will seamlessly allow me to finish out my degree without having to lose any of my credits during the transfer process. Almost every traditional in-person university will only transfer up to 60 credit hours, so I would have to repeat a large portion of my degree and spend extra money that I don't have if I attended, since I am financing my degree completely on my own. \n\nI live in an extremely toxic household under my parents roof, and need to get out as soon as I can. I won't turn 18 until the end of summer following my high school graduation, so I am unable to get an apartment on my own without my parents cosignuature, which they absolutely will not provide. To my understanding, if I live on a university campus in a dorm, I can leave and move in without my parents having to cosign/approve.\n\nWith all of this being said, I have a current plan of continuing on my pathway towards my Bachelor's degree with an online university, but taking 1-2 elective or continuing education course at a local public university so that I could be classified as a student and live on campus. Has anyone ever heard of this happening, and more importantly, can it be done?\n\n If anyone has any relevant advice for me or my situation, I'd greatly appreciate it!", "author": "VaIentiness", "created": 1632030973, "retrieved": 1632801498, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdfktad": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr2dsy/can_you_live_on_the_campus_of_one_university/hdfktad/", "text": "Hmm, this is a tricky situation. \n\nApartments probably won\u2019t rent to you because you have zero credit history.

So electives would be the way to go.\n\nI'd also check about the 90 units transferring in. While they might accept those all as electives etc., the more important question would be what classes do you still need to take to meet the particular degree requirements, and any Ed requirements, and upper division totals needed. You might find that the total number of classes you still need to take aren't that much less than the residential campus. (But, you may already have this all sorted out, just making sure).\n\nAnother option altogether would be to find a roommate situation, students living near campus, renting privately, who need one more person.\n\nGood luck and best wishes. Though this is a tricky situation, it is so because you've already completed so many courses - congratulations on that!", "author": "Violet_Plum_Tea", "created": 1632031877, "upvotes": 3}, "hdfknxx": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pr2dsy/can_you_live_on_the_campus_of_one_university/hdfknxx/", "text": "I would just rent a room somewhere for cash.", "author": "335sunburst", "created": 1632031771, "upvotes": 4}}}
