  "text": "I am currently attending a state school and planning on transferring back to my local community college this spring semester. \n\nI found out that the credit for one of my classes is not transferable. Will the grade I get in this class affect my GPA at the community college? I\u2019m extremely confused as to how the transfer system/gpa transfer works. Thanks for the help!",
