  "text": "Heyo! I just got into uni this year as a med student. Unfortunately, I found that none of the clubs my uni offers suit my interests (drawing/painting/handicrafts, fitness and wellness), and there's also a lot of seniority going on in these clubs as well, especially the ones in my faculty specifically. Are there any way to find any good student clubs or organizations outside of campus that I can actively participate in? And where should I start looking? Sorry if this is a silly question, and thank you!",
