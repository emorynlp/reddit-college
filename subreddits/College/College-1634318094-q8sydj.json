  "text": "I tried to go to a online college this year but it just made me miserable. Do people actually enjoy this? I don't understand how people could just sit through all that. The assignments piled up on me and it overwhelmed me. I was thinking to myself I can't do this. This was only 6 credit hours of classes. I don't know. Maybe I am not smart enough for college. I am really disappointed becase I really wanted to do the right thing and earn a degree for my career path. I took a risk and it didn't work out.",
