  "title:": "Am I a little bitch for not wanting to work during college?",
  "text": "Because of a great scholarship + living with my parents I have virtually no expenses.I have been working over the break, and I know that I could fit work into my school schedule, but to be honest, I just don't want to. I know this might frustrate some people and sound privileged. I don't mean to brag or something like that.I just feel like it is irrational to work during the school year *if I don't have to.*\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nEdit: I don't mean not taking internships, etc. I mean working a job exclusively for money. Part of my justification for not working is that it will enable me to pursue internships, shadowing, etc. much more effectively than if I had work + school + everything else. So, for those who would argue that it's necessary to \"work\" (internships, jobs in your field) if you want a good job post graduation, I agree. That's a big part of why I don't want to \"work\" (jobs that are just for $ and don't relate to my future career).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: For anyone interested, my plan is to stop working as soon as winter break is over and using the free time for extra growth. By this I mean reading up on career, putting more effort into school, looking for internships, enjoying life, etc. If I still have time outside of school + extra growth, I might consider tutoring or finding some sort of flexible gig that doesn't take up as much energy as most jobs.  \nI have read almost every comment, and I genuinely appreciate everyone replying. I am very surprised that it's 99% positive and not just people accusing me of bragging about not having to work or something. ",

But that shouldn't be the part that matters if you think it is right for you. Focusing on your schoolwork and getting excellent grades is sometimes more difficult with a job. \n\nI personally think working during school is a good way to save up some extra money just in case. Never know when you'll be strapped and need it. Sometimes it's better to be prepared; things can go south pretty quickly.",

I didn't work my freshman year (I am a sophomore now), and have been looking for a job this entire year but haven't gotten any leads from my applications and I feel kind of guilty for not working during college but honestly it is kind of nice not having to work and being in a position where I can just focus on school and grades. I model part time, so that gives me income for the most part, but other than that I am not working and I am glad that I have found someone else in the exact same boat. I felt kind of behind from my peers who do have jobs right now but seeing your post, I feel less that way and am glad I am not alone in my situation. I don't know if that makes sense, I guess I just feel less guilty for not wanting to go out and get a job if I am not alone in how I feel?",

      "text": "Love hearing all the stories whos parents rent them an apartment on campus, get them a car, pay for their insurance, phone bill, internet. Buy all their books and supplies. And give them spending money. You're a full on adult right now. Everyone used to have to do what they had to do to go to and pay for college . Which meant working while schooling to pay school bills. \n\nNowadays parents pay for everything.  I'm curious in 10 years how this generation will be living\n \nAfter college will they be back at parents home living rent free until 3o years old?.\n\nAnyone who lives like this, just realize and be grateful that you have that opportunity cuz 75%+ of us depending on city/state/country don't have that option and have to work to get through school and buy ALL THEIR SUPPLIES.  A place to live, tuition, fees, books, groceries, clothes. Literally everything.\n\n  Anddd then we have you guys that have nothing to worry about . You go to class, do your homework and then every night go out on the town with your parents money and party and that's life. No structure other than class and homework. No independence. Yea you live alone but you aren't supporting yourself.  You may as well live with your parents.\n\nHey no hate, just be grateful for what you have. Like you can't even work 15 hours a week just to have some of your own spending money so yoyr parents don't have to pay you THAT ALSO? I'm sure they'd be proud and 15 hours a week is pitiful if that's too difficult. \n\nI commuted 4 hours a day to and from class 5 days a week. Took 18 credits. *Wrote my thesis on the side*. After class biked to and from work to work 25 hours, biked 15 miles total each day 5 days a week. 3 weekday and 2 weekend days. Plus finding the time to study, do homework and maintain relationships when the university recommends 3 hours of studying and work per credit per week.  So under their guidelines on top of work and school and commuting I should have been studying 54 hours a week ontop of that \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo 54 hours of studying a week, few hours a day of writing my thesis, 25 hours of commuting, 45 miles of biking a qeek, 25 hours of work a week, and having some sort of social life or free time. So without the social life I was expected to do 105 hours a week of school/work/homework and almost 50 miles of biking. Along with the little social life I had.\n\nBreakdown per week\n\nClass 5 days a week, from 1010 am till 230 pm with a 2 hr break per day. (Had online classes too). Physical classes was *12.5* hours per week. 54 hours studying  can just be lumped in with my online classes for simplicity \n\n*54* hours studying \n\n*14* hours/week thesis\n\n*25* hours commuting \n\n45 miles biking a week at (each way was 7.5 miles so bout 45 min each way, 1.5 hr per day. (So *7.5* hours per week)\n\n*25* hours work per week\n\n*5-10* hrs social life per week \n\n\nTOTAL******\n\n130-145 hours a WEEK. Some of you don't have to work or buy anything and are taking 12 credits to get the minimum full time and just go to class, spend 10 hours a week on homework and the other 90% of your life is fun and games with your friends with your parents money. Personally I'd feel like a leech but we all have our own set of morals.\n\n\n\n\nAnd yall complain about working 10 or 15 hours when your parents have boughten you an apt right next to campus, you don't work, no biking 50 miles a week. You have. You literally have an extra probably 90 hours of freetime a week more than I did if not more.. And you can't work a little part time job. LOL\n\nGuess its just slightly annoying hearing these posts. These people don't understand how overly privileged they are. And they're definitely the ones with Prada or fendi bags and brand name 100$ shirts and 200$ jeans lmao. They're just easy as hell to spot in general. They just give off that \"i can and do do whatever i want to do because I have an endless wallet from *dadddddy*",

          "text": "I can tell this is a subject you're passionate about. It looks like you just misinterpreted my post + added a bunch of assumptions + picked this as a target to take out some frustrations you have about over privileged people.\n\nFirst of all, yes, I have immense privilege. I will never try to argue against that. What I will argue against is the notion that it's wrong for parents to support their children if they can.  As many people have commented on this post, what's the point of generational wealth if not to give the best life to your children that you can? I don't mean buying them fancy cars, designer clothes, giving them a bunch of cash as an allowance or something, as you have assumed about me and unnamed others. I mean ensuring that they have the resources they need to achieve some form of higher education, etc. Part of that is setting them up to where they don't have to work during the school year. I have never worked during school, but I have worked every summer since freshman year. All of this to say, I don't think it's fair to group everyone who doesn't have to work during school into the same group of over spoiled assholes. There's nothing I want more than to be independent from my parents and take $0 from them ASAP. Thus, I go to college to get a decent job in order to support myself.I'm sorry if your experience has only been with \"over spoiled assholes\", as I put it earlier. I assure you most people are actually pretty cool.\n\ntl;dr Not everyone who isn't working is an ungrateful asshole and it's okay for parents to support their kids, within reason.",

              "text": "I get your side of the argument completely. \n\nI'm curious, do you mind saying how many credits you take per semester? Is it the normal full time 15?\n\nIf you want Nothing more than to be independent from your parents and not use their money, why can't you work a job 20 hours a week and at least pay for your own apartment with those funds at the minimum? That would be a huge step towards being \"independent \".  20 hours a week you could be making 1000$ a month. .\n\nYou can't tell me you don't have the time to work 3x during the week days, like a 4 hour shift, qnd then a 4 hour shift Saturday and Sunday. Thats 20 hours right there. You would have PLENTY of time left for studying and school work.\n\nOr is it that it would take away from your \"college experience \"? Aka less hanging out with friends or going to parties\n\nAlso, did I  assume that they buy you expensive cars to drive around in? You're putting words in my mouth and assuming something *I did not say*.\nI said their parents but them a car. Just a car. I never said a bmw, Ferrari, audi,tesla , Mercedes, etc. Expensive cars.\n\nBut yes I did say that its easy to spot the ones who's parents pay for everything.  That doesn't mean that every parent who pays for your education and everything you need to get by for a full year is buying expensive clothes. I said its easy to tell whos parents pay for everything by the people wearing the expensive ass clothes living in expensive apartments (as all on campus are, they're literally playing you for \"ease of being close to classes\". \n\nTheres no way a full time college student has a 1500$ Prada bag qnd a $300 outfit and affords that themselves on a part time job, along with living on a campus apartment. So I just said that THOSE types of people are simple to spot out on campus. Those people probably get a $1000/month allowance for leisure time/going out with friends/getting food. Whatever they wanna spend it on. \nThats not teaching your child any independence lol.\nAs soon as they are struggling or run into an issue they call home and have mommy and daddy sort it out. Those are the type who bug me. The super privileged kids who act like they're so independent and are almost superior in a way with the latest fashion and get daddys credit card to spend as they like. But then on social media they're also the ones complaining about how life is so difficult for them at this time period..like come on\n\n\nI guess this post just made me think of those types of people. \n\nNot saying you are like that, but this post just made me think about all the kids on campus that I've seen who do live and act that way so I commented my annoyance with it.\n\nSorry if it seemed like I was targeting you. That wasn't the case, my bad. It was just a generalized rant",

Don't ever feel guilty for your situation. \n\nIf I did have to work during college and struggle to make ends meet, would I want to make sure that my kid did not have to do the same? Would I want my kid to work out of gaining experience rather than work out of pure necessity to pay for college? Of course. \n\nMy dad must have thought the same. He worked to build a life so that his kids did not have to go through the same struggle and hurt he went through. I don't know why we're given the circumstances that we have in life, but don't fret. If you feel your time could be better spent elsewhere rather than working during college, then do as you feel led. Maybe the universe needs your time spent in a particular way right now. It's okay.",

I really wanted to move out of my parents house since I couldn't stand them, so I got a full time minimum wage job and went to a community college full-time or part-time depending on what classes were available each semester that I wanted. It was stressful and I did ok for a while until I had to work long shifts 12-15 hours my bills went up and I needed a second job and worked another minimum wage job full-time, my classes got harder and I started to have car problems. I ended up losing both jobs and dropping out of college. Even though most of my classes were online, a few were a 45 minute drive away and with all the work I did, I didn't have the time or energy to devote to my school work. I know this is anecdotal and you may not experience the same problems I had, but it quickly escalated to be more than I could handle even though I was confident that I could because school was always easy for me. It was a hard time for me, I got really depressed and it's been a struggle to get back on my feet ever since. I felt like a failure for a long time and tried to think about where I went wrong over and over and I'm honestly still not sure that I actually did anything wrong or that I would've changed anything if I could do it over again. Sometimes shit happens (often actually) and it helps to deal with it if you don't have shitty jobs or having to worry about paying your bills and worrying about having a place to stay.",

Most people would love to be in your position. A lot of my friends who work jobs during the school year get super burnt out or have really accommodating bosses who respect the fact that they're in school. It is not all it is cracked up to be.

Also the fun parts of college are things you can\u2019t experience once you move past college and it\u2019s definitely not worth sacrificing for a job in retail or food.",

Not because I think everyone needs to necessarily work in college; however, having a paid job with low expenses would mean that all of the money you earn you can save. Think about when you graduate and want to move out. Say you have to pay first + last month's rent and a security deposit in your first apartment, plus buy furniture. What money will you use for that? Or if you graduate and you need transportation for your job, what will you do before you earn your first pay check? Will you be able to afford to move to another city when you graduate if you get a job elsewhere? You can get a campus gig that's only 8-15 hours a week, or tutor in your free time. There are lots of options that are highly flexible, only a few hours a week, and could make a world of difference in a few years.\n\nThat being said, take advantage of not needing to work. Put your time into getting the highest grades possible, and put working on the back burner.

Most of the part-time jobs (at least the ones akin to fast-foods/retail) add little value to your resume that another experience cannot already convey.\n\nFinally, I know, for a fact, that scholarship students don't just \"do nothing\" during the school year as the comments are assuming. Typically, they are the type to reach out and become involved in activities/projects within schools and in the community.\n\nIn other words, **you are not irrational to not work during the school year if you do not need to.** This is, of course, my two cents.\n\nedit: Don't be mislead by some of the comments. Do find work experience, but ones that align with internships, tutoring in your field, and/or TA positions in your field. These are the jobs that matter the most, not the ones in fast-food/retail.",

      "text": "My sister and I had very different work/college experiences. She (firstborn) didn't work, and exclusively studied. My parents couldn't afford another daughter not working, so I had a job throughout my entire undergrad. \n\nShe graduated top of her class with honors. I struggled a lot to transition from high school to college and work. But eventually I got it down, had a pretty decent GPA, and liked having a semblance of cash-flow.\n\nNow, we are both graduates. She has zero work experience and is struggling to be hired (pre-COVID). From my connections with the outside world, I have references and people handing out my name to their connections, and I am employed even through the pandemic.\n\nSo I think it's great you don't have to work! Focus on your studies. But maybe consider even a one day per week job, so employers see some semblance of experience. If you're a 1-day barista for 4 years, your resume won't show your hours, but it WILL say, \"I have been a reliable employee to a company for 4 years.\" Which is impressive for a graduate.",

I had a great time in college all throughout, but my freshman year was the only year that I wasn't working a part-time job and it was so much more enjoyable to have that time. This is literally the only time in your life where you'll be able to have a little extra free time without a job and be able to use it however you please and enjoy it guilt-free. I had my tuition covered so I just had to work to be able to afford food and such lol. If I had extra money from a great scholarship like you're describing, I almost definitely wouldn't have worked. Use the time to focus on school and explore who you are as a person. Trading time for money is so ass so if you can avoid it and spend your time in a much more meaningful way and invest in yourself, then it's a no brainer. Consider if you want the extra cash, though. Might be nice to have some money coming in for drinks, going out, buying something fun every once in a while, or saving up for post-grad, etc. Maybe you could even try not working at first, then trying work for a couple months, and seeing if you like how it feels in your schedule.\n\nAlso not sure what you're field of study is, but especially as you become an upperclassman, you're probably going to want to jump on any worthwhile experience or internship that directly relates to what you want to do after college. Like for example if you want to be a software/computer science person, you'll need to look at getting an internship while you're in school, so just keep that in mind",

So something to consider is a directive/independent studies through internships. My uni did that only for business majors, but what it essentially is is the students apply for internships, get them, and then go to the professors and deans and ask if they can use their internship experience to get credits. Essentially those students got credit for taking a class for doing an internship and then usually doing some related project with the professor or something like that documenting the experience. In a way, your work becomes class. For you, that might be the best option to balance not having to work and work around school and the resume experience.\n\nJust something to consider",

But remember that most people aren't as lucky; don't assume everyone else has the same privilege as you. Also remember that, depending on your field of study, it might be worthwhile to have some kind of work experience before you graduate. The last thing you want is to graduate and still have to work minimum wage jobs because you have 0 experience. Your mental and emotional health, as well as your grades/studies, come first (I know what it's like working a job that you hate and coming home crying every day), but I would talk to your college about student jobs/internships where your hours are limited and you work in a field related to your major.",

It gives them a break in their day, allows them to socialize and make a little pocket money. These people only worked maybe 10 hours a week while the people who had to work could be working 15-35+ hours a week. It's one of those things where the people who have to, dont want to, and the people who dont have to, kinda want to.",

They tell me that my job right now is to be in school and do well, and that I shouldn\u2019t struggle doing both school and work if I don\u2019t need to. I think you should absolutely focus on school and not have to worry about job stuff until you need to- online school feels like a job in itself already. Take advantage of the position you\u2019re in and do well in your classes! \n\nPersonally I still choose to work weekends at my job (which is literally just me sitting around entertaining my boss\u2019s dogs and whatever other client dogs we have + some cleaning) just so I can have some money coming in and I can even bring my laptop and do schoolwork while I\u2019m there. But I\u2019m aware most jobs don\u2019t offer that kind of flexibility. I\u2019m hoping this upcoming semester will be good to both of us!",

Some of the best experiences are not paid, mind you.

I only have worked summers, and each summer I usually have a different job (b/c I keep finding jobs that pay better each summer) For some reason the interviewer really didn't like this, I guess because she thought I was one to bounce around jobs a lot. Which, to be fair, is somewhat true, but all the jobs I've had were during summer months, not like I have a new job every month or something.\n\nThanks for your reply and hope you are doing well.",

Focus on school now and doing the best you can to set yourself up after college. While experience is important and you should get work/internship experience in your field, a job that solely pays for expenses and makes you feel like you're doing what you're supposed to is not worth it at all.

By \"work\" I mean a job that is almost exclusively for money, something I should have been more clear on. I fully plan on aggressively applying to internships, job shadowing, etc.  \nPart of my justification for not working through school is that it actually aids my competitiveness post-graduation by freeing my schedule up for more clubs, commitment to school work, and internships.So, in short, I completely agree with you. I plan on working (in a different sense) very hard on school, internships, and everything else that aids one in gainful employment.\n\nP.S. Tone is hard to convey through text. None of this was meant sarcastically and is said without any malice.",

Part of my justification for not working is that it will enable me to pursue internships, shadowing, etc. much more effectively than if I had work + school + everything else. So, for those who would argue that it's necessary to \"work\" (internships, jobs in your field) if you want a job post graduation, I agree. That's a big part of why I don't want to \"work\" (jobs that are just for $ and don't relate to your future career).",

Candidate 1 that has never work a job, but you see they take extracurricular classes in AI and cybersecurity, goes to at least one hackathon every semester, and has a few long-term side projects to show off? Or candidate 2 that decides to spend their free time doing menial work that gives no indication of their qualifications or ability to take the initiative? I say this as an employed 2020 spring grad with hundreds of applications and dozens of interviews: why in the world would I give up ANY real estate on my resume to my time delivering pizzas when I could use that to showcase why I would be qualified for the company. And this doesn't just apply to STEM, but any major. Fudge the menial labor and expand upon related extracurriculars and projects, even school ones if you have to. That's what they look for when comparing yours to the stacks of other candidates, and that's what the ATS systems are looking for. The only time you should ever feel the need to bring up work as a new grad is when you're at an interview and they ask you why you have gaps in your career, which in that case bringing up work is better than nothing.l",

I think most people who are in university and aren't just lounging around, barely passing because of their own lack of effort, already have a good work ethic.

I didn't even report my professor to the department head when she went MIA halfway through the semester and then dumped the second half of the material on us the day before reading day. Other people did, but I was prepared to just do the work. \n\nPersonally I tell new students that they are expected to spend x amount of time, but if they can get away with less, more power to them.

The math behind this is that every credit is about an hour and then in order to successfully study for every credit you have to spend about an hour or two outside of class studying which adds up to that 40 hours  unfortunately because a lot of college students are legal adults we are sometimes responsible for taking care of ourselves financially so we need to also have a job. \nSo ideally yeah no students should have to work and if you are in a in a place where you can do that then it absolutely is recommended.",
