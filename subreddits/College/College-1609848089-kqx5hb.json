I know this might frustrate some people and sound privileged. I don't mean to brag or something like that.I just feel like it is irrational to work during the school year *if I don't have to.*\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nEdit: I don't mean not taking internships, etc. I mean working a job exclusively for money. Part of my justification for not working is that it will enable me to pursue internships, shadowing, etc. much more effectively than if I had work + school + everything else. So, for those who would argue that it's necessary to \"work\" (internships, jobs in your field) if you want a good job post graduation, I agree. That's a big part of why I don't want to \"work\" (jobs that are just for $ and don't relate to my future career).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit2: For anyone interested, my plan is to stop working as soon as winter break is over and using the free time for extra growth. By this I mean reading up on career, putting more effort into school, looking for internships, enjoying life, etc. If I still have time outside of school + extra growth, I might consider tutoring or finding some sort of flexible gig that doesn't take up as much energy as most jobs.  \nI have read almost every comment, and I genuinely appreciate everyone replying. I am very surprised that it's 99% positive and not just people accusing me of bragging about not having to work or something.

Buy all their books and supplies. And give them spending money. You're a full on adult right now. Everyone used to have to do what they had to do to go to and pay for college . Which meant working while schooling to pay school bills. \n\nNowadays parents pay for everything.  I'm curious in 10 years how this generation will be living\n \nAfter college will they be back at parents home living rent free until 3o years old?.\n\nAnyone who lives like this, just realize and be grateful that you have that opportunity cuz 75%+ of us depending on city/state/country don't have that option and have to work to get through school and buy ALL THEIR SUPPLIES.  A place to live, tuition, fees, books, groceries, clothes. Literally everything.\n\n  Anddd then we have you guys that have nothing to worry about . You go to class, do your homework and then every night go out on the town with your parents money and party and that's life. No structure other than class and homework. No independence. Yea you live alone but you aren't supporting yourself.  You may as well live with your parents.\n\nHey no hate, just be grateful for what you have. Like you can't even work 15 hours a week just to have some of your own spending money so yoyr parents don't have to pay you THAT ALSO? I'm sure they'd be proud and 15 hours a week is pitiful if that's too difficult. \n\nI commuted 4 hours a day to and from class 5 days a week. Took 18 credits. *Wrote my thesis on the side*. After class biked to and from work to work 25 hours, biked 15 miles total each day 5 days a week. 3 weekday and 2 weekend days. Plus finding the time to study, do homework and maintain relationships when the university recommends 3 hours of studying and work per credit per week.  So under their guidelines on top of work and school and commuting I should have been studying 54 hours a week ontop of that \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo 54 hours of studying a week, few hours a day of writing my thesis, 25 hours of commuting, 45 miles of biking a qeek, 25 hours of work a week, and having some sort of social life or free time. So without the social life I was expected to do 105 hours a week of school/work/homework and almost 50 miles of biking. Along with the little social life I had.\n\nBreakdown per week\n\nClass 5 days a week, from 1010 am till 230 pm with a 2 hr break per day. (Had online classes too). Physical classes was *12.5* hours per week. 54 hours studying  can just be lumped in with my online classes for simplicity \n\n*54* hours studying \n\n*14* hours/week thesis\n\n*25* hours commuting \n\n45 miles biking a week at (each way was 7.5 miles so bout 45 min each way, 1.5 hr per day. (So *7.5* hours per week)\n\n*25* hours work per week\n\n*5-10* hrs social life per week \n\n\nTOTAL******\n\n130-145 hours a WEEK. Some of you don't have to work or buy anything and are taking 12 credits to get the minimum full time and just go to class, spend 10 hours a week on homework and the other 90% of your life is fun and games with your friends with your parents money. Personally I'd feel like a leech but we all have our own set of morals.\n\n\n\n\nAnd yall complain about working 10 or 15 hours when your parents have boughten you an apt right next to campus, you don't work, no biking 50 miles a week. You have. You literally have an extra probably 90 hours of freetime a week more than I did if not more.. And you can't work a little part time job.

And they're definitely the ones with Prada or fendi bags and brand name 100$ shirts and 200$ jeans lmao. They're just easy as hell to spot in general.

I think it's the smartest decision. I had a 3.8 gpa when I graduated high school, much of college was still easy for me. I really wanted to move out of my parents house since I couldn't stand them, so I got a full time minimum wage job and went to a community college full-time or part-time depending on what classes were available each semester that I wanted. It was stressful and I did ok for a while until I had to work long shifts 12-15 hours my bills went up and I needed a second job and worked another minimum wage job full-time, my classes got harder and I started to have car problems. I ended up losing both jobs and dropping out of college. Even though most of my classes were online, a few were a 45 minute drive away and with all the work I did, I didn't have the time or energy to devote to my school work. I know this is anecdotal and you may not experience the same problems I had, but it quickly escalated to be more than I could handle even though I was confident that I could because school was always easy for me. It was a hard time for me, I got really depressed and it's been a struggle to get back on my feet ever since. I felt like a failure for a long time and tried to think about where I went wrong over and over and I'm honestly still not sure that I actually did anything wrong or that I would've changed anything if I could do it over again.
