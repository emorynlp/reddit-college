So when everything falls into the home work category now, it feels like work has doubled. I, sure many students, especially in lectures, were accustomed to passively sitting in class. Having to set a time to watch videos isn\u2019t the same, and in a way can be more difficult to stay engaged. \n\nAlso, classes often inherently get more difficult as one progresses in college. So a lot of sophomores or juniors probably are taking harder classes than last year, but that would have been the case anyway. So the virus and online learning isn\u2019t to blame.
