  "text": "College has always been fast paced, I know. But this semester especially, I can't keep with my Professor at all.\n\nHis synchronous classes are just him experiencing technical issues and just showing videos. He's not really teaching. We'd be better off just watching the videos if he just posted the links on blackboard and told us what pages to read.\n\nAnd then his asynchronous class is him speeding through the entirety of what we were suppose to learn on the previous class + today.\n\nAm I just complaining over nothing? Yes I should be productive instead of writing this. I already work twice as hard to even stay up to date with my classes in general every semester, but now I feel like I'm working 10 times as hard. \n\nBeing basically forced to teach myself with the textbook, and needing to attend his lectures which are just a collection of YouTube videos that he doesn't even cite thus making me having to take time to archive them myself for later studies",

      "text": "I totally feel you. Something I've been noticing is that professors are so desperate for students to come to class they are actively trying to make it difficult to access the material if you don't come. Despite the fact that the professor takes a video of each class, she won't distribute the recording unless a student has a written note from a prof! Why do that, why not just make the recordings accessible?",

      "text": "Yeah also some professors seem to think that since they are decided to just upload video lectures that they don't have to adhere to a time restriction like normal (despite the class being listed as synchronous they don't do live lectures). So the 1 hour 15 minutes course I signed up for twice a week has almost 4 hours of video lectures posted each week when it should be at most 2 1/2 hours. Just because a prof isn't doing live lectures doesn't mean they should be allowed to upload more content then their allotted time. Its not fair for us to have to do more than what we signed up for, some of us have jobs and other responsibilities and other classes. I could use those extra hours to study for other classes and all that extra material they now suddenly \"have time to teach\" isn't differentiated from the usual material so I feel like I have much more info to review for tests than I should. Some profs have no consideration, if you're going to upload more content then you're supposed to at least differentiate what is important test material and what is just extra material that you want to talk about.",

Other than that they are just grading a few written assignments. Most other assignments and activities are online assessments from the lectures and readings. Last semester I had discussions and other fun activities that I actually learned from. This semester it\u2019s just lectures where no one else speaks but the professors, followed by an exam or quiz and the occasional essay. Professors don\u2019t do much, and they just steam roll us with their daily loads of work.",

You learn the basic shit that will get your body into an interview and thats about it. The rest of your life will require you learn how to teach yourself everything and, even though it sucks, this semester will do far more good for you than any previous semester because you have to hone that skill. If you don't learn that skill and you are in a degree like CS then you know you will probably still be able to get a mediocre job, but you will never go beyond mediocre. If you aren't in a great job market like CS and don't learn that skill, good luck.",

It usually involves having access to answer keys for problems (prof should give them to you after the homework isn\u2019t due).\n\nWalking through the process for many problems enough times will really drive the points home that a teacher in person otherwise may have done. \n\nAs for the lame YouTube videos.

We just had a big storm that caused major power outages in my area that lasted for a few days and I simply emailed asking for an extension on the assignment that was due, since I couldn't use my computer and had limited phone battery, and she told me no because I would be \"missing out on student interaction\" because it was a discussion board. I luckily got my power back the day it was due, but I was pretty pissed regardless.",

As a result, that creates more work just in figuring out how to manage time. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that even though I\u2019m assigning the same quantity of work, and same or easier level of difficulty on tests, students are saying the workload is more. \n\nI think we are used to dividing up \u201cgoing to class\u201d from \u201cdoing homework\u201d. So when everything falls into the home work category now, it feels like work has doubled. I, sure many students, especially in lectures, were accustomed to passively sitting in class. Having to set a time to watch videos isn\u2019t the same, and in a way can be more difficult to stay engaged. \n\nAlso, classes often inherently get more difficult as one progresses in college. So a lot of sophomores or juniors probably are taking harder classes than last year, but that would have been the case anyway. So the virus and online learning isn\u2019t to blame.  Unlike faculty teaching, students don\u2019t have a large sample of years in college to draw from for reference.",

And because she was new to the whole \"college teaching\" thing, she took herself pretty seriously (i.e. no taking pictures of slides). I believe there were about 30 of us in that class, and I know that at least half of us ended up retaking that course later in college. Unfortunately for me, when I took it the second time a couple semesters ago for my Biology minor, I  had a *different* new professor, and ended up with the same grade as I did when I took it the first time (D), along with 2/3 of the class. \n\nThing about it though is that, I've already gotten the necessary grades (B's, mainly) in my 200 and 300 level science courses (got forced into them, even with the initial D) that I need for the 400 level ones. But my uni won't allow me to progress to the 400 level sciences until I rid myself of my D in Biology.\n\nAt this point, I'm gonna just focus on finishing my major and graduating in May '21, because I figure I can always go back to finish the minor, or to pursue a major in Biology at a later date.",

The best classes kept two modules open at a time so we could work ahead. Usually there was a weekly quiz, a discussion post/response, two midterms, a final, and a paper. Each module had a lecture of some sort, assigned reading and any other materials were included in the module.

The over-compensating by assigning extra work is something that I took into account for this semester, but I didn't think it'd be quite this bad. And because there's so much work, most professors have made it very clear that they aren't accepting late submissions. I even still have a group project in 2 courses and, seeing as how we don't even have virtual lectures for one of them, I'm not sure how that's supposed to go. \n\nI am going to try my best not to stress about it so much, but with graduation looming on the horizon, I definitely can't afford to screw-up in any of these classes. \n\nGood luck to you.

Anyways, I got the code from my school library and when I went to put it in the pearson site to redeem it, the site said I had the wrong code. I messaged my professor about it and over the course of 4 weeks she didn't do anything. She said she emailed the code I sent her to pearson, but I still didn't have access. So today I finally decided to just fix it myself. Contacted pearson, explained what was going on, and they converted my code into a code I could actually use and now I have access to the book. \n\nOnly problem now Is that I can't turn in last week's assignments because they are past due!

I think maybe the dinosaurs are having difficulty understanding how hard it is to juggle everything while also being stuck doing things at home. \n\nThis makes me feel a bit better. My course is set up just like your prof's, except I don't do weekly discussions. There are more written components, because I can't have students leaving my first year social sciences class without knowing how to compose a basic argument and find sources.\n\nThat said, I'm making sure that they have the tools they need to do these things (having a librarian give a talk, opening up lines of communication with our subject librarian, having a Discord server so they can ping me and talk to one another, etc).\n\nI had my class take a vote via Zoom poll on Wednesday, and to my expectation, the vast majority wanted entirely synchronous classes. So that's what we're doing. With recordings uploaded afterward, of course--I wouldn't expect everyone to stick to the same schedule.\n\nI hope that as a collective this forces academia to engage in some critical self reflection. However, for all the theorizing that goes on in the academy, precious little of it is oriented towards the student experience and pedagogy. Best of luck with your term!",

So there is a disconnect there, I think.\n\nYeah, I feel that. In sociology we refer to this as stripping back role insulation. Despite learning remotely, students feel more surveiled and more pressured into doing all the readings, MindTaps, whatevers, every week so they can demonstrate they've done them in an online forum. There is now a higher demand to impression manage, and I don't think Teaching and Learning centres accounted for that. When students have to juggle 4 or 5 classes in a semester, it can feel like a lot to keep up, whereas in the Before Era, they could sort of let one or two slide a bit, and then catch back up once other fires had been put out. IOW, they had more role insulation since the profs *presumed* they had read the material first and no song and dance was required.\n\nLast year, I told my intro soc class to be straight with me when I asked them about who was caught up on readings. I didn't judge, and by the time winter came around they trusted me enough. I shit you not, about ~20% of them were actually caught up at any given time. I wonder how typical that is.",

What I did was find a friend who had taken the class with the same teacher in a previous semester and asked if they would share the notes they took. That way, I have everything written down and can follow along with my prof's lectures without getting bogged down trying to take notes.",

      "text": "Honestly, any concerns you have about this semester are entirely valid. Nobody in college right now has taken classes amid a global pandemic, recession, and climate crisis happening all at once. Even if classes were delivered in the exact same way as last fall, things would still feel different and more challenging. Don't be so hard on yourself.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, I'm having similar issues. My lectures have been okay, but my professors have been bombarding me with Zoom links, Google Drive folders, and assignment files, and it's definitely been more difficult for me to be organized and feel 'on top' of things.\n\nWhat's been helpful for me is connecting with classmates. I'm part of a Discord server and GroupMe chat for one of my classes, and many people in them are just as lost and overwhelmed as I am. You're definitely not alone.",
