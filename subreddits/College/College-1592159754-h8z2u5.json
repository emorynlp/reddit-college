I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something \"useless\" or \"easy\" or \"low-paying\" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.\n\n1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the \"useless\" majors have that you could never dream of.\n2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others \"wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?\" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can \"just do.\" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.\n3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.\n4. Just because you think your major is \"hard\" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are \"easy.\" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called \"easy\" majors.\n5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because \"it's going to get me money\" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.\n6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.\n\nIn conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money.

Why? \nI was on track to graduate with a business major, go to grad school, get employed for a good starting salary, but I realized my real passion was acting. It always has been, but in this pandemic, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve missed the most and what I can\u2019t wait to learn more about. \n\nI\u2019m not your typical theatre student. I\u2019m a 4.0 GPA honors student who has gone through about 3 different majors before finally deciding on a plan. Shoutout to all the AP credit from high school for giving me that wiggle room. This isn\u2019t meant to discredit anyone. It\u2019s just to show that not everyone in a field fits the stereotype of a field. We\u2019re all different. \n\nOne day, an advisor told me I can go to grad school for something I didn\u2019t major in and my entire world changed. More advisors began telling me the same thing, so I did my own research and thought what\u2019s stopping me from just doing theatre now and doing something else later if it doesn\u2019t work out like I hoped? \n\nImmediately, I found a musical theatre undergrad at my school who is getting her MBA. I reached out to her and heard about her experiences in a life of acting, how it was hard, but she wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything and knew she could always go back to school for something more stable. \n\nThat\u2019s my plan now. Major in theatre now and attempt acting (specifically voice acting) while I\u2019m young, and go get a masters in marketing or business when I\u2019m older. I\u2019ll finish my business minor alongside taking theatre classes (and also Spanish classes for a double major in Spanish because I like Spanish too). Luckily, I\u2019m fortunate enough that the majority of my college is paid for by scholarships, so I feel even safer doing this. \n\nBottom line is the people with majors that are \u201chard to get a job in\u201d know the risks, but we\u2019d rather take the risk doing something we love than be miserable for the rest of our lives doing something that is \u201cfinancially stable\u201d It took me over 2 years to finally cave in and major in what I\u2019m passionate about. It\u2019ll already be an uphill battle getting a theatre degree from a school that\u2019s not exactly in the top 10 theatre schools, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make it work. I don\u2019t need to be reminded or ridiculed by someone who doesn\u2019t know me or my story. It\u2019s my life, not yours. \nThe most important thing that comes from college are the life skills, the friendships, and the experience.

At the same time, most folks these days fool themselves when it comes to college and what it's about. \n\nA \"STEM degree\" doesn't make you an engineer or other professional anymore than a law degree makes you a lawyer. They're all academic credentials that merely give the holder of the degree an opportunity to enter an otherwise tightly regulated market. Once you're in, no one cares about your academic training - you prove your worth (or not) by your performance. As it stands, the vast majority of STEM grads suck as professionals at first. They have no sense of context or problem solving, approach everything like it's a textbook exercise, don't recognize and account for complexity, and assume they know more than they actually do. Experienced professionals laugh or cringe behind their backs, although the better ones step up and mentor. \n\nPlus, the bullshit attitude of contempt toward non-STEM majors often carries over to the skill sets many STEM grads bring from college (or don't): poor writing, lack of critical reading ability, bad oral communication, inability to collaborate and work in teams with employees from elsewhere on the org chart - the stuff that professionals spend much of their time actually doing on the job and the sorts of abilities humanities/social science majors concentrate on.

Either way, a) do the actual work and learn something, b) keep your college debt reasonable, c) figure out (some of) who you are, so you'll recognize what makes you happy, and be prepared to have everything change, no matter carefully and confidently you planned it out at 18 or 21.

If someone fucks up in the control room the plant is most certainly not going to explode the second a mistake happens, nor would it even explode! The reactor would shut itself down either by human control or by one of the many automated systems, which have quite a few ways to keep it stable! Also, just because you're working at nuclear plant doesn't mean you're constantly getting dose. There are clear designated areas where contamination and radiation could be and is, with varying levels of intensity. Also, nuclear is most certainly not unprofitable.
