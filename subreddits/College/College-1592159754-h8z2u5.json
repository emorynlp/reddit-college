  "title:": "Stop looking down on people for their choice of major",
  "text": " I am tired of people telling me that my major is \"useless\" and that I'll never use it in the real world if I don't go to grad school. I'm tired of people judging me for spending MY money (I pay for my own college, my parents don't help out) on something that I enjoy doing. I'm tired of people judging others for majoring in something \"useless\" or \"easy\" or \"low-paying\" while being completely ignorant of what others go through. So, to all the people who have majors that correlate to well-paying, specific entry-level jobs post-college and constantly berate others for trying to live THEIR lives, pay close attention.\n\n1. Not everyone wants to do what you do. Do you ever think about that? We don't all want to be software engineers or nurses or business analysts etc. People have different interests and enjoy having the freedom to pursue those interests. If people want to study anthro, let them do it. If they want to study music, let them! Don't be an asshole. You would be surprised by all of the opportunities you don't know exist that people in the \"useless\" majors have that you could never dream of.\n2. Not everyone has the aptitude for it. Yeah, I'm tired of hearing people tell others \"wHY diDN't yoU JuST do ENGinEEriNG?\" as if they know the person they are telling this to better than they know themselves. Stuff like that requires a higher level of understanding of math and science that not everyone can \"just do.\" Just because it's easy for you or you are driven to succeed in it doesn't mean everyone else can. Forcing people into engineering or comp sci (for example) when they aren't good at math or coding only for them to get a 2.2 GPA and learn nothing and not get any internships because of their horrendous academic performance isn't going to do anyone any good.\n3. Going off of the last point, just because someone isn't cut out for a certain major doesn't make them stupid. We are all different and we are all naturally good at different things. For example, I hate public speaking and being in front of people. I would be an awful performing arts/theatre major. Does that make me stupid? Of course not. I am not a big fan of working with kids all day. I know for a fact I would not be able to handle majoring in elementary education. Does not being able to handle the elementary ed curriculum make me a failure? No, it doesn't. Everyone has their own limitations and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I would like you to consider how well you would do if you were suddenly placed in a major like that.\n4. Just because you think your major is \"hard\" that doesn't automatically mean everyone else's majors are \"easy.\" I get it, especially as a science major myself. We tend to think that we are on more difficult path because of the coursework. However, that doesn't mean ours is harder, it just means it's hard in a different way. For instance, philosophy majors have to become really good at critical thought, which is an excellent skill to have and something most of us are severely lacking. Education majors have to become very knowledgeable in a subject area and be able to teach it to kids/teens/etc, which is something I think would be incredibly difficult. Classics majors, depending on the school, develop a high level of understanding of Greek and Latin and learn to write well in these languages, which is an amazing ability because writing in English is already hard enough. I encourage you all to check out the curriculums of these so-called \"easy\" majors.\n5. Not everyone is motivated by money. Yes, money is good, I agree. However, there are people out there that want to pursue something they are passionate about and couldn't care less how much it paid. It is far better to study something you want to study and take a lower paying job and being happy with it than it is to study something just because \"it's going to get me money\" and then be miserable for the next 40 years of your life.\n6. You don't have to go into the field that you majored in. I know this is gonna be a hard pill for all you specific entry level job majors to swallow, but it's true. You can take the skills you learned in any major and apply them broadly. If you know how to market yourself and you take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to you or the one's that you seek out, then you will be fine. Do you honestly think people don't have a plan? Yes, I am sure some don't, but the majority do have some sort of direction they are looking towards going and they have a college degree to help them out.\n\nIn conclusion, stop judging people for choosing what THEY want to do with THEIR college experience. All majors are respectable and offer something unique to the world. No major is useless and no major is easy and some people want more out of life than money. I can already see what the comments section is going to look like now: \"bUt maJOrInG in EnLIsH/tHEaTRe/mUSIc/PoliSCI/BioLOGy/whateverelsepeoplethinkisuselesswithoutgoingtogradschool Is NoT SMArt BecAUSe YoU wONt MaKE moNEy & tHEn YoU WOnt gET a JoB in THat FielD.\" Forget those people, they'll never learn.",

Majoring in music is ok if you get a job as a teacher, same with art. I can't think of many other options for those last 2 majors besides graphic design for art or if your really really good at music then a professional orchestra. But in general they are hard to get a job in and less rewarding monetarily. The reason people look down on them is because a lot of losers spend their parents money on them, then work at Walmart as a cashier and taint the others reputation.",

      "text": "This. \nI switched to a theatre major a few months ago. Why? \nI was on track to graduate with a business major, go to grad school, get employed for a good starting salary, but I realized my real passion was acting. It always has been, but in this pandemic, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve missed the most and what I can\u2019t wait to learn more about. \n\nI\u2019m not your typical theatre student. I\u2019m a 4.0 GPA honors student who has gone through about 3 different majors before finally deciding on a plan. Shoutout to all the AP credit from high school for giving me that wiggle room. This isn\u2019t meant to discredit anyone. It\u2019s just to show that not everyone in a field fits the stereotype of a field. We\u2019re all different. \n\nOne day, an advisor told me I can go to grad school for something I didn\u2019t major in and my entire world changed. More advisors began telling me the same thing, so I did my own research and thought what\u2019s stopping me from just doing theatre now and doing something else later if it doesn\u2019t work out like I hoped? \n\nImmediately, I found a musical theatre undergrad at my school who is getting her MBA. I reached out to her and heard about her experiences in a life of acting, how it was hard, but she wouldn\u2019t give it up for anything and knew she could always go back to school for something more stable. \n\nThat\u2019s my plan now. Major in theatre now and attempt acting (specifically voice acting) while I\u2019m young, and go get a masters in marketing or business when I\u2019m older. I\u2019ll finish my business minor alongside taking theatre classes (and also Spanish classes for a double major in Spanish because I like Spanish too). Luckily, I\u2019m fortunate enough that the majority of my college is paid for by scholarships, so I feel even safer doing this. \n\nBottom line is the people with majors that are \u201chard to get a job in\u201d know the risks, but we\u2019d rather take the risk doing something we love than be miserable for the rest of our lives doing something that is \u201cfinancially stable\u201d It took me over 2 years to finally cave in and major in what I\u2019m passionate about. It\u2019ll already be an uphill battle getting a theatre degree from a school that\u2019s not exactly in the top 10 theatre schools, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make it work. I don\u2019t need to be reminded or ridiculed by someone who doesn\u2019t know me or my story. It\u2019s my life, not yours. \nThe most important thing that comes from college are the life skills, the friendships, and the experience. Not the degree.",

Imagine how much you would be stressed if you had $120k+ in student loan debt and had to pay it off on that salary. \n\nIf you are passionate about the fine arts or humanities, then it might make more financial sense to go to community college first, and then transfer into a 4 year.",

For instance, it's perfectly fine to major in Music or Art History if you want to work in those fields. However, if you apply for engineering jobs or business analyst roles, the odds are going to be against you. It's not impossible, but it will be difficult for you to get an interview as a Art History major for a financial analyst internship as opposed to someone who is Business Administration or Economics major.\n\nAs long as you're not trying to cross into something else, it's no problem.\n\nAlso there's a lot of bad advice in this thread. There is some validity to the argument of a \"useless\" degree, but it all points back to what is your goal. If your goal is to work in graphic design or UX/UI, then yes majoring in Art or Design is perfect and valuable. If your goal is to work in digital marketing for a big tech or media company, then majoring in Sociology or History is not going to be very useful to help you get there.

Also, you can have a STEM degree, and still have trouble getting a job. \n\nYou need to follow your passions because you don\u2019t want to hate what you study. I\u2019ve seen some many people study in demand degrees all because they were afraid of a humanities degree not being \u201cgood enough\u201d. They\u2019re miserable in college too. Just go with your heart, and have a plan in mind, and everything should work out.",

The reason people make a big deal about it is to encourage you to pick a marketable major rather than one without a demand to avoid you going into debt/depression. You can be optimistic all you want until you realize that debt bill after graduation. It's time to wake up and come to realize that it DOES matter what major you pick. Hopefully this post won't delude any other useless major students here because that's what it'll prolly end up doing -- giving the wrong message to innocent students.\n\nI don't care what anybody says or if I get downvoted. The facts are here. Pick a marketable major, get internships/experience while in college and you'll be set. Build that resume and get connections by networking with people in your field. **The point of college for 90% of people is to get a job.** Let's do our best to assure that, ok?\n\nEveryone else who is rich and goes to college \"for the experience\" can keep doing what they want. But if you're a broke ass college student stacking up debt, I suggest you think different than the OP.",

These are my views, but I don't broadcast them.\n\nWe have an entire generation asking to get bailed out for their poor education decisions. I think we should bail them out, ish... Maybe $100 of debt per hour community service, tutoring, things that BLM is asking for. I think they make poor decisions because they got bad data, some we're lied to, some misunderstood.\n\nThe point is, we're being asked to support a huge amount of people who took out huge loans for loans that have a very low ROI. You say you pay for your own school, but unless you already have a high paying job, you aren't paying now, you are taking loans. Considering that right now, the whole country is being asked to bail out people who walked the same path as you, I think it's entirely reasonable for the people who are footing the bill to be concerned about your degree choices.\n\nCollege is not a hobby. The point of college is to prepare you for a job. If you don't want a job in that field, you can audit the course without paying for it. You can... Read books and do your own studies. \n\nI don't believe in useless degrees... I think the people choosing the degree without a plan to pay for the degree are useless. Given the massive amount of recent graduates that are not able to pay back their loans, even before Corona, I will continue to judge people (silently) choosing degrees with a very limited future... At least, until they've shown they're different than the people whose useless degrees I'm paying for right now (... Well, I'm voting for candidates who support bailing them out, so I'm preemptively getting up on my high horse... Again, silently, to myself)",

Or your family can provide you free room and board indefinitely.\n\nIt doesn't matter what your major is, if your father can get you a job by calling up one of his golf buddies. Or you have other connections to the job and/or company you want. \n\nIt doesn't matter what your major is, if you can afford to work for free or less than minimum wage to gain experience in your career field(s) of interest.\n\nThe more privilege you have, the less your major matters. For those who are less privileged, major absolutely does matter, because an in-demand vocational major teaches the skills and experience necessary in order to get one's foot in the door for a living wage job. Privileged people can obtain these skills and experience through internships and networking.\n\nYes, anyone can network. But it's a lot harder for underprivileged people, who aren't born into well-connected families, and don't have as much experience interacting with the kind of people who can help them get a foot in the door. Not to mention autistic people, who may be perfectly capable and talented but struggle with the social interaction required for successful networking.\n\nI graduated with a liberal arts BA over a decade ago, and as the first in my family to get a college degree, I got to learn all of this the hard way. There's a reason why so many people advise against choosing a college major that's not in demand with employers - because too many people can't afford to make the wrong choice.",

      "text": "I agree. As an economics graduate, I totally regret choosing this academic route and pursued it mostly to be marketable to employers. I never felt passionate about my coursework, never really connected with my professors, and didn\u2019t feel satisfied. Now, if I had chosen a route that I feel more passionate about but not necessarily in the \u201cdesirable\u201d and \u201cuseful\u201d major selections, e.g. sociology or anthropology, I wonder if the outcome would have been different. Also this is an advice my economics professor had told me: it\u2019s better to be the best than mediocre in your academic choosing. \n\nSo don\u2019t go for the traditional and expected major because also skills are transferable. In sociology and psychology, you gain research method experience and skills in different tools like R or SPSS. I\u2019ve actually seen many desirable non-tech jobs requiring some of these skills. Philosophy, which people are uninformed about and shit on, leads to super lucrative pathways as well. You also gain critical thinking skills. There are other majors where you can extract transferable skills. With that said, unless you\u2019re going into a career that requires a specialized degree like Nursing or PharmD, I would say that major really doesn\u2019t matter. And it\u2019s also better to stand out and bring a unique perspective to the table; numerous psychological studies show a correlation between diverse employees and company success.",

      "text": "College is expensive these days, and the economy is changing in ways no one can fully predict, so students and those that care about them naturally feel anxious and want a sense of security as fast as possible. At the same time, most folks these days fool themselves when it comes to college and what it's about. \n\nA \"STEM degree\" doesn't make you an engineer or other professional anymore than a law degree makes you a lawyer. They're all academic credentials that merely give the holder of the degree an opportunity to enter an otherwise tightly regulated market. Once you're in, no one cares about your academic training - you prove your worth (or not) by your performance. As it stands, the vast majority of STEM grads suck as professionals at first. They have no sense of context or problem solving, approach everything like it's a textbook exercise, don't recognize and account for complexity, and assume they know more than they actually do. Experienced professionals laugh or cringe behind their backs, although the better ones step up and mentor. \n\nPlus, the bullshit attitude of contempt toward non-STEM majors often carries over to the skill sets many STEM grads bring from college (or don't): poor writing, lack of critical reading ability, bad oral communication, inability to collaborate and work in teams with employees from elsewhere on the org chart - the stuff that professionals spend much of their time actually doing on the job and the sorts of abilities humanities/social science majors concentrate on. Not surprisingly, there's an entire field of professional communication specialists employed by companies to help the STEM grads learn this stuff; it costs a lot to do (and can pay reasonably well). \n\nIn the end, the sorts of judgments OP rightly complains about go in the same category as all the petty gossiping in high school - it's therapy for insecure young people faced with the challenges of adulthood and all the anxiety that brings. It will mean very little in the future. If you want to major in STEM, go for it; if you don't, pick something else that matters. Either way, a) do the actual work and learn something, b) keep your college debt reasonable, c) figure out (some of) who you are, so you'll recognize what makes you happy, and be prepared to have everything change, no matter carefully and confidently you planned it out at 18 or 21. (Government statistics suggest that most workers change careers, not just jobs, multiple times before they retire.) \n\nIf you're doing the right thing for the right reason, you'll be glad for others, even/especially if they chose something different.",

But then when it was time to present, they flip the script and they are excellent public speakers or they are amazing artists or whatever else. Like, bro? Major in what you\u2019re good at. I get that software engineers make a lot of money on average, but if you\u2019re not good at, you\u2019ll stay broke. It\u2019s a meritocracy in tech. That\u2019s just how it is. \n\nI\u2019ve always been of the mind that if you\u2019re going to college, use it to enhance what you are naturally gifted in. If that mean not going to college, even better! It\u2019s a scam anyway. I only got the degree so I could be taken seriously in my field. I didn\u2019t learn anything in class. Often the curriculum was outdated and useless (XML in \u2018emerging tech\u2019? Come on...). \n\nAlso, I respected the hell out of the non traditional students that came back just because they wanted to learn something new. That was so cool. \n\nSure, I don\u2019t get some of the liberal arts stuff. It seemed like a waste of time to me. But if someone didn\u2019t study ancient Egyptians history, we\u2019d forget about it and so it\u2019s valuable to society.",

You'd never believe it, but before the pandemic when I would tell people that that was my major, I was hit with \"That's it? Why not be a doctor? Why settle for less? Doctors get paid more!\" Insane, right? They're two completely different career paths! \n\nThen the pandemic happens and suddenly nurses are praised everywhere for being heroes. AKA, finally getting the praise and recognition that they deserve. They were heroes before and still are. Makes me say \"haha\" to the people who looked down on me.\n\nI add this because society shifts and values in the workforce change.

In our country, a lot would agree they would rather choose something that would give them money instead of doing something they enjoy. It also depends on the individual. If you're that type of person who likes pursuing what you enjoy, then do it. \n\n2. It also saves time when you pursue a degree that fits your skills. Although there are some people who are passionate but not good with the degree they chose, it depends on how they manage it.\n\n3. Refer to #2. \n\n4. As a person who deals with political philosophy, you're right. It's not easy as just reading it. It takes a lot of comprehension and critical thinking to understand philosophy. I just laugh when other students say it's easy to write and read. \n\n5. Maybe. Depends on the context. I just think it's important to follow money as well as doing something that satisfies you. \n\n6. Indeed, I am trying to adopt this mindset. It's also important to be open-minded.\n\nUseless or not, doesn't matter. In the end, it's how you make with what you've got.",

Same thing with coding or anything difficult. \"Natural talent\" is overrated, working hard to overcome is where it's at. But nobody wants to put in the work. STEM majors aren't all necessarily smarter, they're just mentally stronger and more willing to put in the work to succeed. \n\nAnybody who's majored in engineering, computer science, premed, and all the majors with astronomically high drop rates will have seen this. High school valedictorians and straight A students get reduced to tears and end up switching to non-STEM majors just like the C students. When you're used to having things come easy to you, having to actually put in work for something all of a sudden will be a big shock. People can't handle and just give up. Same thing with people in high school where people just need to put a bit of effort in it to do well. But when they get to college, where you actually have to put in the bulk of your work and study outside of class, they fold. It's too common of a story here.",

I use to be biochem but had to get hospitalized in a mental facility just to realize that I didn\u2019t WANT to do biochem for the rest of my life. I was so stressed trying to keep my GPA up,study, network, etc. and the entire time I was miserable and mostly dreading the courses that I would have to take after I finished the ones I was taking. I don\u2019t like math or chemistry and 80% of my coursework was gonna be-you guesses it- math and chemistry. \n\nI liked the IDEA of biochem and I even enjoyed my more biology-specific classes. I wanted to be a pathologist or cardio thoracic surgeon and loved watching surgeries and reading about diseases. But I never showed up to bio only really went to labs (bc I had to)and put more effort into my gen-Ed\u2019s than I did my core classes. I decided to double major in Asian Studies and biochem after i took some courses for my Chinese Studies minor (I\u2019ve been a Chinese studies minor since the beginning) and I just...fell in love with the coursework. But I held on to biochem until I was literally thinking about killing myself because I didn\u2019t understand a topic no matter how much I studied or how many videos I watched or how many questions I asked my peers and my instructor. \n\nI tacked on English because I love to read and analyze literature. AND HOLY FUCK has my college experience just taken off. I\u2019m engaged in class, I enjoy my readings, and I WANT to visit my teachers during their office hours. I felt more understood and happy with one semester of just English and Asian Studies courses that you\u2019d think I\u2019d switched colleges or something with how different my experience was. Ironically, the coursework is more challenging and harder for me but it\u2019s a good kind of stress. \n\nAbout your point when it comes to careers: I\u2019m here to be content and comfortable. I\u2019m black, gen Z, and a woman soooo I\u2019ve honestly given up on trying to achieve the standard \u201cAmerican dream\u201d that\u2019s been shoved down my throat all my life. After I stopped trying to be like whatever I\u2019ve been told to be like, life has been so much more lonely but also enriching and just...relaxing. I wanna go live in East Asia and just...chill and eat good food and meet cool people. As long as I have food in my belly and my fridge, my family is good, and I\u2019m mentally stable (more or less) then life is fucking perfect. People ask me why I wanna go live in Asia and what I\u2019m gonna do (and why I\u2019m majoring in what I\u2019m majoring in and what I\u2019m gonna do) and it\u2019s like fuck man, I\u2019m just gonna exist ya know.",

I think most people who consider themselves weak at math/cs can very reasonably improve a ton. \n\nI've done tutoring throughout college/high school and have had many people improve a lot over just a semester. The most common issue is weak fundamentals as math builds heavily on itself (which is why failing calc tends to be more algebra struggling than calc ideas). Going back to fill back fundamentals may be time consuming but can open a lot of options. If you don't want to major in stem because you dislike/prefer a different area, I fully support that. If your primary reason for not picking a stem major is math, I think most of the time rebuilding your foundations either by yourself or a tutor will give you a solid path to do the rest of your coursework well and it's a bad choice to let that be the reason for not going down a stem path.",

It's that you shouldn't be paying so much and or going into debt for it if it isn't going to pay well. \n\nSay for instance, If your going to be a graphic designer you really don't need college, let alone anything private. If people are saying this at a low cost public school yeah it's stupid, but I would argue it isn't if your at a private or out of state and your major won't net you equivalent pay then you are just wasting money and time. That's the only time I find it acceptable to judge someone for that. You don't need to spend 100k to go get your psychology/art/etc. Especially if you need grad school to make the degree useful. You should not be paying more than $10k-$15k a year.\n\nEssentially, I will (at least subconsciously) judge you if your paying significantly out of your pocket for a degree that won't net you good money. Because you are either wasting your own money, you parents money, or your future money (sometimes all 3) and that makes you either stupid and or incredibly spoiled/ungrateful for your parents (in the case of taking money from them to pay). That's just bad character and shows immaturity. Saying that to someone doing that is stupid and is being an ass but thinking that isn't wrong in most cases.

But then four years later I found myself not hearing back from a single entry-level job in my field, with ultimately little to show for all my undergraduate efforts. I did get some pushback from family and family friends, but it was always \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, become a doctor or lawyer instead\u201d, advice which I promptly ignored as neither career paths interested me. A more balanced recommendation to systematically evaluate placement and career prospects would have been much more helpful.

Like, I get it. The nuclear power plant industry isn't exactly booming nor is it as grossly over-subsidized like wind or solar, but it still has proven to be profitable and is not going away. \n\nPeople look at me with a frown on their face saying:\n\n\"Don't you know wind and solar are gaining more traction and will one day make nuclear power irrelevant?\"\n\n\"Don't you know that nuclear power is dangerous? Do you want to die of radiation poisoning?\"\n\n\"Don't you know nuclear power is unprofitable?\"\n\nFUCKING. NO.\n\nI am tired of ignorant pieces of FILTH try explaining things to me that I know are factually wrong. Maybe one day wind and solar will be better than nuclear but certainly not in my lifetime and possibly longer than that. Nuclear power is also not dangerous when done safely. Literally everything in a nuclear plant has a redundancy. If someone fucks up in the control room the plant is most certainly not going to explode the second a mistake happens, nor would it even explode! The reactor would shut itself down either by human control or by one of the many automated systems, which have quite a few ways to keep it stable! Also, just because you're working at nuclear plant doesn't mean you're constantly getting dose. There are clear designated areas where contamination and radiation could be and is, with varying levels of intensity. Also, nuclear is most certainly not unprofitable. It does take a lot of money to build one but the money it generates easily pays that back.\n\nAll in all I blame the media for giving nuclear power a bad name. And sorry for the rant, I'm reading what I just wrote and I got pretty angry. So I completely understand the anger you're expressing, there is certainly alot of degree and major bias in colleges. It sickens me.",

It\u2019s not about the major, it\u2019s about what you do with it, and the skills you obtain from it. You don\u2019t need a STEM degree to be successful. You can major in the humanities, and still end up down a great path. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed on Reddit, a lot of people will \u201cwarn\u201d you about humanities degrees, and basically almost scare people. They make it seem as if it\u2019s horrendous to go for such a degree. Like your life is ruined if you do it. But that\u2019s not the case at all.\n\nYou can major in STEM, and even end up without a job, so the degree doesn\u2019t matter whatsoever. For instance, I plan on majoring in history/philosophy. And I\u2019ve heard of lots of people with these degrees going on to own businesses, becoming analysts, etc. Things not even related to them necessarily. They were able to get these jobs from the skills they gathered during college.\n\nHumanities can also teach you useful skills too. You just have to make sure you have some kind of path in mind, and you should be good. Never study anything you don\u2019t like/have a passion for because you\u2019ll dread every second of it. It\u2019ll also be way easier to learn during college.\n\nDo what makes you happy, if you love history, Major in that. If you love science, then do that. Just don\u2019t get into a degree you\u2019ll loathe. This is a mistake too many people make. Then, they end up regretting their major choice. Or anything around those lines.",

My art degree can get me into a ton of entry level marketing, industrial product designs, game design, etc. Greek puts me into a position for translation (probably part time due to a lack of Greek translation needed) while I work on expanding my language skills. Im also minoring in creative writing and game studies so I have further entry in marketing and game design. Will it take time finding a job solely in one of my fields, probably yes. But there are so many interconnected fields that it\u2019s laughable if I can\u2019t find a job at all. Plus I have military experience so there is always that as a fallback plan.",

For example, I\u2019ve been to two colleges: one was so small we shared the space with an all girl prep school, the other was \u201csmall\u201d but kind of huge, if that makes sense. At the first school, if you wanted to do Criminal justice and biology as two majors, you could. At my new school, you couldn\u2019t because those are two different colleges and you can only be a member of one college and take majors in that college. I go to the college of arts and sciences, so if I want to do English and biology I could, but if I wanted to do English and marketing I can\u2019t because marketing falls under the business school. \n\nBut I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t, and sorry if reddit makes me sound condescending. It\u2019s a really fun major. It can be controversial at times and arguments erupt but it\u2019s a good field of study.",

I pulled out of art in high school because my teachers did exactly that. It wasn't only about painting and drawing. For the senior project you had to design how a certain product will look, and not just one, like a whole line of them and while it could have been an incredibly fun thing to do (which I know regret a little about dropping) I was all like: \"Yeah I just wanted to draw, I'm too lazy to do all this, I'm not even that original about coming up with my own designs.\"",

          "text": "The reason art majors are 'useless' is because art *degrees* are (mostly) useless. The only real reason to get a *degree* in art is if you plan on teaching it.\n\nAll that really matters for building a career in the arts is whether you can do the work - and this is fairly easy to demonstrate via your portfolio. Whether you're getting a job as an actor, drawing commercial artwork or performing music, what matters isn't some piece of paper on the wall but whether you can actually do the job.\n\nThat doesn't mean it can't be useful to attend an arts college. If you live in Poughkeepsie, it's a large harder to get a foot in the door of the fashion industry than if you're living in New York City and working alongside people who know fashion industry insiders.\n\nThere are also a lot of art fields dependent on collective effort - music and drama most notably - where simply being surrounded by the people who are also interested in it will be incredibly useful.\n\n> who you think animates all the movies\n\nThis is actually more of a hybrid discipline these days. Non-CGI animation is becoming increasingly scarce and is primarily done by low-paid people in foreign countries. CGI Animation requires a considerable mathematical background that you're not going to get in a conventional arts curriculum.\n\n> Who designs the cars you drive\n\nThe answer to this is 'engineers'. While there are aesthetic elements to the design of a car, they are subordinate to the practical engineering elements. At best, you'll turn the design over to artists at the end and tell them \"make it look as good as you can given the constraint you can't actually change anything\".\n\n> the table in your house\n\nMostly engineers and tradesmen. Most furniture is design for functionality first. The really ornate pieces you see are primarily done by artisans who, again, are not the people who get art degrees.",

However you are unaware of the work that goes into many things. \n\n 2d animation work is done all over the US, though specific studios I'm aware of are in Los Angeles and Dallas. Netflix, cartoon network, Powerhouse Animation, Frederator are just some examples. Really check out Samuel Deats @SamuelDeats on twitter to see some of the amazing animation they're doing in Texas. \n\nTechnology in animation has advanced, so not much is pure frame by frame animation anymore. Also not every job in animation is Animator. There's storyboard artists, concept artists, background artist, colorist, ect ect. (You can also find storyboard artists and concept artists working in the movie industry). \n\nThat car acomment is ignorant. For nearly every product you see theres an artist behind it whose done hundreds of mockups and concepts. If people made cars for function alone we'd have some boring looking cars, people will buy cars because they like how they look in addition to how they run. (In many cases how they look goes above how they run)\n\n\n\n I can't address everything you responded here but I hope this gives some insight to the work that goes into products you consume.",

It is an art, however can be applied to tileworks, industrial ceramic production such as high speed drill bits and insulators, high end pottery, or bathroom fixtures to say the minimum. And that\u2019s the tip of the iceberg! One can even use their ceramics degree to model cars out of clay (yes the whole car, not just pieces) and produce molds for the individual components therein. I know several people that have gone to an art school that takes almost 70% of each graduating class to the big three auto makers in the US. \n\nIndustrial Design students are in an art field. Who do you think designed your kitchen table for mass production? The coffee table for easy assembly? Even in companies like Johnson & Johnson, surgical tools need an industrial designer in ergonomics for surgeons to hold tools for long periods. This is the field that promotes ergonomics. If a chair wasn\u2019t comfortable or looked nice, would you buy it? Do you see many people that have chairs from a high school at their house? \n\nI can\u2019t speak for CGI too much, but it takes a ton of graphic design and freehand drawing know-how to render objects in Blender. Not to mention the mental gymnastics required to understand a client\u2019s requests and make changes on the fly. \n\nAnd lastly, portfolios are great for assessing a candidate\u2019s potential, however they need to show they have the base skills required to make a significant addition to the team. Those are learned in school and are seldom taught on the job. Those skills come with the art *degree*.",

Sometimes they'll call themselves directors but they're not and you can crosscheck them with IATSE (there's a director's guild branch and an animation guild branch). \n\nMost of us in animation, vizdev, and production for sure don't know or are related to anyone up top. These jobs are way too competitive and require as much skill in most cases as breaking into the olympics, and there's like 1 job per department anymore, maybe a few, but not as many people do these jobs professionally as you might think - and no exec is going to put their kid they know isn't up to par in any position above intern. Those internships are coveted but usually if you got it by nepotism you're not going any higher. \n\nWhat tends to happen with their kids is this (or...many, at least in games/animation, I used to date a celebrity's kid and they were like this and they're NOT the exception): the kid thinks they're hot shit, they go to a good school and might do well or ok but mostly just get pushed along for their money, even if they are good I've yet to meet one who takes what they do seriously. Then they get an internship at a decent but B tier studio pretty much only because they'll work for nothing and won't renegotiate (my ex was shocked to learn that I made more than quadruple what he made at a \"worse\" studio and as a student). They'll be laid off from that internship either immediately at the end of the contract period or they'll string them along for as long as they at least make themselves useful, but then lay them off the second they can in a way that isn't a firing technically. The kid then goes off in life thinking they left on good terms and not realizing they're fully blacklisted and will never find decent work again.",

          "text": "Ok so I agree that no majors are useless , and we need people to study these fields like art, social sciences , humanities, etc. I also agree that money isn\u2019t everything in life. But, for some people who need to pay for their college themselves, some majors are just poor financial investments. You\u2019ll be left with debt and statistically unable to find a job in your field. No one is saying art majors don\u2019t find ANY jobs, just that compared to other degrees they have a high unemployment and underemployment rate. No one should shit on someone else for their choice of major tho because ultimately I\u2019m sure they understand the risks they\u2019re taking and it is their own life to live. We need artists and we need people to major in art. On the subject of some majors being harder, just compare average college GPAs across majors. STEM majors typically have higher HS GPA and test scores than non stem for admission, yet have lower college GPAs on average. One could reasonably conclude that STEM is harder. For those saying they\u2019d rather work 40 years in a career they love while being payed little compared to 40 years in a career they hate while making a lot , thats based on so many assumptions that aren\u2019t necessarily true. 1. You\u2019re assuming you\u2019ll find a job in the field you major in, which for certain fields is highly unlikely. 2. You\u2019re assuming you\u2019ll NEED to work 40 years. It is possible to retire very early on a high income. Checkout  r/fire. 3. You\u2019re assuming your quality of life won\u2019t be significantly affected by college debt. Debt is a REAL problem affecting many Americans, and (for me personally) I\u2019d rather be working a job I hate but licks debt free than a job I love but have crippling debt. In the end i do agree with following ones passion, because it\u2019s your life and you only get to do it once. but it\u2019s important to understand the risks of getting certain degrees before embarking on them. Many people don\u2019t understand these risks and are very unpleasantly surprised when they graduate college.",

I've noticed a big trend on this sub of people telling others that the only worthwhile majors are engineering/business/comp sci/the trades and that everything else is a waste of time and money. Those are all perfectly fine things to study if that's what you want to do, but it's not the only path. \n\nFor me personally, I'm not good at math. I was barely able to get through Calc and I was miserable the entire time. I'm also bad at working with my hands or anything that requires good spacial skills (I'm on the spectrum and suspect that I might have dyspraxia as well). So that right there makes most of the \"valuable\" majors pretty bad choices for me. The only thing that might work is business which I never had much of an interest in (I took only one business/finance class in high school and absolutely hated it).\n\nYou know what I am good at? Reading and writing. I started reading at the age of two and was one of those kids who had a college reading level by middle school. However, I was weary of majoring in English because I heard it was \"worthless\" so I stuck with my STEM major for longer than I should've and graduated a year late. \n\nSo yeah, TL;DR: Everyone has different skill sets and interests, and just because theirs is different that what you consider \"valuable\" doesn't mean that they or their field of study is worthless.",

I started off as aerospace, and because it sounds cool and is a \"difficult\" major it was full of people who would talk shit about other majors and act like they were the only ones with a major worth doing. Everybody thought they were gonna be Elon Musk or an astronaut. I switched majors and schools (for a lot of reasons), and most of the people I'm still in touch with from that group seem to have done the same or fully dropped out.\n\nMeanwhile the people I go to school with now are a lot more just like... people. You go to class on time, do the work, and then go home or to work or whatever it is you do after school and it's not a big deal. Superiority complexes in STEM are a big issue, but honestly they're a bigger problem earlier on because those are the people are insecure and are making up for it by being loud. By the time it's seniors, sure there are still annoying people, but mostly it's just people that wanna finish up their degree and move on.",

I personally have already figured out that I don't want to work for someone else and I still have a year of school left. My goal is just to save most of what I can earn and figure out other ways to earn income until one works well and I can quit my field. Definitely would not recommend doing something just for the money. I like my field and it pays well, but I don't want to spend 40 years in it even considering both of those things. It's just not worth it and if money is the concern then you have to remember that a job is not the only method to attain it.",

Take a well-paid \"just a job\" over a poorly-paid \"job not enjoyable enough for salary.\" Enjoy work-life balance more AND get to retire early. Avoid ending up in something you think you'll always be passionate for, but won't.\n\nHowever, just as you don't know if you'll hate your job 20+ years from now... how do you know you won't hate it after 1? In my experience, at least, it's VERY easy to trick yourself into doing something you'll hate. Particularly when the stakes are high (the course of your entire life). What seems like \"a job you can bear\" might turn out to be a fast track to misery. If you're incorporating this sort of mindset, IMO it's extremely important to check on yourself regularly. Make sure you aren't pushing past your limits, ensure you're doing this for the right reasons, and continually evaluate the alternate options.\n\nWhich is all easier said than done.\n\n(Note: I am actually just a baby adult with barely any life experience.

While being self employed does give you a greater level of control, it also involves greater levels of responsibility.  In many ways you have less freedom.  You never get to say \"oh well that's not my problem\" because every problem is your problem.  Angry client?  You get to take the phone call and be cussed out, knowing you *could* tell them off but they're too important to your bottom line.  Pipes spring a leak and flood your office at 2AM?  You're getting up to meet the plumber, cleanup, and fight with the insurance company the next day.  Employee quits when you have a planned vacation?  Cancel it, because now you're working double hours or else you won't make enough to cover payroll for the other workers.  \n\nNow, as an employee again, it's a fantastic feeling to be able to clock out, turn my phone off, and have my personal time be my own.  I'm not saying one is always preferable over the other, but just remember the grass is often greener on the other side.

Right now, your gut feeling is telling you that your major is useless and will make you worthless. You can choose to seek an echo chamber to justify your decision, or you can have a wake up call. The choice is yours and I really don't care what happens to you. I wouldn't go out of my way to tell you that your major is useless, but you came here to tell students not to listen to reason and not to feel bad getting useless degrees. That's the reason I replied to you, not because I care about your life, but because I do not like when people give others bad advice.",

This post is sort of like the last fuck I will ever give about people who judge others for what they do with their college experience. I know that I have a future and since I have been in college I have learned about way more than I could have ever imagined I could do with my major. People get stuck in conventional careers that they hate and they think they don't have options. I'm here to remind people that they have options and that their major is not a bad choice just because others think it's useless. Good day, sir.",
