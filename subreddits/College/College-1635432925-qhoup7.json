      "text": "I would need more context to be sure, but I think it\u2019s referring to the prison system. \u201cPenal\u201d refers to any code of law. Penal chain likely means the justice system of some sort. As for correctional apparatus, \u201ccorrectional\u201d is a term used to refer to the \u201cbetterment\u201d of \u201cdelinquents\u201d. The prison system is sometimes referred to as \u201cthe correctional system\u201d. A correctional center is oftentimes for delinquent children. Apparatus is just something that is complex/hard to understand.",
