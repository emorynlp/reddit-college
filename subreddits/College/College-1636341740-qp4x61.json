  "text": "I kinda already know my gpa will drop tremendously after this semester. I\u2019m a freshman in college and I\u2019m about to finish the semester with a bunch of B\u2019s, maybe a C, and like 2 As. I\u2019m extremely disappointed in myself and my performance this semester. What\u2019s worse is that I put so much hard work and time into my academics and I\u2019m still met with lousy results. I\u2019m scared of losing my hope scholarship because lord knows how else I\u2019ll afford college. I wish I was smarter, I wish I was better. I\u2019m so disappointed in myself.",

If you did, take no shame in your grades. They are what they are. Just pass the classes and enjoy the break. However, if you know this was not your best effort and that you could have done better, then use this event as a learning opportunity. Remember, you can choose to go up from here. However, you will remain at the same level if you do not try.",

      "text": "Freshman year is a time of transition and adjustment. Be kinder to yourself. You are doing a good job adapting to a new environment. Mistakes will be made, but you will learn from them. You might be using inefficient study strategies. You might be over studying and causing yourself to burn out. You might be taking courses that aren\u2019t up your alley. It is important to acknowledge both your strengths and weaknesses. Cheer yourself on with your strengths and learn to face your weaknesses.\n\nI have a study with me playlist on my YouTube channel that focuses on helping students study better in college. This playlist includes:\n\n\\- 5 effective study habits (I introduce my overall studying style)\n\n\\- How to read a textbook\n\n\\- How to read a journal article\n\n\\- How to take notes (lectures, readings, project and exams)\n\n\\- How to prepare for and take exams (I talk about ways you can tackle different types of exams)\n\n\\- 5 books that can help you build your vocabulary, improve your reading, writing, presentation skills and life skills for college\n\n\\- School supplies that I found to be useful during college\n\n\\- College freshman advice \n\nMy playlist link is: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS\\_VQo0\\_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdkoToKBS_VQo0_2eyB09tZGzfNYgyEum)\n\nI also have a College Freshman Starter Kit. This useful for getting you familiar with how to transition from high school to college.\n\nLink to the kit:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV\\_W7K9wV5HvoFWK\\_Es2E/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AeO1X4u0ZWQCkDk3zALoDUPV_W7K9wV5HvoFWK_Es2E/edit)",
