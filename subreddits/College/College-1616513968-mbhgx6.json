  "title:": "Who else is constantly overwhelmed, exhausted, depressed and in a state of worry?",
  "text": "I am just chronically worried. College stresses me the fuck out. There is so much to balance and my productivity plummets because of all of my wasted time worrying. Who can work 30 hours a week, take anywhere between 12-18 hours, properly investment in interpersonal relationships/friendships, eat healthy, workout and engage in hobbies. How do people do it? I find myself chronically missing deadlines, not responding to peoples texts, end up eating shitty fast food, and just always getting so overwhelmed where I wanna hide in my bedroom for three weeks and hope it all disappears. When I attempt to calm down it just is apathy and I\u2019m not actually finding any transparent connections with myself. I keep thinking to myself, \u201cfuck If you don\u2019t get A\u2019s, you can\u2019t get into grad school, your just gonna have all this debt, look your friends have degrees and can\u2019t find jobs it\u2019s hopeless\u201d it\u2019s death man. It\u2019s death. I understand that habits and time management would dramatically help me but I mentally am just off in my head too much. My shitty breakup has made it harder to. I can\u2019t just take semesters off anymore because I\u2019m 23 and spent two years dropped out just because I\u2019m depressed. I\u2019ll go to therapy try random medication but no matter what somethings always fucking me I swear",

I hope it can offer something anyway :) \n\nAs for depression, there's always a route cause to it - I experienced it throughout my education and only after university did I find out what it was. I managed to go through all of the schoolings with dyslexia undiagnosed, so things were difficult for me - I even went to a damn Russel group university ( the UK equivalent to an Ivy League)  so it was even more challenging\n\nBut the day I found that out, had an assessment and was officially diagnosed...game changer, I vowed to make an advantage out of it and now I'm doing really well, not because I used medication but because I found the route cause (though medication is fine, if used as supplement and not the solution)\n\n**The Write-Off Principle**\n\n[https://www.putsimply.co.uk/post/the-write-off-principle](https://www.putsimply.co.uk/post/the-write-off-principle)\n\nBest wishes :)",

      "text": "I'm so sorry you're struggling. College can be so hard for some students. Like to a an extreme degree.\n\nI feel like I could have written this, almost to the letter. And so rarely do I feel like I see anyone talk about the *actual* extent of stress and hardship many college students face. I've also been constantly overwhelmed, stressed, and unhappy since day 1 of college, despite (I *think*) being reasonably intelligent and wanting *really badly* to be a good, responsible student.\n\nI've even been seeing a therapist, mostly because of issues related struggling in college but not entirely. And although I wish I was making faster progress, I do think it's more helpful than when I was trying to fix myself and all my problems on my own. It's at least helped me figured out some of the causes of the difficulties I experience as a college student- like avoidance behavior caused by anxiety, which was caused by the inability to focus due to undiagnosed ADHD and depression... But yeah, even if I fixed all my personal issues that make school worse, college would still be stressful. I don't think enough people really appreciate how demanding it is, which makes it that much harder.\n\nMaybe talking to a therapist would be helpful if you're able. I originally went mainly because I just wanted really badly to have someone to talk to that I wouldn't have to worry about judging me or being bored listening to my problems. Sometimes even just that alone can be really helpful in people's lives. Also make sure you're majoring in something you enjoy and aren't in it just because it's a lucrative or well-respected field. I was struggling more before I recently switched to a major that's much better suited to my academic strengths and I'm also way more interested  (it's not *quite* my dream major, but it's waaaay closer than my original major). So that's helped me too.\n\nStay strong, and don't give up. Yeah college is important, and it can really suck when you can't get through it without set-backs, screw-ups, or whatever. But I try to remember that it *will* be over some day, if it's a struggle to the very end. And not being a great college student isn't necessarily going to define your success in the rest of your life.",

      "text": "On mobile so forgive formatting please.\nYou can't possibly do all of the above without sacrificing mental health. As a current student I will talk about my experience and some of my classmates experiences. For a year and a half almost exactly I worked 25 hours a week and took 5 classes a semester. At this specific job July 2019 - Decmber 2020. Then during both summers I worked full time. During semester hours I would attend class Monday - Thursday, then Friday's I would only have class in the mornings but go to work almost immediately after. I worked Friday - Sunday which I find myself fortunate but still I would go months at a time without a day off. My coworkers became my social group, I didn't have time to see my school friends at all due to school and work obligations. My friend group dwindled down to one friend that I would see MAYBE 1-2 times a month for a few hours. Before covid my work closed at 11pm but closing procedures took 30 minutes if it went smoothly so I wasn't off until earliest 11:30 pm in a rough neighborhood. Since I was the college student with the restricted schedule I exclusively got all of the closing shifts. As you can imagine my sleep schedule got screwed over as well. Once covid hit we started closing at 8 pm and my school schedule permitted my coming into work early as to not lose out on hours, so it got better. But then my sleep schedule was still messed up. Once the gyms reopened I would go to the gym after work so after that plus taking a shower and having dinner I would still be going to sleep around midnight or later. The way I coped with school was just doing the bare minimum to get a decent grade. Forget actually trying to learn anything, just do what the rubric says and cram as much information for the test and then purge it out after. I didn't do additional readings, just show up to class and take detailed notes to compensate for that. This style isn't sustainable obviously and I was burning out BAD by the end and during finals. I quit shortly after this last Thanksgiving having saved up a respectable amount of cash. The only reason I was able to do this is because I live at home and am fortunate enough to have a parent that is supportive of my education and wanted me to quit and focus on school. Things have been going much better since then, I am actually learning and retaining information now lol. I graduate at the end of 2021 if all goes well.\n\nAs for other perspectives I have friends A and B. They are both pre-med. Friend A has been working full time since we both started at the university in 2016. He typically has done 4 classes a semester and gets about 6 hours a sleep a night. He currently wakes up around 4 am and goes to the gym fist thing in the morning 6-7 days a week. That being said he's had to retake multiple classes due to not getting high enough grades for medical school. Friend B also works 40+ hours a week takes 5 classes and goes to the gym 2-3 times a week at night. I met her at my work, she basically had the same work schedule as I did but with 2 additional work days. Out of both she's the one that you see is most stressed out/burnt out/depressed/anxious. Friend A is more laid back in his personality but is self disciplined. He gets his work done in advanced if possible. Friend B doesn't have the opportunity to do so, so she's constantly doing things last minute but she does have the better grades. If you see a reoccurring theme here is everyone mostly does work and school, gym if time permits. Social life is non existent.\n\nMy recommendation, stop trying to balance everything at once because it's not possible/sustainable. Work, school, social life...pick 2. Hopefully school is one of them. I went from work and school to school and what is possible during covid for social life. Good luck and remember that it isn't going to last forever, your time to graduate and be done will come.",

It's not possible to balance full-time work with full-time university studies unless you make ridiculous personal sacrifices that 99% of people can't, unless you're on meth 24/7. The occasional anomaly doesn't mean that it *should* work. It *doesn't*. It's like saying - how many people can run a 2:00 marathon? Well, a few people, maybe, under the right conditions. But essentially no one.\n\nThere is no solution. You need to stop working in order to focus on studies, but that means incurring enormous quantities of debt you'll never escape from, essentially negating the project entirely. If you sacrifice school performance for the sake of work, what are you actually getting out of it?\n\nRe-evaluate whether or not you actually need grad school. That's the only practical advice I can give. You almost certainly don't, so at least eliminate that pressure from yourself.\n\n\\*to more explicitly preempt \"but I can do it so anyone can!\" posts: read what I said more closely, and then kindly don't say anything at all. you're not helping **anyone**.",

At worst, you're making people feel like shit for struggling without understanding exactly what those differences are *while working exactly as hard*, or even harder, than you are.\n\nI'm also an adult learner and we have it *way* easier, just by way of having more developed organizational skills, general maturity and resistance to stressors, and you and I both seem to have long-term partners that presumably do a great deal in terms of emotional support and support in terms of household management and finances. It's absolutely absurd to think that your circumstance represents some global maxima of adversity compared with a lot of other, even typical, university students. You aren't that.\n\nLike, just be more self-aware next time you post here. Kids are struggling for real. You make it worse with this shit.",

His social life was of the most importance and he graduated.. barely. Heavy drinking and partying in college because he could give up on social being of the greatest importance. Even as an adult, far from college he looks back and reflects on how he wishes he would have listened when people told him about making sacrifices. \n\nYou are not wrong in saying is a maturity issue and a mindset. And I never invalidated OPs struggle. I was replying to you and saying it\u2019s not possible. It is entirely possible and many people do it every single day. I also never said that I am the standard. I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m not. But again, how could you ever know what to prioritize if you aren\u2019t ever told?  I dropped out at 18 from college. I couldn\u2019t hack it at that age and I sympathize. \n\nAs for my partner?  Minimal. He works 12 plus hour days and is exhausted. 90% of the household duties fall on my lap, including cooking, cleaning and keeping the house running.  How?  Quite frankly I don\u2019t sleep more than 6 hours a night. Ever.",

      "text": "Wow, this is extremely relatable. I actually just quit my job (in retail) because I couldn't handle the pressure of work on top of school anymore. That and my managers would sometimes schedule me for 4-5 days every week even though they know I'm a university student. I wasn't eating properly, my sleep schedule was messed up, and I would typically go to work feeling miserable. Granted, I still haven't completely fixed my sleep schedule and I'm still working on fixing when and what I eat, but it's been a struggle. My social life and relationship suffered considerably, and I was very depressed (still am but less so because I finally called it quits on my job). What I figured is that at some point, something's gotta give because it is practically impossible to balance everything and feel sane.",
