So, I usually have only 1 day off (Friday) or sometimes 2, due to government holidays/festivals. \n\nI wake up really late around 10:30 ish on my days off. I then get my favorite breakfast and take a long shower. After that, I catch up on my school work and get everything done by 3pm. I try to finish  everything by Thursdays, so that I have Friday all to myself. But it\u2019s just not possible. During evening I watch Netflix or movies. \n\nThen if I have more school work to do, I do them and stay up late till night using my phone and usually end up being late to work on Saturday lol \ud83d\ude06",
