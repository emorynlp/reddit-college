  "title:": "College prof hasn\u2019t updated disability accommodation 5 weeks later",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m not sure where else to ask for help about this but I appreciate any help anyone can provide. \nI have been reaching out to disability services, but still have not gotten answers. My disability impacts me in that I am hard of hearing and require captioned or annotated lecture. I have these accommodations listed in with the school, and those were given to my professors 5 weeks ago. I have been asking weekly about this, as one of my courses has only verbal pre-recorded lecture. There is no annotation, captions, or assisted technology being used. I have been requesting updates on this, to both professor and disability services, to no avail. I don\u2019t know what else to do, I can only try so hard in a course where I don\u2019t have access to the lecture; we have small daily quizzes over the information in the lecture. My accommodations were sent Oct 1, it\u2019s November 11th. \n\nI hope everyone is holding up okay this semester, sending the feeling of being well rested everyone\u2019s way.",

You have to show that you were entitled to get disability accommodations and that the lack of accommodations or not receiving what you were supposed to impacted you significantly for discrimination purposes (poor grades despite a history of academic excellence WITH accommodations.)\n\nI would be documenting everything as much as possible from here on out. You should also contact a lawyer knowledgeable about disability law -- the OCR will investigate your claims and from there you can move forward depending on what they find.\n\nThe school may try to get you to speak to their own lawyers or a member of their diversity staff -- a lawyer can help you with this. This is typically not something you want to do without legal assistance",

Failing to do so can affect the school's eligibility for federal funds, as well as expose them to potential legal action.\n\nAssuming your school trained the faculty in online classes, then student accessibility is literally the first thing covered.  And while I agree with what others have stated here, namely that your professor may not have access to the materials to provide you with a transcript, the professor still has their subject notes - so they should be able to provide you with *something*.",

If this is the case, it's the job of the accommodations center to provide this. \n\nI've added captions to my videos, and I find that a 1-hour video takes at least 3-hours to properly caption, and that's with the assistance of an AI text-to-speech app.\n\nI was aware of a situation where videos were being provided un-captioned. A disabled student complained, correctly saying that this was unfair treatment. Rather than caption the videos, the school just removed the videos for *everyone*.\n\nThis is not to diminish your situation - this is a very serious situation and you deserve to be treated well - but university disability centres are usually underfunded and overworked, and unable to provide even the minimal accommodations. It's criminal.",

I generate transcripts by AI, then have to go through and manually make edits. This is what takes all the time. \n\nI can make a bad transcript of a one-hour lecture in about 10 minutes, or a good transcript in about three hours.\n\nThe good news is that the technology is improving dramatically. In a few years we can probably have fully automated transcripts getting it 98% correct. That doesn't help you today, unfortunately.",

      "text": "Do you have students' unions, disabled students' reps, or course reps? Any staff/student department meetings? Do you have a staff tutor to approach? Does your academic dept have a staff member in charge of welfare or accessibility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince you've tried your prof and disability department, the next step is head of department (your prof's boss). If you can't get an advocate through options like the ones above, I'd CC the disability dept and your dept head in your next email to your prof. Ideally all of your emails to your prof so far will be in a thread. When you reply to/forward that with your latest email the dept head will be able to see you've been trying for 6 weeks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour email should cover something like:\n\n\n\"Dear Prof,\n\n\n\"I had a lot of difficulty with the quiz this week due to not having an accessible version of the lecture as outlined in my plan. I'm worried that the last 6 quizzes will negatively affect my grade. I'll also have a lot of catching up to do when the problem is resolved as I'm already 6 weeks behind, and am concerned about the impact on my final [assignment/exam/whatever] if the lectures aren't accessible to me for another few weeks. \n\n\n\"Could you please give me an idea as to when the accessible lectures will be available to me, and allow me to wait until then to submit any further quizzes, please? Will it also be possible to get extensions on work to reflect the time where these have been unavailable, please? \n\n\n\"Thank you very much for your time,\nOP\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note I don't care if the syllabus says the quizzes aren't graded, no one actually reads those properly, and the point is to let your dept head know you've been doing quizzes without access to the material in a way which gives you plausible denyability that you're being a little passive aggressive. If your prof asks you why you CC'd your dept head, you just wanted to make sure they get the resources they need to fulfill the requirements of your plan as they obviously need more support from the dept. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next step would be to ask your Prof for a Teams/Zoom meeting, and try and get a rep from the disability dept on it. I'm hoping your computer gives you subtitles, if not you need to ask the disability dept for an interpreter to meet with your prof. Next you'd ask for a meeting with your dept head and the disability dept head. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be an idea to Google your uni's corporate structure to work out who's next after your department head, but chances are they'll come down on your prof. Above your dept head will probably be a head of college, then a vice chancellor for students/teaching and learning, something like that. There'll also be someone above the disability dept head you can go to. Try and find out if there are staff/student meetings at any of those levels. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you decide to go nuclear, you'll also have a University board, the membership of which you'll be able to find online. They'll have prominent jobs in other organisations and through some strategic Googling you'll be able to find emails and social media for them. Depending on your country there'll also be funding bodies, local and national ministers/secretaries of education, and bodies for disability rights. You decide when you've spoken to enough people or enough time has passed to pull the trigger. I personally think you won't go further than requesting a meeting with the dept head and head of disability services/head of the department above them before your prof gets the biggest dressing down of her career, but if it's taking too long and you're worried about your studies, you can email someone at every level and if there's no response within a couple of days reach out to a couple of board members, and watch the shit go flying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you'd rather get in touch with me via DM before taking extra steps after the email CC'ing the disability dept and your academic dept head, feel free. Bear in mind my experience is as a board member, elected national student rep, and TA of a UK University, so if you're elsewhere I won't know the specifics, just be able to give a bit of direction.",
