  "text": "Obvious answer: *probably not*\n\nBut it hurts knowing that I have such high odds of my getting into my dream school; GA Tech. It feels like that academic grind for 12 years was worth *average*. \n\nAnd it sucks, even more, knowing **what** is keeping you from getting into your dream school. For me, it was *one test* that determines the tier of colleges I'll get into. I can't complain, I've always felt like I could've done better; I'm sure many others felt worse. But that pain of being *average* when you put in the effort to go above that, can you really put it into words?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt makes me want to find those bad things about my dream school and just nail it into my head, y'know that thing where you can make a headache better by hitting your head.",

      "text": "Same my friend. My only hope is to wait about 20 years to be able to go back for the degree I actually want, hopefully I'll have saved money and been able to update my credentials by then.\n\nI did really good in school for most of it, made it my whole life and most of my personality as a child, until I got burned out and basically as you said did average on all the tests that mattered or just flat out failed because I was too depressed.\n\nIt's kind of hard to look back and know that all my young self was working for wouldn't happen. But you can make peace. Life is very long and the happiness, fulfillment and stability you need is 110% still available to you despite taking a different path than expected.",
