I did my first two years in nursing and I just transferred to the social work department. I have only been in the classes about a month but I am considering making a change.\nI love the idea of being a social worker, but I don\u2019t want a career while I am still so young. I want to work small jobs, move lots and travel, get as much out of life as I can while I\u2019m young and build a career later when I am a little more worldly. I feel really tied down to the idea of graduating and having so much debt to pay off and maybe not being able to do all the thing I want.\nI want to have a masters in sw so I can get higher paying jobs, even more commitment! Should I stay/go? No one else I know is in the same boat and I would love some advice.", "author": "Yellowlight7", "created": 1632775238, "retrieved": 1632800154, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hejiazj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwq2dw/should_i_dropout_or_transfer_or_tough_it_out/hejiazj/", "text": "You should do study abroad! I am 23, traveled since I was 18, on and off relationship with school, living overseas. I wish I had just gotten my bachelors done with.

It just catches up to you quickly once you\u2019re out of school and it gets harder to go back because you have bills and stuff to pay. It\u2019s not like being a nomad or backpacker. \n\nI would at least finish your bachelors and then maybe take a break and get your masters later. You don\u2019t have to be a social worker right away. You can work in roles that travel a lot too. You\u2019re still going to be super young by the time you graduate too. It\u2019s a lot more fun to travel when you have funds to do whatever you want and you talk a lot more to others just because you end up doing more!", "author": "shoelaceys7373", "created": 1632792250, "upvotes": 1}, "heiloxh": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pwq2dw/should_i_dropout_or_transfer_or_tough_it_out/heiloxh/", "text": "I\u2019d stay and get the bachelors and then if you want to travel and such see if you can just do one online class each semester", "author": "CozyMiniKitty", "created": 1632776801, "upvotes": 1}}}
