      "text": "It depends on the school. I\u2019m sure some schools will accept them no questions asked and I\u2019m sure others will refuse without looking at them. Your best bet is to ask someone who works with transfer students at the school you want to transfer to. \n\nOne of my friends had dual credit classes from a college in Florida transfer to a school in Kentucky. Since no one had transferred from there to our school before they had to decide if the credits should be accepted or not. They ended up accepting all of them.",
