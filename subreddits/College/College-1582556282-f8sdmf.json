She isn\u2019t the type to listen to her students and tells them to drop out if they don\u2019t like her ways. She also has tenure so she can\u2019t get fired.

Probably 80% of the time I hear about 'racist comments', they're nothing of the sort. Rather, they're (often factual) observations about various groups.\n\nIn general, actual racism involves attributing the characteristics of a group to an individual by default. Merely noting that groups *have* characteristics is not racism, nor is criticizing those characteristics that various groups may possess.\n\nSo when you say he says something racist about the Coronavirus, I'm a bit confused about what that might be. The fact that it originated in China is indicative of Chinese cultural/economic practices. The way it is being handled is indicative of Chinese political practices.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure why a professor would mention the coronavirus in class unless it happens to be a class on infectious disease or current events. Even aside from the fact that it's not a topic that would organically arise in most cases, professors tend to avoid politics and religion unless they're related to the subject at hand.\n\nAs for singling you out, I'd caution you that we all tend to view the rest of the world as paying far more attention to us than the world actually is.
