  "title:": "My professor makes racist comments and it makes me uncomfortable",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I am at my last semester for community college and taking a writing class. In the beginning of LITERALLY every class, my professor says something racist about the Coronavirus and then makes a point to look at me. I am the only Asian in class. It\u2019s gotten up to the point where I have classmates tell me they feel bad for me because of what she does. Who should I reach out to that could talk to her about her racist ways? She isn\u2019t the type to listen to her students and tells them to drop out if they don\u2019t like her ways. She also has tenure so she can\u2019t get fired. But I am so uncomfortable that I don\u2019t want to go to class anymore but I am so so close to graduating. I can\u2019t drop the class due to it being too late in the semester. What should I do?",

      "text": "First of all, make sure that what you're hearing is *actually* racist. Probably 80% of the time I hear about 'racist comments', they're nothing of the sort. Rather, they're (often factual) observations about various groups.\n\nIn general, actual racism involves attributing the characteristics of a group to an individual by default. Merely noting that groups *have* characteristics is not racism, nor is criticizing those characteristics that various groups may possess.\n\nSo when you say he says something racist about the Coronavirus, I'm a bit confused about what that might be. The fact that it originated in China is indicative of Chinese cultural/economic practices. The way it is being handled is indicative of Chinese political practices.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure why a professor would mention the coronavirus in class unless it happens to be a class on infectious disease or current events. Even aside from the fact that it's not a topic that would organically arise in most cases, professors tend to avoid politics and religion unless they're related to the subject at hand.\n\nAs for singling you out, I'd caution you that we all tend to view the rest of the world as paying far more attention to us than the world actually is. To you and I, we're the protagonists in our own grand story arc. To the rest of the world, we're merely bit players.",

I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re for the president or not, but class isn\u2019t the place to do it. Especially when everyone has so many different opinions on it. He jokes about the Coronavirus as well  and I have a half Asian son so it really gets to me. It\u2019s starting to piss me off as well. He teaches a political science class but that\u2019s NOT my class so I hate that he does that. I take his World Civilizations class which has nothing to do with current politics obviously so I don\u2019t even know why he does this shit in our class. I have no idea what to do about this bullshit either!!\n\nI know the coronavirus isn\u2019t an issue just for people of Asia but he is making the jokes in reference to Asian cultures which is why I\u2019m offended every time he does it.",

This could be your approach for your situation. You could otherwise try to improve the situation. I first would recommend an email to the professor, describing how her statements are received and are affecting you. If nothing changes, contact the department chair.",

It goes without saying that it is monumentally inappropriate. \n\nThe two key things are document and report. Take time right now to write down your recollection of everything you can remember.

Judging by how the comments made you uncomfortable and not want to attend class, which is why you\u2019re at an institution, you should also go to a counselor or therapist if there is one offered at your campus and discuss how you do not feel in a comfortable environment in one of your classes. The point is that you draw the attention to multiple groups on campus so you don\u2019t get the \u201cwe didn\u2019t know\u201d argument.

It's probably someone in HR, Institutional Diversity, or some related office. \n\nThis is a serious issue when you escalate to this point. I don't bring this up to discourage OP, but there will probably be an investigation with associated time/stress.

Tenure protects academic freedom, meaning the person can't be fired for changing research areas or researching a specific topic. Being a jerk can still get you fired.

This is particularly true at public schools, which are technically managed by state government and therefore can't give the appearance of curtailing protected speech (free speech laws say the government can't punish you for protected speech). Private universities have more leeway here because they aren't attached to the government.",
