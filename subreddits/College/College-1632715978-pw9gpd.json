  "text": "I am a senior and had extra room in my schedule. I actually completed almost all of my requirements and have enough credits to graduate. So I am just taking some classes to stay enrolled full time that I am interested in.\n\n\nAnyway I had no language requirement for my major. But I decided to take an intro Japanese course. I dont hate it but it is very difficult. My original plan was to take it pass fail because I figured it doesnt matter. But now I'm wondering whether this looks bad to grad schools or jobs. I dont want it to hurt my GPA tho (it is very close to perfect). I would hope that schools or jobs would see it as unique that I explored a second language when I didn't need it, but I have no idea.",
