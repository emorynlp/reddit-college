  "text": "Is it a bad idea to transfer in my case? I currently go to a small to medium-sized decent LAC. The school itself is not bad; it has great humanities/social science and business departments. Although there are good departments, it is not so great when it comes to my respective major(s) (Applied math/CS). What makes it not great is the lack of courses available, particularly for CS students. \n\n\nI have talked about this to close friends and they feel that it is not worth it because I would be transferring to an overall \"less\" well-known school (T60 -> T100). The school overall is ranked lower than my current school, but I suspect this is the case because of its great departments in other areas. I know the reality is that rankings do \"matter\" for some people, but I'm not sure if the school's ranking (doesn't seem large anyways) can convince me not to choose a school that offers more in my major(s).\n\n\nI will be entering my second semester of sophomore year.\n\n\nTLDR: Considering transferring out because of my major\n\nPros: \n\n* Better department\n* Reduced tuition because state school\n\nCons:\n\n* Going to \"less\" reputable school\n* Would have to adjust and start all over\n* Some classes might not transfer over",

      "text": "I went to the cheapest school I could find to major in computer science. It was a no name school and the curriculum wasn\u2019t very good. I finished it in three years and graduated in May 2020 with a software engineering job lined up.\n\nI\u2019ve been working for over a year and have been doing great. Recently bought a house and am really starting to grow my wealth.\n\nHere are my three pieces of advice:\n\n1) Go to the cheapest school you can to avoid debt.\n\n2) finish school as fast as you can.\n\n3) Self study. Learn to code on your own.\n\nTransferring school will most likely take longer to graduate so I\u2019m generally against transferring, but you also said that the new school would be cheaper. If you could save 15,000 a year or more I would transfer if not keep to your school.",

          "text": "The difference in savings would be a lot . I am privileged enough in not having to take out any loans (so far). I just do not feel like I am not getting a good return because of the lack of courses available and understaffed department. STEM overall at the school is not great. The tuition, a meal plan, and dorm would be around 1/3 of my current tuition and that's with me commuting/no meal.",
