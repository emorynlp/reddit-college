  "text": "Hi everyone. I am currently a sophomore in college. I originally started college under the impression that I was going in order to pursue the career of being a lawyer. However, as I did more research on the many different aspects of law school, it scared me off and I decided to switch my major to finance. Although I thought it was the best choice for me at first, I\u2019m not so sure anymore. It\u2019s not necessarily that I\u2019m struggling with the classes themselves, but I\u2019m not feeling a strong interest in them, such as my Economics class and my Business Calc class, even though I am pretty good at math itself. I\u2019ve started looking further into some careers in finance, and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about the salaries. The high end of the spectrum when it comes to their salaries is great, typically ranging from 85k to somewhere in the triple figures. However, the low end of the spectrum isn\u2019t as great; some jobs won\u2019t even bring in 50k a year. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not in it just for the money, but it definitely is a huge plus and something I still am going to take into consideration. There are some other career paths that have interested me, such as again, becoming a lawyer (IP or tax/corporate), becoming a veterinarian, or becoming a nurse with a speciality in injections. These are all very different from each other, and I like them all for different reasons. However, I could still see myself going into finance as well. I also feel like at this point, it\u2019d probably be too late to switch to a major pertaining to one of those (besides Pre-Law). All in all, I just feel so conflicted and stuck. It\u2019s making me feel like I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with my life, and that I\u2019m just setting myself up for failure or possibly being miserable my college career or near future. If anyone has any advice, especially on figuring out what one\u2019s true calling is, it\u2019d be greatly appreciated and your words would definitely be taken into consideration. TIA.\nP.S. I am not interested in taking a gap semester or a gap year so please do not make that suggestion. I understand it could possibly help my situation, but it is simply not an option for me.",

I know plenty of people who went from biology to law; art history to business; etc.\nWhat is it you want to do? College is about exploring opportunities\u2014 not setting the course for the rest of your life.",

      "text": "Ask your school or businesses if they allow shadowing for these positions to see if you like them and talk to people who are in the field. Sometimes the only way to know if you really like something is to see and do. Shadowing may not be hands on but you\u2019ll definitely get the gist and either you\u2019ll feel excited or it will help eliminate some of the other options",

      "text": "Have you taken any finance classes yet? You may not have enjoyed your economics and business calc courses, but that doesn't mean you won't find your finance courses interesting. \n\nI don't think you should worry too much about your future salary. A finance degree won't guarantee a six figure salary by age 30, but if earning a lot of money is a priority for you, you can make career choices that get you to that point.",
