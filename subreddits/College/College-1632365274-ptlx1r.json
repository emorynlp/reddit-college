I don't mean to make excuses, but my ADHD was really put to the test in that class. It was the first time I've never been forced to focus, so I really didn't focus much. Now I have to take an exam, and I'm certain I'm not going to pass it. \n\nMy question is, is there any coming back from a failed exam? Like, even if I did decently well on everything else, would I even pass? I don't really know how college math classes work, or just college classes in general, and I don't know how a failed test can affect you. Tbh, I've never failed a test before, but I fully expect to fail this one. \n\nI've already gotten in contact with the math center for a tutor and with the disability resource center to hopefully sort out something to help with my ADHD, but I don't know if it's even worth it because I don't know if I can come back from a failure.", "author": "awelias8", "created": 1632365274, "retrieved": 1632946184, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdygkka": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptlx1r/im_about_to_fail_my_first_math_test_is_there_any/hdygkka/", "text": "Kinda in the same situation but I cheated out of fear.

That all depends on how the exam is weighted, but from your other comment about that, it's certainly possible. \n\nOne big key here is that in your math classes (especially precalc), all of the stuff you do the rest of the semester builds on the skills tested on this first exam. You need to figure out which parts of this material you don't understand and get help with those concepts. Sit down with your tutor or instructor to go over your exam and see what you got wrong. Study those concepts with your tutor. While you're doing that, study the new stuff, too. Then make sure you have some good study strategies that will help you on your future exams. \n\nPrecalc is a really hard class for most students. Make sure you budget a lot of time and energy into studying. Then yes, you can rebound. \n\nSource: am a college precalc instructor", "author": "mizboring", "created": 1632399424, "upvotes": 3}, "hdxzwgw": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptlx1r/im_about_to_fail_my_first_math_test_is_there_any/hdxzwgw/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632388411, "upvotes": 1}, "hdxnika": {"link": "/r/college/comments/ptlx1r/im_about_to_fail_my_first_math_test_is_there_any/hdxnika/", "text": "I\u2019ve got B- on a first test of Calc III that was worth 20% and managed to get an A in the end.
