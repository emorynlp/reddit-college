  "text": "I\u2019m a math major in the last stretch of credits to finish. I have to get all A\u2019s and B\u2019s to graduate because my gpa has been tanked by this major/previous mental health reasons. \n\nI\u2019m not a great test taker but I am pretty good at math even though it can take me longer than what the class pace allows to understand a topic or concept. I have a tutor because of this and that helps me keep up. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing good this semester in everything except for this one class. I got a D on the first exam and just straight up failed this 2nd exam, over half the class failed. I began studying days in advance, reviewing notes, doing all the practice problems, and meeting up with classmates to study like I do with all my exams. I also have gone to office hours to review what I missed with my professor. \n\nIt\u2019s an upper level math class so basically the only grades are 4 exams and a final. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to pass the rest of the exams to bring my grade up to where I\u2019ll need it. \n\nI can:\n\na) drop the class. I can retake the class next semester with the same professor and avoid a potential gpa hit this semester. \n\nb) stick it out, there is still a chance I could pass if I work my butt off but I\u2019m not sure \n\nc) I drop the class and take a different class next semester. I could take a different upper level math class to substitute the one I\u2019m in, but it\u2019s potentially in a more difficult topic and I\u2019m not sure if the professor teaching is one I like. \n\nWhat would you do?",

An example of an accommodation they may be able to secure is extra test taking time.\n\nYou may also want to drop the class and retake later, or try a different one.",
