I would choose my classes so that I had at least a full day off each week, and if not then having on 1 or 2 classes each day. The workload depends on the course and instructor so it's not really something you can plan for unless you've taken classes with them before. And it depends on how you like to get work done - do you like doing everything at once to get it over with, or working on assignments little by little each day?",

It can be tricky getting a job while in school, so I would say if you're able to get a job *with* your school (aka work-study, campus employment, etc) that would be great. Otherwise, look for a job that will give you flexible hours given that class schedules are always changing. That way you can spend as many free hours from school doing work. Employers will want to know your class schedule to know how much time you can potentially give them, so if I were you I would plan my college class schedule with room for working hours throughout the week.",

In high school we had homework each night for pretty much every subject, while in college we only had assignments here and there. Mostly it was just reading to be completed for the next class meeting. But that's where your personal work style comes in - I never did readings so if that was the only thing we had to do, I basically counted it as having no work for that class. If you're counting reading and/or studying into the mix, then yes you'll probably be busier.",

I've heard that engineering is one of the tougher majors so its understandable that you have quite a bit to do. I did political science and half of my classes were taught by a professor who did nothing but blab on and on about off topic things, so I just watched netflix the whole time. So yea it really just depends on your specific situation. Can't really know until you actually get to college!",

There tends to be more take home work though. Based on your major you could need to be spending a lot of time on that work. But, you might also not need to.\n\nI had a semester where I spent about 4-5 hours a day total on classes and school work, and still did well.\n\nYou could probably work up to like 30 hours a week and not be too crunched, especially if you get a job you can do schoolwork at",
