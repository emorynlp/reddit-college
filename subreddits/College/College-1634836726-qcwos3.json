  "title:": "Advice on Whether to Drop Calc 2",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently trying to get into my uni\u2019s CS major, and to do so, they evaluate how well you do in a few intro courses, one of which is Calc 2. However, I\u2019ve really been struggling through it, as this is my first semester in person and I\u2019ve had a lot of difficulty managing my time in taking care of myself, activities, and school. My advisors are all busy, so I turn to you all: should I consider getting a W on my transcript, and take this class next semester, or just go through with the class and risk getting a bad grade and not being accepted into the major?",
