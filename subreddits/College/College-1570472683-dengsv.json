I began as an environmental studies BA hoping to transfer to a UC in 2 years. I aced all my classes my first year, falling in the top 10%, taking a few humanities, Bio, Calc 1, and English. Now my second year comes along and I want to switch my major to something more science based since I was never interested in the career opportunities associated with the BA in the first place. I see a counselor and he tells me I will need to take a bunch of sciency courses this year in order to transfer next fall.\n\nSo this year I am in Environmental Science, supposed to apply to transfer, and have a course load of Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus 2.  After failing a couple tests and quizzes, I came to the realization that I never had a science brain to begin with. I don\u2019t enjoy nor excel at solving science problems and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing with myself. The idea of studying and saving the natural world just appealed to me. But I have no motivation to study forces, integrals, and orbitals. I enjoy learning about the world from a more holistic perspective. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I would like to withdraw from all my classes, get a job and come back next semester to take an easier course load but at least knowing what I want to do. But that\u2019s my parents\u2019 money. I\u2019m so scared and confused and stressed. My parents keep telling me to just finish off this semester but I know I won\u2019t do well at all. I need at least a C in my classes to fulfill UC requirements which I don\u2019t think I can do. Any advice will help, I\u2019m extremely stressed right now.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the thorough replies! I\u2019m going to see a counselor and will likely withdraw from physics and calc, stay in chem and find a job.", "author": "EggoDeath666", "created": 1570472683, "retrieved": 1632803063, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 554, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fc7auao": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dengsv/failing_my_classes_and_confused_about_my/fc7auao/", "text": "Did you pass or fail?", "author": null, "created": 1577502130, "upvotes": 1}, "f31y0wp": {"link": "/r/college/comments/dengsv/failing_my_classes_and_confused_about_my/f31y0wp/", "text": "Ever considered Finance or Accounting?

Although the road to get there was tough, it has and will probably be the best decision of my life. DO NOT GIVE UP. Now thats easier said than done, however Physics 1 & 2, Calc 2 and chem are considered the \"weed out\" courses. Once you get past them, it's not so bad after that. I was in the same mindset as you (i.e I am not a science oriented person, I am not good at school...etc) but with the help from some friends, constant visits to the math help center and my best friend Chegg, I made it through and I could not be happier. I ended up transferring into the engineering school as Environmental Engineering (it was the least competitive and I barely had the GPA to get in in the first place) and then finally switched to Civil Engineering, which is what I will graduate with. I am currently a 5th year senior having to take 18 credits (max load) both semesters to graduate, but I have a job lined up where I will be making 85k right out of school.
