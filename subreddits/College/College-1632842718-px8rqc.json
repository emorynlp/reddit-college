I\u2019m a commuter and I am having a damn hard time making friends. \n\nI\u2019m not struggling with confidence, fear or any of that stuff. I\u2019m mainly just new to approaching others and trying to get to know them. The main questions I have is when is it a good opportunity to approach someone and what exactly should I be saying?\n\nI\u2019ve been going to events at college in hopes to meet others, so far it hasn\u2019t worked out that well either. Not really interested in any of the clubs that are offered, I also work so my schedule is tough. \n\nAny recommendations as to:\n\n1. How should I introduce myself to others?\n\n2. How to respectfully ask for there contact info; snapchat, IG or number?", "author": "mctrumpo", "created": 1632842718, "retrieved": 1632945382, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"herdqso": {"link": "/r/college/comments/px8rqc/how_do_i_make_friends/herdqso/", "text": "The best thing I can tell you is to just make yourself seen.
