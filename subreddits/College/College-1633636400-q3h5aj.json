  "text": "Quick question. For starters I completed high school with a 4.0 gpa and took classes at a community college and received my General AA degree degree at the same time as my high school diploma, got a 4.0 gpa at the community college as well. I applied to multiple universities and got accepted to every one I applied to. Decided to go with my in state university due to cost. After my first year, I realized I made a mistake and  now planing on transferring to an out of state college with an acceptance rate of 82 percent (previously applied here and got accepted). The issue is I screwed my perfect gpa up at this university. I had a crazy year, had family issues, and all my classes were online due to covid. I have a 3.0 gpa rn. Im worried I won\u2019t get accepted now. Will this college look at my transcripts for the community college and high school? Or will it only look at my transcript for the university im enrolled in now? Do you guys think I still have a chance of transferring?",
