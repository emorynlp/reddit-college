This let me save my GPA and gave me the option to return whenever I wanted. I ended up working in the restaurant industry over this time while also working on building up my physical and mental wellness, which pushed me to really WANT to go back to school and learn and get the most out of it. I realized I was much more unhappy out of school and I wouldn\u2019t get where I wanted to be in the service industry. \n\nNot being a student also helped me form my own identity and mature. When you\u2019re in college, you\u2019re sort of in this bubble and it\u2019s hard to experience independent growth.

If, and when, you are a few years removed from graduation, and you have little to no debt, you will appreciate how lucky you are.  If I were you, I would evaluate the kind of lifestyle you want to set yourself up to live.  It could be having the flexibility to travel, live near the mountains and do recreational stuff on the weekend, live in the city, etc.  Different lifestyles cost different amounts of money. Similarly, different lifestyles require vocations that accommodate accordingly (i.e. schedule flexibility).  For example, if you wanted to do a lot of traveling, I would find a vocation (and subsequently, the appropriate major) that pays you enough to do so while you giving you the time to do it.  I know a lot of nurses that travel extensively. Most nurses work three 12 hour shifts in a week, and depending on where they work make enough to live a comfortable life.  If you were to schedule yourself to work the first three days of one week, and the last three days the next, that's eight consecutive days off without having to take vacation pay.  There's also travel nursing. Travel nurses take temporary assignments (\\~3-6 months) at hospitals that need the labor, and get to choose what cities they go to.  That's a pretty cool way to see different parts of the country.  Anyway, just a thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd as others have said, concentrate on getting great grades.  Whatever it is that you choose to do, especially if it's a more competitive and impacted major, grades will make or break you.  Don't get bogged down by relationships that take away from time that you could be studying, or might emotionally drain you.  Take the time to exercise, eat right, and develop the traits that make you the type of person you want to attract (friends or otherwise).", "author": "_KeenObserver", "created": 1582576927, "upvotes": 1}, "finwepe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/f8k90e/i_kinda_hate_college_and_dont_know_what_im_doing/finwepe/", "text": "It is ok to not know what you want to do.

I would suggest finding a major you like and getting great grades. Depending on your school doing really well can help fo relationships with teachers and will lead to opportunities. \n\nLook over the majors offered at your college and read the courses required. Think about what you enjoy doing in your free time or what seems interesting to you. I know someone who was interested in climate change but didn\u2019t want to do Environmental Science. They found Geography and studied sustainable planning. Good grades and enthusiasm led to more scholarships and eventually job opportunities. \n\nCheck out your Rec department and see if they offer courses in outdoor programs, or event planning.

But by second semester I had come to realize it was still just another form of school, the thing that had driven me to misery before, and I became extremely depressed. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do because nothing seemed interesting and I didn\u2019t want to be confined (for the rest of my life!) by which major I chose at 18 years old. \n\nI was also on a scholarship and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that in any way, which adds more pressure to the situation as you probably know. It was incredibly stressful and I wasn\u2019t sure that I would be able to do another semester, let alone three more years of college. \n\nI was consistently going to therapy for my depression, but tried to hide it from my friends. I dropped all my extracurriculars and missed a lot of classes. A couple of my close friends noticed and confronted me about it - afterwards I felt so much better having someone who knew. After talking with my therapist and friends, I decided to meet with my scholarship director and tell her how I was feeling. I was terrified! It ended up being one of the decisions that helped me get through that time. She told me that if a semester off is what I decide to do, my scholarship would be postponed until I returned. This opened up that decision for me and helped me feel less trapped in my situation. I urge you to talk to someone about your scholarship and time off, even if you don\u2019t decide to go that route. \n\nAdditionally, I signed up for a travel experience through my school (used scholarship money to afford it) and had become sooo anxious about it. I didn\u2019t want to go but I did. For me, this experience helped burst the bubble I had been living in and motivated me to keep pushing through the semester. Even if traveling isn\u2019t your thing or isn\u2019t attainable right now, the best thing that came out of it was learning to be mindful and getting to enjoy nature. I started journaling everyday and meditating as much as I could. I spent time just sitting outside and enjoying the simplest of things. Years later, I still use that skill when I am overwhelmed.\n\nI have so much to say about this dilemma you\u2019re facing and can say more if you wish.
