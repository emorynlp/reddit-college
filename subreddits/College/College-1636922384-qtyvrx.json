  "text": "Hey, so I was trying to find a chill game that doesn\u00b4t require much activity, to play while listening to lectures. A great example would be \"TeamFight Tactics\" which I play on my desktop but my laptop just doesn\u00b4t run \"tft\" that well so I was trying to look for a different option.\n\nDoes someone have any suggestions?",
