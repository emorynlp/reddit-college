  "title:": "Why do colleges in Alaska have such a low graduation rate?",
  "text": "I\u2019m from Kentucky, but was looking at colleges in Alaska, and it seemed normal for colleges to have a 40-50% graduation rate. That seems awfully low for an average college. Why is the graduation rate so low?\n\nEdit: \nhttps://collegesearch.collegeboard.org/filters?s=AK&sortBy=satDes\nAnchorage has a 32% graduation rate, and Fairbanks has a 41% graduation rate. These aren\u2019t your Harvard or Yale colleges, so it confused me why the rate is low.\n\nOther sites on google have them even lower at 29%.",

      "text": "A low graduation rate doesn't mean the school is hard, its usually the opposite. When a school has a high acceptance rate, they take on people that might not be ready for college compared to places like Yale where kids have been prepping their entire life and theres strict selection.\n\nFor example, Yale has a 93% graduation rate with a 6% acceptance rate. Anchorage has a graduation rate of 38% with an 83% acceptance rate.",
