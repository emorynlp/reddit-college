  "text": "I have the option to take Chem 2 online as a web class. It's a risk but, the two in person professors would also be risky. I say this bc rate my professor has horrid ratings on them and others pursuing a bio major, like myself, have told me to to steer clear of both of them. The lady on the web class has better ratings, but I know any web class is a risk. My goal is med school so, my grades really do matter. So, ig which is the riskier decision?",
