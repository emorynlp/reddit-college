      "text": "I am going to college here in the US. But in my country there is no such a thing as gen ed in college. If you choose a major like engineering, for example, you won\u2019t be taking useless art history classes or other useless ones. \nIf your major is art, you won\u2019t take precalc or calculus in college. If any math at all. \n\nSo you will still spend 4 years in college to graduate (most majors), but the work load is a lot lighter than here because you spend two extra years in things that matter for your major, instead of gen ed. \n\nUnited states unfortunately uses college as a way to make extra money. I don\u2019t see any use of sociology in my computer science major, but still have to pay that extra money to graduate for no reason. \nOh well.",
