  "title:": "Should I switch from an Engineering Major to a Finance major?",
  "text": "I wanted to be an engineer before the Covid Pandemic. I was doing pretty well too. I had a 3.9 GPA at my local community college and had taken math from the ground up. I started with intermediate algebra and went all the way to Calc 2.\n\nI finished Calc 2 with a B. As I was taking Calc 2 the whole Covid shut down thing happened. I sucked at learning online so I decided to wait the pandemic out thinking it wouldn't last this long. Boy was that a mistake...\n\nHere I am now, 1.5 years later, terrified to finish my major because I forgot Calculus.\n\nI was thinking of switching to finance because I know I can do it and personal finance is kind of my hobby. I was never an engineering hobbyist and my girlfriend often points out she's never heard me get excited about designing something. She always hears me talk about the market and other finance related stuff.\n\nI have no idea how I would relearn calculus if I did stick with engineering (even though I loved the math).\n\nI hear finance is a pretty miserable field but the degree is less rigorous than engineering. I know It makes good money too.\n\nDo any finance/engineering majors have advice for me? My confidence with academia is at an all time low and I feel lost in life.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a similar boat, except almost the opposite. I began in MechE, and switched to a dual Finance/BMGT major because I wasn\u2019t a big fan of engineering \u201cpersonalities,\u201d for lack of a better word. I enjoy the business strategy side of things a lot more, but I miss having that science background if I ever want to go into a related field. Still debating on doing dual Finance & MechE but afraid it\u2019ll be too big of a workload. It\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but I say go where your gut tells you is what you\u2019ll enjoy more.",
