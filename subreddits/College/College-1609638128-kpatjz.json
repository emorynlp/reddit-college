Most of the high ranking universities tend to focus on their grad programs and research meaning that they don't care as much about the undergrad programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is also an issue with higher education where the lack  of professors of practice leads to inadequate or out of date degree programs. For example, knowing SQL or another database query language is essential in many tech, engineering, business, research and consulting jobs however many stem majors don't learn a database query language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso there are still some schools which fail to teach python to their stem / business / econ students. Python is one of the most in demand skills today and many students aren't learning it in college. There are lots of jobs in finance that require knowledge of python and universities still don't teach python to their undergrad finance students. There are even some computer science programs which never touch python or java. Sure you know a C language however most CS majors should also know another language such as python, java or rust.\n\nThere are some universities which do really well at valuing their undergrad programs such as Ferris State University (MI) and Drexel University (PA) however this isn't the norm for most universities. It is often true that community colleges and universities who don't do research / don't have grad programs are better at teaching the lower level courses and they tend to demonstrate an interest in the student quality of life. This being said - they are often looked down upon as they tend to teach courses in a way similar to high-school where as the more prestigious universities taught in such a way where you have to teach yourself most of the material.\n\nI think this is where many people get fed up. They ask why they are going to said prestigious university and paying tuition only to self teach the material in a lot of their classes. I think it's a fair question to ask and it points to how out dated our higher education system is.", "author": "SecureDropTheWhistle", "created": 1609687761, "upvotes": 1}, "ghyite8": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kpatjz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_university_never/ghyite8/", "text": "I'm fortunate to have attended and worked at a number of schools that were run quite well. I've been in my current job for about a dozen years, in a role that's helped me get to know undergrads, graduate students, faculty, academic leadership, admin/financial leadership, and countless staff.\n\nHigher ed's problems are more structural than folks here realize -- only in rare cases are they \"selfish\". Two structural problems come to mind.\n\nFirst is that we've asked schools to provide _everything_, to create this parallel society that educates, feeds, entertains, employs, provides medical care, polices, etc. thousands of young people. Most of this is a modern creation and not inherent to the concept of a university, particularly to its governance model (more of which next). U.S. schools could revert to what they had been prior to WWII and what many European universities remain: a place where you're educated and everything else is left up to you to figure out.\n\nSecond is that university governance is built to oversee its educational mission even though it's now asked to govern what amounts to a small city. Except for roles with regulations tied to it (like the fiduciary responsibilities of a university treasurer), nearly every senior role is filled by a faculty member. But try to think of a faculty member who makes you say \"Their background is perfect for Dean of Housing\" or \"I bet that professor of mechanical engineering would love spending 200 days a year on the road asking rich people for money,\" in the case of a school president. The paradox is, these people come from faculty because they're the only people faculty (the most powerful non-financial constituency in a university) trust. In order for many school leaders to have broad support, they must be unprepared for their jobs.\n\nMy advice would be highly specific to each school, but in general my recommendation is for students to be sure to be a well-organized constituency that keeps in close contact with faculty leadership and, if the role exists, with the ex officio student members of the board of trustees. That starts by familiarizing yourself with the names and topics in faculty meeting and board meeting minutes.\n\nExamples of minutes: https://trustees.iu.edu/meetings-minutes/minutes.html\nhttps://www.skidmore.edu/dof-vpaa/meetings/faculty/index.php", "author": "dcgrey", "created": 1609686954, "upvotes": 1}, "ghyhsyd": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kpatjz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_university_never/ghyhsyd/", "text": "Another good idea is stop going to expensive colleges", "author": "Purua-", "created": 1609686457, "upvotes": 0}, "ghygvox": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kpatjz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_university_never/ghygvox/", "text": "What you might consider is that students are only part of the institution for a brief period of time and rarely get much of a view of the larger issues facing the institution.\n\nCouple this with the fact that students rarely have any context for how large institutions work and you should recognize that your attitude is likely based more on ignorance than actual dysfunction.", "author": "ViskerRatio", "created": 1609685956, "upvotes": 1}, "ghydmu7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kpatjz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_university_never/ghydmu7/", "text": "Yes, my college is the shittiest place on Earth.", "author": "AnKrieg", "created": 1609684256, "upvotes": 1}, "ghydkng": {"link": "/r/college/comments/kpatjz/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_university_never/ghydkng/", "text": "I have felt like this since I first stepped foot on campus.

That was your first mistake.\n\nStudent Gov, Exec Boards or Councils, Student Trustee positions...it\u2019s all bullshit. It\u2019s literally fairy dust. All of the big problems with a school center around money. Schools, like any institution, are *businesses,* arguably first and foremost.\n\nYou *really* think they\u2019re going to give you even the slightest modicum of control of the coin purse? You really think they\u2019re going to hand over the keys to the castle? What got me to leave my SG was when some knucklehead started going off about defunding our security team. First of all: great idea, Einstein, let\u2019s just have all of the countless homeless only kept at bay by blue lights and midnight patrols creep on after 6 PM after we slash the budget. But moreover: nowhere in our constitution does it give us control over determining our university\u2019s funding for the security.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s an element to it that some faculty want to see rising minds and figures at a university grow and improve themselves and others. But this good intention is dashed away by the very structure of 90% of student governments. And I say 90% because I know some Class of 2022 Student Senator is going to harp on my point by virtue of his school getting a fuckin\u2019 compost bin or something.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no point to becoming \u201cinvolved\u201d at your school or making a mark, but when push comes to shove, unless you know a guy who knows a guy on the Board or unless you have the backing of literally 2/3 of the student body, your idea or plan will be superseded by someone with much higher authority and a far more self-interested goals.\n\nMy advice: advocate for change at the higher level, but acknowledge you\u2019re limited by the situation of university life.
