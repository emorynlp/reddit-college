  "text": "After 3 semesters of school and active student government participation, i have completely given up on my university. The administration and leadership either does not understand or does not attempt to improve student quality of life. Few advisors are helpful and every system on campus is a disorganized mess. The list of examples is endless, and it does not even begin to mention the recent scandals involving my school. Does anyone else feel like this towards their university? Some of my friends who go to other colleges seem to feel the same way, so i was wondering if this feeling was universal",

      "text": "I think this issue plagues higher education in general. Most of the high ranking universities tend to focus on their grad programs and research meaning that they don't care as much about the undergrad programs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is also an issue with higher education where the lack  of professors of practice leads to inadequate or out of date degree programs. For example, knowing SQL or another database query language is essential in many tech, engineering, business, research and consulting jobs however many stem majors don't learn a database query language.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso there are still some schools which fail to teach python to their stem / business / econ students. Python is one of the most in demand skills today and many students aren't learning it in college. There are lots of jobs in finance that require knowledge of python and universities still don't teach python to their undergrad finance students. There are even some computer science programs which never touch python or java. Sure you know a C language however most CS majors should also know another language such as python, java or rust.\n\nThere are some universities which do really well at valuing their undergrad programs such as Ferris State University (MI) and Drexel University (PA) however this isn't the norm for most universities. It is often true that community colleges and universities who don't do research / don't have grad programs are better at teaching the lower level courses and they tend to demonstrate an interest in the student quality of life. This being said - they are often looked down upon as they tend to teach courses in a way similar to high-school where as the more prestigious universities taught in such a way where you have to teach yourself most of the material.\n\nI think this is where many people get fed up. They ask why they are going to said prestigious university and paying tuition only to self teach the material in a lot of their classes. I think it's a fair question to ask and it points to how out dated our higher education system is.",

      "text": "I'm fortunate to have attended and worked at a number of schools that were run quite well. I've been in my current job for about a dozen years, in a role that's helped me get to know undergrads, graduate students, faculty, academic leadership, admin/financial leadership, and countless staff.\n\nHigher ed's problems are more structural than folks here realize -- only in rare cases are they \"selfish\". Two structural problems come to mind.\n\nFirst is that we've asked schools to provide _everything_, to create this parallel society that educates, feeds, entertains, employs, provides medical care, polices, etc. thousands of young people. Most of this is a modern creation and not inherent to the concept of a university, particularly to its governance model (more of which next). U.S. schools could revert to what they had been prior to WWII and what many European universities remain: a place where you're educated and everything else is left up to you to figure out.\n\nSecond is that university governance is built to oversee its educational mission even though it's now asked to govern what amounts to a small city. Except for roles with regulations tied to it (like the fiduciary responsibilities of a university treasurer), nearly every senior role is filled by a faculty member. But try to think of a faculty member who makes you say \"Their background is perfect for Dean of Housing\" or \"I bet that professor of mechanical engineering would love spending 200 days a year on the road asking rich people for money,\" in the case of a school president. The paradox is, these people come from faculty because they're the only people faculty (the most powerful non-financial constituency in a university) trust. In order for many school leaders to have broad support, they must be unprepared for their jobs.\n\nMy advice would be highly specific to each school, but in general my recommendation is for students to be sure to be a well-organized constituency that keeps in close contact with faculty leadership and, if the role exists, with the ex officio student members of the board of trustees. That starts by familiarizing yourself with the names and topics in faculty meeting and board meeting minutes.\n\nExamples of minutes: https://trustees.iu.edu/meetings-minutes/minutes.html\nhttps://www.skidmore.edu/dof-vpaa/meetings/faculty/index.php",

However, I was able to give them feedback and I feel like they used it. However the so called \"graduation\" was a slap to the face. They didn't even read my name off, they just patted the faculty on the back. \n\nI transferred to a University to work on a bachelor's degree. GOOD GRIEF they can't figure out squat. I think for the entire semester I only got to talk to two different employees on the phone. There was an issue with my transcripts (there was multiple repeat codes, and the program I was going into only allowed two repeated classes) and it took MONTHS to get it fixed. I had two professors who made an effort to help their students, and another two who didn't understand that not all students were locked up in quarantine and had to work. Amazingly the only thing they did figure out was how to take the money from my pell grants. \n\n\nI decided to transfer temporarily to a local college to work on a second degree and wait to work on my bachelor's at the university when they figure things out (they have a year). This school is amazing. I have access to an academic advisor Monday - Saturday. And my program specific advisor always responds back to me within 24 hours. I had an issue with my fiancial aid (there was a hold placed on it that shouldn't have been) and they resolved it within 48 hours of me contacting an enrollment advisor. Absolutely phenomenal. If the university I'm going for my bachelor's didn't have the accreditation that it does I would transfer there completely.",

      "text": ">active student government participation\n\nBelieving in student government, heh. That was your first mistake.\n\nStudent Gov, Exec Boards or Councils, Student Trustee positions...it\u2019s all bullshit. It\u2019s literally fairy dust. All of the big problems with a school center around money. Schools, like any institution, are *businesses,* arguably first and foremost.\n\nYou *really* think they\u2019re going to give you even the slightest modicum of control of the coin purse? You really think they\u2019re going to hand over the keys to the castle? What got me to leave my SG was when some knucklehead started going off about defunding our security team. First of all: great idea, Einstein, let\u2019s just have all of the countless homeless only kept at bay by blue lights and midnight patrols creep on after 6 PM after we slash the budget. But moreover: nowhere in our constitution does it give us control over determining our university\u2019s funding for the security.\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s an element to it that some faculty want to see rising minds and figures at a university grow and improve themselves and others. But this good intention is dashed away by the very structure of 90% of student governments. And I say 90% because I know some Class of 2022 Student Senator is going to harp on my point by virtue of his school getting a fuckin\u2019 compost bin or something.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no point to becoming \u201cinvolved\u201d at your school or making a mark, but when push comes to shove, unless you know a guy who knows a guy on the Board or unless you have the backing of literally 2/3 of the student body, your idea or plan will be superseded by someone with much higher authority and a far more self-interested goals.\n\nMy advice: advocate for change at the higher level, but acknowledge you\u2019re limited by the situation of university life. Look out for #1; and if you want to look outside your own bubble, tend your own garden. Start a club, join a frat or sorority, a sports team (university sponsored or club). Don\u2019t stay stuck in the clouds.",

The weirdest part is the lecturers are quality, the profs are phds and experts in their fields, and advising was great but EVERYONE ELSE, no clue. \n\nThe weirdest part was unm generated a bill the moment I registered for classes. Makes sense right? You want money right? I signed up for guaranteed tuition, no surprises right? Nope, current school send it to be about 1-2 weeks before the semester starts. Don't you want your money early? \n\nDon't get me started on literally everything else. And the weirdest part is everyone is so damn helpful. Like, the scholarship office finished my finaid form because finaid but a freeze of some kind on it marking it incomplete. And my \"notmyadvisor\" greenlighted me for classes after advising me. Then a professor that advises for my department but is not my advisors advised me 2x before telling me he wasnt my advisor. Well guess what, now he's my advisor... because I don't know. No idea. Alsi this other guy, I dunno what he's supposed to do. He worked in the student ID office. He's the one that finished my transfer application in the first place because it was held up by some meningitis bullshit. THE STUDENT ID OFFICE. I walk by all the time, his entire real job is taking pictures and printing ID. Not even in the same building as admissions \n\nAnyways. How can I be mad? The application did go through, my finaid did get finished, I did get advised, greenlighted and registered. Now I've got a form to take graduate classes supposed to give to a dean... its in my notmyadvisorbutiguessmyadvisors desk... he said he'd get it done and his track record is immaculate.",

Some schools and department chairs made some really stupid decisions for their programs, but the rest of us were largely insulated from those decisions.\n\nWith a good department chair who is willing to go bat for his/her students, and the power to make things happen, the program can stay healthy for much longer even if the rest of the university isn't doing quite so hot, at least until the university starts concentrating that power at the top.",

It's very well-respected, and I'm glad it was an option for me. They have great programs for students and the professors are very accessible and helpful (for the most part). The drawback is that it's a stem school, so you're not gonna have a very diverse campus life or options for your major. But I think schools that focus on a specific field are probably the best option since they are better able to meet the needs of students.",

Dining halls would change menus spontaneously or keep up outdated ones. Department has classes filling up and they give a vague response on if they will make additional sections.\n\nBut overall most of the university works fine and operates professionally. It's easy to notice the 2% of the time they mess something up but you have to remember that you don't notice the 98% of time time they don't mess up. A lot of the stuff you do each day as a student is held together by university employees and I guarantee you would be a lot worse off if most of those people actually didn't care about their work.",

From what I hear from my friends who go to private universities, you actually don't deal with a lot of administrative issues and do end up getting a decent education, though it costs a lot of money. I complain to them about having to call a million numbers, send thousands of emails, pay tons of fees to get something small processed, and they don't understand why the university doesn't take care of all of that for us.

It is a *somewhat* closer drive to my home, but has way easier traffic (not all the way into the city) and easier parking. My program director is given a lot of responsibility (in reverse perspective, I will say she is admittedly overwhelmed), so she is directly coordinating my entire education almost completely one-on-one. My own graduating class is less than ten, and my program is less than 50. I\u2019ve gotten an extremely customized and targeted education, with the amazing personal touches of having your professors care about your well-being in times of crisis. \n\nThat was a lot of info, but in general, my advice would be to look at the logistics of your own life first, determine under which circumstances you can succeed in, and search institutions accordingly. Make it about you first, so you guarantee yourself success, and consider the logistics in correlation. Bam",

That way you can tailor your resume (and especially internship experience) towards it.\n\nIf you go on job boards and look at job requirements, something to notice is that companies don't tend to ask for just any experience and skills. What they usually seek is 1 or more yrs of **relevant** experience and skills.\n\nFor example, the [Environmental Specialist II position](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&client=ms-android-tmus-us-revc&source=android-browser&q=state+of+California+job+openings#fpstate=tldetail&htidocid=2SPs6iatidr5LcxEAAAAAA%3D%3D&htiq=state of California job openings&htivrt=jobs) requires:\n\n\"One year of professional experience in environmental regulation, analysis, or environmental research performing duties and responsibilities equivalent to the Environmental Specialist (Level I) class in Sacramento County service.\"\n\nSo if you build up your internship experience to that level, it can put you in advantage over someone who has 2 months experience in a police department, 1 month experience in customer service, 3 months in a finance department, etc.\n\n>I'll probably work for the State of CA and hopefully make enough money to only need 1 roommate to help pay rent. I'm thinking about graduate school but I don't know if I'm ready to commit to another 2 years of school\n\nSince you're interested in State government, you might want to consider getting an [MPA degree.](https://www.csustan.edu/mpa)",

Yes, the level to which professors are condescending creates a somewhat hostile learning environment, and they are incredibly unprofessional. I've had tenured professors show up to class, in sweats/stained shirts, late and complain that \"they didn't want to be there\" and that \"they hate coming to class\" and they \"just want to go home.\" It's incredibly frustrating; if I did that at my job, I'd get written up or possibly fired. If I, as a student, said that to the professor, I'd get called ungrateful and lazy. As an upper division student with 2 AA degrees in my major, they talk to me like a child. I have a good job in my field and my boss will talk to me with much more respect than they will. I'm not learning anything that I wasn't already taught at CC, unless I do my own research. It is very frustrating that the highest paid state employees in CA are the NCAA coaches. I know a couple of great people in my school's administrative staff who really care about the students, but they don't have the power to actually do anything to help the students. Very frustrating.",

Look no further than Michigan, California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Illinois. They also have the dual purpose of producing research and being academic/industrial kingpins of specialized industries, which allows them to produce something and bring in funds to provide more knowledge.

Of course, these are generalizations, there are plenty of good private schools and *plenty* of bad flagships, but as a general rule it holds true.\n\n\nEdit: your experiences with bad teaching aren\u2019t uncommon, specifically because in many cases it is world class *researchers* teaching them. This is an advantage at the higher levels, but not always at the lower ones. This is actually good, since unlike small schools the admin isn\u2019t hiring adjunct faculty in favor of TT professors. My experience with community colleges has been poor because they often do not have the course selection, nor the same rigor of education, that is needed in my field.
