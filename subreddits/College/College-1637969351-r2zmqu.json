  "text": "It's a brand new apartment and it's in this super nice harbor area next to the sea, i have been earlier here many times and it's one of the best areas in this city. But my dorm has no window? There are 4 rooms but i got the one who has no window at all.\n\nI'm kind of worried, but at the same time i'm really not. It's not like i can't handle it, it's piece of cake living inside your own closet lol. I have lived in a single room apartment with 1 balcony and 1 window usually, but i never kept them open really. I only opened them for a few minutes only ( or left open for many hours when i go out of my apartment ) but i always kept them closed really, with curtains. I sleep with my balcony door open minimally only where i can feel only a little bit of breeze of air coming in, but that's all.\n\nNow my new upcoming dorm room has no air of breeze available at all. Any tips? Should i get a lot of plants lol? What should i do :D ? Should i also get a fan or something that keeps spinning the air all around the room or something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. There is a mutual kitchen, 2 bathrooms and 1 big balcony. The rest of the dorms have a window but i don't.",
