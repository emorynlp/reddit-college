  "text": "I\u2019m sick of this shit. \n\nI\u2019m a sophomore who has one of the easiest majors out there, and I\u2019m done with college. It\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not right for me. I honestly try to earn good grades but don\u2019t get the ones I want because I miss a bullshit quiz weighed too absurdly, or do just averagely on an exam. \n\nMost of my professors don\u2019t give a shit either. It\u2019s their policy to not cut you any breaks at all because a show of leniency is too difficult to manage for everyone. Understandable, but the way you were condescending and belittling in your emails made me feel awfully stupid for asking. \n\nI don\u2019t need a college education to become a wilderness tour guide in fucking Montana, so let\u2019s go with that. Come the end of next semester, catch me on my way to the Tetons cause I got fed up with this bullshit. \n\nFuck me for being stupid and fuck life for feeling worse than an itchy tender patch on Satan\u2019s hairy fucking nutsack. I give up.",
