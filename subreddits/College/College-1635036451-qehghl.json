  "text": "I\u2019m torn between my current major (quantitative economics) vs switching to finance\n\nI'm not entirely sure what I want to do with a career choice. It's beginning to stress me out. I  I feel like I need to dedicate to a field of study sooner than later.\n\n\n\nI have taken some principles of economics classes which I found kinda interesting. I want to take economics of sports beacuse I find some of the topics extremely interesting \n\nI am also taking personal financial planning and find that interesting and useful too. \n\nIn terms of an actual major, I have considered accountancy, economics, finance but nothing jumps out at me. I feel like I\u2019m wasting away. I feel like the prestige of my school isn\u2019t good enough for economics or finance \n\nRight now I declared econ but doubting my choice since I might want to work in finance since it seems like a good job that pays well and if I don\u2019t study finance then I won\u2019t be able to get a financial job with a economics degree.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m wasting my time in my 4 year program even though the advisors there has been good and There are great opportunities. \n\n\nAny advice",

      "text": "If you aren\u2019t gaining actual field experience the school you went to usually matters less than you think. Try just getting a job in your field entry level or anything of that nature. It puts you in direct contact with people that are at times already years into the field and can offer some unique insight if you pick their brains. One recommendation I have for sure is to go to any career fairs if you have them. It seems small but it\u2019s one of the only times you\u2019ll meet an employer face to face before just being another \u201capplication\u201d.",

      "text": "for what it\u2019s worth, almost every job you can get into with a finance degree, you can also get into with a quantitative economics degree\n\nreally depends on the school\u2019s particular program for each and what your ultimate goals are, but a quantitative economics degree would maybe even be better than a run of the mill business/finance degree \n\nid try to research job placements for both of the programs in question at your school and see what seems to have better placements in the part of the finance industry you\u2019d like to be. if there\u2019s no readily available info on the school site, maybe try linkedin and see where people from both of the programs have wound up and see which is more in-line with where you want to be after graduating",
