  "text": "I basically do all my assignments on my phone because I can't afford a laptop or computer, and I'm used to doing everything on my phone. However I'm not doing great in college and I wondered if not having a laptop was partly to blame or not? I don't think so but I've heard people say that. I just wish we could write assignments instead but I get its a lot more convenient to have it saved digitally.",

But wouldn't it be possible for you to use library computers in your school, I think thats better than a phone in most cases",
