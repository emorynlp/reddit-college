  "text": "Hey Fellow College Student,\n\nI was wondering the skills need to get an internship in an office setting. For reference, I am a business administration major, and the business course that I have taken are economics (macro and micro), intro to bus, financial accounting, and managerial accounting (currently). In term work experience and voluteer, I have worked at a tutoring center and voluteer for several park clean-up.\n\ntl;dr: what skills do I need for an office job or internship?",

      "text": "Employers who hire business interns don't expect you to have a lot of job skills. They will train you to do whatever tasks you are asked to do as part of the internship. If you are recruited for an internship in accounting, you'll be expected to understand basic accounting concepts, but your employer will still train you on their processes, their software tools, etc.\n\nUltimately, most business students have pretty similar resumes, and you set yourself apart through your behavior/ personality and by preparing for the networking event or interview.  \n\nWhen you talk to recruiters and interviewers, they're mostly trying to assess whether you have the potential to be a good entry-level employee at some point in the future. They're looking to see whether you're smart, motivated, capable of behaving professionally, and genuinely interested in working for their company. You can convey this by dressing appropriately for the networking event or recruiter (this generally means a suit), researching companies in advance so you know what they do, having a practiced elevator pitch explaining who you are and what kind of internship you're looking for, and coming up with good questions to ask the recruiter or interviewer.  \n\nAs a final piece of advice, I strongly recommend you pursue a specialized business degree in something like finance, accounting, operations, supply chain management, logistics, or MIS rather than business administration. The best entry-level jobs are in a specific business function (think financial analyst or supply chain analyst) and you'll be much better qualified for these roles if you study the relevant field. Business administration is one of the weakest business degrees, and you won't graduate with in-demand technical skills/ specialized knowledge.",

Some jobs might not need some of these but the wide range of business roles will use at least one of these in some way",
