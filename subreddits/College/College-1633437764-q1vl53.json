  "title:": "Should I change my major a second time?",
  "text": "Have had two majors now, first was welding and second is mechatronics. Both classes I have had teachers that wouldn't actually teach.\n\nI'm pretty well decided but figured I'd ask for y'all's opinions. Should I stay in this class that I haven't learned anything in or find a different major?\n\nMy problem is that I don't have any extra cash or Pell grant money left to change my major again and I don't want to waste time in a class I'm not learning anything.",

Bad proffesors are sometimes unavoidable and in those situations you just need to make sure you are taking the time to understand the material even if it means teaching yourself. I'd highly recommend finding other students who feel the same way in your course. It helps to just email everyone and offer them to join a GroupMe.",
