I tried all the time management strategies like Pomodoro but it\u2019s not helpful and I usually just get off track anyways. \n\nI hate myself for this and feel like I\u2019m wasting so much time by doing nothing then I get burnt out by doing nothing.",

      "text": "I have the exact same problem, my strategy is to fool myself. At the start of every week or every semester I will look through all my syllabuses and mark the dates of all the upcoming assignments in my google calendar BUT heres the trick, I will purposely put the due date for an assignment two or three days before the actual due date. So during the week when I forgot I did this I will check my calendar daily or nightly and see a due date for an assignment due tonight in 2hours and my anxiety will build up and boom im on go mode putting all my focus on the assignment. You think I will remember that the due date is actually two days ahead and catch on but throughout a busy week I tend to forgot. It works really well and I always end up finishing the assignment and submitting it two days before the deadline. I highly recommend it. Another trick that is good is to remind yourself why you are going through college and why you dont want to fail and maybe write it on a piece of paper and hang it on your wall or the background of your lock screen to always remind you, it could be something as silly as \u201cso that I can continue living on campus and see my friends everyday\u201d, that was a big motivation to me in college, or the name of the job your college degree will get you and the salary and etc. \n\nAnother tactic is to write a list of all the important tasks you need to complete today and start with the hardest/most important one. \n\nAnother tactic is to find the root of the problem, for me im somewhat lazy and uninterested in the topics some of my classes teach but Im also somewhat of a perfectionist and when I realized this and started to fix it by telling myself things like \u201cjust get it done\u201d, \u201cits perfectly fine, a lot of other classmates work is even worse\u201d, \u201cits better to submit it poorly than not to submit it at all\u201d, \u201cthis class isnt all that important just submit it how it is\u201d I started to get better with my perfectionist attitude and started doing assignments earlier. \n\nBut at least for me the first tactic works the best and when you get more used to it you will start doing assignments earlier and earlier by your own will.",

I also find that putting my phone behind my laptop helps, I know it's there but it's out of sight and out of mind. Also, idk if you're in the situation, but maybe change your major to something you find exciting? I find it so much easier to focus when it's something I'm actually interested in. \nIt's not going to be easy but small consistent changes make a huge difference!
