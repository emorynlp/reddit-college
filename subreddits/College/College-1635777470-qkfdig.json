  "text": "I keep procrastinating because I just can\u2019t sit down and get motivated to do the assignment unless if it\u2019s urgent like it\u2019s due today at 11:59 pm even still I wait til 10:00 pm to do it. \n\nI procrastinate in all of my classes and I also can\u2019t pay attention in class no matter what. I tried all the time management strategies like Pomodoro but it\u2019s not helpful and I usually just get off track anyways. \n\nI hate myself for this and feel like I\u2019m wasting so much time by doing nothing then I get burnt out by doing nothing.",
