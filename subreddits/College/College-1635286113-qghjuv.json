  "text": "In high school, I was stuck with a group that I didn\u2019t click with because many people weren\u2019t interested in branching out after freshman year. Because of this all throughout high school I felt like a background friend and felt left out a lot. It was weird for me because I had really amazing friends in middle school and I wasn\u2019t able to find that in HS.\n\nDid anyone go through this and were able to turn it around in college?",

      "text": "I was homeschooled. My family rarely left the house and when we did it was either for educational purposes or to attend the cult-church we were in. In college I had crippling anxiety and deep depression. All of these are mentioned because they were heavy obstacles to making friends, but I still made them. All of it was very hard, and I didn\u2019t stay in touch with all of them. The people I am still in touch with are very dear to me. College is a great place to establish strong friendships. \n\nIt is so hard to do this as a commuter, so I recommend living on campus if you can. With or without that, please be the first to extend the invite. Create a study group. Take breaks to look at memes. Even side eyeing people together when a professor says something weird can start a friendship. Be open and vocal. That\u2019s terrifying, don\u2019t avoid it.",
