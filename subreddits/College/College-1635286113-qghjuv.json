  "text": "In high school, I was stuck with a group that I didn\u2019t click with because many people weren\u2019t interested in branching out after freshman year. Because of this all throughout high school I felt like a background friend and felt left out a lot. It was weird for me because I had really amazing friends in middle school and I wasn\u2019t able to find that in HS.\n\nDid anyone go through this and were able to turn it around in college?",

      "text": "I was homeschooled. My family rarely left the house and when we did it was either for educational purposes or to attend the cult-church we were in. In college I had crippling anxiety and deep depression. All of these are mentioned because they were heavy obstacles to making friends, but I still made them. All of it was very hard, and I didn\u2019t stay in touch with all of them. The people I am still in touch with are very dear to me. College is a great place to establish strong friendships. \n\nIt is so hard to do this as a commuter, so I recommend living on campus if you can. With or without that, please be the first to extend the invite. Create a study group. Take breaks to look at memes. Even side eyeing people together when a professor says something weird can start a friendship. Be open and vocal. That\u2019s terrifying, don\u2019t avoid it.",

Don't be afraid to put yourself out there, don't get anxious when you don't establish a group with the first people you meet, and you're bound to have great friends in no time!",

      "text": "For me it was the reverse. In high school, I had a friend group and the entire school knew who I was. In college, the only people who know who I am are roommates, people I went to high school with, and professors whose classes I took. Before the pandemic, I would occasionally have lunch with a few kids I knew. \n\nI think it\u2019s because unlike high school, there\u2019s almost no social politics in college, since you choose to be there and you all have different schedules. Depending on how big your school is, you might not see that particular student ever again after you finish a class.",
