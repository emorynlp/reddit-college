I had to do a room scan at the beginning which I did and I also talked through every problem and showed my work to the webcam in addition to erasing all my work before moving on to the next question. Issue is that at the very end I forgot to do a second room scan. I don't know whether I should take the initiative and tell her or not. My worry is that she will give me the 0 cause I told her about it.

I took an online lit class and it wasn't super bad. No tests but there were 5 essays (10ish pages each) and around 7 books I had to read. The rest of my classes were in person with small class sizes (less than 20). Overall I really enjoyed my time in college and I learned a lot.\n\nThen I spent a semester at a larger college in a different state. My smallest class had 50 people in it, teachers just droned on without explaining anything, and there was so much useless technology that was integrated into the courses. Clickers, online textbooks, etc. It would have been easier to teach myself the subject. It's one of the reasons I won't go for my 4 year degree until major college reform happens in America. If all my classes had been online like y'all have been talking about in posts here (I lurk this sub pretty hard), I would have dropped out.", "author": "Delta451", "created": 1591696252, "upvotes": 1}, "ftdgjo7": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gyge70/should_i_tell_my_professor/ftdgjo7/", "text": "Thank Christ my exams are 24 hours long", "author": "Duckhorse2002", "created": 1591627596, "upvotes": 2}, "ftcommk": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gyge70/should_i_tell_my_professor/ftcommk/", "text": "When i read these stories im happy our University isnt pulling this nonsense", "author": "astonaidan", "created": 1591605600, "upvotes": 4}, "ftc9wvj": {"link": "/r/college/comments/gyge70/should_i_tell_my_professor/ftc9wvj/", "text": "This is your professor.
