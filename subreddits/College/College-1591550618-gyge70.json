  "text": "Hey guys, I just took an online exam that required me to use a whiteboard, cam, mirror, and some other stuff. I had to do a room scan at the beginning which I did and I also talked through every problem and showed my work to the webcam in addition to erasing all my work before moving on to the next question. Issue is that at the very end I forgot to do a second room scan. I don't know whether I should take the initiative and tell her or not. My worry is that she will give me the 0 cause I told her about it. What do you think?",

      "text": "I got my AE at a smaller, but respected, tech school. I took an online lit class and it wasn't super bad. No tests but there were 5 essays (10ish pages each) and around 7 books I had to read. The rest of my classes were in person with small class sizes (less than 20). Overall I really enjoyed my time in college and I learned a lot.\n\nThen I spent a semester at a larger college in a different state. My smallest class had 50 people in it, teachers just droned on without explaining anything, and there was so much useless technology that was integrated into the courses. Clickers, online textbooks, etc. It would have been easier to teach myself the subject. It's one of the reasons I won't go for my 4 year degree until major college reform happens in America. If all my classes had been online like y'all have been talking about in posts here (I lurk this sub pretty hard), I would have dropped out.",

Of course there will be more specialized on-the-job training later (or grad school, more than likely).\n\nI don't know what you're aiming for, but I wish you luck finding a good job once you're done.

So basically we had to use a computer webcam and show our dest area on the zoom call with mics on. Definitely not full proof since idk if you can see every student the whole time but it\u2019s pretty close to the classroom setting in terms of what the prof sees. You\u2019re only required to show a limited amount of personal space and at least for me I couldn\u2019t think of that many ways one could confidently cheat based on the angle he required. My physics prof just had open note exams designed in such a way that the only way to cheat would be to ask someone for answers. And that other person would need a pretty good understanding of the material to have the answer right. Plus that type of cheating is probably the easiest to catch since you\u2019d probably notice two nearly identical papers.",

Especially since this transition occurred mid semester and a lot of professors adopted policies like this really suddenly as students were displaced. \n\nI would totally agree that courses that are not usually online need SOME system to honestly assess students. I just don\u2019t think this is it. I was actually pretty disappointed in how my professors handled that. I totally agree that they were doing their best and so I don\u2019t hold it against them/wouldn\u2019t review them for it when I talk to other students about whether or not to take the course. And I\u2019m lucky I had nothing like this because I didn\u2019t and don\u2019t have the resources. But half my professors just said, \u201cI expect you to be honest.\u201d In classes that were curved based on class average. I would never cheat but I got so mad knowing that a lot of other people likely would. I also had exams that were open note but harder questions which was my favorite but I still would have preferred to be assessed based on writing/projects that gave me more time to spend with the material. \n\nI dunno. Every system has problems. But suddenly requiring new tools and adding ten steps to an exam just feels crazy stressful to me.",

          "text": "I consider it a violation of my privacy, and the lockdown browser is practically malware. It can definitely freeze your computer and fuck up other stuff. In addition, I don't own a webcam for my desktop, so I act like a little shit about it. I pre-record about an hour or two of me staring at my screen, usually watching a movie, then I run this footage through a fake webcam software (including 1 minute of me looking straight at the camera in order to trigger the facial recognition you have to in order to start the test). \n\nI usually don't include audio so that I can use the movie watching footage. To make up for this, I purposely lower the \"webcam\" framerate to 24 or 15 FPS and the resolution to SD to give the appearance that I have a shitty cam and make it look like I suck with technology. \n\nThen, during the test, if I want to get up and use the bathroom or grab a drink, I just do it. \n\nI really hated this professor, so after two different classes with him, petty victories like this made me happy. Fact is, most professors would never even consider that the camera footage of you taking a test that the lockdown browser itself has confirmed as coming from a webcam is actually you watching Scream 2 on Netflix. There is absolutely no way to visually tell, and even if you had the most paranoid professor in the world, there's no evidence with which they can prove you did anything wrong. I've never been called out on it, though. I'm one of about 90 students minimum, and my footage looks just as convincing if not more so as everyone else's. I sincerely doubt they do more than skim them. \n\nWhen corona hit and the schools canceled, I logged in exclusively on my Linux laptop and Android phone, which Lockdown does not support. Tech support from the University said they couldn't do anything about it, so he ended up having to give me a version of the test I could do in a non-malware browser. \n\nI promise you, this professor is an asshole. One of the common things he did across my two classes was fall months behind on grading, say he'd have them up within a few days when you complained about it, then promptly not do it. It left you in a permanent limbo of having no idea if you were failing the class or not. I need a B average to keep my scholarship, so I ended up wasting one of my few pass/fails (P/F means that if you make a C- or better, you get the credit and the class has no affect on your GPA. If you make a D+ or worse, you don't get the credit, but it still doesn't affect your GPA). I had no idea if I would make a B or a C and no way to find out, so I used one. When the semester ended, there were STILL grades from months ago that he had not filled in (we had complained to him several times). I ended up making a B equivalent. If I had known what my damn grades were, I wouldn't have wasted a P/F. I should've logged a formal complaint with the University, I know, but hindsight is 20/20. Point is, that was just one of the things that made him horrific throughout my college experience. My webcam shenanigans were minor in comparison.",
