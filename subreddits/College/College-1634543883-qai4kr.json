  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019ve been at college since August, and at this point I want to transfer. I\u2019m at a big state school about 3 hours from home, and I just don\u2019t like it. I feel so alone up here, I miss my family, the amount of people here is often overwhelming. \n\nI don\u2019t really have any close friends, and I don\u2019t see myself ever making any. I\u2019ve tried much harder than I ever have before to meet people but nothing really sticks. My roommate and I really just don\u2019t click, we rarely talk, and it\u2019s really hard for me living with someone that I don\u2019t like. \n\nI\u2019ve tried joining clubs to meet people and do fun things but because it\u2019s such a big school all of the clubs have tons of people and I never really get to know anyone or necessarily see people multiple times. I\u2019m just not the type of person who can make friends in one interaction. They\u2019re also kind of clicky it seems. \n\nMy school is kind of known for being the school thats students absolutely love and never want to leave, but I feel left out in this mindset. I just want to go home. If I transferred I wouldn\u2019t even be upset about leaving, just about dealing with it. Im thinking that a smaller school closer to home would be better for me. Maybe I won\u2019t like it there either, but at least I would be closer to home and not feel trapped.\n\nDoes anyone have an opinion or experience with this? I know people are gonna say that I haven\u2019t tried to make the best of it, but I did everything anyone ever told me to do. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t had any experiences. I\u2019ve been to some parties and had some fun times, but still I feel hopeless and I just want to leave. Im not sure if this is me running away from my problems or just knowing myself.",

      "text": "Oh you precious person! I was in the exact same boat. Went to a massive state school a little far from home and didnt know anyone there. I would advise against you leaving halfway through the academic because it usually gets better, as it did for me. Here\u2019s what helped me:\n\n1) talk to people in your classes, especially in your major classes. Ask if they wanna study together for an exam and set up study groups. \n\n2) join clubs and organizations you might be interested in. I\u2019d 100% recommend joining greek life! It helps you meet so many new people and find a family of sorts. And it\u2019s important that you keep going to these club meetings and events. Its almost impossible to make a friend in just one interaction. \n\nJust know that everyone wants to make friends and most people are lonely to some degree their first year. So dont be shy or embarrassed!",
