  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAre there any college students here that are also dealing with chronic illnesses? Without getting into the specific details, I am dealing with some really painful abdominal issues such as low-functioning gallbladder, chronic gastritis, chronic pancreatitis-like symptoms (haven\u2019t been diagnosed yet but I feel a great deal of pain every day), chest pains (undiagnosed symptoms), and also a ton of other things with my back and joints.\n\nFor the past 3 years, my life is has been going to school, doing homework, and scheduling doctor\u2019s appointments to try to figure out what\u2019s wrong. Dealing with health problems on top of school feels like 2 full-time jobs. It\u2019s hard to find the time to get doctor\u2018s appointments while also having to attend lectures and do school work, so I haven\u2019t been able to see specialists as often as I\u2019d like because school usually gets in the way. So getting diagnoses has been a very slow process, which means I can\u2019t get treated properly aside from self-care such as taking Tylenol, using heating pads, and trying to eat well. I try to excericse too but I usually end up in more pain afterward.\n\nI am beyond stressed out and anxious trying to maintain good grades while also figuring out what is going on with my health. I often wonder what the point of going to college is if I\u2019m going to end up being too sick to work anyway after I graduate. The only thing I look forward to every day is going to sleep. At this point I just want to graduate so that I can spend all of my time figuring out what\u2019s wrong with me and start getting treatment. \n\nIs anyone else here dealing with something similar? If so, how do you deal with it? I\u2019m so exhausted,  mentally and physically.",

      "text": "Hugs for you! My health problems are less drastic than yours sound, but the big things for me have been 1) involving my profs early in the semester and 2) learning to set boundaries for myself. \n\n1) I don\u2019t have an official diagnosis yet, so there\u2019s no paperwork I can file with the Access and Accommodations office (or whatever the equivalent at your school is called), and therefore no intermediary and no guarantee where your faculty HAVE to provide reasonable accommodations. However, so far I\u2019ve had success with talking to my professors *before* there\u2019s an issue. Basically like two weeks into the semester, just long enough to have established myself as an attentive and thoughtful student who turns work in on time, it\u2019s time for a chat. You don\u2019t have to be super specific about your health if you don\u2019t want to, but being specific about what you are likely to need tells them that you\u2019re on top of things and are doing your best not to make too much extra work for them. \n\n2) Saying no is hard. It sucks, especially when it\u2019s giving up an opportunity to do something fun because you know it\u2019ll take away all your energy, or alternatively declining something like a professional opportunity that might be really good for you long-term because you Just Can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have any advice here, just sympathy. \n\nAnd as for school/work/life balance\u2026give yourself permission to not do All The Things, and also to put your priorities where they need to be at any given moment, guilt-free. Sometimes doctors\u2019 appointments have to outrank everything else, and that\u2019s okay! (Side note: fml scheduling appts around class is the absolute worst! You can\u2019t get in to see a specialist until the middle of next semester and it\u2019s not even time to register for classes yet so no I have no idea what time on a random Tuesday would be best??? Sorry, rant over.)\n\nHandling-school advice is, unfortunately, the same as for people not dealing with health issues: organization. Always. Deadlines go into your planner/calendar as soon as you receive a syllabus on the first day of class, and work ahead when possible.",

      "text": "I am in a very similar position to you. I have multiple chronic illnesses that have led me to have to apply for special permission to take the online versions of classes, even though I'm an on-campus student. I take the asynchronous classes, since I could have a flare-up at any time and there is no guarantee that I will be able to sit down for a class at a set time. This allows me to study whenever I feel up to it, on my own schedule. \n\nI also receive accommodations from my college's disability office. Extra time on timed quizzes/exams, and deadline extensions for assignments upon request. The latter means that I will only email the professor and request it when I really cannot do it, and I try to let them know in advance if I anticipate something coming on, otherwise whenever I have a flare up. I try not to abuse the deadline thing and only use it when I'm absolutely unable to complete it. \n\nAt any point during the day I'm feeling somewhat okay, I sit down to complete assignments and work ahead as far as possible. Unfortunately, sometimes i had to suck it up and work through the sickness and pain due to some circumstances, but otherwise my professors and disability officer have been very accommodating. You just have to contact them early on in the semester and keep them updated if anything changes.",
