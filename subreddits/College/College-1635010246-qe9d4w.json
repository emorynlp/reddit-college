  "text": "I\u2019m not just talking \u2018bout school work and exams. Like even just socializing and interacting with different people is hard. And college has made me learn that people can switch up on u fast. Maybe I grew up sheltered but I used to have this view that most people won\u2019t do crazy or irrational stuff. College has changed that. And it got me so shocked \u2018cause I always had the impression that everyone here are young adults- meaning we\u2019re not high schoolers who can be easily dramatic and do irrational things. You can guess how that changed. Maybe I was just naive and gullible but college made me experience a ton of hardships I never thought would happen :/",

When in reality, it can be hard for some people and you may be feeling more anxious than you realize. Try and join some clubs or organizations to find your people. You don't need to surround yourself with shitty people. You get one life and one college experience, try and make the most of it. Breath, try not be to so hard on yourself, and slow down your thoughts.",

Some problems are mainly logic or if more applied will lay out all the necessary background knowledge to such a level that someone with no prior knowledge could derive the needed information. Some of those questions can be very difficult as they require several different steps of inference but they don't require any studying as all of the information is theoretically right there. A 'smart' person would be able to solve a question like that, but a well-studied person would not.\n\nMy point, then, is that many smart people who have strengths in problem-solving and inference can easily survive through high school as not much studying is necessary. But in university, it's very rare that you will be presented with problems that don't require pre-existing background knowledge to be able to make these inferences, as the question doesn't provide it or assumes you know the underlying theory, which can sometimes be significant in volume. This is where smart people would fall down but people who were perhaps closer to average or above average in high school, who studied the material and know the course content well, would outperform a smart person who had never developed those kinds of skills.\n\nI personally disagree on your opinion that a person can be smart in one field but not another. In my opinion, smart people pick up new concepts quickly and can not only apply the concepts to known situations but also expand on the idea while applying ideas from other concepts as well. There are plenty of smart people who are not highly educated, and there are plenty of highly educated people who are not smart.",

And after you study it more, you build up your logic and then eventualy you can begin to trust it.\n\nAs I stated previously, I believe logic is built up.

People may have every intention of \u201cbecoming better people,\u201d but frankly most don\u2019t even know what that means when they start out. It isn\u2019t a linear progression either \u2014 people grow in spurts, regress when things change too much to be comfortable, grow again\u2026some grow within the bounds of their own self-awareness, empathy, and compassion until they simply reach the limit for the time being. Until those other areas grow, their overall person is a tad hamstrung. \n\nThese are often the people you watch repeat the same mistakes over and over, doing the same questionable or \u201cerratic\u201d things as OP mentioned. It makes you question who they are, but, whether the people acting wild realize it or not, they too are probably unsure. Without an instantly accessible family framework, their clique, sport, hometown\u2026many people are lost, thrust into an open world with very little idea of where to go with themselves, who to become, how to start \u201cgrowing up.\u201d \n\nAs someone who had travelled a lot, met many kinds of people, developed many skills, and done many different things by the time I reached college, I found the experience very painful. I was fortunate to have had such a breath of experiences, but it was something I became both grateful for and alienated by. I had always gravitated towards more \u201cadult\u201d figures, and my first years of college did nothing but confirm that to me. Two really difficult long term relationships messed me up too, and I\u2019m still recovering from that. \n\nOP, all I can say is this \u2014 keep doing you. Let the particulate matter settle, if you will. The silt will fall out of the water over time and things will become clearer: you\u2019ll find those who you can put your trust in, understand who you don\u2019t or don\u2019t spend your time on, and how to be you regardless. I thought I was mature when I came to college, I probably was compared to my peer group, but holy crap\u2026as a senior, looking back after three colleges and four potential majors\u2026I\u2019ve changed a lot too!",
