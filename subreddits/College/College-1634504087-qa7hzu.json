  "text": "I have a group project and the previous group project many years ago was a complete disaster and failed it. I have a bad feeling about this. We all have each other's phone numbers and I started texting them and working on it but it feels like the same situation as the last class project in a previous class. It feels inevitable and almost out of my control. Maybe I'm not holding my partners accountable enough.IDK. What should I do? Does anyone else do poorly on group projects?",

But I will try to delegate, but some people aren't too kind to taking directions. I will try to make a list of deadlines.
