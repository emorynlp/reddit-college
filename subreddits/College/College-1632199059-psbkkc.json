It is meant to be a time for recuperation and relaxation - providing work that will induce stress and prevent students from truly enjoying their break defeats the purpose and contributes to burn out (also, it will get them disliked).\n\nI thought, moving into college and the adult world, professors would respect break time more. It feels like high school teachers did it and got away with it because we were kids and our time was scheduled for us so teachers didn't put much thought into it.\n\nBut in the professional world, especially as our workload increases, I should think break time is more important and necessary for students to refresh.\n\nI've recently been assigned a large group project due the day my class returns from Fall break in a couple weeks (we're to present our projects to the class that Monday, so we can't just get it done with early). Why do some professors assign work over break? Does this happen commonly?
