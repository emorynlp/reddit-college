  "text": "Holy shit, thorn in my side gone and I don't feel like throwing up anymore. I have to take a heavy load later or extend my graduation date, but unfortunately worth it because I never have to see my awful (now former) professor again. Should've dropped sooner to take less mental damage, but oh well.",

I've been pressured to take as many concurrent enrollment classes as possible in high school, but I dropped one so my school days start at 9. I'm not gonna get my associates before I graduate but whatever",
