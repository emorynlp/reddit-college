  "title:": "I am literally one submission away from graduating and I just can\u2019t do it",
  "text": "I have been doing fairly okay all through out college. This is literally the last submission of my entire undergraduate life and I just can\u2019t bring myself to do it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to me - all I do is open a word document and then go to YouTube. Someone please give suggestions as to how to find it in myself to complete this. I only have two days left. Please help me.\n\nUpdate: \nTLDR - Submitted the assignment 19 hours before the deadline.\n\nI just would like to thank everyone for helping out. I did not expect this post to have 1k upvotes because I really just wrote it on a whim because I felt really down and unmotivated. I think one redditor really hit the nail on the head - I think I'm deathly afraid of the transition to adulting work life. I have to worry about getting a job, doing well at said job, having to meet new people. Change is hard for me but seeing all these comments made me feel a sense of camaraderie? I'm glad that there are people out there who are in the same shoes, feeling the same emotions. It's a turbulent time so kudos to everyone who has stayed strong and made it this far! We can do it!\n\nIn case there are any other people facing the same situation as me, here are some of the comments that helped!\n\n1.) Siteblocker - blocked youtube and I found myself straying less\n\n2.) Pomodoro - 45 minutes of work and 15 minutes of break and rewarding myself by doing some other stuff like reading\n\n3.) Coffee and exercise - helped me to refresh my brain\n\n4.) Just typing anything - because starting and writing the first word was the hardest step",

      "text": "Phd student and college prof here. Did you know that when people place a lot of personal self-worth and their self-assessment of their identify relies on their outcomes, they tend to procrastinate? The more of your personal self-worth reflection and perceived identity is related to an outcome (such as your school outcomes) the more and worse you will tend to procrastinate. It's a self-defense mechanism related to fear of failure and fear of change of identity.\n\nNow you're almost graduated, you have this assignment that is THE LAST COLLEGE OUTCOME EVER. You're putting it off because turning it in says something to you about your identity and and your self-worth. But here's the kicker- your identity is going to change whether you turn this in or not. You're basically done with being a college student. Now the only thing left tied to this is your self-worth. TURN IT IN. You seriously don't want to spend the next 60-odd years kicking yourself because you didn't bother turning it in. Even if it doesn't really affect your grade, I PROMISE you that THIS will turn into your anxiety dream the next 30 years (true story- these are the stuff of random nightmares in your 40's FOR NO GOOD REASON). \n\nSo please do your 40-year-old self a favor and turn this fucker in, already. YOOOOU can DOOO IT.",
