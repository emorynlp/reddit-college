  "text": "I\u2019m a junior going for mechanical engineering. I have no experience or extracurriculars so I\u2019m forcing myself to get involved with something this year. I saw my schools ASME recruiting students to participate in a NASA design competition. I\u2019m wondering if this is good experience to have for my resume and future career.\n\nSince I have no experience with extracurriculars I\u2019m not if something like this would be worth participating in for someone like me. I have a couple of questions. Here is the project https://www.nasa.gov/aeroresearch/nasa-design-challenges-and-competitions-overview\n\nSince I have no experience I don\u2019t know how someone like me could contribute to a big project like this.\n\nHow work intensive is a design project like this? Is it easy to balance school work with the project work?\n\nDoes the experience make an impact on your resume even if you don\u2019t win?\n\nThank you in advance",
