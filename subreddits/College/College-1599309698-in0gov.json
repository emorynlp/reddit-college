I will say I attend a college in Virginia that is currently getting hit hard with rona, and is a hot spot zone.  The most common thing I have seen people blame is that it\u2019s people partying. Yes that is a factor but I will list all the things I have seen on campus.\n\n1) No mask enforcement, even though they market that they are mandated on campus.\n  You can walk on campus and  if people do not have masks on, they are wearing them incorrectly. I witnessed a girl with a mask below her nose ,sneeze and not cover her nose.\n\n2) Buildings do not enforce policies\n   I worked in a public area on campus and many  times students would overcrowd elevators, take off masks before they left the building, and come when they were sick. \n\n3) staff and professors did not follow procedures \nStudents are not the only one to blame. I would say that as many students that were not following procedures, staff and faculty were not either. On my first day back, a professor and student stood in-front of the library door talking less than 6 feet apart ( no masks on) and you literally had to go in between them to get into the building.\n\n4) The administration has their head in the sand\n While you notice everything wrong on campus you will continue to get  emails saying how great everything is. In a recent email , our president said that this outbreak was expected and it is coming to a head. They also said we have no evidence of community transmission on campus(blaming off campus students), even though positive COVID cases make up 3/4 of the county positive results.\n\n5) Not enough testing is being done\n Our university has a COVID dashboard and anyone with basic understanding of statistics will see how skewed the data is. They only tested kids coming from hot spots and just recently have held mass testing for willing individuals. They only update the information once a week. I was tested on a Friday and did not receive my results until that next Thursday, a day AFTER the university updated their weekly stats.(may just be a conspiracy I have).\n\n6) You can do everything right but it doesn\u2019t matter if those around you aren\u2019t.\nI live with a roommate who doesn\u2019t take COVID seriously. They think because they are young and \u201c Never get sick\u201d, they shouldn\u2019t worry. I did everything right and because others don\u2019t take it as seriously, you will be affected.\n\n7) Faculty are struggling \nProfessors are having a hard time teaching in this environment. I am very close with one of my professors and they relayed to me how stressful all this has been, especially being an older population and having vulnerable parents at home.\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know if we will shut down. I think it will take everyone overloading the isolation dorms or someone dying.

And plus I can still take the bus to libraries and study like I did before. \n\nAs for mask, the busses here require it and make it mandatory. As do the libraries (covering nose as well) or else you can't enter.

I'm not even aware of elevator policies here, but I've only seen one person use the elevator so far this semester.\n\nAs for classroom policies, in some classes students are within 3 feet of each other instead of 6 feet apart.\n\n3.
