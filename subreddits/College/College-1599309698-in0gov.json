  "text": "Let me start by saying  I have yet to get sick, but I have had to move locations the past month due to people around me becoming infected.\n\nFor sake of anonymity, I will not disclose my school directly. I will say I attend a college in Virginia that is currently getting hit hard with rona, and is a hot spot zone.  The most common thing I have seen people blame is that it\u2019s people partying. Yes that is a factor but I will list all the things I have seen on campus.\n\n1) No mask enforcement, even though they market that they are mandated on campus.\n  You can walk on campus and  if people do not have masks on, they are wearing them incorrectly. I witnessed a girl with a mask below her nose ,sneeze and not cover her nose.\n\n2) Buildings do not enforce policies\n   I worked in a public area on campus and many  times students would overcrowd elevators, take off masks before they left the building, and come when they were sick. \n\n3) staff and professors did not follow procedures \nStudents are not the only one to blame. I would say that as many students that were not following procedures, staff and faculty were not either. On my first day back, a professor and student stood in-front of the library door talking less than 6 feet apart ( no masks on) and you literally had to go in between them to get into the building.\n\n4) The administration has their head in the sand\n While you notice everything wrong on campus you will continue to get  emails saying how great everything is. In a recent email , our president said that this outbreak was expected and it is coming to a head. They also said we have no evidence of community transmission on campus(blaming off campus students), even though positive COVID cases make up 3/4 of the county positive results.\n\n5) Not enough testing is being done\n Our university has a COVID dashboard and anyone with basic understanding of statistics will see how skewed the data is. They only tested kids coming from hot spots and just recently have held mass testing for willing individuals. They only update the information once a week. I was tested on a Friday and did not receive my results until that next Thursday, a day AFTER the university updated their weekly stats.(may just be a conspiracy I have).\n\n6) You can do everything right but it doesn\u2019t matter if those around you aren\u2019t.\nI live with a roommate who doesn\u2019t take COVID seriously. They think because they are young and \u201c Never get sick\u201d, they shouldn\u2019t worry. I did everything right and because others don\u2019t take it as seriously, you will be affected.\n\n7) Faculty are struggling \nProfessors are having a hard time teaching in this environment. I am very close with one of my professors and they relayed to me how stressful all this has been, especially being an older population and having vulnerable parents at home.\n\nAt this point I don\u2019t know if we will shut down. I think it will take everyone overloading the isolation dorms or someone dying. The administration is full steam ahead...",

      "text": "I go to a small LAC in Massachusetts and they're taking things HELLA seriously. Everyone gets tested every other day with results coming back less than 24 hours. Everyone has to wear a mask everywhere except in our dorm rooms and eat or drinking. We've only had 3 cases so far amongst staff students and faculty and it was after people moved in. Our dining has been completely remodeled to a grab and go situation dispersed through our campus to reduce density. We have outside classrooms with nice tents used for classes and study time. The admin is taking reports of ppl seriously as there have been one or two people who were immediately sent home. Everyone has singles including the first years.",

      "text": "99% of classes are online at my uni but campus amenities like libraries and dining halls are still open, albeit at a limited time. I currently live off campus about 15 minutes from my school and I honestly love it compared to staying at home where I couldn't focus on online classes and practically failed. And plus I can still take the bus to libraries and study like I did before. \n\nAs for mask, the busses here require it and make it mandatory. As do the libraries (covering nose as well) or else you can't enter. They limited the amount of chairs at each table so that there's only two to three chairs per table at a distance compared to four to six. And I've rarely seen anyone without a mask unless they were eating.",

That\u2019s my point. We have no guarantee of a vaccine or any suggestion that this thing will stop until we reach herd immunity.\n\n>There\u2019s evidence asymptomatic carriers can suffer from heart and lung damage. We also don\u2019t know if the virus will manifest itself later in life in a dangerous way. E.g. chicken pox that results in shingles later in life. \n\nThis is also true. We also won\u2019t know how prevalent those issues might be for another 5 to 20 years, so we can\u2019t factor that into our decision. Controlled avalanche is the best way forward with what we do and can know now.\n\n>I appreciate your willingness to take one for the team, but this virus is just too dangerous to spread uncontrolled through any population.\n\nIt\u2019s too dangerous to spread through the elderly. Again, any 20 year old who gets covid and doesn\u2019t die is a win. That\u2019s one more person who can\u2019t spread it. There is certainly risk involved, and young healthy people have died from covid. But the risks are minute and still largely unknown compared to the known risks and public health outcomes that will occur with continued lockdowns and this bullshit idea of \u201cstop the spread.\u201d We have lost over 18 million life years from lockdowns; the same lockdowns only saved 750,000 life years. I am vastly more afraid of my friends taking their own lives than i am afraid of them contracting covid. Again, i appreciate and understand that there are risks, but for the sake of society we need to let covid burn through our population. NYC and NJ have had barely any cases and little to no deaths for a month. They got slammed in march, but covid burned through and now they\u2019re pretty much out of it. If we let covid burn through college campuses*, we could have a safe campus for vulnerable students by next semester. Instead of following the science, most are* choosing to follow the short-term pr/money making strategy.",

If we had a strong and comprehensive plan from the beginning of the pandemic, we would have the virus under control, and we wouldn\u2019t be contemplating such nihilistic proposals.

I\u2019ve been advocating for professors to zoom into classes instead of the students, and providing complete accommodations for any students who want to opt out of coming to campus for any reason. That way, healthy students are able to go out and approach herd immunity, vulnerable students are removed from the population (and if they aren\u2019t, that\u2019s because of their choice), and faculty and professors are protected. I\u2019m no expert in civil litigation, but i think a uni providing accommodations to anybody who requests them is sufficient to remove liability. With that plan, the uni follows the science, keeps their students and employees happy, and removes liability, instead of just removing liability.",

Regardless, the risk averse approach is to always follow public health guidance and to allow either students or professor to opt out of in person contact. The university is unlikely to adopt an approach contrary to public health guidance. If I were their attorney, I would certainly advise against it.",

I'm personally guilty of lowering my mask when no one is within 6 feet of me (especially when walking up/down stairs) because I find it hard to breathe in it and have started hyperventilating many times. But I put it back up during class or when people walk by me.\n\nOn the first day of school, I saw a lot of students not wearing masks outside, but everyone was wearing them inside.\n\nSince then, I've only seen 2 people not wear their masks. One was a student, and the other was my history professor who has always taken it off to teach. But really, other than that, everyone wears it, and wears it properly. (Just..uh, not me...\\*sweats\\*)\n\n2. I'm not even aware of elevator policies here, but I've only seen one person use the elevator so far this semester.\n\nAs for classroom policies, in some classes students are within 3 feet of each other instead of 6 feet apart.\n\n3. History professor doesn't wear mask when teaching. My other professors follow the procedures diligently.\n\n4. N/A?\n\n5. My college isn't testing anyone (as far as I know), which is stupid and sucks. I was under the impression everyone would be getting their temperature tested every time they entered any building. So much for that, lol\n\n6. Well, doing everything right does protect you much more than if you do everything wrong.\n\n7. It seems to be working out okay for my classes, honestly. I could be underestimating what my professors are going through, but I'm overall impressed/happy with how they're handling it.",

It doesn't have dorms so luckily that's not even a worry. \n\nThe only classes allowed on campus are labs, studios, and a select few that really require hands on work. For those, you can only go in on one of your scheduled days and the other day is for the other half of the class.\n\nYou have to take a screening test before coming on campus and present a code at every door you enter which is scanned by a staff member behind a screen. Masks are required at all times. Elevators are one person only. \n\nIt only has about 7000 attendees this year and probably barely 2,000 that need to be on campus, so that accounts for how effective they've been so far. I just hope they don't get lenient as the semester goes on. Can't say as to how open they will be about cases though.",

I agree that a lot of people that are having a hard time have other health factors  that play a role in how their body puts up a fight with COVID. This information may have changed since I\u2019ve last seen it, but 30% of athletes affected by this have contracted Myocarditis. The great thing about research and science is that it is constantly changing . You make mistakes before you find the answers .if what you say is true about the death rate, that\u2019s great. Let\u2019s look at people who have been affected by COVID financially, mentally, and emotionally. I would say that the number of people in that group is much higher. When it comes to disease , death is not the only factor. I\u2019m sure we both can agree that Covid-19 is affecting people in many aspects of life other than just being the sole cause of death on a death certificate.",

They don't allow visitors from different dorms to visit other dorms. We will have a mandatory \"wellness survey\" daily. We will take a new covid test every 2-3 weeks on campus, provided by campus health. We also have to take a covid test 5-7 days before arriving to campus, and we will take one as a check-in on moving day. If someone tests positive, they have an entire dorm section dedicated as the quarantine area. I feel like a lot of school, especially in the southern area, didn't have proper regulations, and I am feeling okay with being safe on campus.",

As someone who has not been sick but had to quarantine,now going on a month( found out last night my roommate was sick , she thinks COVID is a joke). I will say it completely uproots your life. It makes it hard to study. I basically packed as many bags as I could and I am now living in my partner\u2019s guest room.",
