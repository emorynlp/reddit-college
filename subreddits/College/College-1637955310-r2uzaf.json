  "text": "He\u2019s a freshman at college, and there\u2019s this course that he simply can\u2019t get anything done, so all the time he keeps insisting for me to do it for him. It\u2019s very annoying, today I told him that I\u2019ll be busy, and he kept insisting, telling me to try to find some time.\n\nWhat should I do? Would reporting to college for academic dishonesty be too much?",

You\u2019re not responsible for him completing his work and he knows better than to ask you the way he is. He\u2019s not in kindergarten he\u2019s a freshman. \n\nSo he\u2019s trying to use you and clearly doesn\u2019t care about your well being. I would tell him straight up that you\u2019re not going to help him and that you don\u2019t owe him anything, and asking again will result in consequences. If he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you anymore then hey, you dodged a bullet I\u2019d say. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to visit his problems on you, which is selfish on his part. You have every right to stand up for yourself, good luck!",
