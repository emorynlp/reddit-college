Great. I don't understand a single thing and whenever I search on Google or read the textbook, I still am so lost.

See what\u2019s going on (are you not understanding the concepts cause it\u2019s too wordy, is it too many things, do you blank on the exam?) and then see how you can fix it (maybe look up videos, write out the topics and tackle on at a time, practice relaxation techniques) Lastly, trust yourself that whatever happens you\u2019ll be okay!!
