  "text": "Right now I have a 79.2 and I just got a 66 on my second exam. Great. I don't understand a single thing and whenever I search on Google or read the textbook, I still am so lost. I'm already halfway into this class and I'm scared to find a tutor and just straight up tell them I just don't understand anything starting from the start. Any tips? Study tips? I will probably find a tutor after fall break. A nice comment might be nice :') I am really sad and feel panicked about my grade.",

It will be okay. \n\nSecond: take some time to figure out what you do and don\u2019t understand (you\u2019ve got more than an F so you understand *something*, and we can work with that). Even just a really basic list of topics that are yes, maybe, and no, can be really revealing, and it might also tell you (or tell a tutor) something about how you learn best. Maybe you\u2019re in great shape on the vocabulary, but you\u2019re not sure on how to apply it. Maybe Punnet squares are your jam but taxonomy is breaking your brain a bit. And this doesn\u2019t have to be anything super formal - just run down the table of contents in your textbook or flip through your notes thus far and jot down your first instincts. \n\nAlso - and yes, this is a totally shameless advertisement - if you\u2019re planning to look for a tutor I\u2019m taking new clients! PM me if you\u2019re interested.",

      "text": "First off take a breath! It\u2019s okay Bio is so difficult! Especially 101 classes sometimes cause they reallly want to weed students out. See what\u2019s going on (are you not understanding the concepts cause it\u2019s too wordy, is it too many things, do you blank on the exam?) and then see how you can fix it (maybe look up videos, write out the topics and tackle on at a time, practice relaxation techniques) Lastly, trust yourself that whatever happens you\u2019ll be okay!! I got a D on Orgo Chem and then learned I was in the wrong field. Now I\u2019m a straight A student",

If that\u2019s the case, understand that there\u2019s so many changes that happened at once (school and home?? That\u2019s a lot) You might be feeling unmotivated cause of how overwhelmed everything is rn. Write down what needs to be done for the week. It always seem so much when it\u2019s in your head. Get yourself a cute little notepad so you can do it every week. Break things down into smaller task and only focus on the smaller task; the big picture can come later. Also, just be gentle and understanding with yourself",
