      "text": "It's more common in easier majors and at schools with more grade inflation, but even then it's not particularly \"common.\"\n\nAlso, it's easy to get a 4.0 GPA while you're in college-- it's much harder to *keep* that 4.0 GPA. In other words, many freshmen get all A's their first semester, so technically all of those students have 4.0 GPAs. Keeping it up is quite a challenge, though.",

I would say this is how it goes: 3.0-3.1 = slightly below avg, 3.2-3.3 = average but good, 3.4-3.5 = above average and pretty good, 3.6-3.7 = Great GPA, better than pretty good, 3.8+ = WOW, do you study all the time or what?\n\nAlso, I agree with what someone said about keeping the 4.0. After your first semester you will see a lot of freshman with 3.7+ GPA, but after 2-3 semesters or so, you won\u2019t see that many anymore bcuz classes can get a bit harder, people lose motivation and realize a 4.0 is not necessary unless you trying to go to grad school, people get more responsibilities, or just life happens in general.",
