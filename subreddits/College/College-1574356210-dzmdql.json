  "text": "hi,\n\nim dumb. Im a junior in college and i feel like all ive done is fucked up. my freshman year my grades were okay, just above a 3.0 - but then i got in a relationship and my gpa was a 2.7, and then i got dumped & got in a serious car accident and my gpa that semester was literally a 1.599. Now, my cumulatvive gpa is a 2.564 and i feel so guilty and full of regret. I know i fucked up, but what can i do now in my last 3-4 semesters of college to bring it up? Ideally, I'd like to get up to a 3.0, but idek if thats possible.",

I pretty much bull shatted around and left. Long story short, I started up again 3 years ago at Shawnee State University and I graduate in December. Oh, by the way, I'll have a GPA just over 3.0. I've done every drug, gone to every party, been dumped and dated everyone, I've been depressed, poor, drunk, and lonely, but DUDE. If I can do it (no one thought I would, no one!) You can my dude! And let me tell you, it's really not that hard to do well in college. If I would have REALLY put 100% in to all my studies, attendance, etc., I would have gotten a 4.8 GPA. There's nothing to it. Go to class (you can even stay home some days!), do what you have to do, ask questions, use the help they offer you (counseling, USE YOUR ADVISOR), act like you want to be there, get some buds that you can rely on for help (questions about class, due dates, etc.), and HAVE FUN. We all have some darkness but dude! You have a beautiful and unique mind and when you add that to your heart, you can do anything you want. Fuck 3.0! Go for 4.0!!!

I know at my old school if you retook a course and received a better grade the better grade was the only one that factored into your gpa.

It's possible, dont give up because it seems impossible or others tell you it's not worth it. Retake classes if need be, take fluff electives if you're able to boost that gpa higher, hell take another semester specifically to upgrade your gpa if you need to it's nothing to be ashamed of. You have plenty of time to raise your scores and gpa up to a high level. And remember that it isnt all about gpa! Talk to your professors, clubs, research labs if that applies to your major, reach out to internships and graduate schools in person. A little effort and sincerely direct personality can really carry you beyond what you're expecting. Most importantly tho make sure you take care of yourself mentally and physically because a broken body cant help anyone, just remember that you arent alone and theres nothing to be ashamed of!

      "text": "I was in the same situation as you a few years ago. It definitely isn\u2019t too late to turn things around, but you\u2019re going to have to be willing to ask for help (Help isn\u2019t required, but it does make things easier while you transition)\n\nI find that getting straight A\u2019s after you\u2019ve just been through so much is not a very realistic approach. You would just be saddling yourself with a lot of pressure and setting yourself up for a painful fall.\n\nInstead, speak to your counselor to see if courses can be dropped. Then speak to your parents honestly and see if they\u2019d be willing to help you as you remediate your grades.\n\nI see that some have already offered the advice of retaking courses, and I think that is excellent advice, especially if you are in a STEM major (a lot of the courses build on each other, and you\u2019d be putting yourself at a disadvantage if you try to plow on ahead with large gaps in fundamental knowledge. Plus half the fun in learning is in understanding why things are the way they are. If you get that, you\u2019ll minimize the need for memorization).\n\nNow that you are ready to give it your best effort, set yourself up for success. It may seem completely abhorrent to you, but consider having a light semester or two  (if you are able) where you take less hours than you usually do. Sure, it\u2019ll delay your graduation date, but it can mean the difference between graduating or not. \n\nThis will give you time to develop and reinforce good study habits before you go back to full course loads. It\u2019ll also give you some time to take care of mental health. I don\u2019t know what is actually keeping you from studying, but for me it was a mix between the sense of wanting to have things perfect and spending excessive amounts of time playing video games (because it was predictable and gave me instant gratification when I got things right). For me, reading Stephen Guise\u2019s How to be an Imperfectionist helped me begin to break out of my need to do things perfectly. After that, it was just habit building. Everyone does it differently, so find what works for you. If you\u2019d like a place to start, I highly recommend the Pomodoro technique with a 5 minute break-25 minute study interval. Feel free to make intervals as small as you like. Ultimately, the point is really to break any resistance you may have to just begin the task of studying. And once that\u2019s done, I\u2019ve found myself to be quite self sustaining.\n\nThen seek out friends in class. Look for the people who sit near the front row and become friends with them. And I don\u2019t mean just so you can use them. Really, make a concerted effort to be friends with them. Work hard in class, and ask for help from them when you need it. They are just as human as you, and one day, they will need your help as well. In this way, you will build yourself a support network for the days that you aren\u2019t feeling up to speed.\n\nIf your school offers it, I\u2019d highly recommend speaking to a counselor, otherwise consider finding a therapist. They are not as expensive as you might think. I paid $45/hour with mine when we first started out as he knew my circumstances and that I was tight financially. My only regret is that I didn\u2019t pursue therapy earlier in life. I connect better with people now and have better ways to cope with change than before.\n\nLast of all, realize that even if you do everything I\u2019ve suggested, there will be days where school/life will take a massive dump on you. On those days, spend time with your family and friends. Lean on them. People care more about you and your wellbeing than you may think. Then dust yourself off and try again. Remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, you just have to give it your best effort. \n\nGood luck on your journey!",

In other words, do what it takes to earn higher grades. It takes *a lot* of time and work, and trial and error, but it is something you can do.\n2. Take some time to find out what policies apply on your campus. (It's different at each school, so don't ask people here). Two possible policies are if you re-take a class and get a better grade, the higher grade replaces the lower one, and something along the lines of \"academic renewal\" or \"forgivness\" where if you do well for a certain number of semesters/units, you can have some substandard grades removed from your GPA calculation. Give your college catalog a good read and go talk to an academic counselor on your campus to see what options you have.\n3. I'd recommend take no more than a normal load of classes in the next semester, so you can get your study skills well developed before taking on a bigger challenge. But after that, you might consider taking a larger number of classes/units each semester, because the more classes you take with higher grades, the more that will bring up your grade point *average*. Also consider summer to take an extra class or two (but don't overload yourself in the summer, as that can make success difficult). You might also consider, where you have room for electives in your schedule, shop around for an \"easy\" class to bring up your grades.",

I literally felt like the dumbest piece of shit for YEARS because I couldn\u2019t stay organized or focused on assignments, even though I used to be a straight-A student all the way up until 7th Grade. The thing is, I wasn\u2019t dumb. I just had a condition that I didn\u2019t know I had. It\u2019s hard to address an issue if you don\u2019t even know you have it in the first place!!",
