Also I don\u2019t even really feel like talking to most people, but I\u2019m so sad now, I just want to find one person who I can really relate to\u2026.",

      "text": "I feel you. I didn't feel like talking to anybody either when I started and I rlly missed out. Sometimes, I wish I could've gone back and been more sociable. Now, I'm currently a senior and still haven't found my group. I like to think I will tho regardless of the fact that it won't be long before I graduate out into the real world. But if it's anything, I'll be your friend! Dm if you want, no pressure.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't be so quick to jump to the conclusion that you're all alone. Lots of people start out that way and college can be lonely at first. But it doesn't have to be that way bc I believe there's a group out there for everyone to join and there are tons of people who likely share the same interests. Try to go ahead and join some orgs or clubs, you'd be amazed at how many people wanna be your friend. I know it sounds easier than done since you said you don't feel like talking to people, but it's either stay quiet or take the risk to find that one friend.",
