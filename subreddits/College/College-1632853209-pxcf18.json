Keep in mind I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Dyslexia. but, I made it through it and got into college. Freshman year I was on cloud 9. great grades, excelling in my engineering classes and following my dreams. \n\nWhen covid hit and the whole world shut down all my classes moved from in person to all online. So, I learned to adapt to online learning and simply keep my head above water like everyone else at that\n\nNow a year and a half later I\u2019m in the middle of my junior year and everyone is pretending everything is the same. For me the world ended the day covid hit. I lost all normalcy and stability during lockdown that I had spent my entire life to develop for college. I have switched my major 3 times and I\u2019m quickly running out of time and it\u2019s all my fault. Honestly I\u2019m so lost\u2026 \n\nThis semester I was forced to quit my job to focus on my classes. I am taking survey of calculus, microeconomics, data analysis and interpretation and accounting. It was not me decision to take all of these classes at the same time, I trusted my advisor to help me and instead they screwed me. If I don\u2019t pass all my classes this semester I will lose my scholarship and my parents will pull me out of college causing the past 12 years of school to count for nothing.\n\nI\u2019m really at the point in my life where everything I do will affect me for the rest of my life. I have worked my ass off entire life until this point and now everything is coming to a head. How have you all adapted to post lockdown campus? And what suggestions can you give me to survive a loaded semester.\n\nIf you read this far thank you I\u2019m really having a tough time but, I know I\u2019m not alone.", "author": "Honey_Badger227", "created": 1632853209, "retrieved": 1632945410, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hemxe2e": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pxcf18/post_lockdown_life_has_ruined_me_help/hemxe2e/", "text": "If you do your work from easiest to hardest, you will have less on your shoulders by the time you get to the hard part. It's like doing a test. When you get stuck on something, you move on. \n\nWhen you find a reason to be motivated to do your work, you'll find yourself at your most productive. When you are passionate about what you're doing and your mind is stimulated, you blaze through your work. If you let yourself think enthusiastically, you will become more enthusiastic about your work. I hope. \n\nIf you want someone to talk to, I'm here. I don't bite.
