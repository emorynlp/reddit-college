  "title:": "HELP: Stressed / anxious about not being motivated enough to work on assignments or even to study.",
  "text": "I have been having these phases (starting this academic year) where im absolutely demotivated to do anything related to college. Before i sleep, in my head theres a list of things that i COULD be doing instead of lying down in bed. I feel terrible because there\u2019s absolutely no reason for me to not go ahead with starting work. I love what Im studying, yet I fail to be discipline and motivated through out this course (my point being, its something internal rather than something to do with what im studying). \n\nPeople keep telling me to take a break, to relax, but that just stresses me out further because i have done nothing to earn that yet and instead the problem is that my \u201cbreak\u201d has been on for too long !",

      "text": "I generally have to discipline to do my work, but it can be more difficult by Friday when it's near the weekend.  So what I like to do is compromise. I\u2019ll try to get one or two assignments done or study for x amount of time until I\u2019m done for the day. I may also take 10-15 minute breaks if I feel I need it to prevent from burning out.",

      "text": "Anxiety and procrastination can be a vicious cycle - you get anxious so you don't work, which makes you more anxious, etc. For me, it's been helpful to set small goals. Preferably something that I can do in less than 30 mins. Instead of reading a chapter, I can read a subsection; instead of writing a paper, I can take notes on one source I'll use for it. It helps me feel like I'm making progress and am in control. Sometimes I find that I get in the zone and end up doing much more than I initially planned - which is awesome, but I also remind myself it's okay to just do a little bit. Good luck - I hope you find your motivation again!",
