  "title:": "Is it wrong to reject driving my dorm mates to and back from parties?",
  "text": "In college and I have a truck, it can be hard affording gas sometimes but I will happily drive my dorm mates to get food and anything they need. But they ask me sometimes to drive them to big parties that last all night. And I usually like parties but this year I want to make some extra money. But I usually agree and want them to be safe but i waste at least 20$ in gas money driving them to and back from parties. They don\u2019t have much money to even pay for gas. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s selfish to reject them rides to parties because it\u2019s time consuming or to make money to afford gas.",

For three friends that's enough to cover gas and get some breakfast for yourself in the morning after driving them back.\n\nIf you drink once in a while make sure to tell them that you aren't always going to be able to do this all the time and there will be some nights where you don't want to be the driver.\n\nAlternatively you can just take turns driving, split an Uber, or use public transit.",
