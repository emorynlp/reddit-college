Then again my state has been doing pretty well in terms of Covid. I feel like they they overestimated how bad the fall semester would be.",

Sure, it provides some protection, but it's greatly reduced, and the best way we can be protected is to not be put into risk of getting it in the first place. Add that to the fact that we're at *far* greater risk of dying from it, and you've got a big problem. Given that vaccination of someone with a healthy immune system is ~90% effective in stopping infection and thus stopping spread, those who aren't getting vaccinated are directly increasing spread, and thus putting people like myself who are immunosuppressed or otherwise immunocompromised at increased risk. There are almost 4 million Americans that are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed; that's a significant portion of the population.\n\nSure, as someone who has a healthy immune system, you're probably not worried about the unvaccinated if you're vaccinated, but I don't have that luxury. Though you should know that it's still possible for you to catch and die of COVID even while vaccinated, so you really should care. Even if I *don't* catch COVID, hospitals are still being overwhelmed by unvaccinated COVID patients, so if I need an emergency surgery because of my condition, I simply won't be able to get it because the unvaccinated are taking up almost all hospital resources. So even if I don't catch it, the unvaccinated are *still* putting me at much greater risk both directly and indirectly.\n\nUnderstand now?",

                          "text": "The only legitimate medical exemption to the approved vaccines is an allergy to a vaccine component that is *shared across all approved vaccines*. There is not a single medical condition that has proven to be any issue when receiving these vaccines, even those on chemotherapy (although immunosuppressive therapies reduce the efficacy of the vaccine). Do you also say that you should *do what you want* when it comes to vaccinations for Polio, Measles, and many other life threatening diseases that have had outbreaks in recent years due to anti-vaxxers? What reason would you have to oppose vaccination to COVID?\n\nThose are legitimate questions that I'd be curious to hear you answer. As someone who is immunosuppressed and directly impacted by the rate of infection - as vaccines are far less effective for me and I'm at much greater risk of hospitalization and death - I don't understand why people refuse to reduce spread. Those who aren't getting vaccinated are directly increasing the chance that I catch it when I need to leave my home to work, pick up groceries, or even just go to an appointment with one of my doctors. Not to mention how hospitals are full because of unvaccinated COVID patients, so if I needed to get an emergency surgery for my condition (which really isn't unlikely), then I'd just be shit out of luck and either die waiting for an opening, or face serious and irreversible damage.\n\nWhat motivation do people have to avoid vaccination when it affects myself and those like me (almost 4 million immunosuppressed or otherwise immunocompromised individuals in the US) so dramatically? I'd like to be able to live my life without fearing stepping outside my house because I could catch an illness whose spread is *preventable*, which has a high likelihood of hospitalizing or killing me despite being vaccinated. I'm sure that the 4 million others like me in this country feel the same way. What is so important that people feel no remorse actively increasing the risk that those around them die?",

Any doctor who *doesn't* is standing against peer-reviewed medicine and clinical trials, which is the entire foundation of approved medical treatment. Anaphylaxis is the only major concern of vaccination throughout all the safety studies done. That only happens when you're *allergic to a vaccine component*. If you're worried about the absolute miniscule chance of thrombosis from J&J, then get an mRNA vaccine. *They're more effective anyway*.\n\nDo you believe that someone needs to be a doctor to be knowledgeable about the safety of a vaccine that has peer-reviewed safety studies posted absolutely everywhere? It's absolutely absurd to think that. Contrary to popular belief, medical doctors aren't the high authority with vaccines. *Virologists* are much more qualified to provide recommendations, and I haven't seen a single virologist recommend against vaccinations for those who aren't allergic to components. And as you can see in recent news, medical doctors who *have* expressed anti-vaccine sentiments have been discredited. In fact, these studies are publicly available; go on and do the research yourself. If you're in this sub, then you're a college student right? You should understand how to do your own research.",

I thought it was okay considering the school's policies on vaccination and masks, and the covid cases in our area. \n\nUntil classes started. First math class, Thursday, my professor said she was going to Disney on Saturday for her birthday and coming back Sunday. We had our next class on Tuesday, then Wednesday morning she emails us that she tested positive for covid, and we were going virtual for 2 weeks. \n\nIt absolutely blew up the start to my semester for that class and things have been going horribly for me since then. I tried talking to my professor, that I've been struggling with class due to alot of family medical stuff, including my own, on top of the abrupt change to virtual and my struggles with that. She basically responded with the fact that she had covid and she still taught class so I as a student just need to get better at school. \n\nI mean she's right but I've had virtually zero motivation to work in this class since that conversation. My physics professor offered to help me file a complaint but given my academic history and the shotty work I've done for this class so far, I'm afraid it would just be a waste of time and kick back in my face. \n\nSorry, it seems I used your post asking about american universities as a way to vent, which I guess I needed. Maybe this gives more insight into how some American students are actually feeling.",

I mean, hasn't sickness in general typically been an \"excused\" absence pre-covid, anyway? Seriously, what's with not allowing sick people to stay home?",

They're not allowed to mandate vaccines here because of the Republican governor so we get emails every week reminding us that everyone REALLY should choose to get vaccinated because the local ICU is pretty much full.",
