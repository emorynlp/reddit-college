  "text": "Right now, I am receiving financial aid that covers all my tuition but not enough to cover housing. Since I am living with my parents that is not a problem. However next year, I plan to move on campus. If I declare independent with less than 5k annual income and 15k in financial aid, would I get more generous financial aid since I no longer am connected with my parents' income?",

Their has been legislation to fix that but it's stalled (US) however changed can be made on the individual level so you might want to reach out to financial aid to see if you can get a larger aid package.",
