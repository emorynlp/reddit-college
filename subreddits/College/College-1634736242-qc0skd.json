  "text": "Hi! I'm an international applicant. What are some not so well known ways to finance your college education? We all know about financial aid, part time jobs and education loans. Are there any other ways that not many people are aware of? Like maybe an amazing external scholarship for international students? If you know anything of that sort, please let me know. Thank you.",
