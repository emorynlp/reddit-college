      "text": "These are both decent degrees, but they also lead to different outcomes.\n\nAccounting is a *profession*. If you receive an accounting degree, that's likely what you'll be doing for the rest of your life (if you so choose). You will earn a good income with good job stability.\n\nComputer Science is what I'd call a 'foot in the door' degree. If you're a 21-year-old using a CS degree to leverage your way into a decent-paying job, that's a good thing. If you're a 40-year-old expecting your CS degree to sustain stable employment, you're probably in trouble. You'll either need a lot more education to continue in the field as a Computer Scientist or you'll need to pick up an additional sphere of rarefied knowledge or managerial skills to sustain a career.",

              "text": "Computer Science *at the PhD level* is a reasonably stable career.\n\nThe reason Computer Science opens up so many entry level jobs is because it provides a valuable skill. However, there is relatively limited career advancement potential because you don't put people into senior positions for their coding skills.\n\nA good thing to keep in mind when you're looking into jobs/companies is to take a look around. If you don't see people in their 40s doing the job, that means you won't be doing that job in your 40s either. You need to figure out why you won't be doing that job and what else you'll be doing. Not necessarily right away, but don't get trapped in the mindset that you've found your 'career' because you've just found the stepping stone to a potential career.",
