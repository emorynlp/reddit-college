Here is a one minute one: https://youtu.be/cEqZthCaMpo \nSecond, write down affirmations (works every single time with me). Write things like: i know the material really well; i am so thankful i got 100 on the exam; i knew the answer to every single question on the exam; the material comes naturally to me; i am intelligent; i am smart etc etc. Look up exam affirmations on Google, they will help you script the affirmations.\nNow you should be more or less calm.\nFinally, try this guided meditation  https://youtu.be/p7Rfz3M0hIo . If you enjoyed it, there are plenty of other guided meditations on YouTube that you can try. \n\nDo this right now and tomorrow before the exam. If you want you can do it at night as well. \nWhen you feel calm, try solving the exercises again.\nBe kind to yourself. And don't say you 'you don't have time', these shouldn't take more than 20 minutes", "author": "West-Ad8997", "created": 1632120263, "upvotes": 3}}}
