  "text": "Hi everyone, currently trying to finish up pre-recs for nursing, this semester I made the mistake of taking a 7 week Anatomy and Physiology I course while working over 40 hours a week overnights, stressed out and not sleeping enough. \n\nThis sounds like a recipe for disaster, I know, I put too much on my plate. I wasnt able to meet the minimum grade requirement of C, got very close but now I must retake. \n\nBut the basis of my question is this. I encountered these questions on exams that are obviously intended to make you apply what you\u2019ve learned and apply it to a new scenario, ie use problem solving or critical thinking to arrive at an answer,  for a question that wasn\u2019t plucked straight from the lecture or text. \n\nI feel dumb but, for the life of me I cant understand how what I learned is supposed to enable me to answer the question. It seems too dissimilar. Maybe my brain is shot from stress and lack of sleep, or my crappy lifestyle, I also dont study well and usually try to cram over a couple days before the test, but this happens to me in other subjects like Algebra and Computer science. I\u2019m not stupid, but I\u2019m worried that I lack too much of the right kind of intelligence for these subjects. I know intelligence is largely genetic and my Dad is dumber than a bag of goddamn hammers. My Mom though is pretty smart, and a Nurse. \n\nBesides better time management and healthier lifestyle, what else can I  do next semester as far as study materials/habits to avoid being stumped by these types of questions?\n**I\u2019m not changing majors, its either this or back to retail or entrepreneurship for good.**",

      "text": "Continue exposing yourself to those problem solving/critical thinking scenario questions. Perhaps also look into courses online like Magoosh that break down and thoroughly explain how they arrive at answers. Idk if Magoosh has a program specifically designed for nursing exams, but I do know they have ones for MCAT prep that covers clinical questions, physiology, anatomy so maybe they\u2019ll have one geared for nursing too. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are dumb and there isn\u2019t the right type of intelligence in my opinion. You do need to put in more time to your studies though and learn what type of learner you are. I\u2019m a slow learner and I like to draw and map out what I\u2019m learning, for example. Also a visual learner too. I used to straight up just read from a textbook and did not retain the info well so i tried other study tools like watching videos on YouTube relevant to what I read and at the end of reading and watching videos, I would summarize what I learned by mapping it out on a piece of paper. It would take me an hour or more just to finish a 5-10 minute video most of the time \ud83d\ude05 because I had to pause the video to organize what in the worlds I just learned, but this type of studying helped me retain the info and helped me perform well in class. I took physiology and other \u201chard core\u201d science courses like biochem, organic chem, and cell bio in undergrad and this study tool worked well for me! You could try if this works for you. \ud83e\udd13\n\nIf you can try for one semester, cut your work hours in half and dedicate that time to studying to determine if it is the lack of effective studying that has been negatively effecting you from improving your grades. Sleep also helps rejuvenate/recharges your neurons and improves your health by a lot so also incorporate that into your lifestyle.\n\nBtw\u2026since your mom is a nurse\u2026have you tried asking her for advice on how she studied when she was in your position?",

          "text": "Thank you so much my friend. Great response.\nI currently have a job in healthcare where I already have to use problem solving and critical thinking (cardiac arrhythmia analysis) so I don\u2019t think its mentally out of reach for me, I\u2019m just a slow/different learner like you said. If I don\u2019t procrastinate and let the stress pile up I\u2019ll probably be able to learn faster and gain a deeper understanding.",

              "text": "YW!\n\nAnd that\u2019s great that you have a job in healthcare already. You\u2019re getting relevant experience to the career you want and that\u2019s definitely going to help you out. \n\nWhen I took anatomy, I was also using this app (forgot what it\u2019s called). It wasn\u2019t free from what I remember, but it was worth the purchase. During my down time (waiting for bus or during work break), I would go through it. It\u2019s one of those interactive games where you label/locate organs and their functions. Pretty fun stuff \ud83d\ude2c and it helped me retain info for when I had to take a cumulative final for anatomy.",

                  "text": "Thanks! my mom went to nursing school during the lawless wasteland of the 1980\u2019s, back then everyone would just snort a bunch of coke and study/party all night. Professors were more strict but also corrupt, and could also be bribed for better grades\u2026with what\u2026 god only knows. \n\nFor me, the physiology is more difficult than the anatomy. For Anatomy its just memorization, for physiology they can literally ask you any detail about a bodily process, a conceptual or problem solving question, or ask you an ordering question about anything like muscle contraction or action potentials.",
