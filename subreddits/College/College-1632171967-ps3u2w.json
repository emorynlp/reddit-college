  "text": "Okay so last year I got a 4.0. First year back to school after 4 years of the marines and it was a great start\n\nThis semester is different. Currently on track for nursing and in anatomy right now and about to bomb the exam and practical tomorrow. I had two other exams these past two days and a bunch of other school stuff. Of course they piled everything in one weekend and nothing next weekend. Well I got a D on one exam and pretty sure a C or low B in my one I just had today (hopefully). I\u2019m incredibly burnt out already, have had zero time to hang with friends or family. It\u2019s just been school and work and not even working a lot. I met with my advisor and she didn\u2019t really listen to me when I said I\u2019m going to bomb anatomy and it\u2019s gonna hurt my other classes. She just has a lot of hope cause I did so well last year. \n\nGonna take the exam and practical and meet with her again and probably switch majors and use my pass/fail on anatomy and it\u2019s lab.I can\u2019t drop it because then I wouldn\u2019t get the fully living allowance from the GI bill because I need it as I only have $600 to my name",
