  "text": "20M, did not have grade school friends.\nThought university would be a change, but several semesters in and barely have anyone to interact with.\nOf the ones who do, many I know through something specific, like group study in class, and they seem to have me pigeonholed into that role: they seek me out when the context comes up but would not bring me closer or into anything else they do.\nExtracurriculars? Mine is laboratory research, and I spend much of the weekday daytime there, as the only undergrad in the group.\nWeekends? Friday night tends to be a scramble to finish homework, Saturday I often sleep in until evening, and on Sunday the next week of study is starting and I need to prepare for that.\nClubs? Here they are either highly exclusive black-tie \u201csecret societies\u201d, which I have no interest in trying to get into (and also prefer the comfort of dressing informally to the extreme), or informal gatherings I would need to be closer to others to get into. I also do not care to get drunk.\nJust talking to others? That could have been viable at the very beginning, now everyone has their own friend groups, and why would they let someone else in?\nHow do I make an inroad?",
