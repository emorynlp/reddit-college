There was this quick stop cafeteria on the 2nd floor of the student union building with great grilled chicken sandwiches, and breaded chicken wraps with bacon and cheese and mayo... the smoothie station was the bomb too.  Cheeseburgers were grilled fresh and ready in no time. they worked really hard in there.\n\nThen there was more of a secluded coffeehouse vibe cafe next door, and sometimes they had kinda boogee meals being served (think pesto paninis with Asian sesame eggrolls or something like that).  The cafe was really nice but all I really remember about it was that that's where I watched Hurricane Katrina happen, on the big screen TV.  Like literally as I was eating that panini, the city of New Orleans was inundated with water... and I cried.  I actually sat there and cried, i was so upset... i didn't even know anyone in Louisiana but my heart really went out to them.  Poor people, to this day they always get hit by something.\n\nAnd then there was the large cafeteria - really quite big where you'd pay with your card up front and then all these kids (and being that i was closeted and was checking out all the boys, these were all unattainable hot jock guys and their petite blonde girlfriends... the girlfriends I knew because they were very nice to talk to) were eating things like pizza, chicken wings, nachos and cheese (which was my favorite part of the buffet line), pasta, i mean it was wonderful... I love American style foods, and I love buffets so it was great... just very overwhelming if you were eating by yourself.\n\nThere wasn't really any cliques, but most college kids ate with friends or classmates or something.  I was a total loner, had no social life, and my friends were always busy at that time... \n\nThis is why I closed the campus library on Friday nights, and was there first thing on Saturday morning - i was basically the epitome of the dorky nerdy boy, pretty much an extension of high school.... \n\nI want to go back to school so bad, and from what I hear, Simmons College (now Simmons U actually) in Boston has pretty decent food.  I might just decide to live on the campus because I think that's what i missed in the first try of college, which wasn't a good experience overall even though I did meet some great peeps, and yes the food was Amazeballs (a word, btw, that we did not use back then in the mid-00s)\n\nSo what about y'all?  What's the food like at your college, and if you are just looking at colleges, is food ranking high on your list of qualities you seek in your dream school?  \n\nWhat types of foods would you want your school to have that they don't already have?  Do you feel the campus food leans towards healthy or unhealthy, and are there options for you if you're vegetarian or vegan or lactose-intolerant?", "author": null, "created": 1632672563, "retrieved": 1632945905, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hee32xe": {"link": "/r/college/comments/pvwtau/how_do_you_like_the_food_on_your_campus/hee32xe/", "text": "The food that I have at my college is okay.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the school does not serve my favorite food (pasta) very often, which is a huge bummer, especially when compared to a different college that I toured, which had a whole pasta bar.\n\nI don't know if its just me, but my school seems to have a weird obsession with rice. Like...they serve rice a lot. Way more than pasta it seems (could be just my bias I guess).\n\nI'm a picky eater, so the unfortunate reality is that the school does not really serve a huge variety of things I want. I'll get plain pasta if its available, but otherwise I just eat pizza plus apple juice almost every day. They don't have a ton of fruits and vegetables I want.\n\nThe store on campus isn't really that spectacular for me because they mostly just serve junk food. What little healthy food they might have doesn't interest me.", "author": "ZitiRotini", "created": 1632688353, "upvotes": 2}}}
