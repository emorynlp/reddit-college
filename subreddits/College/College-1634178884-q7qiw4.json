  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school, and I\u2019ve lived in Wisconsin my whole life, and really want to go to college out of state, but whenever I bring it up to my mom, she advises against it because of the price for out of state students. My counselor and teachers also advise against it as well, just in a more subtle manner. \n\nI know that some of the surrounding states offer instate tuition, but it\u2019s the Midwest. I\u2019m looking at colleges on the East coast.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do because on one hand, money is a real issue, but on the other, I just want to get out of WI.",

      "text": "I went out of state for my bachelor's degree. But they offered me a scholarship that was too good to turn down, and actually made it cheaper than any of the schools I was considering in my home state. It was a good experience, but I would only recommend it if you can at least get the out of state tuition waived.\n\nIs there a different part of your home state you might like better than where you are living right now (e.g. big city vs. small town)? That might be another option to get away from home while still taking advantage of in state tuition.",

      "text": "Im not telling you what to do, but.....\n\nI choose to stay in state instead of going out of state. It was only going to cost $3k more a year to go out of state, but sooooo many of the scholarships I applied to and received only applied to in-state schools. I saved about $20k in total by going in state, which actually prevented me from having to take out loans. Also, my parents live 3 hours from my university.  If I need to it is super easy for me to go home just for a weekend, and going home costs $40 in gas, not a $200 plane ticket. But, at the same time, I am far enough away from my family, that I feel independent and like I successfully got out of my hometown",

And almost 400k to go out of state.\n\nJust a basic Google search shows a French teacher starting at 35k a year. So in my opinion I would either pick a major that has a better return. Or avoid a four year university and start with community college to cut as much cost as possible and transfer after two years.\n\nMy sister spent almost 400k and she went to med school so going into that much debt for a 35k salary is a step in the wrong direction. You'd be stuck paying that debt off for decades.",
