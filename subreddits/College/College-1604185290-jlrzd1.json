You tell yourself that you'll work on it after watching an episode of your show, or after taking a nap because you're too exhausted to start this assignment. After hours of putting off your work, you finally decide to open your laptop and start. You click on the assignment and 5 minutes later you find yourself on your phone, distracted once again. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that you are completely capable of acing your classes, of earning the grades you'll be happy with. All it takes is a conscious effort to complete your assignments and set aside time for your studies. \n\nProcrastination stems from fear, and the key is to do your work despite *feeling* like you want to procrastinate. There is no physical barrier between you and your assignments, it's all mental. So, ground yourself, stop the self sabotaging, and get it done. You\u2019ll feel awesome and accomplished and still have time to do everything else you like. Nothing is above you, nothing is too difficult for you, and you are more than capable of being *that* student.\n\nEdit: The intent behind this post wasn\u2019t to completely change lives, to sound cheery, to oversimplify a bigger problem or to sell something. It\u2019s a short post and I personally love coming across things like this because it makes me feel not so alone with these struggles. I know the internet is saturated with fake positivity these days. You are free to take it or leave it. On the other hand, I\u2019m so glad many of you could relate and found this motivating. I often journal stuff like this but I wanted to share it today because I thought it might resonate with people.", "author": "ochemgenius", "created": 1604185290, "retrieved": 1632947083, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1775, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gav4yff": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jlrzd1/stop_selfsabotaging_because_you_are_capable/gav4yff/", "text": "This post serves as my motivation well.
