  "text": "Hi, so I'm a college freshman. \nI'm getting my associates in liberal arts, and my dream is to become an archeologist. \n\nI've somewhat figured out what I need to do academically, but as far as actually entering the career I don't even know where to begin. There's tons of associations and organizations for the different branches od archeology, but I guess I am struggling trying to figure out how exactly I'm going to enter this career whenever I do. \n\nDo I just search for it on google jobs? Do I contact organizations? I get that I still have a while before I need to worry about this kind of thing, but I want to be prepared...\n\n\nShould I try applying for an internship after I get my associates (/before if I am eligible)? I am thinking that may help in terms of climbing up the career ladder a little bit (and if I can land a job that will help me pay for further education that would be great).\n\nJust a little freaked right now thinking about the future and worrying whether I will even be able to get the job \n\nPS. \nI'm aware that the likelyhood of me changing paths is very high, and I am definitely just riding the wave of life no matter what (i.e nothing is set in stone for me rn\ud83d\ude01)",

      "text": "A career like that probably requires a graduate degree on top of your normal bachelors (although I could be wrong)\n\nRegardless, the best solution is to reach out to professors at your school, if an archeology prof at a nearby school if there\u2019s no department at your college. They will have the most specific knowledge, far more likely than us rando\u2019s on the internet",
