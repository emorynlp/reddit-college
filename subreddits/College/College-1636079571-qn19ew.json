  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in high school looking for extra colleges to add to my list.\nI\u2019m thinking about majoring in science and would like a school that is strong academically and where I would be challenged. I\u2019m leaning towards LAC because I feel like it would be more meaningful learning and I\u2019d like tk get to know the professors \nAt the same time I love the outdoors, spending time with friends, ect. I don\u2019t want to waste college being stressed, I wan it to be a fun experience that isn\u2019t cutthroat.\nRight now I\u2019m applying to CC Whitman Macalster and other similar schools and possibly williams (I love the school but seems to elitist)\nDoes anyone know of other schools which are academically challenging without being overally cut throat, have a chill student body, and preferably good outdoor access? Merrit scholarships are also a plus.",

      "text": "It would be helpful if you say what is your goal - trade, bachelors, master and what degree?  \nAlso, what area? All USA?\n\nOne thing I can say right now - do NOT go to school or choose school based on how much \"fun\" experiences you will get. School is an investment in your future and studying and getting the skill should be the priority. It sounds lame but when you are older and you will realize that you could go to better school and shouldn't choose over what experience you will have and now you do not even know these people yo will hear my words again. You can have fun and fun experiences anywhere.   \nIf you want to get any decent and worthy degree that is worth your time and money, college WILL be stressful. You do not get good salary and great position in the field so easily. If this was the case everybody would be NASA astronauts.   \nSure, you can go for easy degree but you will end up with basically a general education like everybody else, you will have your \"fun\" and you will be working low wages and struggling in life.   \nTake advice from an older student college who wished knew it at age of 20 instead of going to college and finally doing it right at age of 27.",

It is up to you it be memorable. Just because you go to Harvard doesn't mean your experience will be more memorable than in UCLA or smth or some other community college.\n\n  \nYou will be stressed I repeat, college isn't easy lol  \n\n\nThe rest I can not suggest school cause you did not answer my questions lol",

              "text": "Hmm... I do not know where you re located, but if you are still uncertain it would be worth starting at community college to get basic credits and then get transferred. You will save TONS of money as community college is way cheaper. And it will help you figure out if you wanna go into medicine or chemistry or biology. You will probably need to try some things and experience before you can commit to an bachelors in university. Start with AS at community college that's my suggestion.",

              "text": "Don\u2019t listen to the other person below. If you do premed community college is not a good idea. Go to a state research university that has many opportunities in a big city. This is because you will have a ton of research opportunities and you can volunteer at hospitals close by. You will have a big advantage. \n\nI warn you premed is cutthroat and it is not easy or fun. Science classes in college are usually weed out especially premed so the try curve your grades to a low average. You also need to do many labs which do not count as credit. You spend equally as much time in your chemistry class and lab class. Those are like 5 credit classes but the lab doesn\u2019t count as credit so you\u2019re basically using your free time. I would reconsider premed if you don\u2019t want unnecessary stress. It will bring lots of stress. Premed is extremely cutthroat people are equally or more qualified than you. There are minimal spots so you need to be competitive in order to get in.",
