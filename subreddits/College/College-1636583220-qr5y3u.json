  "title:": "What Graduate program should I stay away from?",
  "text": "So I really need to decide on a graduate degree soon.  I'm a fresh Lt in the military and am trying to decide on a program.  I'm wanting to pursue anything in Business, Computer Science, Information Systems and more.  I really want to pursue an MBA type of program (the cyber MBAs look pretty cool) but I'm pretty weak in mathematics.  I struggled in the few business statistics and Pre Calc that I took for my degree...  I ordinarily wouldn't worry as I do okay in person classes but this will probably be strictly online.  Which grad programs are math heavy??  Any advice on which way to pursue is greatly appreciated!",
