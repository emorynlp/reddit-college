  "text": "I go to UChicago and there's a few copypastas particular to UChicago that have emerged over the years. The two that specifically come to mind are [\"Scav bothers me\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/uchicago/comments/2659je/q_how_do_you_know_someone_went_to_harvard_a_they/) (referring to the annual scavenger hunt) and [\"Greek Life vs. Greek Philosophy\"](https://chicagomaroon.com/article/2017/11/6/greek-life-vs-greek-philosophy/) (a widely panned article in our school newspaper). I was wondering, do other people's schools have any copypastas specifically relating to them? If you happen to know of one I'd love to read what kinds of things other people have come up with at other colleges instead of studying for my physics midterm.",
