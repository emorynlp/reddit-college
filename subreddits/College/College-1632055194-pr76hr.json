My problem is I\u2019m not really enjoying these accounting classes to me they are pretty boring. I\u2019m hoping that finance isn\u2019t really the same in terms of what you study, am I right?\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far accounting is mostly how you collect and organize money. I\u2019m more interested in something that deals with problem solving and how to actually acquire the money rather than how to organize it.\n\nShould I stop thinking about a finance degree or proceed?\n\nAlso economics is not an option for me, just in case anyone is thinking about it.\n\nAny advice?
