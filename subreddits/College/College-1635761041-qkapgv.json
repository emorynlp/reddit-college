I (as professor) didn't even have the option of converting an incomplete to a W (withdrawal); the Registrar would have had to do that.\n\nDo you want to retake the courses?  If you get a C, can you still retake and have the old grade removed from your GPA?  Will missing prerequisites derail your current plans?  That's something to consider.\n\nTalk to your advisor.",

It\u2019s either incomplete or drop.\n\nThere are no retakes for courses that already have a numerical grade unfortunately but yes, I want to retake to get a better grade than a possible C.\n\nMy issue is I\u2019m transferring to another country and continuing my studies there. Would 3 Withdrawals then 3 high grades (hopefully) look better than 3 Cs?",
