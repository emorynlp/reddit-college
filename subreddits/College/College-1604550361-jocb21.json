Other times there are course co-ordinators who are specifying it.\n\nI get that group work can be awful. In grad school we had group work in every class, and the first day of class I'd look around, see who was competent in class, and immediately form a group with them. Not everyone was so lucky. But when I became a professor, I started to understand why there were so many group projects.\n\nYes, interaction between students is important. It's part of what you're going to college for -- making connections with other students and faculty. Group work is just one of many ways to do that. It's also important to learn to work as part of a group -- you'll do a lot of group work throughout your life, and it's not always with people who pull their weight.\n\nGroup projects also allow a professor to assign a larger, more interesting project than otherwise could be assigned. (Yes, that does depend on everyone doing their part.) \n\nAnd, let's be honest, if I'm teaching 90 students this semester, it's a lot easier to grade 30 projects in the week between finals and when grades are due than it is to grade 90. And remember a lot of your teachers are part-time faculty (thanks, university budget cuts!) who are teaching at multiple schools or also hold down a full-time day job to make ends meet, and budgets for TAs to help grade have been slashed too. (thanks again, university budget cuts!)\n\nAll that said, group work can definitely be improved. I usually set a maximum number of groups and I'll take and allow some of those to be single person groups -- that seems to cut down on the friction of \"having to take this person no one else would partner with\". (I've also noted that the single person groups usually have the worst projects. Go figure). I also give each group an option to split up if things aren't working out -- no one has taken me up on it. I'm always on the lookout for other improvements, but these two things seem to solve most of the complaints students have had -- the group work usually gets really positive feedback on my reviews, so something is going right.", "author": "Scary-Boysenberry", "created": 1604610115, "upvotes": 3}, "gb9ib2y": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jocb21/professors_that_are_assigning_group_work_during/gb9ib2y/", "text": "HS here, but for science labs I don\u2019t have enough material for every student to do each lab.
