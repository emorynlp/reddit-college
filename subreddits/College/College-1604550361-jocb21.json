      "text": "Lots of opinions have already been shared, but I wanted to add to the fire.\n\nAnother professor's opinion - most of the work my students will ever do will involve dealing with other humans.  The sooner you learn how to deal with groups, the better.  At the same time, it's not fair for a professor to expect a bunch of 20-year olds to know how to work well with others, so I teach them how to do it.  \n\n* You must set ground rules at the onset of a group project - what's acceptable, what's not.\n* You must practice accountability & responsibility - someone doesn't pull their weight, talk to them.  Engage in respectful conflict.  They continue to do it, turn them in.  I've started to really enjoy giving zeros for that one person who thinks s/he can skate by.\n* Learn how to \"storm\".  Conflict is critical to success.  Companies that focus on change and innovation have figured out how to engage in respectful conflict.\n* Group time management is a special skill set.  I recommend Kanban boards.  They're super easy to learn.  You can't procrastinate the same way in a group project that you do in individual assignments.\n\nI do not assign group projects because it's easier to grade (mine are not); I do not copy/paste from previous semesters (I tend to change assignments every other semester anyways).  And the entire planet had to figure out remote, group work, so saying \"online school shouldn't have group projects\" is bad logic.  No one got that choice this year in the professional world, so use your school years to learn how to do well with lowered stakes.  (Yes I'm biased, but grades are dumb.  But it's still better to fail in school than to fail at your job and be fired).\n\nYes - it's frustrating.  But you should never assume it gets easier just because you graduate.  The same people in your group now will go out into the world and still suck at group works.  There's no magical fix that occurs at graduation.  It doesn't get easier, you just get better at handling it.",

      "text": "Professor here. \n\nSome departments require a certain number of classes to have group work, so your professor may not have any choice. Other times there are course co-ordinators who are specifying it.\n\nI get that group work can be awful. In grad school we had group work in every class, and the first day of class I'd look around, see who was competent in class, and immediately form a group with them. Not everyone was so lucky. But when I became a professor, I started to understand why there were so many group projects.\n\nYes, interaction between students is important. It's part of what you're going to college for -- making connections with other students and faculty. Group work is just one of many ways to do that. It's also important to learn to work as part of a group -- you'll do a lot of group work throughout your life, and it's not always with people who pull their weight.\n\nGroup projects also allow a professor to assign a larger, more interesting project than otherwise could be assigned. (Yes, that does depend on everyone doing their part.) \n\nAnd, let's be honest, if I'm teaching 90 students this semester, it's a lot easier to grade 30 projects in the week between finals and when grades are due than it is to grade 90. And remember a lot of your teachers are part-time faculty (thanks, university budget cuts!) who are teaching at multiple schools or also hold down a full-time day job to make ends meet, and budgets for TAs to help grade have been slashed too. (thanks again, university budget cuts!)\n\nAll that said, group work can definitely be improved. I usually set a maximum number of groups and I'll take and allow some of those to be single person groups -- that seems to cut down on the friction of \"having to take this person no one else would partner with\". (I've also noted that the single person groups usually have the worst projects. Go figure). I also give each group an option to split up if things aren't working out -- no one has taken me up on it. I'm always on the lookout for other improvements, but these two things seem to solve most of the complaints students have had -- the group work usually gets really positive feedback on my reviews, so something is going right.",

When people don't want to work as hard as I do or literally lie and say they'll do work, then bail last minute and leave it to me and my harder working teammates to fix, it's irritating. One person in my group is getting favoritism from the teacher; she says that I and my 3 female teammates are \"intimidating\" him and that we need to \"give him more encouragement\" so he does his work. She has also made some racial assumptions about our group (3 white women and 1 male student of color). Having to deal with all of that on top of the stress of having a teammate who won't do his work is horrible. It has created so much additional stress for me and my peers who are committed to doing well on this project. So, I agree, but these additional challenges and having multiple group projects are making the semester so unpleasant.",

It\u2019s one thing if a job requires people to work remotely, but it\u2019s a completely different situation for a college to require remote work, with a normal curriculum, and added remote group work. It\u2019s just way too much for a student to handle, which is what I think OP is getting at. School is incredibly stressful. A majority of students haven\u2019t had a career so telling them to basically nut up and shut up doesn\u2019t justify the requirements put on the students. It just stresses them out even more which can lead to burnout, depression, anxiety, and a whole list of fucked up problems that make finishing a degree seem like a hike through hell. Yes, it\u2019d be great if the students can just overcome these circumstances and use the experience for when they get to their career but the reality is these are young adults who probably haven\u2019t even learned to be fully independent or take care of themselves properly.
