These are some tips I really haven\u2019t seen mentioned before and although some of these tips may not be applicable to everyone, they sure helped me out. \n\n1. Network as many people as you can to and go out of your way to help people. \n\nI would say I talked to about 50% of the people in my classes (about class size of 40) and got to know about 5 people from each class really well. When I had a question about homework I always had someone to ask and when people asked me a question I tried my best to answer. I would even used my tablet to make a step by step example to help them understand the topic better. When I graduated I got multiple jobs interviews/offers because people knew the type of person I was and recommended me for the job at the company they worked for. \n\n2. Talk to your professors and show them what type of student your are. \n\nPut in the extra effort into studying for your tests and completing your projects. Spend that extra time in creating your presentation and attempting to have the best results for the project possible. Let me tell you professors recognize this and when they need someone to help with their research they may turn to you. I had a couple of professors approach me during my senior year offering me a job working for them along with PAYING FOR MY MASTERS DEGREE. I know this may not be true for some majors but for some it is. \n\n3. Learn to read PDFs on your computer. \n\nI didn\u2019t buy a college text book in 4 of the 5 years I was in college (sophomore year throughout my masters) because I either found PDFs online or was given them by other students (this is where networking and going out of your way to help others comes back around). The last book I bought was a chemistry book and the only reason I bought that was because I had to have the online access code (such a rip off). Some of the books were the previous edition but the information in them was still 95% the same. The only thing that was altered was the example and homework problems. \n\n4. Make a study guide that summarizes all of the important topics with worked out example problems for every course relative to your major. \n\nRight before every test I made a short summary guide of every major topic that would be on that test along with a few worked out examples. Many of my courses called for knowledge from a previous course and I used this study guide to quickly/ easily remember those topics. I also used this guide to study for my job interviews. You will be thankful for this when the person interviewing you makes you solve problems on the white board \n\n5. Find out where your department staff is and always be friendly with them. \n\nOver the first two years I got to know the office staff of my department and every time they had leftover food from meetings they would let me know. I got a free lunch one to three times a week from this. \n\n\nI hope this helps you out some and if you would like me to further explain just let me know!\n\n\nEdit: Many people are asking me through on and commenting about how to network. I was/am an extremely introverted person that enjoys being alone at times. To show how introverted I am here is a story: I didn\u2019t like talking to people so much that in my first semester I would eat my lunch in my truck. Well one day a guy from my calculus class saw me and came to my truck and started talking to me. The day after he found me again and did the same thing. The third day I park in the parking lot across campus so I could eat lunch alone again. Fast forward 5 years and I actually have a great job because of this guy.\n\nSo here is how I did it.  At the start of my sophomore year I started small by sitting in the front row next to people that were actually engaged in the class and I would ask them how their weekend was or how their other classes were going. After I got to know them the first couple of weeks I would ask them if they would like to stay after to work on the homework or study for the test. Then I would invite them to go to lunch or dinner. I found a common interest with some of them and did that with them. This is a long story but in summary one guy and I played ping pong in the rec every Tuesday my junior year.  He became one of my best college friends and we now talk every week even though he is 10 states away. Also when you are in group projects pull you weight and step up. People remember this and will want to work with you again. This is how I began to network. I hope this helps some.", "author": "HellOnReels", "created": 1566577453, "retrieved": 1632947275, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1223, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ey3169c": {"link": "/r/college/comments/cug62h/a_former_students_top_tips_for_college/ey3169c/", "text": "Oh wow this is very helpful!

Even if they are your same age or maybe a year younger or older?\n\nI've actually made a pretty large number of new friends already, some of these friends will be in my classes this week, is that considered networking? I ask because I thought networking was more about meeting people in the industry you want to get into, and connecting with them? How exactly can students help with networking?
