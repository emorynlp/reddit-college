Even if you know intellectually that you\u2019ve entered a new stage of life, the unconscious awareness that you spent 18-ish years home with your family and only 3-ish months at college makes the latter seem surreal and/or like a long vacation.",

      "text": "I remember this. It's such a strange feeling to walk into the home that was once yours and it no longer is. I remember when I had that feeling too. What a strange thing. \n\nThing is, it just keeps getting more intense in ways. I've been out of my parents house for over a decade now and I live 300 miles away in a different state. That's a third of my life that I've been out of the house. \n\nMy home town no longer feels the same. I can't even remember the roads which I'd had memorized for a solid 20 years. Plus, going back always yields new buildings and developments in the city that throw me off more. Over time, I've seen that the town I grew up in is no different than one of those small towns you drive through on road trips. \n\nIt won't ever return. It's a part of growing old I suppose. Give it time and you'll start to notice your parents aging between times you see them. It's not a great feeling really. It's the flow of life. We don't have a choice in it, it always moves. It's difficult to leave that comfort of home behind forever. \n\nI've moved like 8 places in the past 10 years. Home is where your stuff is. At least now, you've learned about moving far away. It opens your doors to explore the country and travel. It's still not easy. The first 6 months after a move are the worst. At about a year, it starts to feel fine again.",

      "text": "Well yeah because you're not a kid anymore. You're an adult that lives independently from your parents even if you're still working on the financial independence thing. You have your own place even if it's just a dorm Room. Your home isn't your parents home anymore it's wherever the heck you live at your college. You have most likely a moderately annoying roommate maybe a pet that you had to make arrangements to be taken care of by either someone who was staying near campus Campus or you had to take it with you.\n\nYou have a life outside of your immediate family in your Hometown. You have friends your parents have never met in most likely never will, If you have a job you have coworkers classmates professors and you're used to handling your own shit at this point. You know where to get your coffee you know what time you have to be at classes you know how much time you can spend on a paper and I and actually reasonably expect to get a decent grade attached to it. You're an adult and you've gotten used to being an adult in whatever capacity you're currently functioning at. So yeah you went home to visit your parents but you don't live there anymore the 1st time you realize that feels a little strange but you get used to it eventually. You're an adult and college was your 1st step into adulthood, It's a weird realization but it's not uncommon.",

Now I\u2019m home for the second time since leaving for college and things feel less weird, though that might be partly because I was expecting it. But I think the longer my stays at home, the more things will go back to the way they were before. Just takes some getting used to.",
