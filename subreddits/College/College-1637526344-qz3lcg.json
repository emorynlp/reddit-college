If you have at least 60-70 in the class right now then yes you can bounce back and maybe get an C\u2019s or B\u2019s, but then there are class that don\u2019t give out homework and only test then you are pretty much screwed. I had one of those class where the grade are the 4 exams so if you flunk once, it kinda guarantee yourself an B( assuming you did well on the rest of the exams, A is possible only if you are getting 100).",
