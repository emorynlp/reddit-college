  "title:": "Why are people so obsessed with getting their grades back?",
  "text": "We all know there are some professors who take longer than others to get exam and paper grades back to their students. This semester I have one Professor in particular who is taking a while to get an exam grade back and literally every single day I\u2019m seeing messages in the class group chat complaining that she still hasn\u2019t posted grades. And every single class people ask when she will post the grades. \n\nI understand that having a grade can help you see where you\u2019re at in a class and where you need improvement, etc. But i feel like it\u2019s easy enough to know whether you\u2019re doing well in a class or not without grades. \n\nWhy are some students so obsessed with knowing their numerical grades?",

      "text": "Depending on the school and timing, you may be able to withdraw from a class before it goes on your transcript. It would be nice to have some grade feedback before that.\n\nAlso, top students can sometimes bomb on a final and still get an A, but they need to know where they stand before the final first. It allows them to concentrate on other class finals and not worry about this class.",

If all they have to deal with is bitching students then they\u2019re getting off easy so deal with the bitching students or maybe grade your shit on time.

This is unacceptable because there are questions similar to the assignment on the exam and because these questions are very difficult, it is important to know how well you did on the assignment before the exam so you can study it.",

It implies that they don't respect their students or they don't take being a professor seriously enough. At my school, failing a class is $3,000-$4,000 you don't get back, and  have to pay again if you're forced to retake the course, not to mention that it can mess with scholarships. Professors who don't acknowledge that by making their grades accessible are usually out of touch with how much it costs to be in their class. \n\nYes professors can have a  lot of work, but if most of the grading is putting a scantron through to grade, then it's doubly frustrating not to know your grade. If it's a lot of short answers or essay questions, then it can take longer. However, I've had professors refuse to post grades on online tests for no reason (even when makeups were done and everything was automatically graded). \n\nPersonally, I have 15 credits, and two jobs so I need my grades back soon to plan. Do  I need to review some basics? Can I move onto the next chapter?  You may not be worried about your grades in that class, but for a myriad of reasons getting your grade back soon is legitimate concern for some students.",

If the button doesn't do anything, you would return to the starting point and never go back to press the button feeling that you did something useless. If you press the button and something happens (in the case of a good grade, something good), it becomes much more likely that you would return to the button several times just to get that reaction again. \n\nNow, in college we mostly depend on grades to continue studying normally, and if you put at least a little effort in a work, or in this case an exam which isn't getting any kind of feedback, the mind feels like it's doing something useless in an action that naturally triggers anxiety (or stress, if it's an important grade), so it kind of revolves thinking and might desperate anyone who's not patient enough to wait for the teacher.",
