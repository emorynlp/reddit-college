      "text": "I was nervous about graduation. Mainly about getting a good job. I currently have a shit job, to the point where I would have jumped out the office window by now if my division didn\u2019t happen to be on the first floor (fml). I am working towards my master\u2019s degree in a different field to hopefully get a higher paying position. Yay to living with my parents for the next couple of years",
