          "text": "This is a great list for starting out. Like VA_Network_Nerd says, it's impossible to really pick out a \"best\" and that goes for anything, let alone something as complex as a university. Ranks are pretty arbitrary after a point and all of these schools are great. You should definitely consider what factors are most important to your degree and use those to try and determine your personal best choice. Do you care most about time to degree? Cost? Availability of out of class resources like tutoring? Obviously all of these things are important, but having an idea of what you value most helps a ton.",

                  "text": "Bachelor's degrees cover largely the same content regardless of if you go to a local state university or an expensive private school. Transferring credits can also be a pain so your time to degree may be longer if you switch schools. If you don't have any glaring problems with your current university I would 100% change majors and stay where you are. You go to a good school and your education will be basically the same, but you'll likely save money and finish more quickly. Best of luck!",
