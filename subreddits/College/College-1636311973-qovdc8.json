  "text": "The other day I met someone who said they had trouble making friends, and we hit it off real cool. They were average student age (19). I told them my age and 5 minutes later, they went totally silent. They came back and told me the \"age gap\" between us made things \"too weird\" and I was concerned. Like a) what do you do with your friends, man? b) I've never really been made to feel creepy in my life, but now I do, and Idk how to deal with it.\n\nAfter a period of homelessness in my early 20s and working hard to get myself financially stable, I came back to college when I was old enough to be considered \"independent\", which is 26. \n\nI was looking forward to coming back and having a \"fresh start\" at making some friends. At community college, I made some, and in my classes at my new school, I am making a few buddies here and there. I never really had issues making friends. I've worked in a lot of different environments, and I've made friends with co-workers or customers decades older than I am. AFAIK, all we're doing is slinging memes back and forth. There isn't any reason for age to make anything weird. \n\nLooking at my school's demographics, less than 4% are nontraditional, most had 4.0s in high school, and I just feel like I've buckled in for a horrible nightmare, and I'm not a good fit here, at all.\n\nI feel kinda absurd asking this, but should I just be hyper-professional and bounce off any attempts to make friends here? I feel real self-conscious, but its not like I could have enrolled in school any sooner. Idk.",

      "text": "Not creepy at all. I used to have that mentality when I was way younger, but once I started college and met people older than me, I realized people in their late 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s really aren\u2019t old at all. Sounds like this 19 year old most likely hasn\u2019t had much experience hanging around people older than them. I\u2019m 22 now and I have a friend who\u2019s 42, and it\u2019s not creepy to me at all. In fact, I think having older friends is super fun. I know people in college who are around your age group and they\u2019re friends with 19-20 year olds. My sister\u2019s 20 year old friend has a 58 year old roommate and they all love hanging out with her.  I think it\u2019s nice to have friends from all age groups. There\u2019s a lot to learn from people with more life experience. Don\u2019t let the opinion of one person discourage you. Everyone\u2019s path in life is different and there\u2019s no shame in starting college at a later age.",

      "text": "It's not bad or weird. You want to socialize with people on campus. That's normal.\n\nIt's possible that the person you talked to had bad prior experiences with \"older\" friends. 28 feels far away when you're 19.\n\nNot all of your yearmates will have that mindset, but many 18-20 year olds are immature, and the age gap means you will have vastly amounts of life experience, priorities, etc. Friendships can happen at any age. But if teens are a bit hesitant, respect their boundary. It's not necessarily an issue with you, it's about them protecting themselves from the very real chance of being manipulated by an older \"friend.\" \n\n(Spend 5 mins on the relationship advice sub. Take a shot every time you see a toxic relationship between folks with a 5+ year age gap who started dating when the younger one was 16-20. Even if you're not looking to date, the people you talk to don't know that.)",

          "text": "I feel like its a weird conversation to have, because I don't necessarily want to attack the guy or call him \"immature\" for having a boundary.\n\nPeople can be manipulated even outside the context of dating, too. So, I do understand.\n\nI'm also really anxious around teens. My teen self was way more harder, louder and meaner and would have probably beat me up. \n\nI just don't know how I fold into the community writ large, being almost 10 years older than everyone else. Like, the harsh attendance and grading policies make me feel like I'm a number here, and after getting mixed messages from students, it doesn't help.\n\nAlso, people in that age range really have their minds wrapped around dating. I'm glad I don't. My days of being endlessly sexually harassed are pretty much over, haha.",

              "text": "Oop, sorry if it sounded like I was implying that having boundaries was a sign of immaturity. That wasn't my intent and I'm sorry if it came across that way!\n\nI was referring more to how someone 10 years younger is less likely to be mature, and thus you may find it hard to connect with many of them. The reverse is also true; a 19 year old may still feel immature/childish, and may assume they will have trouble connecting to someone almost a decade older.\n\nYou're definitely right about people that age having dating and sex on the brain lol. It ain't always about that.\n\nI'm also in college at 29, but all my classes are online so there age range is all over the place. More people are around our age, but I've had classes with people from 18 - 80. It's not as noticeable since the online format makes socializing kind of impossible. Tbh if I were sitting in classes with a bunch of 18-19 year olds, I'd be scared of them too \ud83d\ude02 Sorry I don't have any real advice, but I wish you luck!",

      "text": "The only people who think that age means something are kids. Sounds like that 19 year old is still a kid. Not all 19 year olds are. I wouldn't give up on making friends, but you probably should be mindful that the population of \"traditional college students with 4.0s in high school\" tends to be pretty sheltered, and they tend to have little perspective. To be blunt... they often are \"kids\" in many ways. Community college is different, and tends to attract young people who have been forced by life circumstances to mature faster than students who go straight to 4-year schools. It's just a different crowd, and there's nothing inherently \"wrong\" with either, but it's something worth being mindful about.\n\nPersonally, I think it's good for young people to have older friends, and I think many young people appreciate having older friends. Some might find it \"weird,\" but that's their problem, I guess.",
