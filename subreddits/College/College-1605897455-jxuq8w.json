Let me provide you with a different perspective for your consideration:\n\nBe careful playing games like \"how many assignments can I skip and still pass\" or \"how low a grade can I get on the final and still pass\" or \"how much can I half-ass this final project and still pass\".\n\nWhy?  Because every semester we have students who play these games, and every semester someone who calculates they only need to score a 45 on the final exam to pass the class actually gets a 42 on the final and then fails.  Or the person who half-asses the final project expecting to get a C then gets a D and finds out that a grade of D doesn't count for degree credit in that particular major.  Or something like that.\n\nThen these people send frantic emails or make tearful visits to our offices begging for extra credit and saying that they won't graduate without passing the class and all kinds of similar things.  But they're usually completely out of luck.  If you purposely skipped some assignments or obviously half-assed a final project because you thought your grade was bulletproof, almost no professor is going to have any sympathy for you if and when your plan backfires.\n\nSo, play those games if you want, but play them at your own risk.  Many students get away with playing them, but some few don't.  And for those who don't, it means tears in the short term and extra time and tuition money to retake the class next semester.", "author": "ChemMJW", "created": 1605946370, "upvotes": 5}, "gd0vy84": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jxuq8w/does_anyone_else_calculate_how_much_their_grade/gd0vy84/", "text": "I'm thinking of doing this for a term paper worth 10% I already have a high A in the class and really don't feel like writing 5 pages plus it's due Monday aaaaahhhhhhh", "author": "39_33__138", "created": 1605940761, "upvotes": 1}, "gd0uh68": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jxuq8w/does_anyone_else_calculate_how_much_their_grade/gd0uh68/", "text": "I thought everyone did that lol", "author": "TruthAndConversation", "created": 1605939504, "upvotes": 1}, "gd0u2uo": {"link": "/r/college/comments/jxuq8w/does_anyone_else_calculate_how_much_their_grade/gd0u2uo/", "text": "Hi my name is kevin ..
