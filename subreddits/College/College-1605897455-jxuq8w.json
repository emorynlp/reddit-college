      "text": "Faculty here.  Let me provide you with a different perspective for your consideration:\n\nBe careful playing games like \"how many assignments can I skip and still pass\" or \"how low a grade can I get on the final and still pass\" or \"how much can I half-ass this final project and still pass\".\n\nWhy?  Because every semester we have students who play these games, and every semester someone who calculates they only need to score a 45 on the final exam to pass the class actually gets a 42 on the final and then fails.  Or the person who half-asses the final project expecting to get a C then gets a D and finds out that a grade of D doesn't count for degree credit in that particular major.  Or something like that.\n\nThen these people send frantic emails or make tearful visits to our offices begging for extra credit and saying that they won't graduate without passing the class and all kinds of similar things.  But they're usually completely out of luck.  If you purposely skipped some assignments or obviously half-assed a final project because you thought your grade was bulletproof, almost no professor is going to have any sympathy for you if and when your plan backfires.\n\nSo, play those games if you want, but play them at your own risk.  Many students get away with playing them, but some few don't.  And for those who don't, it means tears in the short term and extra time and tuition money to retake the class next semester.",

Homework problems from the textbooks are only worth 5% of your grade (for all of them combined). So each textbook assignment is individually worth about .5% of your grade.\n\nThe thing is, she assigns us like 20 questions per assignment, and most questions actually have 4 questions underneath them. You're spending 2+ hours on something worth only 10 points. To compare, our quizzes are worth 30 points each, but only take about 30-45 minutes to complete. We also have way more quizzes than we do textbook assignments (about double). So in the end, the textbook problems are really not worth it.\n\nFor other classes, I would never consider not doing an assignment. I want to keep getting As. I would not settle on a B or worse. Any assignment skipped is an assignment that brings me closer to losing that A. But, if I were a senior or graduate, I'd definitely stop caring and would be fine with a C or B, lol.\n\nFunny enough, in my first semester, I ended psychology with something like a 105% because of extra credit. I *should* have skipped some assignments in that class. I was way too concerned/paranoid about my grade xD.",

Definitely had a few shifts where I was crying out of pure stress towards the end. I ended up making an A in the course, though!\n\nI had a friend in the exact same class as me who didn\u2019t realize that you had to do everything step by step, so he tried to skip the first couple quizzes and go straight to the first exam. Let\u2019s just say he did not pass the class, simply because he missed those quizzes and it was too late to submit them.\n\nI guess I understand why it\u2019s structured like that, especially for an asynchronous class, and a short one at that, but it really sucks when you have to spend three times as much work on the same material just to get to the end of the topic",

Was he able to work on later assignments even when the previous ones weren't done yet? Were the quizzes locked after a period of time, or was it just at the end that it was too late to submit them?\n\nI've never heard of asynchronous classes before, but it seems like it just means \"at your own pace\"? I've had a couple of classes like that, but never where you had to complete previous assignments to access new ones. It's usually just \"do x assignment by x day\" and if you don't do it on time, you get penalized for that specific assignment only.",
