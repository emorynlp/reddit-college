  "title:": "Should I take a break from school",
  "text": "Ever since High school I have felt really unmotivated, and I just can't seem to focus on any work since. I really want to finish my Associates in Mechanical Engineering, but I am just struggling in my classes. I have failed pre-calc last year and Calc 1 attempting a summer class to try to get back on track. Currently retaking it and I am still getting D's and C's on my exams. Now it is worse having other classes piled on top. Barely passing Chem and my coding class. I am just frustrated at myself telling my parents I will do better, just to get the same results every time. I do not know if my mental health is contributing to bad grades. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks.",

I felt more motivated finding a group to study with and copying their study hours and also have a mindset (idk if that\u2019s the right word) I think to help.. I thought about failing and having to move back home with my parents and wasting money and it motivated me not to fail..",
