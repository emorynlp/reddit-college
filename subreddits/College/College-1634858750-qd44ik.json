  "text": "Apart from going to classes and studying, I don\u2019t do any other thing. I don\u2019t socialize with anybody. I\u2019m in clubs but don\u2019t attend the meeting. I don\u2019t have a job, nor have I ever volunteered. I\u2019m getting bored of my major, but I feel like I have nothing else to offer. I don\u2019t have any hobbies or friends to spend the weekend with, so I\u2019m just alone in my room, either watching anime or kpop. I want to learn some programming alongside the one I\u2019m doing in my classes, but I don\u2019t have the motivation to start. I feel useless and wasting my time. I\u2019m a junior, by the way.",
