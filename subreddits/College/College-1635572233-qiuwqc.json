  "text": "So you have to take seven hours of science to graduate from my community college I took bio 102 a non-lab class I was planning on taking bio 152 (A&P) a lab science class next semester which I will need for my 4 year degree when I transfer. My advisor knew this when we made my schedule last semester, but I come in to enroll for spring a few days ago and I\u2019m told that I will need to take another lab science class on top of a&p. I was told this was because you can\u2019t take two classes with the same prefix to fulfill the graduation requirement. This wasn\u2019t a new rule she just didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care to tell me when I enrolled. The requirement isn\u2019t anywhere on the degree checklist it just says a non-lab and a lab class for a total of seven hours. A&P meets 4 days a week and every one says one of the hardest you can take and the other class is a night class that 2hrs long 2 days a week. Next semester is supposed to be my last so putting it off isn\u2019t really an option, but the course load is looking crazy. I want to maintain a high gpa to get as scholarship opportunities as possible.\n\nIs there anything I can do to fight this or am I sol (go to school in Missouri if that means anything)?",

      "text": "Well, you could try to fight it. It doesn\u2019t hurt to try. But at both colleges I\u2019ve attended, it\u2019s considered your responsibility to know what your requirements are and what courses you need to take. You cannot rely on advisors to remember to tell you every little thing. They work with a bunch of students who have different requirements. It\u2019s easy for them to miss some things. When you transfer to a 4-year university, definitely be more on top of knowing all your requirements and what courses count towards your requirements.",

          "text": "I get they have a lot of students, but every student has this same requirement since it\u2019s a gen Ed class. Also that information wasn\u2019t made available if you look on course catalog or your degree checklist there\u2019s nothing about it, so realistically where could have I found this info? I\u2019ve taking multiple classes with same prefix with no problem but for some reason science classes are the exception. It\u2019s not like came into her office and said what classes do I need, I came prepared and she just told what works and what won\u2019t, and I did my due diligence and talked to multiple counselors/advisors and non of them said a word about it. So unless there\u2019s a better way to get it right I think I did everything I could not to get fucked but here I am.",
