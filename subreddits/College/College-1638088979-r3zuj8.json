  "title:": "Should I go back to campus after Thanksgiving break?",
  "text": "I go to school across the country but have been in my hometown because of Thanksgiving. Honestly, I\u2019m really comfortable right now and am debating on going back. I\u2019m a senior who has been stressed out this semester and am really enjoying the break and better weather in my hometown. One of my parents has been having health issues and the other is lonely being an empty nester. Most of my work can be done remotely. I\u2019m in a decent situation as of now and have saved up enough money to the point where I don\u2019t really need to work for a few months. Honestly, I think my mental health will improve from spending some time back home. \n\nHere\u2019s the only thing, I have an on campus job and I want to get rehired. I don\u2019t want to rub my bosses the wrong way by dipping during the last 2-3 weeks of class. This is the only thing keeping me fro just staying home. \n\nWhat should I do?",

      "text": "This would sort of depend on your relationship with your boss, but telling them straight up that you want to stay might be the way. Tell them your parents are struggling and it would be beneficial for them if you were to stay. I don\u2019t know many people who would say no to that.",
