I'm a college student age 20, I would say I'm relatively attractive. Not the worst, not the best. \nAnyways, I went to a frat party last weekend on Friday night in hopes of meeting some people and having a good time. I know some of the members so they let me in. \n\nAs soon as I walked downstairs (where the party was really going on) this one girl caught my eye. I could tell I caught her eye too becsuse we kept glancing over at each other every minute. It was one of those energy things where you can just sense something happening. \n\nI danced with some of the people I knew, talked with some friends and kept my distance for maybe 15 mins. Eventually this dance circle started going crazy when the cupid shuffle came on (lol) and I ended up right beside her. As soon as the circle calmed down I started talking with her. Introduced myself, asked the basic questions (what's your major, where are you from etc.) Well it turns out we have a lot in common. After talking for a while we went upstairs to get another drink....\n\nAt this point we were definitely getting pretty flirty with each other so we headed back downstairs. Some classic party songs came on and we started dancing with each other in a pretty explicit fashion. \nAfter a few songs her tongue was down my throat and mine was as well. (She was also a really good kisser). This was in front of maybe 40 people but we both didn't care, we were having a really good time. \n\nAfter an hour of dancing and more making out, the party was over. It was 2am and I had to go. I wanted to take her home with me obviously but being decently responsible I had a ride plus work the next day at 8 so I needed to get some sleep. She told me many times to snapchat her the next day and keep talking with her. I completely agreed, I thought we really had a good connection. \n\nSo the next day rolls around and it's maybe noon or 1pm. She follows me on Instagram and we talk a little bit over snapchat. It was casual. Then on Sunday I sent her a paragraph telling her I really enjoyed seeing her and if she wanted to grab food or study sometime. She said she would be totally interested in that which felt like a total win. \n\nNow this is where I'm having trouble. I asked her to go get pizza with me 3 days ago. No response. She ghosted me on all forms of communication and I don't have any classes with her so I don't see her at all. \n\nI haven't reached out again in those 3 days but she's been very active on social media etc. I want to say something but I also don't wanna seem like a creep or desperate. \n\nTruth is, I do wanna see where things go and I wanna actually get to know her in a better setting other than a frat basement. I've been really struggling with this situation because my last long term relationship ended 8 months ago and I was super invested in it. But for some reason, the pain and emotion I feel about this girl I've only seen once hurts way more than when my ex and I broke up. \n\nThis is my first post ever on reddit so I'm definitely struggling with this haha.
