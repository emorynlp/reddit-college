  "text": "Hi all! I have a really convoluted personal history with college so I'll try to sum it up. \n\n-Attended a local university (Northern Kentucky University) for three years, completed most of if not all of my general studies, but couldn't decide on a major and left because of severe depression and anxiety(no debt--I was on a full tuition scholarship)\n\n-Attended a local community college for ~2 years but couldn't decide on a path and left again due to depression /some life changes that have since been worked out ($14k in debt to Sallie Mae, I'm paying right now)\n\n-I now work at Target who has recently begun offering some online degrees for free via Guild (I'm not a team leader or anything just a \"part time\" team member working full time hours, barely making enough to cover monthly expenses)\n\nI desperately want to finish my undergrad. I was so excited when Target announced their Guild program, but most of the schools scream online only. But it'd be free! The programs I'm interested in if I did that would be Business Information Technology or anything like that, I wouldn't mind doing a longer program because it'd be at no cost to me. \n\nHowever, I spoke to my step mom and some friends about this and they all think I should just return to NKU on one of their online programs because that is more likely to land me a job around here (Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area --lots of bigger companies here). However, this would add to my debt . The only plus to this is that my student loans would be defaulted and that would really help because I really don't make a ton at Target, so it wouldn't hurt me right away. \n\nMy step mom is saying to just finish whichever degree would be quickest, which would be a Psychology/Sociology/or Criminal Justice degree. I really don't have a path I'm passionate about, so I can see how this could help me get my foot in the door to various jobs if I use my connections to network. \n\nOn the other hand, my friends are pushing me to major in Business Informatics, which would take longer but probably result in a better paying career trajectory from the get go. \n\nJust curious if anyone has any thoughts on what they'd do? I'm 26 so I'm running out of time lol (I know it's not old but I'm so far from where I'd like to be at this point in my life)",
