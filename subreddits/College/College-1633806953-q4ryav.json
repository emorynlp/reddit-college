  "text": "I\u2019m currently thinking about switching my major to studio art with a concentration on digital art/graphic design. Is art that bad of a major? I feel like I\u2019m asking the wrong people (aka my friends who are stem majors and my parents who have no experience in this field). I just wanna know from an art major\u2019s perspective, do you think pursuing art as a career is fulfilling? I\u2019m pretty sure you all have the passion for it, so do I. But looking at the future, is it hard to get a job like everyone says it is or is it actually not that bad?",

If you\u2019re already not extremely dedicated with a SOLID skillset in an area of the arts then it\u2019s a bad decision. I\u2019m an art student and I\u2019ve seen dozens of kids with no talent put in the bare minimum work and think they\u2019re going to be good enough to be exhibited. They won\u2019t. Ever, based on the quality of work being produced. \n\nDon\u2019t do it unless you have pre-established artistic skill. And I\u2019m not talking about drawings of anime girls with hands behind their backs",

      "text": "Don't listen to all that crap people say about being a \"starving artist\" that's been drilled into your head, that's the first step. There's only a half truth to it, but then again that can happen in stem too. I've been in the arts my whole life and I can tell you that connections are your path to getting an internship/job. I went from fine arts to animation and I can tell you that I don't regret it for a second. My advice would be to talk to your art professors about possible career paths and advice in building your portfolio. The arts force you to put your feet to the fire, where if you want it bad enough, you'll get it. You won't be handed anything on a silver platter on LinkedIn and that's what people mean when they say it's \"too hard\" to make it\n\nAlso, think about how many artists are forced by their parents to go into stem under these beliefs, making them super unhappy. Stem can be a \"bad\" major too if you don't care about it.",

I\u2019m currently doing stem but honestly if I have to stress and work hard for something, I would rather do it in the art field. Ik its a given at this point that I should just change but it was nice to read your perspective on being an art student.  \n  Do employers care about your major or do they specifically look at your portfolio? Or do they consider both?",

I would so take advantage of those connections and, while they more than likely won't offer a job to you, they can point you in the right direction and make the journey less daunting. Don't worry too much about skill level when majoring because most intro classes are tailored to beginners. If you want to sharpen your skills a bit more, I'd suggest life drawing classes. These are often available in school, but there are smaller private studios that you pay per session to draw for a few hours. \n\nI can totally feel your dedication and I would say that employers only care about your portfolio when hiring, but a degree will give you an edge over others. We do have guest speakers that come and talk to us about recruiting and tips, but it depends on the professor \n\nAnd finally, what's the worst that can happen if it isn't a good fit? You can always start over",

      "text": "So here's my perspective as a (graduated) art major. Let's say your goal is to be a digital illustrator or designer/concept artist. You need some serious skills, and your main concern before anything else is getting those skills. It's a competitive field and the degree means nothing. Portfolio is everything.\n\nIf you already have the aptitude for it and are serious about it, why do you need the school? There are so many resources for learning very inexpensively online, from pros in that field. Unless the professor is brilliant at digital painting (very unusual), it would be useless to you. You may even be more skilled than the person teaching you if youve been doing it for a while. \n\nOn the other hand let's say you are either just starting out, or don't have much aptitude for it. Then again, not really the major for you because why are you going into a field that you don't have much skill in? Youd need to be working on just fundamental drawing stuff and the kinds of design assignments they would give you wouldn't do much good. And again, the teacher's skill is important. Are they going to do demonstrations? Are they going to give proper critique? Maybe, but find out first. \n\nSo yeah, i don't know you or your situation or your goals, or your school. I'm just saying, most people majoring in art, especially digital! have so many better paths open to them and don't even realize it. Learn everything you can about the professor and the program's curriculum to see if its something that is going to suit you before just deciding. Personally I think there are so many great resources out there, that it makes more sense to exhaust them first before anything. \n\nFor example, check out Schoolism, or Watts Online for drawing. Idk what style of art you are looking for I'm just throwing them out there.",
