  "text": "So my question is should I tell my professor i\u2019m gonna leave a little bit early or should I just walk out. I\u2019m in a very small class and I don\u2019t wanna make it seem like i\u2019m just walking out early but at the same time I know the professors don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m just a dumbass freshman so any advice is appreciated. lol",

      "text": "Hi-hi, my advice is to let the professor know that you will need to leave class a bit early because of a meeting. Make sure you let the professor know why it is that you have to leave early this way they don\u2019t think that you\u2019re just trying to get out of class before everyone else. Even though the professors seem like they don\u2019t really care, it is best to just do the common courtesy of letting them know ahead of time.\nBest of luck.",

      "text": "I recommend letting the professor know at least one day prior to the class start time. If you tell the prof at the start of class, I think it's difficult to find them, or they're just too busy to have a talk with. I'd email them and state the reason, then it should be ok. You can also drop in during their office hour and tell them about this.",

      "text": "Tell the prof at the start of class. \n\nAlso, are you sure that leaving class early is a better choice than showing up to the meeting late? For example, if you\u2019re struggling in the class, you might be better off staying and arriving late to the meeting. But if the meeting is like a doctor\u2019s appointment for something you\u2019ve been waiting months for, then yeah that\u2019s more important.",
