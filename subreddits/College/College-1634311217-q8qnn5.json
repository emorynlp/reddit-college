  "title:": "Applying to colleges with support for learning disabilities",
  "text": "After meeting with the high school college advisor I have been told that there are supports for students with disabilities that some colleges have that can be additionally paid for. This is beyond the disability office who will register the IEP, administer exams, interface with teachers and make certain accommodations are in place.  I was not aware that this is the case.\n\nI am looking for a comprehensive resource that discusses the programs of such colleges that offer an additional layer to the Disability Department.  Are there books ? Is there a website? I would like to independently be able to evaluate such programs. \n\nThank you",
