  "text": "Hey so I\u2019m in this 2nd year tech class, and we need to make a music video with a certain number of cuts and other videographer techniques. We get to choose the song and do whatever we want, as long as we meet the criteria.\n\nI think I\u2019m capable of making something that I think is really cool, with costume design and a story to the music video. I have basically the whole thing planned out in my head and it\u2019s not due for 3 weeks. \n\nI just\u2026 also don\u2019t want to embarrass myself. We need to show the video to the whole class. I plan to include myself in many shots as I play both characters in my music video. I\u2019m also choosing a rather alternative song, Shameless Shadow by The Garden and it\u2019s definitely got a different sound than what most people will probably pick.\n\nIf I\u2019m just confident in my delivery and work hard on the project do I have anything to worry about?",
