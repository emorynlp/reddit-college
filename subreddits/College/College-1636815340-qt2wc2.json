  "text": "So I\u2019m attending community college and I\u2019m failing most if not all of my classes. It\u2019s 90 percent because I haven\u2019t done any of the homework and just can\u2019t motivate myself to make a turn around with all the work that\u2019s piled up. I know I\u2019m going to fail at least 3 of my 4 classes. So how likely is it that I\u2019m going to be kicked out this semester?",

If he passed they\u2019ll remove the probation and you go back to normal. Thank god is CC lol I think in private or 4 years they\u2019ll just kick you out.",
