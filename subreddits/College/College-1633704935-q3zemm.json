      "text": "I transferred 2 years ago, and the workload is 1000% way heavier. At community college I was an English major and took more writing-based classes like journalism, creative writing, etc. with some literature-based classes mixed in too. \n\nAt my 4-year college I'm an English Secondary Education major and, the amount of reading I have is actually insane. I struggle a lot. For one class I might have to read about 100 pages for one class period...I'm taking 5 English classes this semester. It's rough! \n\nAs for employment, I would recommend getting a chill on campus job if you can. Reach out to your library, for example. I worked for my school's college of liberal arts one semester as a kind of front desk position on one of the floors and I could get so much homework done during it. Wishing you luck!",
