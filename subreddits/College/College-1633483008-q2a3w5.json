  "text": "Can someone explain what it entails because it seems like I'll have to do it in psychology. \n\nIf you have done a psychological thesis for your Master's and Honour's (if you need to do it for both), I'm looking into Consulting Psychology, then your explanation is much needed).\n\nI get very anxious about working on something I'm not really sure what it's about beforehand so this explanation will help me at least have an idea as to what I should be preparing for mentally and see if I'm cut out for it, because I suffer from sunk cost fallacy a lot. Thanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019m currently working on my PhD thesis, and I did an undergrad thesis (Bachelor\u2019s degree) for honors, all in physics/astronomy. For both of these, I had to do some amount of original research in my field, write about the state of knowledge before my work, write about what I did in my experiment (or tried to do), what my results were (if any), and what open questions remained. If you\u2019ve written 10-page term papers before, for the undergrad honors thesis it was like pages 1-10 were the term paper, and then another 40 pages about my original research, for 50 pages total. For my PhD thesis, I am expecting to have more than 150 pages by the end.",
