  "text": "So far I'm at a B- and I would need an 85 on this exam to bring it up to a B. I finished watching all the lectures but the practice problems seem impossible to me. I am not sure what to do as I am just panicking looking at these problems. This exam is also somewhat cumulative so I have to relearn all the reactions from last unit.",

      "text": "Best way to get ochem down is to learn and practice the more complicated and difficult problems. That usually can mean finding a different book from your own. If you can at least comprehend most of the complicated reactions your test should be a breeze. Don't bother practicing the easier problems they won't do much for you. Also, ochem is cumulative in the sense that if you don't understand the basic reactions you won't get the more complicated ones. It's not like a bunch of random concepts that don't relate the way gen chem can be. Overall, It's kind of like physics in terms of the problem solving. Don't let a problem get to you and make sure to break it down so you can understand it's components. I think 3 days is enough if you put in the time.",
