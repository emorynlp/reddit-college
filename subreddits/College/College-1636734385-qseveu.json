  "text": "Okay so basically, I want to go into nursing, but I\u2019m failing one class first period because I can never get in on time, and i have mostly B\u2019s but that one grade brings my gpa down to like a 76, and my guidance counselor said I should go to community college for two years to get my gpa higher, and transfer.  But for some reason I just feel like shit about it because community college gets such a bad reputation and it makes me feel like a failure.  I feel like I won\u2019t even be good enough to transfer.",

      "text": "This is exactly what I\u2019m doing and it\u2019s the best option there is without a Full-Ride or just in general good scholarships. It\u2019s also less stressful i\u2019m taking 4 classes to go into nursing right now and it\u2019s breezy. Please don\u2019t put yourself in debt for an experience that isn\u2019t necessary \ud83e\udd0d. You\u2019ll be able to transfer as long as your grades are above Cs I believe. The nursing program is competitive from what I have been told so try to find yourself some new study methods in the mean time! I took this breeze semester to find methods of studying that worked for me so next year can fly by. We will be nurses. GOOD LUCK \u2661.",

              "text": "**Please be consistent with your academic advisors if you do decide to go to comm college.** They will help you with everything. Look at your uni requirements list for transfer. Read the whole thing top to bottom and once you tell those advisors you would like to transfer in 2 years they will help you pick the classes your desired school requires for a nursing transfer! I wish you best of luck and I'm so glad I could help. I felt the same way you did, but I'm managing, and you will too! Happy Friday",
