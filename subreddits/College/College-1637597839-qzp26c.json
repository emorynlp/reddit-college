  "text": "I'm planning on going back to school and I will be returning as a mature student. Ever since elementary school I've never really enjoyed math and has always been an area I've struggled in. I've done a bit of my own research on Ontario Colleges but I keep coming across various courses asking for math or a math assessment for mature students such as myself, I'm just looking for a career path outside of the subject I struggle with. \nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThank you for your time.",
