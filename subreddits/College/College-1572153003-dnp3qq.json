I sit in the front row, so he will randomly walk over and stare down at me, or just stare at my desk. It is for an uncomfortably long time, and I don't even know how to react. Two other students in my class even commented on it to me, so they've noticed it too (although they find it funny).  I am the only student he calls on (when I don't have my hand raised) and he seems to take joy in humiliating me when I don't know the answer (in a lighthearted way, but it's still embarrassing)\n\nHe has stopped me after class & asked me to come to office hours three times, even though I have a 93 in the class at the moment. I went one time, and he asked me questions about my family and life..as if it was some social hour. He also compliments my work and writing all the time, even though I'm not the greatest student. He used my last assignment as an example of \"excellent work\", even though I wrote it right before class lol\n\nHe sent me an email saying that his disabled mother has the same name as me (Gabriela) and he used to call her \"Ella\" when he was younger. He said he told her about what a \"great student\" I am, and that she said they should \"have me over for dinner\". I just ignored the email LOL. Since then he always refers to me as \"Ella\", even though I never use that nickname. Anyway, I just find him weird. I showed the email to my roommate and she just finds the whole situation hilarious. He hasn't really \"done\" anything, but he makes me feel on edge. I especially hate when he looks down at my desk, it is so awkward and I never know what he's looking at.

BUT my field is social work. I see a lot of tough things, and being new to the field can make it especially hard to handle. So I do appreciate these professors making an effort to get to know me, connect and make sure I\u2019m alright. But, if a writing or math teacher called me in for that, I\u2019d find it a strange. \n\n\nThis started out really normal so I can see why you\u2019re feeling kind of confused. But, it\u2019s not exactly what someone does that makes it inappropriate - it\u2019s how they do it.\n\n\nI always sit in the front and participate a lot. So when no one raises their hand, I feel like professors generally almost always me... but it *never* felt like an effort to humiliate me. It feels like they want someone to take a guess and they know I\u2019m comfortable guessing. \n\n\nI\u2019ve also had professors do the whole stare-down thing and have found it funny. But, I\u2019m really outgoing and it\u2019s more of a banter because I joke back. If a professor wants to joke around like that, it should be with a student who\u2019s 100% comfortable with it *(professors I\u2019ve been close with have always made sure of that)*\n\n\nThere\u2019s some faculty at my school who are really big in their field, and I have had lunch / coffee with them before. But no one has ever invited me over to their place. That\u2019s kind of sketchy- if he just wanted to talk, why can\u2019t it be done at a restaurant or cafe? An invitation to the home seems a little too personal. \n\nI get the sense that you\u2019re nervous to report this because none of the behaviors are glaring red flags, because they\u2019re things that could be appropriate with certain students who\u2019ve made it known that they\u2019re okay with it. They\u2019re not like full blown illegal actions.... but they\u2019re repeated boundary crossings. And they\u2019re not okay. you never explicitly asked for or consented to this extra attention, and he never asked if it was okay with you. So that makes it unacceptable \n\nYou really should be keeping track of everything and documenting it. I also believe you should speak to someone (even if it\u2019s just a counselor at your school).

The fact that he holds a position of power just gives him leverage to avoid facing the repercussions of his behavior.\n\nI cannot speak for all women, but in my experience, we do have a tendency to write off creepy behavior from men as a simple case of them being socially inept and awkward. I've been there, people always say that the guy is just being friendly, or they say the situation is funny.
