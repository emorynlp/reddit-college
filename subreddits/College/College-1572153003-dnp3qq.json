  "title:": "Have you ever had a Professor make you uncomfortable?",
  "text": "I have this professor who is creepy and I always get really weird vibes from him. I sit in the front row, so he will randomly walk over and stare down at me, or just stare at my desk. It is for an uncomfortably long time, and I don't even know how to react. Two other students in my class even commented on it to me, so they've noticed it too (although they find it funny).  I am the only student he calls on (when I don't have my hand raised) and he seems to take joy in humiliating me when I don't know the answer (in a lighthearted way, but it's still embarrassing)\n\nHe has stopped me after class & asked me to come to office hours three times, even though I have a 93 in the class at the moment. I went one time, and he asked me questions about my family and life..as if it was some social hour. He also compliments my work and writing all the time, even though I'm not the greatest student. He used my last assignment as an example of \"excellent work\", even though I wrote it right before class lol\n\nHe sent me an email saying that his disabled mother has the same name as me (Gabriela) and he used to call her \"Ella\" when he was younger. He said he told her about what a \"great student\" I am, and that she said they should \"have me over for dinner\". I just ignored the email LOL. Since then he always refers to me as \"Ella\", even though I never use that nickname. Anyway, I just find him weird. I showed the email to my roommate and she just finds the whole situation hilarious. He hasn't really \"done\" anything, but he makes me feel on edge. I especially hate when he looks down at my desk, it is so awkward and I never know what he's looking at. He literally does it to no one else in my row",

      "text": "\nNot sure what your field is, but I\u2019ve had professors call me into the office and ask questions about my life (despite always having high As). BUT my field is social work. I see a lot of tough things, and being new to the field can make it especially hard to handle. So I do appreciate these professors making an effort to get to know me, connect and make sure I\u2019m alright. But, if a writing or math teacher called me in for that, I\u2019d find it a strange. \n\n\nThis started out really normal so I can see why you\u2019re feeling kind of confused. But, it\u2019s not exactly what someone does that makes it inappropriate - it\u2019s how they do it.\n\n\nI always sit in the front and participate a lot. So when no one raises their hand, I feel like professors generally almost always me... but it *never* felt like an effort to humiliate me. It feels like they want someone to take a guess and they know I\u2019m comfortable guessing. \n\n\nI\u2019ve also had professors do the whole stare-down thing and have found it funny. But, I\u2019m really outgoing and it\u2019s more of a banter because I joke back. If a professor wants to joke around like that, it should be with a student who\u2019s 100% comfortable with it *(professors I\u2019ve been close with have always made sure of that)*\n\n\nThere\u2019s some faculty at my school who are really big in their field, and I have had lunch / coffee with them before. But no one has ever invited me over to their place. That\u2019s kind of sketchy- if he just wanted to talk, why can\u2019t it be done at a restaurant or cafe? An invitation to the home seems a little too personal. \n\nI get the sense that you\u2019re nervous to report this because none of the behaviors are glaring red flags, because they\u2019re things that could be appropriate with certain students who\u2019ve made it known that they\u2019re okay with it. They\u2019re not like full blown illegal actions.... but they\u2019re repeated boundary crossings. And they\u2019re not okay. you never explicitly asked for or consented to this extra attention, and he never asked if it was okay with you. So that makes it unacceptable \n\nYou really should be keeping track of everything and documenting it. I also believe you should speak to someone (even if it\u2019s just a counselor at your school). That way you can get some back up, support and have evidence lined up for you in case you need to use it",

      "text": "Your instincts about him are definitely not wrong. I promise you that he is making a deliberate effort to make you feel uncomfortable, and I bet if you confronted him about it, he would claim he was just trying to be friendly. The fact that he holds a position of power just gives him leverage to avoid facing the repercussions of his behavior.\n\nI cannot speak for all women, but in my experience, we do have a tendency to write off creepy behavior from men as a simple case of them being socially inept and awkward. I've been there, people always say that the guy is just being friendly, or they say the situation is funny. What you are describing though is not cute, it isn't funny, it is just wildly inappropriate and bordering on disturbing. If I were you, I would not even talk to him about how he is making you feel weird, I bet he knows that already. I would go straight to somebody higher up and tell them what is happening, and I would show them the email. Hopefully they will have enough integrity to take it seriously. I can tell you right now though that if there was evidence of a teacher acting this way at my school, their ass would be grass.\n\nI don't want to freak you out, but if I were you, I would avoid speaking to him outside of class for any reason as long as you can help it, and I would even bring a friend with me to office hours if he simply insisted you come in.",

I thought he was walking to the cafe or a nearby restaurant and I could talk on the way and then leave. I was totally naive and trusting; he was an adult professor, so CLEARLY trustworthy! He says he wants to go to this place off campus and I HAVE NO IDEA WHY but I got in the car with him. It was like by then I felt like I was in too deep and to say no would have said that I was a child or something, IDK.Like I said, I trusted him. Now we are at a TRUCK STOP, he is eating, he answered my questions in a minute and I am thinking omg this is SO awkward. I just finally pretty much shut down the convo, I think he could tell it was a weird vibe, so we left . The MINUTE the car was close to campus, I was like THIS IS GOOD, I WILL JUST GET OUT HERE! After a moment of confusion with the door lock (!!!!) I was free. Learned a lesson that day, I'll tell ya! He wasn't even like a young cool prof, he was older and creepy and cringy. I heard some other creepy things about him through the years.",

I felt immediately uncomfortable with this guy before I even met him (he taught an online class and we had interacted via email before our meeting); I ignored my instincts and wound up reliving some of my own sexual abuse trauma. He talked to me about rape, about how men from his country flirt with women--it was horrible and I felt so scared. I reported him o Title IX and the school ended up letting him go. \n\nYou need to go to Title IX. Keep all records of emails he has sent you because Title IX will want to review them for their investigation. If you ever go to office hours again, record the entire interaction on your phone--this is the most concrete evidence you can give Title IX to prove he is behaving unethically. You could also discreetly record him in class and show it to Title IX. Any evidence you having proving he is behaving inappropriately is good. Just make sure you look up recording laws in your state and make sure one-party consent is in place; otherwise, you could get in trouble. \n\nPlease do not ignore this. He is using his position of authority to harass you. I am friends with multiple professors and they won't even add me on Facebook until I've graduated, let alone invite me to dinner with their mother. His behavior is wildly inappropriate. Report him.",

Your professor may really just like you cause you remind him of his mom. \nVery creepy, but you can be firm to him and tell him that he needs to back off and tell him that his actions are making you uncomfortable. \nIf he apologizes and backs off, he is just a weird guy but he will respect you going forward. If he gets offended and says you're making it up or humiliates you, then go to the dean. You'll have evidence that he knows you were uncomfortable and you ask him to stop, at which point he took it personal, and he's at fault. \nBelieve me, he'll back up.",

If that happens, that is illegal, and you need to keep evidence of that. I would avoid telling him though, at least until the end of the semester. \n\nYou could also tell a female professor, counselor, or advisor how you are feeling, and they can help you navigate how to handle the situation. I say female because they may understand where you are coming from. \n\n\nMy campus has a website to anonymously report stuff like this and they take it very seriously. I hope you have something similar. \n\nInviting a student over to dinner is inappropriate and that could count as \u201cdoing something\u201d.  Asking you to come to office hours for no reason and then asking you very personal questions should also count as harassment IMO.",

He sounds very creepy but at the same time reporting him could do damage to your grade and if you have to take him for any classes in the future that can also be an issue.\n\n Inviting a student over for dinner definitely crosses a line for professional conduct. Keep a copy of that email, and if his behavior escalates you may need to use it to report him to the Dean.\n I've been in similar situations with professors and bosses, and what always worked for me is just not encouraging them by not responding and not being super friendly or anything. So keeping responses vague and noncommittal, and if at all possible defering to someone else when he calls on you. I'm not trying to lay blame on you at all!  I'm just saying don't interact with him past the required bare minimum, don't give him anything to encourage whatever he thinks is going on. \n\n If after you start drawing back he tries to retaliate  by damaging your grade that's when you would need to go talk to the Dean and show them that email.  If he just makes you so uncomfortable that you can't bear it then you should probably report him now. That's your call to make.",
