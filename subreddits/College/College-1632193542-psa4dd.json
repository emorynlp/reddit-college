There is the off chance that you could just show up and the person at the front is being nice and will let you in if your honest, but I wouldn't count on it, and if you are doing this strategy, NEVER go with any other guys, letting in 1 guy is fine, but letting in a group of 5 guys all who nobody in the frat knows isn't going to happen.", "author": "2001MThrowaway", "created": 1632582673, "upvotes": 1}, "hdol0rn": {"link": "/r/college/comments/psa4dd/soooo_how_am_i_supposed_to_go_to_parties_when_im/hdol0rn/", "text": "Brigade and say you know someone or walk in there", "author": "FCHusky", "created": 1632199050, "upvotes": 1}}}
