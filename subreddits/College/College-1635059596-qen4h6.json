  "text": "What this amounts to is positive toxicity. You are pretending a situation isn't bad when you don't even know the desires of the person. Speaking from personal experience, I badly want friendships and being able to party and have fun. That is what I want. \n\nI tried everything from joining clubs, being nice to people, striking up conversations, smiling, being positive, being myself, going to therapy, and so on, but nothing worked. I followed everything to the textbook in terms of social interactions and making friendships, but I don't see the results from my hard work. \n\nThis is getting personal, but when you have no friends and people know you are lonely, people do treat you differently. Whenever I make eye contact with anyone, they immediately turn their head away. When I walk away, they make comments behind my back about me being disgusting or whatever. This is just one person who says it. At this point, it is hundreds, so something is going on. Yet, I been to therapy and they couldn't figure anything out so I am just left clueless.\n\nI just want what is supposed to be an easily achievable dream to come true. But unfortunately, it is still just a dream. People who just repeat the same cliche over and over again about how it gets  better are just virtue signaling. I have been told the same cliches in high school, yet look at me 4 years later. It has not gotten better.",

It\u2019s not always easy to pick up in normal therapy because therapy is not at all like other social situations, that\u2019s why a lot of autism assessments involve watching you in the real world or in other set-ups (eg a playgroup, for young kids).\n\nI went through a phase where I tried to follow social rules to a tee. But it didn\u2019t work *at all* because that\u2019s not how social rules work. I read that you should ask people questions to keep them interested and talking, but when I implemented that, the end result was me interrogating them at length. I had no way to know I was doing it wrong. You may think you\u2019re following the rules, when in reality you\u2019re just being weird and creeping people out.",

      "text": "~~Maybe a wild approach but have you tried asking one of the head-turners and shit talkers what makes them not wanting to be friends? Or show this post. Not that it will likely change things with them but maybe with the next group? If they\u2019re just hurtful assholes it might be a risky move. (Probably not my best idea)~~\nThe second thing is maybe ask yourself which kind of people you genuinely like. Not aspire to be, look up to or think you should be friends with. Just people you have felt at ease with in your life. Where were they, were could others like them be? Is there a hobby or interest group that could connect you? Talk to these people about simple things. Have they taken a certain class, how did they approach a question on an exam etc. don\u2019t put the pressure of being friends immediately on them, you don\u2019t even know if you\u2019ll like them yet.\nAnd as annoying as it might sound: figure out what works for you. I met a friend of mine through the internet because we\u2019re both IT nerds and I was looking for a mentor. He is a total loner and not the person people would normally try to be friends with. But we somehow clicked over internet related stuff and me asking for help with a project. He is in his 40ies now and makes maybe one friend per year, mostly over the internet which makes for a big circle of friends at his age. He is happy and wealthy. \nYou might not be a people\u2019s Person but you can certainly find your people with try and erroring what works for you personally. What won\u2019t work is trying to become someone from an internet article that everyone likes who isn\u2019t you. I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t been born a natural people magnet, I appreciate it makes your life harder. It does not mean you can\u2019t find happiness.",

I know it sounds bad but hear me out. \n\nGo the extra mile on someone\u2019s birthday. Be extra helpful at work or on projects or whatever offer to pay for meals. Just anytime you can find an appropriate reason to give a gift do it. Then people  kinda feel in your debt, or that they owe something to you. And are less likely to turn you down when you ask to hang out or do something, sometimes they\u2019ll even invite you themselves. And once you\u2019ve got them to hang out with you they get to know you and actually become your friend. Works everywhere. Especially at work when people feel like they can count on you, or when your constantly bringing treats in. You become very popular fast that way.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add what I do at work as well as bringing in treats. I always have quarters on me. And every time a new person initiates some kind of pleasant convo I\u2019ll drop a quarter in their hand. When they ask why I just say \u201ca gift\u201d and shrug it off. It confuses them at first but becomes a fun surprise and a funny quirk. Basically I Pavlov them into talking to me \ud83d\ude02",
