  "text": "I don\u2019t know what it is about textbooks. It\u2019s not reading in general\u2014I can be fine reading a ~10 page paper that\u2019s assigned reading. But reading a chapter from my history textbook? My brain absolutely refuses. I will waste time looking for the perfect playlist or even stare blankly at my laptop for a good while before I actually bring myself to read a chapter. \n\nI\u2019m trying breaking it down, tell myself to just read half the chapter, then go back and take notes. Then I will read the chapter, but it\u2019s more like skimming and I\u2019ll barely register any of it. I just want to give up at this point\u2026 any advice?",
