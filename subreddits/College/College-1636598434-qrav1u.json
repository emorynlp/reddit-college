  "text": "I am currently having a long awaited breakdown after months of regretting what major I chose and dreading the future classes I will have to take. I am a sophomore (about to be a junior after this semester) and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too late to change or if I should just tough it out until I graduate. I\u2019ve been trying my best, but i am becoming more unhappy every day. If anyone has advice or experience with this, i would appreciate it very much.",

I have nearly all of my gen-eds done and I am two classes deep into my major requirements (which isn\u2019t a lot compared to everything I have to do). I have been behind in school because I\u2019ve taken semesters off to work and I also switched schools (university to community to a different university) and not all of my credits transferred. It has been complicated.",

              "text": "You should be fine. I will caution that it seems like you do kinda need to pick a direction, constant changing of schools, semesters off and major changes are an easy way to end up with student debt and no degree. \n\nI assume it\u2019s not a drastic change, you\u2019re not going from engineering to music or something like that.",

      "text": "Depends if it\u2019s a similar major to the one you have. For example Computer Science vs Data Science, Business vs Econ or something idk. What I\u2019m trying to say it that some core prerequisites could be in there already if it similar. My advice would to definitely sit down and see what prerequisites you have or don\u2019t, what gen eds you have and don\u2019t. And see how many credits you have left to graduate. You may have some electives to fulfill a few credits that would be like free classes anyway where you can chalk them down that you did. I\u2019d definitely talk with an adviser after doing these things but it is possible if you feel like it\u2019s not your cup of tea as a sophomore.",
