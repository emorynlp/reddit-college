  "title:": "I think my new friend group is trying to cut me off",
  "text": "I\u2019m in a freshmen at college and like everyone I joined a little friend group. The first 2 months we hung out a lot and I was invited to eat out and party a lot with them. As the school year went on I knew we would hang out less frequently but it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve been ghosted from them. I saw on social media that they were all hanging out on multiple occasions without me, either in someone\u2019s dorm or getting food. They didn\u2019t text me or anything so I confronted them about how I was feeling and said that wasn\u2019t cool. They made some excuses that i accepted and I moved on. Today is a football game and I texted where we were meeting up and at what time. They said they were eating and i told them I would meet up with them after. I got ignored and I just learned that they left and went to the game once again without even texting me. Am I over thinking this? It\u2019s only been 3 months, should I just move on and look for new friends?",
