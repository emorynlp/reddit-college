  "text": "Forgive me- but I'm first generation and didn't care in high school to learn so this may sound stupid. \n\nIt's the end of the semester and I'm lucky enough to have a wonderful professor who is allowing us to redo assignments to raise our grade in the class on top of allowing us two extra credit assignments. I'm happy with my grades at the moment, and in this class I have a 148/100. I have the chance to work through the holiday weekend and raise that even more. Will it effect my 4.0 GPA as in raise it above? I know that I've heard of people graduating with higher GPAs and I would love to but if it won't then I would rather not stress about it.",

      "text": "Some high school GPAs can be higher due to classes being weighted differently, but I\u2019ve never heard of that in college. \n\nAnd A+ is an A+ and that\u2019s a 4.0. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 100/100 or 150/100. \n\nYou could always look up the grading scale for the class/university if you want a full picture of how it works.",

      "text": "Probably not. If you get a 200% in a class and a 0% in a class it does not mean you have a 100% (200/2) (GPA = 4.0). It means you got an A (4.0) and then miserably fail the other class (0.0) therefore your cumulative GPA is 2.0 (bcuz 4.0/2 is 2).",
