  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm currently finishing my sophomore year of electrical engineering and planning to graduate with my AS in the spring.\n\nI was on a hike and long story short hit my head off a low hanging fallen tree trunk. I hit it so hard I saw stars and laid down on the side of a trail for 10 minutes before even trying to walk the 2 miles out. I  had my boyfriend there to help me out and get me to urgent care where they said they suspect it could be a concussion but they weren't 100% since they weren't able to do scans.\n\nIt's been a little more than a week feeling out of it, hard to focus, light sensitivity, brain fog, funky memory, migraines at random times, etc. So I'm 98% sure it is a concussion. I've been trying to get a appointment with my PCP but no luck until next week.\n\nMidterm grades came out today and I have Cs and Ds right now. One of my professors emailed me telling me there is room to improve still.  But I feel so dumb. I didn't send out the note I got from Urgent care stating I had a head injury (10/11/21)  and to excuse me for one day (probably should have asked for more but hindsight 20/20). Actually went to my lab the next morning anyway. Couldn't focus but still got data.  Just struggling to do the actual reports (on a computer) and the calculations in general. \n\nI'm at a loss at what to do. I'm dealing with the concussion symptoms and now riddled with anxiety for waiting so damn long. Do I send the head injury note that excused me for one day? I don't even know if my PCP will give me a note in the end and I'm just in a bit of a panic in general.  I'm kicking myself for not sending an email that day but my anxiety has been raging since everything happened. \n\nTLDR; Got a concussion and just spaced out of school for almost two weeks. Grades got low. Should I still reach out to teachers about handing in missing work/extensions. Just feeling dumb/anxious",

      "text": "First of all, take care of yourself. Letting your brain heal is your top priority. Explain to your medical provider that you are having significant symptoms after a head injury. Ask to be seen ASAP. \n\nSchool should be accommodating as you recover. Let your instructors know that you may need deadlines extended as you heal. If needed, provide documentation from your urgent care visit or additional documentation you receive in the future. It would be a good idea to be in touch with your school's disability program. They can provide you with a letter to notify your instructors that you are entitled to receive specific accommodations related to your injury. Instructors will provide the accommodations specified by the disability program. \n\nGet all the rest you can and focus on getting better.",
