  "title:": "[USA] Master's Program Before PhD Advice Wanted",
  "text": " \n\n\\[USA\\] Grad program in preparation for PhD?\n\nI am interested in a PhD in Counseling or Clinical Psychology at a program that has a fairly equal balance between research and clinical, but I have decided to pursue a Master\u2019s Degree first for a few reasons. Firstly, to get some experience in research to see if I like producing it (I already like consuming it) and to get a sense if school for 4-5 years will be ok for me. Secondly, I want to show a strong GPA and get research experience to build a complete application to potential PhD programs. I graduate undergrad 8 years ago with a 2.89 GPA. I\u2019ve grown into a practically different person since then and feel confident in my ability to excel in graduate school.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a degree that can help me get into a PhD program, help me determine if I truly want that, and that can offer master\u2019s level licensure if the answer is no. I\u2019m considering a Master\u2019s Degree in Counseling (while trying to volunteer for a lab on the side), and a degree in Psychology (little master\u2019s level licensure options, but seems more geared toward future PhD applicants).\n\nIs there anyone here who could help me understand how these two different routes would be viewed by doctoral programs in clinical or counseling psychology?\n\nThanks for your help!",
