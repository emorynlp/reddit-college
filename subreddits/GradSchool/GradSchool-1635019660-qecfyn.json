  "title:": "Should I drop my courses now? - I need help",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently in my first semester of my program and I\u2019m not doing alright. My father has an incident a few weeks ago and I\u2019m currently taking care of him. It\u2019s taking a toll of my mental health and school doesn\u2019t feel like a priority anymore. I just missed an extended deadline for a methods class and I\u2019m only 75% done the assignment. My program has a strict schedule, which means  I need to get these credits or else I will have added course loads in the future if I take a semester off or take drop my classes. I am also planning to apply for a MBA program for next year, this means I need to start my application and study for the GRE next semester. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m tired. Since my parents are older and they don\u2019t speak English, I am taking my father to the hospital three times a week. It\u2019s also hard to see my father struggling since the accident has put him in constant pain. It\u2019s been hard to be motivated or even care about anything. I already reached out to my school\u2019s accessibility office for accommodations, was transparent with the situation to my professor and program director, and made plans to meet with my school\u2019s mental health office. However, I\u2019m considering dropping out of my classes right now (not all but the ones with the most course work). When I talked to my graduate assistant about what my next steps are, they kept on reminding me I need to push through it or else I will be losing my funding. I don\u2019t know what I should do since I don\u2019t want to fuck up my future or relationship with my professors. Even if I take the next semester off, I will be in the program longer and pay more for school. While I\u2019m in a good financial position, I don\u2019t want to increase my student loans. I\u2019m truly lost right now and I don\u2019t know what to do.",
