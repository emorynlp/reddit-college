  "text": "If December 1st is the priority deadline with a secondary deadline of January 1st is it bad to not meet the priority deadline? It does not look like there is a difference in funding just when the invites for visits and interviews go out.\n\nI made kind of a late decision to just go ahead and go for it, but now I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it.",

You should probably ask an admissions person there. \n\nThat said, I doubt it looks \u2018bad\u2019 or is impossible to get in otherwise they wouldn\u2019t give the option at all.",
