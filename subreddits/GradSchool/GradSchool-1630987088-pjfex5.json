I\u2019m 3 weeks in at my grad school and I feel like quitting but that\u2019s not an option for me.\nI\u2019m doing masters in statistics and I feel so behind in class. I did mathematics in my undergraduate where we didn\u2019t have to do a lot of statistics courses; meaning we only did the basics.\nAnyway, it\u2019s not an imposter syndrome because I actually have no idea what\u2019s going on in my classes.\nI\u2019m also a TA. I feel so unmotivated to do my schoolwork; I just sit in my room all day regretting my decision of going to grad school. \nSo, I guess I\u2019m asking for some motivation or advice here\u2026\ud83d\ude29\n\nThank you for reading!", "author": "introvert2019", "created": 1630987088, "retrieved": 1632844753, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hbx5kar": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjfex5/3_weeks_in_and_i_feel_like_quitting/hbx5kar/", "text": "I'm only 6 days into my program and considering quitting.

Have you tried reaching out to your professors for help understanding what\u2019s going on? If not, now would be an excellent time to do that so you don\u2019t fall too far behind.

Just want to say you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m in a DS masters right now, and although I did some programming in undergrad, I never did it to this depth/extent. I also have felt like I should quit- and would agree that it\u2019s not imposter syndrome because it\u2019s not that I know how to do this and I think I can\u2019t, but I genuinely, actually don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Whats been helping me is connecting with other students who need help, tapping into resources like office hours, and tapping into outside resources that have worked for me before, in my case, I just bought a code academy subscription. I know that we will be okay because admissions deemed that we would survive. They\u2019re not gonna fail us. We might not be the most experienced in our respective cohorts but we WILL SURVIVE! Cheers and don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. It\u2019s gonna be alright", "author": "Mysterious_Donut_750", "created": 1630988661, "upvotes": 5}}}
