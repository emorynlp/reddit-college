I had no social life, my relationship were strained because I was working all the time. Last night I imported the four W-2 forms and one 1099 form representing my 2019 income and my AGI was just over $26,000. I budget carefully and have been able to make ends meet, barely.  But now, reflecting back on last year, I'm really pissed off that I have worked SO hard and for so long and have little to show for it. I'm not even getting a tax refund because my non-compensatory income is more than my qualified educational expenses and one of my gigs was an IC job I still have to pay taxes on. I'm so sick of this, I've been below the poverty line for 6 years now despite having many skills and working my ass off.", "author": "TweakerALaBeaker", "created": 1581267739, "retrieved": 1632954500, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"fh7rl7z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f1bf5i/i_worked_5_jobs_last_year_i_made_a_total_of_26k/fh7rl7z/", "text": "Was it mostly part time jobs?", "author": "DapperFisticuffs", "created": 1581342777, "upvotes": 1}, "fh6rghc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f1bf5i/i_worked_5_jobs_last_year_i_made_a_total_of_26k/fh6rghc/", "text": "Seeing stories like this make me really wonder how some programs include in their requirements that TA/GA-ships mean you can't have another job.", "author": "validusrex", "created": 1581304283, "upvotes": 3}, "fh6m1uf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f1bf5i/i_worked_5_jobs_last_year_i_made_a_total_of_26k/fh6m1uf/", "text": "Holy crap, stories like this make me so grateful my program has a good stipend to COL ratio.

I live in a university town where rent can be cheaper if you live far out from campus and commute. But I like the safety and convenience of living on campus so either I have to cough up a steep rent or in my case bunk up with three undergrads as roommates. Add to that the pressure of only getting paid 11 months a year and saving enough to  afford a ticket back home once a year to see family. I can justify all of this with the desire to contribute to science and telling myself this phase is temporary and a stepping stone to better jobs in future. But my blood boils when we are gaslighted by people in power. I was at a recruitment event for new graduate students where a candidate was asking about living expenses on our stipend and I was giving them a real picture of how it is, when our HoD stepped in to remind me that we are so much better off than graduate students in Boston or NYC where they live in shoebox size apartments for double or triple the rent we pay, so I should not be complaining. Yeah right, I should be satisfied with my meager paystub because other people are being more exploited than I am.
