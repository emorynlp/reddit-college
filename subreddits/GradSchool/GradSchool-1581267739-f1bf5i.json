  "text": "My 2019 was consumed by side hustles I needed to supplement my below-living-wage PhD stipend while working on my dissertation. I had no social life, my relationship were strained because I was working all the time. Last night I imported the four W-2 forms and one 1099 form representing my 2019 income and my AGI was just over $26,000. I budget carefully and have been able to make ends meet, barely.  But now, reflecting back on last year, I'm really pissed off that I have worked SO hard and for so long and have little to show for it. I'm not even getting a tax refund because my non-compensatory income is more than my qualified educational expenses and one of my gigs was an IC job I still have to pay taxes on. I'm so sick of this, I've been below the poverty line for 6 years now despite having many skills and working my ass off.",

          "text": "I feel like that depends a lot on your degree. A low industry salary for my field would be $80k/yr. $4k a year lets me not have roommates, be able to go out to the bar whenever the hell I feel like it, and not stress about money in general. $20-24k in debt is easily worth that given future earnings in my book. I can see the hesitation if you're likely going to be making $50k a year for the foreseeable future, but in general I think there's too much of a stigma around PhD loans. Nobody bats an eye when a med student takes out $200k in loans, but it's heresy for the engineer to take out a tenth of that? I know the ultimate salary for PhDs is lower, but in a lot of fields it's not low enough that a small loan actually matters in the grand scheme of things.",

I live in a university town where rent can be cheaper if you live far out from campus and commute. But I like the safety and convenience of living on campus so either I have to cough up a steep rent or in my case bunk up with three undergrads as roommates. Add to that the pressure of only getting paid 11 months a year and saving enough to  afford a ticket back home once a year to see family. I can justify all of this with the desire to contribute to science and telling myself this phase is temporary and a stepping stone to better jobs in future. But my blood boils when we are gaslighted by people in power. I was at a recruitment event for new graduate students where a candidate was asking about living expenses on our stipend and I was giving them a real picture of how it is, when our HoD stepped in to remind me that we are so much better off than graduate students in Boston or NYC where they live in shoebox size apartments for double or triple the rent we pay, so I should not be complaining. Yeah right, I should be satisfied with my meager paystub because other people are being more exploited than I am. Thank you for the enlightenment.",

Others are not so lucky. \n\n  \nNational Labs are relatively better with post-doc fellows getting 60-70k annually. But this is not for International candidates. \n\n  \nThat doesn't mean Industry jobs are great. Places like Intel Fab units have high attrition rates for Ph.D. grads.

      "text": "My PhD defense is this Friday. I took out about $5k per year to supplement my stipend and tutored and cleaned for couple on the side (2 hrs a week cleaning and usually 2-4 hours a week tutoring while my experiments were running and didn\u2019t require my attention). I also had to teach undergrad labs ~20 hrs a week for my stipend. I just started my full-time job and I have to say, I\u2019m so glad a took out the loans. The side gigs gave me enough to spend money on stupid stuff, but with the extra loan money I could afford to pay my rent without worrying, buy a new computer when my laptop died in the middle of a weekend take home exam, and pay for unexpected larger expenses that would pop up (medical/car/etc). I just started my full-time job and I know it will take some time to pay off those loans but it was 100% worth the peace of mind and ability to focus all my other attention on my research (I also have about $70k in student loans from my undergrad- I went to a state school and lived at home, but my dad couldn\u2019t help me pay tuition because he was single with 2 kids and barely made ends meet. He did co-sign my loans though so that was a relief). Remember, it\u2019s an investment in your future.",

              "text": "I will say that I have a lot of student loan debt from undergrad and while it is daunting, it is low interest compared to consumer debt and federal loans have more flexibility in terms of repayment. I went into default once and was even able to bring them back into good standing and it's not on my credit report or anything. If you're able to take out the bare minimum for expenses, you could be on a plan to pay that off later on. I don't know anything about private loans, however ...",

Our stipends (1990s) were about $9K, so about $14K adjusted for inflation.  Basic living expenses ate that up plus some, and I had to fund research travel (there was/is little external funding in the humanities). The completion rate in my Ph.D. program was very low, but almost everyone left with heavy debts as there was simply no way to live off the stipends (zero in summers) while still having time to research/write. I was only able to finish because I worked full time the last two years while I wrote my dissertation.",
