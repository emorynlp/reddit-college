I felt like their lives revolved around their partners. I would ask someone to get a drink after class or meet up last minute on a weekend to study and their response constantly revolved around \"asking\" their partner, etc. I was actually super turned off that the majority of us were only in our mid twenties and had already lost our sense of spontaneity and to me, they felt \"settled.\" Don't get me wrong- there is nothing wrong with feeling comfortable and settled... but in my twenties, that did NOT appeal to me. I spent long weekends traveling or backpacking with other friends outside of the program, while they were at home taking care of newborns and sleep deprived (again- nothing wrong with this, just not what I wanted at the time, ESPECIALLY in an intense grad program). Now that I am more domesticated living with my partner (4 years out of school), I am even more happy that I spent that decade of my life being selfish and focusing on myself and doing whatever I wanted. My point is- it's not always rosey and nice on the other side.\n\nThe pandemic adds an interesting twist though- I am sure it feels incredibly isolating to even be meeting people right now just seeking friendship.
