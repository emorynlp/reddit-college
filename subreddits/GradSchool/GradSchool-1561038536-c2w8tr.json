My wife left an Ivy League Biomedical Engineering PhD program for the up and coming field of Engineering Education. Ultimately, this left to finding better balance in life, a healthier community and being closer to family as well as recognition in her field. \n\nRemember to take a step back to evaluate your goals and your trajectory. Do they line up with what is truly valuable? Are they going to allow you to live a healthy, balanced life? It can be hard to let go of the prestige, especially for those of us who find ourselves inclined to pursue advanced education. Your future self will always have things that you wonder about what would have happened (many would call this regrets but that also carries too much negative baggage), make sure whatever path you take has the best up sides.",
