  "text": "In my country, the grades go from 1 to 10, so I was wondering what was the equivalence of a 3.6 gpa. And does someone know what gpa is usually required to be accepted in a good European grad school like HEC or ESSEC?",

      "text": "In Canada they have a website (google Omsas gpa converter) which will show the equivalencies between different scales. It doesn't appear to be proportional - like a 3.60 would land between a B+ (7) and an A- (8),  which makes sense for typical grad school GPA cut offs. Could be slightly different where you're from and in Europe but it may help get a better idea",

      "text": "That's an unsolved problem. For a somewhat fair conversion, you'd need to know the distribution of grades on both scales, so you can use the percentile you're in as an intermediate, bias-free metric.\n\nBut those distributions are usually not known (and you'd still have to decide who you should compare to)",
