  "title:": "Decided not to start grad school this fall and am looking into starting this spring instead, is it appropriate for me to ask my professors to submit their letters of recommendation for me again?",
  "text": "Basically I was accepted and enrolled to begin my masters in biomedical engineering this fall. I had a last minute change of heart and ended up dropping my enrollment. I have no doubt that this was the right choice for me, however now I want to go back to grad school to get a masters in chemistry instead. \n\nIs it appropriate to ask the same professors from last year to submit a letter of rec for me again? I had good relationships with them while I was a student, but at this point it will have been at least a year since I have really been in contact with them. It isn't like I reached out to any of them to tell them that I decided not to attend this semester even though I got into the program, so this would all be news to them. Is this inconsiderate to do? Will it seem as if I wasted their time last year writing me a letter of rec? I guess I technically did waste their time. \n\nAlso I am applying for a different major so I don't know if that would prevent them from submitting the letter they already wrote for me last year...\n\nI would appreciate any feedback you guys have! thank you.",
