  "text": "Hello all,   \nI am currently applying for a post-doc in the lab of an important lab in my field and in the application they are asking for my cover letter and a CV.  \nI was wondering how often PIs even look at the cover letter. Will they even look at it, or are they just going to jump straight to my CV?\n\nAny feedback would be helpful. Thank you all!",

      "text": "I can\u2019t say for sure what most PIs do, but from the perspective of someone who successfully landed my first-choice postdoc I think the cover letter really helped me.\n\nThe CV is for what you have done, the cover letter is for what you are interested in doing and why you want to work with that particular PI.\n\nThe cover letter is also a chance to highlight things you really want the PI to know about you that might otherwise get lost in your big multi-page CV. A CV is a disjointed list of facts/accomplishments, a cover letter puts them in context and highlights a few of them in order to tell a story/make an argument that you are the right person for the position.\n\nI\u2019ve had PIs reference things from my cover letters during interviews, so I\u2019m pretty sure they read them!",
