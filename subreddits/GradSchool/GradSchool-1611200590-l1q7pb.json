I've been toiling away in lab for the last 11 hours or so and then the stupidest of things doesn't seem to work. Part of me knows that I should call it a night, rest and try again tomorrow. But of course a part of me feels anxious about not being able to meet the deadline.\n\nSigh. 5 years back when I got my admit letter to this program on a full ride, my joy had known no bounds. Little did I know how hard and frustrating it would really be.. The imposter in me is back with a bang (not that it had really left).\n\nAnyone on the same boat?\n\nEdit: A big thank you to those who left such supportive and motivating messages on the post. Really makes me realize that this academic boat isn't all that empty lol. For those with similarly dreary anecdotes about their experiences, please push through and if you can, get some rest.. A day later my experiment that I was agonizing over for 2 hours last night started to work in about 20 minutes today! I still have a lot of work to complete before my conference deadline, but a small sliver of a silver lining has definitely helped.\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "Gee_Es10", "created": 1611200590, "retrieved": 1632953367, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 528, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gk967fq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/l1q7pb/whats_a_phd_without_a_good_cry_in_the_middle_of/gk967fq/", "text": "I spend a lot of time in the lab, too.
