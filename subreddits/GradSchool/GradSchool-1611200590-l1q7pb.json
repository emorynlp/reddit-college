  "text": "\\*Rant post out of exhaustion\\*\n\nNothing much, except that my latest experiments seem to have hit the most unexpected roadblock at the most crucial time. I've been toiling away in lab for the last 11 hours or so and then the stupidest of things doesn't seem to work. Part of me knows that I should call it a night, rest and try again tomorrow. But of course a part of me feels anxious about not being able to meet the deadline.\n\nSigh. 5 years back when I got my admit letter to this program on a full ride, my joy had known no bounds. Little did I know how hard and frustrating it would really be.. The imposter in me is back with a bang (not that it had really left).\n\nAnyone on the same boat?\n\nEdit: A big thank you to those who left such supportive and motivating messages on the post. Really makes me realize that this academic boat isn't all that empty lol. For those with similarly dreary anecdotes about their experiences, please push through and if you can, get some rest.. A day later my experiment that I was agonizing over for 2 hours last night started to work in about 20 minutes today! I still have a lot of work to complete before my conference deadline, but a small sliver of a silver lining has definitely helped.\n\n&#x200B;",

But I think you shouldn't beat youself up too much because it also depends a lot on your advisor. If they're too directive and rigid it can make things unnecessarily difficult for students.

I can't stress enough how much of a n00b I was at research, or how poorly I felt the research methods class prepared me (it was an all-online six-week summer class that basically involved watching some sometimes silly videos).\n\nThey also didn't understand how to guide me through my first time through the IRB process.

These two books go over, in copious detail, how to get a job with a graduate degree (specifically a PhD). Key take-aways are: go to a top school and/or work with a top researcher in your field. Publish *a lot*. Don't be an adjunct if you want to be a researcher. For STEM fields: Assistant Professorships aren't all they're cracked up to be and you should consider working for industry or government labs as well (and then trying for a fast-tracked Associate Professorship - if you're still interested in that - after building up your body of work.)",
