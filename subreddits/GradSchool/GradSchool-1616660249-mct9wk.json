The paper has 71 references and an ENTIRE research framework. \n\nThere's even a photo of a dog as the supporting photo. \n\nEdit: After zooming in, I found that it\u2019s just the dog\u2019s bed with a teddy not the dog \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nHere\u2019s the link to the journal article! Enjoy!\n\nhttps://res.mdpi.com/d_attachment/animals/animals-11-00089/article_deploy/animals-11-00089.pdf\n\nEdit: THANK YOU FOR THE HUG AWARD! I'm glad you are all enjoying this post <3",
