  "title:": "Supervisor is on leave - things to consider with new supervisor?",
  "text": "My M.A. supervisor is now on leave for an indeterminate period of time, and has asked me to find a new supervisor so I can continue my work and graduate on time. Have taken courses with new supervisor before, and grateful they are taking me on. But I was pretty close with my ex-supervisor and they were like a mentor for me. \n\nNot really sure how to build a rapport with new supervisor, if it even matters since I'm halfway through my thesis and just want to finish at this point, and how to approach it. Does having a new supervisor mean that I have to re-discuss everything already agreed upon up to this point with them? Or is it usually something that we would mutually agree on the way forward? Have you had experience with changing supervisors midway through writing a thesis, and are there any things I should consider discussing beforehand?\n\nSorry if my questions are unclear - I tried to look up some past posts on similar topics but still feel quite confused and nervous about the situation. Thanks for any advice or words of comfort \ud83e\udd23",

      "text": "Talk to your new supervisor on what you're doing and how you've progressed so far. You're already deep in the project so don't think that you're going to have to change anything. Your supervisor is there to, as you said, keep you on track, aware of deadlines, and knowledgeable of what your department requires and what the grad school will require for completion of your project.\n\nI don't think your new supervisor is new to this either. They already have their own students they are working with and are taking you on. You've taken classes with them so they know you as well. Just have a meeting with them and ask what their expectations are (I doubt they will be much different than your original).",
