Presentation went smooth and the defense was very constructive.\n\nCan\u2019t emphasize enough how important it is to be fully prepared AND to relax. I read through my dissertation several times before sending it to my advisor early. Getting her the best first draft possible allowed her to get me edits back pretty fast. \n\nWent over my talk with my advisor a couple times and then rehearsed it several times to my wife (also in my field).\n\nOnce I had my talk down, I spent a couple days doing NOTHING. Hung out at home and watched some tv and baseball. \n\nCouldn\u2019t be happier right now!", "author": "Schmoopy_Boo", "created": 1553956137, "retrieved": 1632845770, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 446, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"ejst3gu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/b7bvr5/am_doctor/ejst3gu/", "text": "Way to go, Dr. OP!", "author": "magpie2295", "created": 1554035473, "upvotes": 1}, "ejsoy92": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/b7bvr5/am_doctor/ejsoy92/", "text": "nice", "author": "mister_peeberz", "created": 1554029099, "upvotes": 1}, "ejrsw7c": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/b7bvr5/am_doctor/ejrsw7c/", "text": "woohoo! congrats, dr!
