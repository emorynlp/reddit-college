  "title:": "Advice on applying to grad school for ecology",
  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm really anxious about applying to grad school. I feel like I know nothing about science graduate school. \n\nHow do I choose a major professor if my interests are really wide? I've been reading through the primary literature from a few people and it all sounds interesting to me. I can visualize myself working on a variety of these projects.\n\nOne of the professors has a \"How to apply\" advice article which she states that \"cold-calling\" is not the best way to find and advisor and it should instead come from participation in the field, such as conferences, etc. I've been teaching public high school AP Environmental Science an Chemistry for 7 years so I haven't been in the ecology field and COVID virtual conferences have really reduced the chance for networking. \n\nI do have a BS in biological science (3.89 GPA), but my plan was teaching, therefore I did not write a thesis and I've never been published. I don't have examples of journal-style writing. The closest I have are some papers I wrote in undergrad or a sample of writing for my teacher National Board Certification. Should I share one of those since they ask for a writing sample? Should I try to write something else?\n\nThis was my dream when I started college but I was dealing with some major depression and couldn't handle the networking and competition. Through therapy and medical help, we found my issue and it has not been a problem for almost a decade. COVID and the death of a close family member made me realize I really want to give this field another shot.\n\nI'm confident in my intelligence but humble enough to know how little I know about this field. Teaching has taught me excellent communication skills, especially in communicating technical content in a way that makes it comprehensible to a wide audience. I love working outside, and I love solving difficult puzzles. I'm an easy to work with team member. I'm worried these qualities will constantly be overshadowed by my lack of experience listed above. \n\nDo you have advice for me?\n\nEdit: To clarify, I'm pursuing an MS degree in the US.",

      "text": "I get that cold-calling might not be ideal, but the pandemic has messed everything up, so you have to work with what you\u2019ve got. You\u2019re also a non traditional student with a lot of teaching experience, and you\u2019ve got a relevant degree with a good GPA. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about your experience looking different from the norm. I\u2019d actually lean heavily on the strengths your experience gives you, because you\u2019ll stand out. So find what that is and sell it. \n\nI do think you should work out a research statement and hone your interests a bit. I work as an ecologist now, and I\u2019ve done fieldwork and computational work. My background is in paleontology. Basically, I have pretty broad interests, due in part to having an interdisciplinary background that has let me take on different roles in my work. I don\u2019t work in academia anymore, but if you have questions I can do my best to answer them. \n\nOne thing I would recommend you consider is how much fieldwork you\u2019re really interested in. Depending on what you pursue, you may end up with an annual field season, it could possibly be isolated or expensive to get to (which requires more funding). Is that something you\u2019re okay with? What do you intend to do with your degree long term? If it\u2019s get a PhD and develop your own research program, I recommend considering what you\u2019d like to be doing down the line.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for this response. It's hard to know if being non-traditional is valued or frowned upon in various fields, but I imagine it depends how I spin it.\n\nI would say if I had to choose an interest with a more narrow view, I'm interested in stream ecology and how riparian ecosystems respond to disturbance (wildfire, forestry, development, etc.), along with the best methods to restore them. Alternatively, the impact of invasive species on streams or wetlands and how to minimize invasive species distribution.\n\nI'm fairly sure I don't want to work in academia, at least not at an R1 institution. Ideally I'm looking at government work with USDA, USFWS, BLM, etc. Or even environmental consulting. The more time I can spend in the field, the better.",

I would consider your years of teaching to mean you have a strong background in basic science, you know you can take on challenges and meet deadlines, and you\u2019re an experienced science communicator. All great things for the career you\u2019re pursuing.",

      "text": "I suggest listening to the \u201cHow to survive academia (and enjoy it)\u201d podcast by Conservation Careers on Spotify. They give some good tips on how to canvas for programs and the general landscape of graduate school. I basically went in blind to grad school and it would\u2019ve been immensely helpful to me at the time. Mind you, if I knew more about the actual grad school experience before I went, I probably would not have gone.",

      "text": "Could you clarify if you're looking to pursue a master's vs PhD? Also, may I assume from context that you're based in the US?\n\nBroadly, there is quite a bit of heterogeneity in grad programs---way more than most grad admissions discussions usually acknowledge. For example, a lot of programs don't care or even want you to reach out to potential advisors during the admissions process. Each program will have different biases toward or against applicants on less traditional paths. Writing samples, beyond the statement of purpose, don't seem to be very common. To be \"ready to apply\", you don't need to satisfy the maximal set of application requirements across all programs in your field; you don't have time apply to all of them, anyway. Figure out what you're ready for at this stage, where you want to be by the end of the program, and narrow down the field to a set of programs that makes sense for the applicant you are. \n\nWith that out of the way, I encourage you anyway to cold-email advisors whose work you're interested in learning more about. Even if a specific research project doesn't materialize from any resulting discussions, it will help hone your understanding of the area, what the current research looks like, and whether it's something you would want to pursue.\n\nFinally, I am not sure if this specifically applies to ecology (I'm in a different STEM field) but I've noticed that quite a few conferences and professional organizations in my field welcome and encourage K-12 teachers to attend and contribute (esp. about pedagogy and talent pipelines), and therefore also network with univsersity-level researchers. I definitely would encourage you to see if any regional national professional organizations in ecology or environmental science have a K-12 instructor membership and relevant opportunities.",
