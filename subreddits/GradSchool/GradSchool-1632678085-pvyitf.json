One way to combat this is to just start working on it - then check in to see if it was worth procrastinating about. \n\nalso as a wonderful therapist once said, \"you are never going to feel like it\" - a lot of things we want in life (degree, promotion, ect) are not self-motivating. for example,  I want to get my PhD, but I don't \"feel\" like writing my dissertation. These things conflict with one another, but generally the tip here is to stop overvaluing how you feel - your feeling towards something may actually be a detriment towards your overall goal. \n\nalso, as always, therapy is amazing if you are not already doing it. no problem is too small or too big for therapy.", "author": "JGRuff", "created": 1632679750, "upvotes": 14}}}
