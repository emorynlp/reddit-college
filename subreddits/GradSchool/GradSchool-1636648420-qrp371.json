  "text": "Just defended my masters thesis and I've never felt more stupid. My committee asked a lot of questions about things that I have learned in classes before but couldn't recall, and I feel like I've let them down. It was accepted with revisions, but I also want to ask for advice: how do people deal with depression/anxiety and the memory problems it gives you? I definitely should've brushed up on my notes from my classes relevant to my research, but I thought I would be able to remember the things I've learned.\n\nEdit: when I take antidepressants I can concentrate more on when people are talking to me, but I have completely no motivation to do work. When I am off antidepressants, my anxiety is enough to get me super motivated to do work. What a tradeoff...",

      "text": "I don't think the problem is your skill or intelligence at all. IMO this is clearly just mental health / anxiety problems, and blaming yourself for having them is as silly as blaming yourself for being five feet tall. It's just your biology / anatomy / physiology, and some things just can't be helped.\n\nI personally get REALLY nervous when I'm tested on anything and often forget basic things that I absolutely do know. Sometimes it's just hard to shake that, no matter how much we do to try and minimize our anxiety. I've accepted that I'll just mess up sometimes because of my anxiety, and since it's not my fault that I have anxiety, I've made peace with that.\n\nSo *don't* tell yourself that you are \"stupid\"! Hardly anyone makes it as far as you have, so you can't possibly be \"stupid\", all things considered.",

You\u2019re always gonna get hit with something unexpected during a defense, and it really takes a lot out of you.  But also take a moment to feel proud for making it through.",
