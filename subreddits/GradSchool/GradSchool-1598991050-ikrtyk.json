If you're in the U.S. and someone tells you to show up, you can quite literally use the shelter-in-place orders from your state and the letter of the law to support your choice to say no. Viruses don't care about social or political boundaries, so it is up to us as responsible citizens to set those boundaries. Given the circumstances, I'm surprised your professors wouldn't be more flexible about the possibility of a take-home examination; more to the point, any university admin worth its salt would have sent out some general guidelines to faculty, graduate assistants, and students about what to do in a situation like this.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, this will have to become the new norm: With no vaccine yet and a bungled \"back-to-school\" response across the board, airing on the side of caution should be the respectable action.\n\nBottom line, I'm hoping you're going to be alright. I know what stressing about this kind of thing entails, and I too went the route of showing up to a final that had no take-home option: I showed up to a debate final for an ethics class with a high fever and what I would later find out was mono. I felt like I had to show up or I wouldn't get a good grade in the class. Several times during the debate, I nearly fell forward in my chair; the professor was obviously worried.\n\nTake care of you, and know that setting boundaries does get easier with time.", "author": "OfTheWater", "created": 1599009179, "upvotes": 5}, "g3npkzr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ikrtyk/hopefully_not_showing_up_when_not_feeling_well/g3npkzr/", "text": "I\u2019m pretty glad that my grad school seemed to already have that kind of culture.
