I'm also just coming to terms with the fact that I'm transmasculine and non-binary (they/he/she). I am planning to get started on my medical transition while I still have decent health insurance through my (trans supportive) parents for the next year or so. I will be starting low dose T soon and am trying to schedule top-surgery for sometime in 2022. I am not aiming for passing as a cis-man.\n\nI'm out as vaguely queer in my research lab in that I have referenced a same-sex partner, have some pride merch, and just generally look gay as hell. I have never tried to look less visibly queer for work, and just generally aim for a masculine business casual. My lab is generally a very supportive, professional environment with decent (cis Male/Female) gender, language, and race/ethnicity diversity, and it's clear my advisor doesn't really care about your personal life as long as you're doing good work.  I've been here a month and a half and so far he's been a very active professional mentor and has generally liked my work and provides productive critical feedback. I have felt very comfortable being myself here.\n\nBut, I've never explicitly stated that I'm queer, I go by my given name, and have never brought up my pronouns and have been leaving it out of professional profiles/email signatures. I assume most people can tell I'm queer but alas, some people, especially straight men in science, will just assume you're straight and cis unless you get your identity tattooed on your forehead. Also, I'm brand new in the lab, am funded but still looking for grants to fund a research interest of mine for my future thesis, and won't be done with quals for another two years.\n\nI was kind of just hoping to wait until I'm a fully fledged PhD candidate to try and assert my trans identity as I am nervous about coming out when I am in this tenuous position. Unfortunately, even if they're not actively transphobic, asserting a new name and pronouns seems to be seen as an inconvenience for a lot of the \"paper output is the only thing that matters to me\" type people. Also, I have no idea if saying I'm trans/queer when applying for grants that require a personal statement would harm or benefit my applications (I know applying and mentioning difficulties as a \"woman\" in STEM right now is good for my applications. It sucks we have to leverage our identities and past trauma to be more highly considered for funding in these things, but that's another discussion completely). Another reason I don't really want to come out is that, while I'm interested in mentoring queer undergrads in STEM once I finish getting my own shit together, I'm sooo not interested in having to educate my entire department on trans-issues and be held up as an example of diversity in the labs. I'm kind of just planning to do the HRT and get the top-surgery without ever saying anything. Especially since I'm not really planning on growing any facial hair and already bind my chest and use the gender neutral bathrooms, the main noticeable differences will likely be more acne, muscle and fat distribution changes, and voice changes. I'm happy with the current support system I have outside of my lab that I am out too and don't feel an intense need to be validated in my gender at work; everyone is in a lab coat and mask all the time anyways.\n\nHow should I go about this professionally? What should I look out for or be aware of in terms of gender-based discrimination? Is it totally wild for me to try and transition without letting most people know? How can I find allies in my department before selectively outing myself when queer issues are not commonly discussed at work? I don't want my being trans, especially as I work through all the kinks of medically transitioning to the point where I'm more comfortable, to affect my professional life more than it has to if I can avoid it. If it becomes an extremely toxic envrionment for me, I'll leave; but I'd like to be able to at least walk out with a Master's and try again elsewhere with some research experience under my belt.\n\n(Cross posted with some edits in r/asktransgender for some more specific gender HRT advice)", "author": "SN4k3SNpl4N3S", "created": 1631307841, "retrieved": 1632844652, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "comments": {"hcma985": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pltn5d/coming_out_as_trans_as_a_new_phd_student/hcma985/", "text": "Not particularly qualified to tell you what/how to run this, but three things;\n\n1) Unless they're *reaaaaaaally* old, I'd bet your PI already broadly \"knows\" that you're LGBTQ+ and thus if they had any sort of issue with it you'd probably know already.\n\n2) Once you're comfortable, you'll *probably* want to talk to your advisor and the Department Chair so as to establish boundaries vis-a-vis not wanting to be held up as a diversity yardstick.

There are ways around this that I've heard for those who transition over their careers (e.g. their post-transition name starts with the same letter as their old name, and their nom de plume on all of their papers is just their initials i.e. \"R L Stine\"), but it'll make that bridge easier to cross if you start thinking about it now.
