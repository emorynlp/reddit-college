Set a goal to read one paper per day", "text": "This was some advice that worked really well for me. Read one paper per day. Print it out, read it entirely (edit- or skim the relevant sections), and make handwritten notes at the top of the paper that will summarize the one-sentence importance of the paper and how it may apply to your research. You will slowly build a database in your head for when you start writing.\n\nPlus, one paper a day is manageable and a realistic goal and helps you build confidence in your topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit- To the people saying this isn't reasonable: that's fine, each field is different. This post is about setting tangible goals. Find a goal that works for you and stick with it. Create a program and stick to it.

When writing my own stuff I read everything I come across (or skim and put it in the backlog for later). One a day makes that crunch a tad easier.\n\nMy approach is a general scan, go into details if necessary (or sometimes if it\u2019s interesting even if unrelated).

No. In most cases this is a waste of time, especially with super technical papers. Its much more useful to tip people about how to read a paper in the first place; abstract -> conclusions -> interesting? no: next, yes: go deeper into introduction and discussion, need to know exactly what they did? read methods.\n\nSecond, its easy to read a paper and forget everything right after you finish if you have no connection to the material. Its much more useful to read papers in parallel with what you are doing, especially at the same time as writing your own papers. Sure, it can be good to get an overview of the available papers initially when getting into a new field, but most of the time they will be way too detailed to give you much use yet. \n\nI have found that it can be useful to make a fake presentation when getting into a new topic, as we humans are very good at identifying our own knowledge gaps when we are trying to explain something to others.\n\nIdeally, you should do as much as possible in parallel. Do experiments, read and write at the same time. Ive seen people do all their experiments and read everything first, then when the time comes to actually write something they feel like they know nothing, and its like ofcourse, because you only stored the knowledge in your brain and not on paper.
