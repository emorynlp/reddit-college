  "title:": "Tip: Just starting your thesis research? Set a goal to read one paper per day",
  "text": "This was some advice that worked really well for me. Read one paper per day. Print it out, read it entirely (edit- or skim the relevant sections), and make handwritten notes at the top of the paper that will summarize the one-sentence importance of the paper and how it may apply to your research. You will slowly build a database in your head for when you start writing.\n\nPlus, one paper a day is manageable and a realistic goal and helps you build confidence in your topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit- To the people saying this isn't reasonable: that's fine, each field is different. This post is about setting tangible goals. Find a goal that works for you and stick with it. Create a program and stick to it. IMHO this sub needs more contributions on how to be successful in grad school and where to start.",

(Probably start the waiting part of experiments first though).\n\nThat backlog of PDFs is less intimidating when I\u2019m just grabbing the next one off the list. When writing my own stuff I read everything I come across (or skim and put it in the backlog for later). One a day makes that crunch a tad easier.\n\nMy approach is a general scan, go into details if necessary (or sometimes if it\u2019s interesting even if unrelated). I code each article with a 4 digit code that tells me the year, month, order and category + the title. Import to Endnote and set that code as the short title for easy sorting/finding later.",

                  "text": "Just make sure your inclusion/exclusion criteria are clearly defined and reasonably tight and you'll be fine. If more than 1/4 of the abstracts you're skimming are making it into the \"read further\" stage, stop and talk to your PI about tightening/clarifying the criteria. (This may depend slightly on how abstracts are written in your field - if the info you need for inclusion/exclusion is usually not in the abstract, the \"quick skim\" stage may need to include a *very quick* glance at the methods section.)\n\nIf you can set aside a day or two, you can make it through all the abstracts in one intense burst. Once you're through that part the whole thing feels much, much less intimidating.\n\nBe sure to keep a document or spreadsheet of \"author, year, reason for exclusion\" as you go (one line per paper), so when your PI asks you to make a PRISMA diagram later you won't have to go through them all a second time! Ideally a second person should be doing the same thing in the same format, so you can compare your lists at the end and see if there were any papers you disagreed on.",

      "text": "This sounds like oversimplified advice.\n\nFirst of all, the whole paper from start to finish? No. In most cases this is a waste of time, especially with super technical papers. Its much more useful to tip people about how to read a paper in the first place; abstract -> conclusions -> interesting? no: next, yes: go deeper into introduction and discussion, need to know exactly what they did? read methods.\n\nSecond, its easy to read a paper and forget everything right after you finish if you have no connection to the material. Its much more useful to read papers in parallel with what you are doing, especially at the same time as writing your own papers. Sure, it can be good to get an overview of the available papers initially when getting into a new field, but most of the time they will be way too detailed to give you much use yet. \n\nI have found that it can be useful to make a fake presentation when getting into a new topic, as we humans are very good at identifying our own knowledge gaps when we are trying to explain something to others.\n\nIdeally, you should do as much as possible in parallel. Do experiments, read and write at the same time. Ive seen people do all their experiments and read everything first, then when the time comes to actually write something they feel like they know nothing, and its like ofcourse, because you only stored the knowledge in your brain and not on paper. Also writing is a muscle that needs to be maintained.\n\nA good quote by Einstein: Never remember something you can look up.",

But as someone who was just starting out, I didn't really know where to begin. Someone told me \"start reading one paper per day\" and I started to become familiar with the other researches in my field and the types of experiments they ran.  For me, I found it helpful and thought others might too.  \n\nNo directional advice will be all encompassing or perfect, but I think this sub could do better about giving examples at what worked well during grad school to give ideas to others, as it is often a place where people come to vent. Venting is fine, but it's good to have a balance of posts. ",
