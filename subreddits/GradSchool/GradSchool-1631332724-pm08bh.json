When we did my interview with them, they told me the project would be to work with something (that its kinda of my interest, not 100%). However, today I had a meeting with one of them saying that she thinks this project is not very promising and she wants me to have another main project that ive been reading some papers about and I have NO background and doesnt interest me at all but its something that relates the field from both of them.\nWhat should I do? I didnt think this was very nice but I didnt know how to act (we\u2019re still gonna have another meeting about it)\nConsidering that ive been questioning already if I did the right choice starting a PhD because I dont loooove research like many people and Im already researching something Im not passionate about.\nLet me know about experiences", "author": "Current-Road9437", "created": 1631332724, "retrieved": 1632844659, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "comments": {"hcef0f5": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pm08bh/professor_is_changing_my_main_project_and_i_hate/hcef0f5/", "text": "That's always a possibility.
