My lab agreed on one grad student who has the most animal work experience (we work with mice) to be counted as the one essential personnel. I am the designated backup to her in case she gets sick. Everyone else is not allowed to come in. In fact, the university will deactivate all people ID cards access who is not listed as essential including backups. In case a backup needs to step up, the PI has to call the university police department to activate my ID for access. For labs that maintain cell lines, they require complete shut down of those cell lines. They will not make any exception for those that work with cell lines.",
