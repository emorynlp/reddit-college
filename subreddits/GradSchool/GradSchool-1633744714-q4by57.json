  "title:": "Too Busy to Date in Grad School?",
  "text": "So, I met a guy at the end of the summer, prior to starting grad school and we went on a few pretty great dates. The  chemistry was definitely there. However, a week before the semester started, he became pretty distant and communication became less consistent. I reached out when classes started to check-in  and also ask what was up and if he would like to continue talking. He basically told me that he didn't know whether or not to reach out again because he's realized that he has a lot of time commitments (i.e. being a full time grad student + internship) and doesn't concretely know when he'll have any free time to connect again. However, after having this conversation, consistent communication has picked up again and he's fairly responsive.\n\nShould I believe him? Also, What challenges have you faced while dating as a grad student?",

And different programs and labs/research groups and people balance it differently, so it shouldn't surprise you he's not having the same exact experience as you. \n\nWhat are the other options? Not believing him? Why would you want to pursue something with someone you can't believe? Forcing it? Sorry, but that's not going to work out if he's not in it for whatever reason.",

It took up a lot of my time. \n\nSadly, when I tried to date, the guys I met wanted someone with more \u201cfree time\u201d and I just didn\u2019t have it.\n\nI had a couple hours of spare time (those are times I cry), but that was it. My weekends focused on assignments and end of the week tests. \n\nIt was all consuming in my opinion. \n\nYes. Trust him. I know what it\u2019s like.",

      "text": "While graduate school is usually a big transition, the fact is if he wanted to he would. When I was trying to graduate, I was dealing with an insane work schedule on top of emotional stress from my narcissistic advisor. And with all this I was flying out every 3 weeks to my LDR boyfriend's city (which is stressful, and financially difficult). None of it was fun, but I made it happen because it was worth it to me. My boyfriend had started a new high stakes job but he also visited me every 3 weeks. We'd only dated for a few months before he had to move for his job, so it wasn't too different from your situation.\n\nForget about grad school, before this I was dating an army officer and he would call me every single day no matter where he was, no matter how little sleep he had had and no matter how difficult it was to call a civilian from remote places. Meanwhile I've had men with cushy corporate jobs explain their lack of communication by telling me how their life is a \"battlefield\" because their mom had a cold. Point being, actions speak louder than words.\n\nBottomline - it's nice that he's being honest but the fact is if he wanted to he would. It's actually the best part of the day when you call up your partner after a long day. So take the hint. Texting takes 2 seconds, anyone can do that. So him now texting you isn't real effort.",

Usually the decision to not date is more like \"I don't want to date _you_\" as harsh as that sounds.",

A lot of people have mentioned that if someone wants to make it work they will, and I agree. You would just need to be willing to prioritize seeing this person over other things you could do in your limited free time. The little relationship-y things like a quick text to let them know you\u2019re thinking about them can keep you feeling connected in the meantime and take very little time or effort.",
