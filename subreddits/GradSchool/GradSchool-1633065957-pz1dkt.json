  "text": "I just started a program in chemistry this past month. I joined a research group and am starting to learn a lot about the lab and the work that they do. I am also TAing and taking classes. I am wondering if other graduate students in a similar situation are able to take some time off to recoup? I was hoping to visit my family over Christmas/New years, and possibly take a week and a half to go visit my family overseas in the summer. Before I ask my PI, I was hoping to get some advice on here about what other students have done. I know the time between classes is valuable time spent working on ones project, especially with oral exams coming up during the second year. I would just like to hear what other students did during their PhD, and what would be reasonable to ask my PI. Thanks in advance!",

They may go home for another week or so in the summer. \n\nI\u2019m not international, but I took a few shorter trips home prior to covid. I went home for Christmas last year for ~3 weeks since I didn\u2019t go anywhere during the year. We always check with our advisors to get approved to go on longer trips. I typically do still work some on vacation(although I obviously can\u2019t do lab work). The amount you\u2019re proposing sounds totally reasonable.",

When I was a MS student with an assistantship at a different university, my PI said \"alright, Monday (the, idk, 21st or something) will be our last meeting of the year! So-and-so, wrap project X up and get my that email by Wed, You There, send me the updates on Y, and congrats on finishing a tough semester! We'll reconvene on the 4th.\"\n\nObviously I can't swear that you'll have a week or more of vacation, at your particular university and in your particular lab, but I'd certainly expect it.",

It's like impossible to contact my advisor over winter break because he's bouncing around visiting family on his and his wife's side. I find it's really easy to just disappear for that month. \n\nI've taken a week here and there to travel during semesters too. I let my advisor know mostly so I don't get frantic texts because I'm not in lab meeting, but that still happened once anyway! For TAing, if you teach a class with a lot of other TAs, it's usually very easy to find someone to cover your classes in exchange for covering theirs later in the year. It's harder the fewer students there are TAing the class.",
