  "text": "Best news I've gotten this year. I cried as I was reading the email. I've applied for this program since last year and I haven't heard back from them for many months. I was almost certain that I won't be getting it due to the whole pandemic mess but I'm so glad I received this good news today. I've been dreaming for this opportunity for many years and it feels so unreal to have the letter of offer right in front of me. This is will also be my first study abroad experience and I'm really looking forward to it! \n\nWon't be commencing so soon due to the pandemic, any advice on how I can prepare myself for this?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind and supportive comments! It means so much to me especially to those who took the time and offered me some really great advice :') This community is great.",

It\u2019d be like doing a hard workout before swimming; you might just set yourself up to drown. \n\nSo loosely review stuff maybe, but most of all enjoy the last bit of time before you start the journey :)",

Here's a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/hssbde/im_such_a_failure/fydvnr4/) I wrote for somebody else, just to spare myself from reinventing the wheel here (which is in keeping with the Zettelkasten spirit, come to think of it):\n\n> I've been struggling to complete my thesis for a long time. About a month ago, I learned about the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) method and wish somebody would've told me about it sooner. So, now I'm telling you about it. It's weird and took me a long time to wrap my head around it, but it directly addresses a lot of the problems I was having.\n\n> If you check it out and have the kind of \"holy shit this sounds like exactly what I need\" reaction I did, then PM me and I'll try to give you a boost up to my level of understanding of how to actually _do_ it. (I've invested the last month meticulously studying the methodology because it was so alien to any other workflow I'd ever seen. I still have more to learn, but at least I can offer some simplified \"just do this, then this, then this\" instructions so you can get started before you properly figure it out, share my notes from [a book about the Zettelkasten method](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y), tell you about some of [the](https://www.zotero.org/) [software](https://obsidian.md/) [I've](https://gingko.io/) [used](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), etc.)\n\nIf you learn the Zettelkasten method and start making your own before you go, then I imagine you'll be a *very* happy camper indeed. \n\nGood luck to you!",

                      "text": "I'm so happy you're finding it worthwhile and exciting!\n\nWhen/if you get the book I recommended, here's the suggestion I wish I'd been given: read it in three passes.\n\n1. Set a timer for 1 hour and skim the entire book. Or give yourself exactly 1 day. Whatever you decide, make it short. Don't worry *at all* about fully grasping things during this pass. You don't even have to skim it from front to back, if you feel any inclination to deviate from that. Jump around as much as you like. If you have extra time, then re-skim it again as fast as you can until the time limit is up. (The real point of the time limit is just to keep you in skimming mode instead of reading mode. So if you feel like you absolutely need to go over the time limit, then fine. But stay out of reading mode. Stay in skimming mode.)\n\n2. Now you get to read it properly from front to back. Highlight and/or make fleeting notes on things you learn that you find interesting. Don't analyze or evaluate what \"deserves\" to be highlighted/noted. Just go with your gut and don't worry about it. If you can bias your gut toward being selective, then great, but if you catch yourself worrying about it then just mark whatever passage you're deliberating and move on. Aim to keep 100% of your brainpower focused on taking in and comprehending the content.\n\n3. Go back through those quick and dirty highlights/notes you took. Decide which ones deserve to be developed into permanent notes in your Zettelkasten, then do so. Don't overlook how I worded that: don't do the developing until you are done with the judging. And remember: if you don't *actually* develop the fleeting notes/highlights (sidenote: highlights are actually a type of fleeting note, he mentions at one point toward the beginning), then they are pretty much a waste of time. In a nutshell, they're worthless if you don't and invaluable if you do.\n\nOkay, now for the explanation.\n\nThe first reason for doing it this way is to gain glean what the book is about and maybe pick up the gist of what some sections are saying. This way, when you *properly* read it, you'll already be able to start making connections and will therefore by learning it better.\n\nThe second reason for doing it this way is to make it so that you don't have to switch between reading mode, judging mode, and writing mode. These are completely different activities that require completely different mindsets. So, when you try to do these activities at the same time, all you're actually doing is constantly interrupting your own flow.\n\nThe third reason for doing it this way is speed. It might seem like this would be slower than just reading and taking notes the way you probably/possibly were going to do. That approach might _feel_ faster in the moment, but setting up a conceptual skeleton and eliminating the mode-switching will ultimately prove to be _actually_ much more efficient.\n\nYou can still develop a fantastic understand and develop Zettelkasten-style notes without doing it the way I described. However, I think the method I described will let you learn better, will save you tons of time and improve the quality of your Zettelkasten by letting you be more selective about which notes you actually need (because you'll have the bird's eye view in the back of your head, so you won't need to waste time writing every note that you could _possibly_ need to understand later concepts), and \u2013 in the long run \u2013 leave you with a higher quality Zettelkasten precisely because you'll have been so much more selective (so your Zettelkasten will have a higher percentage of critical insights).\n\nAlso, please bear in mind that I write this post having read 70% of the book because I've been meticulously taking high-quality notes all along the way. All the pitfalls I described in my description and explanation of the three passes are pitfalls that I believe cost me a lot of time without compromising the quality of my notes or understanding. Like I said at the beginning, the unsolicited advice I'm thrusting at you now is what I wish somebody had told me. It occurs to me now that I also could've been practicing the three-pass method I described this whole time. Ugh.\n\nSo, of course there's a chance that there will be something in the remaining 30% that will completely upend all this. I'm also planning to read How to Read a Book after this, which is almost certain to amend the approach I'm recommending now. All of this is to say that you shouldn't take what I'm saying as gospel. Take it as the best advice I can currently offer, based entirely on what I've learned so far from tackling How to Take Smart Notes without the benefit of having read How to Take Smart Notes before doing so. I did my best after absorbing what I could from scouring the web like you're doing now, but the book is unsurprisingly much more instructive, informative, detailed, clear, and so on.\n\nSorry if this comment comes off as commanding, arrogant, or presumptuous. I hope it doesn't, but I can see how it might by the very nature of being unsolicited advice. But yeah, like I've said twice now, I wish that somebody had told me this, and *that's* why I'm telling you.\n\nIn any case, it's awesome that you also see something fascinating and game-changing in the Zettelkasten method! I hope you *continue* to be as excited about it as I am!",

With the whole pandemic situation everything is stressful enough as it is! I know it's tempting to get started working ASAP but enjoy some time off.\n2. Review statistics. It's important for all fields, but especially for immunology. Even having a general idea of stats (i.e. regression, ANOVAs, etc.) can come in handy at the beginning of your program.\n3. If you have time, learn how to use R and/or Python proficiently (if you have not done so already). Knowing how to use them (and use them well) makes analyzing data so much easier. Following up on this, become more familiar with Excel if you have time. I was surprised how many things I didn't know Excel could do before I was forced to learn the ins and outs of it for the lab I work in.",

Most week days, for a couple of hours, I\u2019d just go to a coffee shop and relax and read without pressure.\n\nOne of those classes was taught by my advisors so I wanted to make a good impression the first semester. I aced one of her tests with the highest score in the class and got A\u2019s in both classes while balancing a lab TAship and a new girlfriend. Starting out with a 4.0 in grad school makes applying for funding so much easier.\n\nThen my advisor left and the rest of my PhD was an obstacle course but you know, that first semester was great.",

There's no need to burn yourself out before even arriving on campus, and I'd recommend taking this opportunity to relax, spend time with family, travel, etc.   \n\n\nIf you do want to do something, I would recommend is starting the conversation about first year/rotation projects. That might give you more of a focus than just trying to cover a broad field of study. Another idea is to look at recent papers from your perspective mentors and any reviews that mention them (the *Current Opinions in* review series are pretty approachable and give a good idea of the field, if there's an issue that's relevant for your interests).   \n\n\nTransitioning from undergrad to a PhD program depends a lot on the person, but lots manage it successfully. A lot of the difference relies upon how much research you were involved with as an undergrad and how much coursework is required by your program, so without knowing that it's hard to say what exactly your experience will be like.    \n\n\nFinally, fwiw, I'd be happy to talk shop/ideas as well if it would be relevant for you. I'm currently working on projects regarding the functional and evolutionary genomics of immune variation.",
