I cried as I was reading the email. I've applied for this program since last year and I haven't heard back from them for many months. I was almost certain that I won't be getting it due to the whole pandemic mess but I'm so glad I received this good news today. I've been dreaming for this opportunity for many years and it feels so unreal to have the letter of offer right in front of me. This is will also be my first study abroad experience and I'm really looking forward to it! \n\nWon't be commencing so soon due to the pandemic, any advice on how I can prepare myself for this?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the kind and supportive comments!

That's awesome!\n\nYou asked for how you can prepare, so I'll share something with you that I wish somebody had told me about: Zettelkasten. Here's a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/hssbde/im_such_a_failure/fydvnr4/) I wrote for somebody else, just to spare myself from reinventing the wheel here (which is in keeping with the Zettelkasten spirit, come to think of it):\n\n> I've been struggling to complete my thesis for a long time. About a month ago, I learned about the [Zettelkasten](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) method and wish somebody would've told me about it sooner. So, now I'm telling you about it. It's weird and took me a long time to wrap my head around it, but it directly addresses a lot of the problems I was having.\n\n> If you check it out and have the kind of \"holy shit this sounds like exactly what I need\" reaction I did, then PM me and I'll try to give you a boost up to my level of understanding of how to actually _do_ it. (I've invested the last month meticulously studying the methodology because it was so alien to any other workflow I'd ever seen. I still have more to learn, but at least I can offer some simplified \"just do this, then this, then this\" instructions so you can get started before you properly figure it out, share my notes from [a book about the Zettelkasten method](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y), tell you about some of [the](https://www.zotero.org/) [software](https://obsidian.md/) [I've](https://gingko.io/) [used](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview), etc.)\n\nIf you learn the Zettelkasten method and start making your own before you go, then I imagine you'll be a *very* happy camper indeed. \n\nGood luck to you!", "author": "SquareBottle", "created": 1595459845, "upvotes": 3}, "fyx1o5h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hvwupf/i_received_a_fullyfunded_phd_offer/fyx1o5h/", "text": "Congrats!!", "author": "nonintellect", "created": 1595454582, "upvotes": 2}, "fyx0zkf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hvwupf/i_received_a_fullyfunded_phd_offer/fyx0zkf/", "text": "First off...CONGRATS!!!! \n\nSecond off, I haven't read through all the replies on here, so forgive me if these things have already been said, but my recommendations are:\n\n1. Relax. With the whole pandemic situation everything is stressful enough as it is! I know it's tempting to get started working ASAP but enjoy some time off.\n2. Review statistics. It's important for all fields, but especially for immunology. Even having a general idea of stats (i.e. regression, ANOVAs, etc.) can come in handy at the beginning of your program.\n3. If you have time, learn how to use R and/or Python proficiently (if you have not done so already). Knowing how to use them (and use them well) makes analyzing data so much easier. Following up on this, become more familiar with Excel if you have time.
