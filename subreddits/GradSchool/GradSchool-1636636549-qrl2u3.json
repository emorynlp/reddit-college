  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m what we call a \u00ab\u00a0former gifted child\u00a0\u00bb. During all middle and high school, I never really worked and graduated with honors. But during college, I realized that I didn\u2019t know how to study, and now I barely get my years.\nI somehow managed to get my law degree (thanks to Covid !), and I\u2019m now in master. (Still in law)\n\nThe thing is, I feel like I\u2019m gonna give up, I have no idea of how to study, I can barely focus, and I had my first grade which is really bad, 8/20..\nI can\u2019t also learn things (each courses have like around 100 pages to learn so imagine..) because every time I\u2019m in front of my lessons, it doesn\u2019t seem logical to me, or I end up thinking about 4738271629 things because my brain is constantly overthinking everything (for instance while trying to work for an exam I can think about why there\u2019s no McDonald\u2019s on the side of highways\u2026)\n\nHow can I learn how to study, when I\u2019ve never did it in my entire life ?\n\nThanks you :)",

      "text": "You can set small goals. I have adhd and that helps me a lot. Sometimes I can\u2019t focus on anything and sometimes I get hyper focused. So I try respecting myself and setting realistic goals and sometimes rewarding myself with small things so I can relax. \n\nYou might be still a very intelligent person experiencing burnout. So self care is always important. Setting a healthy schedule and exercising helps with focusing a lot. \n\nBut that\u2019s my main advice: realistic goals. We often want to do way more and when we fail the disappointment with ourselves makes everything worse.\n\nBut remember that discipline is something difficult (at least for me) to develop and keep. So it won\u2019t happen over night. It\u2019s a work in progress forever and needs patience. And keep in mind that every progress is a progress still.",

With start and end times for each subject for each single day, lunch breaks, what practice tasks to do, what pages to read etc. \n\nThat's no small task btw, working out the schedule for one month alone took me about a full day by itself, since you have to got though the material and make sensible estimations for what takes how much time",

I recommend that during/after a lecture/module, brainstorm some questions that you think might be on the exam based on that material. Keep a list with the answers hidden (flashcards, toggle lists on Notion, etc.) and review them often. For example, I review the previous questions before starting/attending the next chapter/lecture. I learned this from a classmate and it's helped me a lot.",

A good study tip is to see the material more often, across multiple days. It helps your learn the material better, instead of one long study session. I do this when I need to study. Learn how to learn, and work with your brain. I also was someone who rarely needed to work- even until graduating with my BA. Now I'm in a masters + 30 program and I had to learn how to study hahaha.",

      "text": "Hi! ADHD and severe Learning disabilities here. Sounds like you just need to hack you brain a little on what works best for you. I can relate to this as I recently just had to figure out how to properly study and what everyone was giving me advice on did not work. This may not work for you since everyone is different but you could try! \n\n1. If you\u2019re a visual person- white boards/notes on iPads are super helpful. I\u2019ve literally created my entire room into pretty much a giant whiteboard with the wall adhesive they have on Amazon.\n\n2. Buy a figiter. Sounds stupid but if your brain needs something to focus on since it\u2019s used to working in four different directions. keep it busy! \n\n3. Background music. Trying different focus music but turning it almost the entire way down where you can\u2019t hear it also helps with your brain trying to figure out what to focus on. I thought this was weird but my therapist has a background in music therapy and it works! There are songs that have been processed in 8d and 16d, that some say help those either with ADHD or need support with focus.  You can go to youtube and put 8d or 16d in the search engine. \n\n4. Check out aliabdaal on YouTube- great study methods explained. \n\n5. Where you study will make a huge difference. Try studying in different places throughout the week! \n\n6. Turn that phone on silent or get a application blocking app! I also through mine in a different room. \n\n7. Also if you\u2019re a procrastinator- that\u2019s okay just utilize those times of hyper focus efficiently and manage your time. Break down your large tasks into small sections and start with the hardest one first. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions feel free to message me. (:",
