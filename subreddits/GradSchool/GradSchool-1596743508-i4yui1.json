I wasn't too pissed tbh, and I actually used this time to take a much needed break. \n\nYesterday they got back to me, and apparently what happened was IT did something to reboot all the computers on campus, and somehow something went wrong for my computer, which meant that it went into \"don't touch me I'm scared\" mode, and they told me the only way to fix it is to reformat my computer and wipe the hard drives clean so it can do a clean restart.\n\nThey haven't done it yet, because they're waiting for my ok to go ahead and wipe everything, but I can't bring myself to do it, because I'd lose 2 years' worth of work and basically have to start from scratch. \n\nI already know people are gonna say \"why didn't you back up your files,\" and in hindsight I definitely should've done it, but it just never crossed my mind (funny thing is, on my to do list, I actually have \"upload xyz files to Google drive\" scheduled for next Wednesday). I have some stuff backed up, like a couple graphs and python files here and there, but a large chunk of my work will definitely be lost.\n\nThe projects that I was working on were almost done, but now it seems like I'll have to start all over again. I don't know how to feel or what to do right now. Has anyone experienced similar issues before?\n\nPSA: ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR FILES!\n\nEdit: The reason I gave it to the IT dept. and didn't try to fix it on my own is because we're not allowed to mess with the computers without their permission.\n\nUpdate: The IT dept. at my school is very overworked and understaffed right now, so I have 2 options. I can either let them \"try\" to recover the data that I have, and have the computer back in a couple months (wtf), or I could just let them wipe everything clean and have it back in a week before school starts again. Honestly, I'm leaning towards the latter, since I'm really short on time on a couple projects atm, and although it sucks, I can definitely get most of what I need back since me and my adviser have the core of what we need saved (thank God). I really would rather not go through this, but I can't go a couple months without using that computer for my research. Now excuse me while I go get some intoxicants of my choice to end the week off :)", "author": "ZachTheYek", "created": 1596743508, "retrieved": 1632845556, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 469, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g17ahxp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/i4yui1/i_lost_2_years_worth_of_research_because_i_didnt/g17ahxp/", "text": "OP don't format your drive until you get that data back.

From looking at the ifixit guide for the imax (2019) I know we wouldn't have done that much work on a machine to remove the hard drive. Ask IT if there is Apple care for the machine and if so use it to have Apple service the machine. IF you can remove the hard drive (it isn't soldered which it might be) and IF filevault isn't turned on you should be able to recover the data barring a mechanical failure\n2. You many want to try and see if there is an IT policy regarding data storage, if there is a policy that mandates cloud storage and you aren't using it they may push back.\n3. Ask to escalate to a Tier 2 or 3 engineer to look at the machine and can spend more time on it. If you can't escalate through IT channels escalate through academic channels. IT in Higher ed is to support the faculty and researchers so a request from a senior member on the academic side will be given a lot of weight unless the request is completely unreasonable. It sounds like in this situation since there is the possibility of losing 2 years worth of data some more time spent from IT would be good. I did deal with this situation from a faculty member who lost 20 years of data but it was a mechanical failure of the drive (they knocked it over) and they didn't have anything backed up so they lost everything. Their department and IT was not willing to spend money on a data recovery service (which are really expensive if recovering from hardware damage, software recovery is pretty cheap)\n\nPersonal anecdote. While in undergrad I lost around 6 months of working during my last semester during portfolio review (art degree) and had to rebuilt most of it from scratch. I had some final cuts saved on DVD and that was it. Now all my data is backed up in 2 different cloud providers, 3 way mirror on my local machine and one of the cloud providers backs up automatically to a local NAS that has a pair of redundant hard drives in it. Both cloud providers auto version my documents, code is also sent to visual studio online code repository and local GIT repository so I have that handled as well. I am in grad school now and I'm not going to watch my data disappear like last time. I will say my solution is actually pretty cheap (about $25 a month for both cloud services) and is almost fully automated which is the other important part.

Right now, that's you. The IT department of your school did a very bad job of wording their email to you (causing your brain to melt from panic), or they're just completely inept (because plugging the drive into another computer to get the data is extremely basic).\n\nIn a nutshell\u2026\n\n**Doesn't boot \u2260 Data is lost.**\n\nSince you're dealing with macs, you can go to the nearest Apple store and ask them to help you get the data. From the sound of it, you do *not* need \"data recovery.\" That's for when the hard drive is actually damaged, the data is actually corrupted, or the files are actually deleted. In your case, it sounds like all that happened was a clumsy update pushed by your IT department made it so that your computer won't boot anymore. Messing up the files your computer needs to boot is not the same as ruining the hard drive, nor does it mean the rest of the files on the drive were affected at all. Indeed, this is why the IT department wants to just format the drives instead of replace them.\n\nAnyway, like I said, you (very probably) don't need what is referred to as \"data recovery.\" What you need to tell them is that the computer won't boot and you need help getting the files off. If you can, bring an external hard drive to make it easy for them. You might be able to just buy one while you're there, but they might not have it in stock. If your data doesn't take up a ton of space, then you can probably just have them upload to your Google Drive account.\n\n**Another option:** Buy an external hard drive kit, remove the drives from the computer (or have someone do this for you), stick them in the kit, then connect to any mac. Get the data you need. Then, return the hard drives to the computer.\n\nThis is not a difficult procedure at all! External hard drive kits might sound complicated, but it's no exaggeration to describe them as being no more difficult than \"Put the round peg in the round hole and the square peg in the square hole.\" Seriously, there are two wires that will connect from the kit to the drive, and you can just look at the shape of the connectors to see where they connect. Piece of cake!\n\n**The bottom line is that it sounds like your data can be _easily_ recovered.** Hell, if you happen to live in NYC and want help or hand-holding, then I'll come do it for/with you!

As what has already been said, you can recover data from a hard drive. If it's incredibly important, don't format it. Try to recover it before giving up. \n\n4. If you spill water on electronics, remove any power cables and batteries. Dry it off as best as you can and then take a vacuum to it. Let it dry out for as long as you can (at least 24 hours)  to make sure that any residual water dries.

It becomes a little bit more complicated but can be done.\n\n1. Don't let them reformat anything. They don't need to do this at all. Tell them to take your hard drive out and give it to you.\n2. They can replace your hard drive with a new one or wait till you have copied everything off the drive first.\n3. Buy or borrow a hard drive enclosure, they are cheap. Like 10-20 bucks on Amazon.\n4.
