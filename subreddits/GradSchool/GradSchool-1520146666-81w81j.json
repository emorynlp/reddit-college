The alcohol expert came to help out my mentor and I develop a model of co-use since we hadnt had experience with alcohol SA, only other drugs of abuse. And the undergrad that I mentored was the absolute best, so I argued for him to have authorship (even though that's not traditional for this type or research).",

Beyond this, I'm also asking general questions about how music is constructed by metal bands, how harmony and voice leading practices develop in extreme metal more broadly, and how genre(s) is/are developed musically.\n\n",

                  "text": "Oh man that is fascinating. I'd be interested to see if there was any similarity between the formation of extreme metal and jazz subgenres. One of the strong themes of the bands I have been in has been avoiding cliche. I have often thought that some very extreme types of metal (eg Behold the Arctopus, Sunn o) are kind of just the natural conclusion when you go to any lengths to avoid cliche within a particular idiom.

I don't know enough in detail about jazz to comment meaningfully on how jazz genres develop, but the idea of avoiding clich\u00e9 is an interesting one and pretty relevant I think. There's also the idea of a 'race for harder and faster' in the 80s and 90s that influences the formation of metal subgenres, especially as bands try to be more extreme than each other.",
