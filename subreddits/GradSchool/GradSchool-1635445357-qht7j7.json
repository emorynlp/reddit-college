  "title:": "How to handle switching grad programs and no letter of rec from PI in statement of purpose",
  "text": "I've decided to try grad school again after 3 horrific semesters. I developed a lot of skills and on paper I'm a very competitive applicant for another program. \n\nMy former PI really dislikes me, the reason for which is...pretty unethical. I will not be asking them to write a letter of rec. I have someone else in the department to write me one instead. \n\nI'm assuming that I should include something in the SOP about this. Do I just say a sentence about it not being a good fit and move on?",
