I am also a first gen and POC. I would spend all day and night working on school assignments and research. Even papers many other students would barely take time on, I felt I had to put in extra work to prove myself. All that time I put into school and work, I took away from being with my loved ones. Now one has passed away and I can't ever get that back.\n\nIt's been very difficult to cope, but I am now finally starting to feel better about myself. But it is definitely difficult balancing family and school/career. Now that I am trying to spend more time with family, I also feel guilty for continuing to pursue my studies. I deferred enrollment to a PhD program because of this guilt, I am not as motivated (or even happy) as I once was, and I keep questioning if this path is even right for me anymore. \n\nSome advice when starting your PhD, is to try to find a faculty mentor (or some other form of support) that might understand these difficulties. I am part of a fellowship program that supports minority students, and one faculty mentor has had similar difficulty with family balance. She has been a great person to open up to, AND I just recently learned she got a new position where she can be closer to family. Another faculty member has also helped a great amount. I just had to be honest and open up and she tried helping me look at my options realistically. I'm definitely not 100% anymore, but I'm grateful for these people who have helped. \n\nI think we need more people like you in academia and in research positions, those who understand these difficulties, to create a better space for future scholars and students from different backgrounds who can feel supported in their endeavors. Prior to beginning grad school, I asked many professors for tips on how I can prepare in the summer prior to grad school. Most told me \"spend time with family or do something fun. Because you won't be seeing them the next X years\". I took this very literally, thinking it would be irresponsible to spend time with family once grad school started. Not an OK mindset. As humans, I think we all work better (and are more happy!!) when we balance our time and spend time with those we love. \n\nCongrats so far on all of your accomplishments. And again, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure your godfather and family are very proud of you!!! Thank you so much for sharing this. It feels nice to know I am at least not alone.

As a queer person of colour in academia (tenure track) - I get some of the pressures you're speaking about. I think the key to success in academia is finding a good work-life balance. There doesn't have to be an incompatibility between research, publishing, and having a good family life with plenty of leisure. \n\nFor me, I work no more than 45 hours per week and usually stick to a 8-5 schedule except during grant season. I used to work many more in industry as a consultant. A lot of it is about being developing efficiency, breaking your work down to small pieces and checking it off throughout the day. If you're in the sciences as well, make sure you are collaborating to get your publications. My postdoc mentor (also another POC scientist) told me that you should be part of at least 3 seperate teams at any given point - and make small but meaningful contributions as co-author as much as you can. This advice has helped me get my numbers up (typically 10+ papers per year), and also offer opportunities to my co-authors in the 1-2 first author papers that I lead each year. \n\nYou definitely should take time off for vacation, but I think the idea that you would get the summer and winter breaks off might be unrealistic and you wouldn't expect that in any other industry. This might not apply to you, but for me, it's important to make specific plans with leisure to make sure it is high impact (scheduling dates with my partner, going to concerts, weekend trips, playing sports, ski trips, etc).
