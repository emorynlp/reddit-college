I was in grad school almost 10 years and have been out of it for a whole year and only now am I getting published. I'm happy, but also *meh*. My masters research was horrible and after my paper from it got rejected 3 times I gave up. I vowed to do better research for my phd but it took me forever to figure out the research questions, then I lost motivation, then by the time I regained my focus on the dissertation I just wanted to get it over with and wrote more of a holistic document rather than a collection of publication-ready papers. That meant I had to wholly re-write my chapters after graduating to submit them for publication. Then more rejections. Until today. I have another paper in review and a 3rd I'm still writing, but at this rate I might be looking at another year or two for them if they keep getting rejected. I never post on facebook but I had always imagined I would drop a link to the paper for friends. At this point though I'm just not that excited about it anymore and am too humbled by the experience to do anything like boasting. I have no idea how other people manage to publish so frequently. Anyways, if publishing is getting you down, just know it could be worse.", "author": "bicepsion", "created": 1579910557, "retrieved": 1632953765, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 458, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ffqym1u": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/etizxf/after_9_years_in_grad_school_a_whole_year_postphd/ffqym1u/", "text": "Just saw this.

It's just that the field is unforgiving and nobody knows who I am... but if you believe in yourself, you should never give up! Don't let anyone else decide what you can and cannot do.
