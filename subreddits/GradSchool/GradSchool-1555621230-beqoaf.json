They wait 15 minutes after the sessions are supposed to start and if 4 grad students aren't present after that, then they cancel it.

Rates and severity of mental illness in higher education are rapidly rising and we don't have the resources to keep up. Session limits are not to screw anyone over, it's to try and allow us to provide care to as many people as we can. It is by no means a perfect solution.\n\nNot that it's anyone responsibility - especially those already struggling - but people should make this frustration not known to their counseling center (trust me, we know) but to their administrations.
