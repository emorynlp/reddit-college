  "text": "Great. That is taking SUCH good care of our mental health.\n\nResources are available where I can talk to a trainee psychologist about how frustrating and miserable my life is, for a maximum of six sessions, and then afterward I am going to feel so much better that the thought of stepping out in front of a bus will never cross my mind again no matter how much my department and advisor screw around with my funding, future, and sanity.\n\nBut we have posters up on the walls for the counseling center, so everything is OK now and we are doing a great job addressing the issue of graduate student mental health.\n\n**Edit:** Not hating on the counseling centers here, they do the best they can. My complaint is with faculty/departments that think they're \"addressing the issue graduate student mental health\" by putting up posters for the counseling center, instead of addressing that the way the treat us CAUSES a lot of the problems. \"Sure I cut your arm off with a chainsaw, but I told you that we have a cupboard with bandaids...\"",

Well we have a huge wait list for people trying to get in to see counselors so maybe in a few months someone will be available to see you.\"\n\nThen, an even bigger joke is the fact that they have these group counseling sessions for grad students, but if less than 4 people show up to a session then they cancel the session. They wait 15 minutes after the sessions are supposed to start and if 4 grad students aren't present after that, then they cancel it. So you waste your time going there and waiting for people to possibly show up, while a counselor sits on her computer because she doesn't want to help the people that are there unless she feels it's worth her time and effort.\n\nAlright sorry, I'm done ranting. It's been a stressful week and I think I need sleep.",

It disappoints me that the number of students at my university is cited as the reason, but I feel that it just means the university isn't willing to hire enough staff to serve the mental health needs of the campus.",

At large, graduate student mental health and graduate culture are definitely messed up.\n\nBut being a doctoral student in psychology, having spent almost all my training in college counseling centers, it's my experience that most of those in college counseling centers do care. Rates and severity of mental illness in higher education are rapidly rising and we don't have the resources to keep up. Session limits are not to screw anyone over, it's to try and allow us to provide care to as many people as we can. It is by no means a perfect solution.\n\nNot that it's anyone responsibility - especially those already struggling - but people should make this frustration not known to their counseling center (trust me, we know) but to their administrations. Many counseling centers are fighting for more resources to help burned-out counselors help a burned-out student body. The only people who can give those - and often withhold them - are administration.",

So it really depends on the profession those trainees are working towards unfortunately.\n\nWhat? No. \n\nCounseling Psych PhD student here who is currently doing a practicum at a college counseling center (and also works in an inpatient mental health facility with severe mental illness). \n\n1. (Virtually) All mental health professionals treat anxiety and depression. Indeed, to bill insurance, you MUST have a DSM diagnosis. \n\n2. Counseling Centers absolutely deal with anxiety and depression. I would say that it is 90% of what I see in that setting (in my inpatient setting, we have a lot more diversity of diagnoses). \n\n3. Counseling Psychologists are licensed exactly the same way Clinical Psychologists are licensed-- as psychologist. At the end of everything you're a licensed psychologist. That means you ABSOLUTELY have to be able to handle common shit like anxiety and depression. I can't imagine how little you think of your fellow psychologists if you think that is outside of our scope. (We also meet the exact same APA accreditation requirements as clinical psych.)\n\nThere are absolutely situations where is warranted to refer someone to a community provider. Counseling Centers are typically a short term therapy model, so, for example, someone who comes in with adequate insurance and a plan to see a therapist weekly over the long term is probably not a good fit. If someone is actively psychotic, they might need a more intensive program than what is typically offered on campus. Or if the waitlist is hella long, I might talk to someone about community providers who are current accepting clients, so students don't have to wait three months for a first appointment when their problem is happening NOW. But people are not deferring anyone with any mental health issues; that would make our services useless. \n\nI obviously cannot speak for all schools, but I am familiar with procedures at the school where I am getting my PhD and the school where I am a therapist. \n\nTl;dr: This is misinformation.",

Anyone who wants to work as a therapist works with diagnosable mental illness; it's necessary if you are going to bill insurance. \n\nI work closely with a number of Master's level clinicians in a variety of settings. They do all the stuff. The difference between a Master's level clinician and a psychologist (who works in a clinical setting) isn't in the therapy they do, it's all the other stuff on top of therapy (e.g. psychological assessment, supervision of future psychologists, research background). \n\nIf this was what was being said, I actually think it's borderline dangerous to suggest that LMHCs/LPCs (and future LMHCs/LPCs) don't work with issues like anxiety and depression, as it can discourage folks to seek out fully competent clinicians who are more accessible. In many areas, access to mental health is super limited, and many psychologists really just do assessment work. Additionally, psychologists are typically more expensive per session (meaning more expensive copays as well), which can create artificial financial barriers for folks who think they need someone with a PhD to manage anxiety. \n\nThis isn't to minimize the impact of either anxiety or depression. More, it is to make it clear that this is within the scope of any competent mental health practitioner.",

In the final year of training we do a year-long internship (usually not affiliated your program - like a medical residency) of full time clinical work where you further develop your competence to act as an independent psychologist. We definitely learn to deal with difficult cases, but you have to learn basic therapy skills first. \n\nI don\u2019t want to undermine the competence of therapists in university clinics.

I was able to find a therapist in the community who offers a student rate. It's annoying that my university didn't offer more on campus, but I ended up very happy with the therapist I found. Is there anyone in your community who offers a student rate or sliding scale for payment? That way you won't have to deal with the six session maximum.",

      "text": "In an ideal world, the student counseling center would be for short-term management of less severe situations, with the counselor referring people out into the community if someone else seemed like a better fit - a psychiatrist, or a long-term therapist for example, who was low cost or did sliding scale. A provider at a university hospital clinic can be much cheaper. Speaking from my own experiences, I've found the session limits pretty flexible. I did have to pay after six sessions, I think, but I was seen much more than six times over the course of about five years (I would guess 20 times).\n\nBut, that's not addressing the bigger question, which is that counseling services can't fix adviser bullshit or funding scarcity or the generally broken system. That reflects the wider world, though. How does therapy fix my financial problems? It doesn't. How can therapy get my boss to stop dropping me from projects? It can't. It can give you the tools you need to make changes in your life, but it's not a magic wand. Academia doesn't want anyone getting a hold of the magic wand.",
