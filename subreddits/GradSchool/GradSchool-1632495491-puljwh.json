  "title:": "Which GRE score (AWA 4.0 vs 5.5) should I send for Social Science?",
  "text": "Hi, I am seriously torn between two scores for PhD programs in Social Science.\n\nI've taken two exams so far, and received\n\n1st Attempt: V:156 (72 percentile) Q:156 (59 percentile) W:4.0 (55 percentile)\n\n2nd Attempt: V:153 (59 percentile) Q:155 (55 percentile) W:5.5 (98 percentile)\n\nGiven the characteristics of Social Science, particularly Psychology, I assume the committee is more concerned with Verbal and Writing than Quant score. Thankfully, most schools I'm applying to have shifted GRE to optional, but still considering sending one in case.",

      "text": "A lot of schools don't care about your GRE at all, many require it just because it's been required in the past. Your undergraduate GPA, references, and connections mean a lot more. \n\nHowever, for your case, I would suggest using the 2nd attempt. While the percentiles are significantly different, there is only a 3 point difference on the verbal and a 1 point difference on the quant. Meanwhile, the written portion represents a significant difference.",

I'm in Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Science and my adviser cares way more about people's Quant scores. I know social psychology professors in the department who are the opposite, and I know ones who don't care at all.",
