Troubles sleeping - either insomnia, particularly even after taking sleeping pills, or waking up throughout the night. \n\n2. Having achy and sore muscles \u2013 this is typically more than the usual back/trap pain and elbow/wrist pain associated with extensive laptop use. For example, my legs get very lethargic when I am stressed, even after a good night sleep. \n\n3. Feeling abnormally warm \u2013 my body temperature is consistently higher. \n\n4. Feeling exhausted and lethargic during the day even after a good sleep\n\n5. Heart palpitations that do not seem to be linked to anything \n\n6. Craving sugar or alcohol \u2013 not just liking or desiring these things, but legit craving them\n\n7. Increased anxiety that typically is not socially motivated: for example, during high times of stress I am more likely to check to see if my oven is on before leaving the house even if I know it\u2019s off, but personally, I do not feel more anxious around other people (I am also more of an extravert).\n\n8. Increased irritability \n\n9. Changes in appetite \u2013 a few years ago, my appetite went up when I was stressed, but now it decreases. However, in general, I will engage in more \u201cemotional\u201d eating when stressed.\n\nEdit. 10. Sometimes my left eye will twitch. \n\nCan you all relate? Are there any physical signs that you experience that signal to you that you may be stressed even when your mind doesn\u2019t register it? Got any tips for self-care withina academia?", "author": "Skinnrad", "created": 1550693101, "retrieved": 1632845957, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"egypebc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/asszna/grad_students_have_to_listen_to_our_bodies_during/egypebc/", "text": "I'm in my first semester of grad school (getting my master's in December graduating early) and then going onto a PhD program (hopefully).

I was absolutely terrified; they almost exactly mimic a stroke, and I had a few hours in my life where I thought I would never be able to feel or use my left arm again due to having a stroke in my early 20s. Myself and my family have no history of any sort of migraine, so my neurologist asked for details about my everyday life. After a cathartic venting session, he said he was certain it was an extreme reaction to stress, and that I cannot afford to continue working as I had been.\n\nYou are so right about the \"go-go-go\" mentality. The weirdest part of the whole experience is that I was not even the most stressed out person I knew; I was only one year into a Masters! I think it's important to realize that everybody handles stress differently, and everyone's \"too much\" threshold is different. It took me a while to realize that I could not keep up with my coworkers, but my work wasn't worth sacrificing my health over.
