  "text": "Hey, guys. I'm currently undergrad, but I'm still in this sub because I plan on pursuing a PhD.\n\nAnyways, I see a lot of chatting about research and what not, which is why I'm here.\n\nI've approached two departments in hopes of getting an advisor for a research project I'm working on... Specifically an econ and finance research professor and a machine learning research professor.\n\nMy project centers around prediction models for investments in live markets using machine learning advanced data analysis.\n\nMy question is, what should I expect for this project? The two professors are deliberating over accepting me, but they both sounded interested and on board.\n\nI've been advised to fill out a research grant application for the next school year, but my concern is that it's my senior year and I don't know if I'll be able to complete my research in such a short time.\n\nI do plan on getting my master's, but I wasn't planning on getting that at my current school.\n\nI'm lost and overwhelmed and need some guidance into what to expect. My econ advisor mentioned goals to publication and I didn't even expect that, I just wanted to program this cool thing.",

They're asking you to bring your own funding because they want to work with you (as you're excited about the topic) but if you bring your own funding then you can dedicate more of your time on this. \n3. Publication can come later.  Don't worry about that.\n\n>I've approached two departments in hopes of getting an advisor for a research project I'm working on... Specifically an econ and finance research professor and a machine learning research professor.\n\nSounds like you're just talking about doing a senior thesis?  Then just keep it at that.  If you don't want to get your master's at your current institution then don't.  It sounds like those professors think you're interested in grad school and working with them.  You said you plan on pursuing a PhD so just do your senior thesis and apply for a PhD at the same time (or a masters, whatever step you want next).  \n\n>My question is, what should I expect for this project? The two professors are deliberating over accepting me, but they both sounded interested and on board.\n\nSounds like there's different levels of expectations.  Probably communicating that you're only looking for an advisor for your senior thesis is probably a good idea...\n\n>My project centers around prediction models for investments in live markets using machine learning advanced data analysis.\n\nNot my area of research but as one of my side projects I've been building one myself as well.  The literature in this area is a crapshoot as a lot of people are using concepts of Technical Analysis as the basis of their ML algorithm whereas others are trying to use ML to help with Fundamental Analysis.  If climate change research has taught me anything, historic data doesn't predict the future (aka \"Stationarity is Dead\" paper), so I'm not convinced TA is useful for the long-term.  But it's a fun area to read literature in.  I recommend it.",

              "text": ">Is it normal to have a senior thesis? My school doesn't require one, but the masters program does.\n\nMore ambitious undergraduate students in honors colleges usually writes a senior thesis.  Most undergraduate programs don't require this and is usually the choice of the student if they wish to do it.\n\n>And I do think they want me to apply to funding myself, but idk what the stipulations are for that.\n\nThey're trying to prepare you for grad school if you want to come to grad school.  they're telling you to bring your own money.   There are some things professors can apply for to support students and then there's some opportunities that are only open to students.  If you want to go to grad school, bringing your own funding gives you more control and leverage when finding an advisor (and just makes life so much easier).  However, this is also super competitive, just like anything related to money.\n\nThe TLDR is...  If those professors don't have money to give you (and you need help paying for grad school), then they can't work with you.  If you want to guarantee working with them, then you should bring in your own money (either a loan or a fellowship).  But then if you have your own money, you probably have an easier time getting into grad school from a more prestigious university.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also what's interesting on my project is the absence of using historical data, but utilizing real time data to make the predictions.\n\nNot my area of expertise but I'd have to read a bit more in that methodology to understand it.  Almost all algorithms and indices in this area requires historical data of some form to evaluate the current real-time value (if PLTR sits at 25 currently, the algorithm won't know if 25 is high, average, or low without historic data for context).  For example, MA5 or RSI indicators require a small window of historic data to calculate current indicator values, which then traders use to decide what actions to take.",

But you actually bring up a good point that might make the learning more accurate...\n\nIf I apply the same methodology of using current datasets in real time, and predict the tickets movement, I can teach the beastling how to recognize that data by using the same datasets from that point in time and the historic rise and fall of tickets.",

                      "text": "Yeah speaking purely algorithmically, you just need something to show the relativity of the current value and evaluate if it's at a decision point so it knows \"when\" to execute.  Then once you hit a decision point, it needs to know \"what\" to do.  All these decisions are based on historic data.  Iirc many people use those indicators and \"the greeks\" as a way to make those decisions.\n\nAnyways best of luck though!  It sounds interesting and fun.  I've been dabbling in it in my \"free time\" and am building my own trading algorithm for fun.  It's an interesting area to build algorithms in.",
