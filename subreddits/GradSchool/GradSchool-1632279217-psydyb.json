I'm currently undergrad, but I'm still in this sub because I plan on pursuing a PhD.\n\nAnyways, I see a lot of chatting about research and what not, which is why I'm here.\n\nI've approached two departments in hopes of getting an advisor for a research project I'm working on... Specifically an econ and finance research professor and a machine learning research professor.\n\nMy project centers around prediction models for investments in live markets using machine learning advanced data analysis.\n\nMy question is, what should I expect for this project? The two professors are deliberating over accepting me, but they both sounded interested and on board.\n\nI've been advised to fill out a research grant application for the next school year, but my concern is that it's my senior year and I don't know if I'll be able to complete my research in such a short time.\n\nI do plan on getting my master's, but I wasn't planning on getting that at my current school.\n\nI'm lost and overwhelmed and need some guidance into what to expect. My econ advisor mentioned goals to publication and I didn't even expect that, I just wanted to program this cool thing.", "author": "Emperor-Valtorei", "created": 1632279217, "retrieved": 1632952141, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdt3is7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psydyb/research_project_and_grad_school/hdt3is7/", "text": "1. They're both interested because they see a potentially interested student who already has an idea.\n2. They're asking you to bring your own funding because they want to work with you (as you're excited about the topic) but if you bring your own funding then you can dedicate more of your time on this. \n3. Publication can come later.  Don't worry about that.\n\n>I've approached two departments in hopes of getting an advisor for a research project I'm working on... Specifically an econ and finance research professor and a machine learning research professor.\n\nSounds like you're just talking about doing a senior thesis?  Then just keep it at that.  If you don't want to get your master's at your current institution then don't.  It sounds like those professors think you're interested in grad school and working with them.  You said you plan on pursuing a PhD so just do your senior thesis and apply for a PhD at the same time (or a masters, whatever step you want next).  \n\n>My question is, what should I expect for this project? The two professors are deliberating over accepting me, but they both sounded interested and on board.\n\nSounds like there's different levels of expectations.  Probably communicating that you're only looking for an advisor for your senior thesis is probably a good idea...\n\n>My project centers around prediction models for investments in live markets using machine learning advanced data analysis.\n\nNot my area of research but as one of my side projects I've been building one myself as well.  The literature in this area is a crapshoot as a lot of people are using concepts of Technical Analysis as the basis of their ML algorithm whereas others are trying to use ML to help with Fundamental Analysis.  If climate change research has taught me anything, historic data doesn't predict the future (aka \"Stationarity is Dead\" paper), so I'm not convinced TA is useful for the long-term.  But it's a fun area to read literature in.  I recommend it.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1632284797, "upvotes": 3}}}
