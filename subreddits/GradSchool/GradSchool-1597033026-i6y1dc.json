Also, if you wanna bitch about people, Zoom is not exactly the most secure way of doing so.\n\nFor this summer, I was maybe 70% productive and I did get some work done. But as the summer concludes, I am struggling to work even the minimal amount of work that a phD student has to accomplish as a research assistant. \n\nBecause my work can be performed entirely remotely, using COVID as a excuse doesn't work for me.\n\nI do have hobbies like exercising, reading books and video games etc... But I am capping my hours spent on my hobbies - I can easily get obsessed with my hobbies and spend the entire week not working. \n\nI tried tele-therapy for a month or so but my therapist seem to spent the minimal effort on me by simply lending a ear for my rants. She did not prepare the more standard clinical psychology techniques on me so I stopped it as I feel like it wasn't helping much.\n\nNGL, I do have some psychological issues even before COVID.

The first month or two I was ok. As a computational chemist, I like you was not technically affected by having to work from home, but I came to realize this was a total lie. By month 3, (May) I was totally shot. I was probably only working 10-15 hours a week honestly. That may not be totally accurate but I lost track. \n\nThen I lost my father in June. I\u2019ve been in quarantine since and haven't worked once in the last 3 months. Therapy has helped but I can tell you that you aren\u2019t alone in feeling this way. Quarantine has amplified every feeling, distraction, emotion, etc.... and for people who thrive in structured environments I think it has taken a heavy toll. I learned a lot about myself in these last few months, especially my work habits. My advisors don\u2019t really give a damn but that\u2019s besides the point.\n\n\nI\u2019ve started to find my work ethic again slowly. A few hours here and there when I can. When the depression isn\u2019t what dictates my life. I can only suggest trying to find structure again. If you spend 5 hours a week working, embrace it. Dont feel shame. And if you can, set a goal for 10 or 20 the next week. And if you can\u2019t, don\u2019t punish yourself for it either. \n\nMany people struggle to work from home. Especially when your a poor grad student living in a small ass apartment. But our homes are where we build our lives. Our homes are where we go to escape work, relax, unwind, and take a moment away from the stress of grad school. It was always going to be incredibly difficult for me (and maybe you and others) to suddenly try to be 80hrs/week productive in our home environment. I maintain any advisor who thinks it was possible is out of their mind.\n\nI can only tell you to keep pushing on, and really remember the situation we are in. If you\u2019re like me, structure is key. And if you can build structure slowly, piece by piece, it may help. Just remember to take it slow and everything will come, one way or another, one day or another. \n\nBest of luck to you.\n\n*Edit: Just a note about therapy. I too entered therapy on a weekly basis when my father first fell sick. I think I had the same reaction as you did. That all I did was talk and all they did was listen. It sucked because I was angry and wanted answers (like most grad students, I think we want to live in a world of absolutes). I dont know when it clicked but eventually I realized what my therapists role was. A bad therapist either 1.) just listens and nods along and offers platitudes, or 2.) tries to give advice to every problem you have. I think personally, a good therapist offers perspective. They give perspective to your emotions, thoughts, reactions, problems, whatever, because it is ultimately up to you to arrive at a place that allows you to feel better. And better doesn't always mean happy. Ultimately there is no correct advice for ones problems, but perspective in how I deal with and approach my problems and who I am has helped me greatly by allowing me to come to my own conclusions. Finding a good therapist is critical, but understanding their true role in your health is just as important. **THIS IS ALL MY OWN, PERSONAL OPINION THOUGH...**", "author": "IrishAmericanWhiskey", "created": 1597045165, "upvotes": 22}, "g0z1lil": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/i6y1dc/anyone_feels_that_isolation_is_affecting_their/g0z1lil/", "text": "I\u2019ve been through a lot of crappy therapists in the past.
