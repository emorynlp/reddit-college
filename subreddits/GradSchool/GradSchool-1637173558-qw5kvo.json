  "text": "I hear that term get tossed around a lot, I have been researching schools lately and it seems kind of like a too good to be true or really hard to get kind of thing. \n\nI really want to go to grad school, but am still in debt from undergrad and do not want to worsen that. I work in freelance writing and education, and want to find a good public writing/journalism program.\n\n \n\nTL:DR how hard or impossible is it to get into a fully funded program?",

      "text": "No idea how hard it is generally or in your field, but it's definitely possible.\n\nThe program won't be advertised as fully funded, though, because it's handled through an assistantship (research or teaching), not the program as such. Where I'm studying you're not eligible for assistantships unless you're doing a research-based degree. That also skews the difficulty, since you're looking for the advisor (with a suitable project and funding), not just the program itself.",

      "text": "PhDs are much more likely to be funded than masters degrees.\n\nProfessional degrees that train someone for a particular job are much \\*less\\* likely to be funded than research or academia-oriented programs.\n\nMy impression is that good journalism schools, particularly ones that are training people to get jobs writing journalism, follow the professional model. The idea is that the whole point of the program is to get in and get out and get a job that pays more than you would have earned otherwise, which lets you pay off the loans you probably need to take to get through the program.\n\nFor comparison's sake, this is also roughly why people take out huge loans to go to medical school - because it pays off.\n\nPart of the reason PhDs are typically funded is that they take such a long time and that the career prospect after you get one are \\*not great\\* - it just wouldn't make any sense to do a PhD if they weren't funded.\n\nI'm pretty sure you can find some journalism or journalism-adjacent PhD programs that are funded. Also look at Communication Studies and Rhetoric/Comp departments maybe. But if what you actually want to be doing is writing journalism, this might not actually serve you well. A PhD program is going to push you more towards teaching and theory!",
