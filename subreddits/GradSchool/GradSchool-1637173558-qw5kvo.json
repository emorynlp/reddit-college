  "text": "I hear that term get tossed around a lot, I have been researching schools lately and it seems kind of like a too good to be true or really hard to get kind of thing. \n\nI really want to go to grad school, but am still in debt from undergrad and do not want to worsen that. I work in freelance writing and education, and want to find a good public writing/journalism program.\n\n \n\nTL:DR how hard or impossible is it to get into a fully funded program?",

      "text": "No idea how hard it is generally or in your field, but it's definitely possible.\n\nThe program won't be advertised as fully funded, though, because it's handled through an assistantship (research or teaching), not the program as such. Where I'm studying you're not eligible for assistantships unless you're doing a research-based degree. That also skews the difficulty, since you're looking for the advisor (with a suitable project and funding), not just the program itself.",
