  "title:": "As international student in a research group, do you feel like missing out on information due to language barrier?",
  "text": "Question to all international students who are a part of a research group where English is neither your nor their first language.\n\nI want to know if only my research group does this or if it's a common problem. \nPeople from my group (we are small - only 6 students, I am the only international) often begin conversations in their mother tongue (which I understand only on a very basic level) even if I am right next to them.  \nAlso, I often feel that I have a disadvantage and that I lose a lot of information when they talk about whatever topic, including topics related to their research in lab. Even my PI often comes to us grad students and begins talking in his language, no matter if personal, faculty- or research-related. I always feel like they are up-to-date and learn a lot by just overhearing other people. And I tried to point out that I am feeling left out when they talk in their language but they simply fall back into their old pattern all the time. In spontaneous or private conversations they don't consider me at all. \n\nHow's your experience?",

      "text": "I was part of a lab like this, the PI and all other members were Chinese and spoke Mandarin to each other very often. Our \"official communication channel\" was a WeChat group chat where everyone wrote in Chinese. I was always blindsided by lab plans, as no one thought to include an English translation when they were planning stuff, and obviously never had a say in anything we did as a lab as all was planned in Chinese. \n\nI don't think/know that research was impacted too much by this, but it did suck.",
