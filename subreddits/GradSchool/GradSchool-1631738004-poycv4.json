For instance, on this page linked below the instructions under **Research Proposal, If you are not currently enrolled in a doctoral degree program** say to provide an outline of your doctoral thesis, which includes your research question, context, objectives, methodology, significance, and so forth.\n\nIs it, then, necessary to structure my research outline like this:\n\n**Research Question:**\n\n**Context:**\n\n**Objectives:**\n\nand so forth?\n\nOr can I just make sure that all of these criteria are addressed, and write my proposal as one coherent whole. I find that to break it up into sections like this affects its coherence, since some information is relevant in a number of different sections, etc.", "author": "ProofArtichoke1", "created": 1631738004, "retrieved": 1632844394, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hd03mtx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/poycv4/structuring_a_research_proposal_for_sshrc/hd03mtx/", "text": "I haven't been successful but I've sat through a lot of presentations on sshrc proposals. The rule is that you need to include all those categories, but the order is up to you. You can use headings, or not. But remember the headings make it easier to read for the people evaluating these things. Walls of text get monotonous \n\nThere are lots of examples online and recommendations from different universities about how to approach writing the proposal", "author": "CadmiumRrred", "created": 1631741848, "upvotes": 2}}}
