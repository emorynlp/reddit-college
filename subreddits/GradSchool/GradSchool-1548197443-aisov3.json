Thank you for all the kind words and support. I love you Reddit!\n\nJust here to lament. Long story short, was supposed to defend last May. PI pulled my defense last minute for a number of reasons. Later found out he wanted data for a high impact paper. I had already moved for a new job, so I have to move back, find short-term housing, and complete his lab work (all out of my own pocket since I was no longer getting paid/funded). Ended up not submitting the paper with the new data anyways. Almost a year later, it\u2019s finally here again. Still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I hope after tomorrow I can finally earn my PhD!
