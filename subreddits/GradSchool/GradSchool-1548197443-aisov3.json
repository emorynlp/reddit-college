  "text": "UPDATE: I passed y\u2019all! Thank you for all the kind words and support. I love you Reddit!\n\nJust here to lament. Long story short, was supposed to defend last May. PI pulled my defense last minute for a number of reasons. Later found out he wanted data for a high impact paper. I had already moved for a new job, so I have to move back, find short-term housing, and complete his lab work (all out of my own pocket since I was no longer getting paid/funded). Ended up not submitting the paper with the new data anyways. Almost a year later, it\u2019s finally here again. Still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but I hope after tomorrow I can finally earn my PhD! Send some love please!",

Whether because they feel something needs clarification, something isn't explained in as much detail as they would like, or maybe a key figure was missed that would make the point come across in a better manner. The level of the revision depends on your committee. For my masters my internal examiner requested I add a figure to ensure that point came across. It ultimately made my thesis better, and it didn't take too long so it wasn't too bad. That's the stage I meant, if your committee keeps asking questions about a particular topic and you get to the point where you are unsure, you can tell them you will be more than happy to provide more info either in the thesis or to them personally, and then if you do tell them that you can follow up",
