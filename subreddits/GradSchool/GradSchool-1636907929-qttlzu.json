      "text": "My supervisor is absolutely stellar. Our work style works nicely, and we get along outside of work quite nicely. He is incredibly tough for his standards, but fair and clear. He also lets me work largely at my own pace; as long as my progress is steady, he doesn't require constant updates. That works great for me, as I don't feel like I'm stressed. While it can be sometimes hard to gauge his mood, even after working with him so long, I struggle to think of somebody who I'd rather work with.",

      "text": "Some highlights of mine\n\n- Fully admits to lacking a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of my area of research, despite also being a micromanager, resulting in non-sense experiments and completely wasted time and research funds.\n\n- Maintains being a micromanager after having several experiments fit my own hypothesis and not his, has very little interest in my own ideas of research direction.\n\n- Extremely indecisive, I spent about 4 months discussing future research directions, with each meeting have hardly any continuity to the previous.  Eventually I just picked one of his ideas that seemed like it could have some meaningful value and walked through it with him, I've been waiting 3 months for him to review the write up I made for it.\n\n\nThings are better now, I had plenty of extra time since he didn't provide much guidance (when I say micromanager, I mean he wanted me to follow a very specific research path) and used it to work on what I actually wanted to do my thesis on.  He also strangely has support for it now, despite previously stating he had no interest after a 15 minute presentation I gave on it a few months ago.  I think he might be a bit overdue for retirement, regardless, I feel like I have a moral obligation to formally complain about this after I graduate.",
