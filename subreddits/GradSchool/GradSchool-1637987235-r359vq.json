  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am currently a junior at a T50 college on Biomedical Engineering. I have been thinking about applying grad school but have no direction on which college is better or suitable for my situation.\n\nMy GPA is kind of low at 3.2 but have current ongoing research on cardiology to make up for that and a co-first author sci article to publish early next year on the research that I am in.\n\nIn terms of applications, are the difficulties of applying based on the ranking of its program in schools or is it based on the overall ranking of schools? I don't know if I should try and go for a grad school with similar ranking to my school or to push higher. I do dream about going to the T20, but I know it's probably not gonna happen.",

      "text": "so many people obsess about the rankings of the school they are applying for when what is most important is the fit of the research and professor to the student and their research interests.  \n\nwhat you need to do is to look for programs that have research that you are interested in, whatever their ranking is.",
