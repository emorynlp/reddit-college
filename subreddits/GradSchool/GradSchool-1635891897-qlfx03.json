  "title:": "A week into an awful rotation, should I try to tough it out or arrange a new rotation last second?",
  "text": "I am a first year PhD student in the biomedical sciences, and I just started a new rotation about a week ago. I was really excited about this lab as I studied something really similar for a couple of years, and my old lab frequently read their papers and liked their work. I met with the PI a couple of times prior to the rotation and we had good convos about science. \n\nNow that I started the rotation, all the grad students have practically been telling me to run as fast as I can. The main grad student I work with said they have not had a day out of the lab in months (red flag #1).  The student already published 2 first author papers but the PI won't let them graduate until they get another paper, despite them expressing that they want to graduate and have met all the requirements  (red flag #2).   Multiple people have complained about how much they are working all the time, but the PI constantly tells them they should be working harder and are not smart enough (red flag #3). A grad student needs to take a couple of weeks out of lab to meet a requirement for a dual masters they are doing, and the PI won't let them, so they have to lose out on a masters degree that is 95% finished (red flag #4). My project has changed almost 4 times since last week. The PI tells me about a rotation project for me to work on and who I will be working with. Then I go talk to that person and they tell me that the data on that is terrible and that they already told the PI they refused to work on that anymore. This leaves me no way to actually accomplish anything in the rotation because people are refusing to work on these projects (biggest red flag).  So many more things in just the first week.  Today a grad student just straight up told me that I don't want to joint this lab. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is not unheard of to leave a rotation this early, but I really didn't want to do that unless it is necessary. However, my rotation slots are a resource that I would rather not spend in a lab I know I don't want to join. Should I talk to the program director to see about changing rotation labs, or should I just tough it out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I also don't want to be a snitch and rat out this lab for being toxic af, I barely know them and it seems like their lab business. I also don't want them getting in trouble with the PI for telling me all the bad things about the lab since they are supposed to be recruiting me. What should I do?",

      "text": "Set up another rotation and leave asap. This is your phd and you shouldn't feel bad about prioritizing your time and finding a good lab over others' feelings. If you've decided not to join, continuing your rotation is a waste of time for both you and the people training you.\n\nThat said, you don't need to give super specific reasons why if asked. You could just say that you've decided to pursue another direction, or there's another research project you're more interested in.",

      "text": "Yeah, just ask to switch rotations if possible but dont \u201csnitch\u201d on the lab. Just say it wasnt a good fit. Your graduate program director understands there will be personality clashes, research clashes, etc but just say that you dont think that lab will be a good fit for you and you want to move on to another rotation early. You dont wanna make waves by saying too much about a lab you wont even be working with",

      "text": "Rotations are meant to help you and prospective advisors figure out which lab to join. What action will be most productive towards that goal?\n\nChanging to a different rotation lab right away is sensible. You'll get to see another lab culture. \n\nYour program may not be set up to change rotations midway, though. Then you have to continue in this one for the relevant time slot. But you will use the time in a different way. The PI is likely to be really good at something. Figure out what that is, and learn what you can about it. Let the stuff they are not good at pass you by. Get to know the grad students a year ahead of you in that lab. They will be your professional cohort thoughout your career. If they succeed in that lab, they will likely do well in the future.\n\nNo matter what, talk with your director of graduate studies to help guide you through the process and mediate any move. That is their job.   Focus on what you need for your education, not \"snitching.\"",
