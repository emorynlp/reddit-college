  "text": "I am very very VERY excited and I have to share it. I\u2019m a second semester MA student studying international affairs with a concentration in queer security in Sub-Saharan Africa. I wrote a term paper for one of my classes on Senegalese political and religious mobilization against queer and gender non conforming men, stemming from attacks in Dakar in June 2021. My professor is (unbeknownst to me at the time) an editor on an book on West African identity politics that is currently in the works. She asked if she could send the paper to her co-editor to see if my paper could work as a chapter on fringe and challenged identities - AND THEY SAID YES!!\n\nMy paper is going to be a CHAPTER in a book! But that\u2019s not all - I was asked to CO-AUTHOR the theory chapter. Like\u2026 WHAT?! I\u2019m so happy! This is a huge step forward for me. I haven\u2019t decided if a PhD is in my future, but this is such a validation that if I wanted to, I CAN do this. My work is good. My work is necessary. \n\nTo have someone in my corner, to have a professor tell me that my work can stand alongside her\u2019s and other professionals in this field is just so exciting. I\u2019m 33 years old. I, admittedly, began my grad school career much later than most. But this is such a validating moment that lets me know that I made the right choice by pursuing academia.",
