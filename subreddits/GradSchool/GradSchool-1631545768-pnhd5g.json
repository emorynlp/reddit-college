We were touring his office and had left to go and check out the lab, which was in one of the newer buildings on campus. We walk there and immediately my supervisor heads towards the stairwell, which comparatively to the rest of the building, looks kind of...unfinished? As we're climbing the stairs to the lab on the fourth floor (which is quite a ways given the high ceilings of the new building), he remarks: \"I never understand why people don't just use the stairs. It's good exercise and takes less time.\" Now as a Kinesiology grad student, it was obvious to me why the stairs would be the better choice. But man, sometimes you're just tired and want to take the elevator. After that meeting though, I *never* took the elevator in that building for 6 years, unless I knew my supervisor was on vacation. I don't know why, but I just felt like I would be betraying my field if I was caught taking the elevator (which was visible from the stairwell exit), instead of  the stairs. Looking back though, it was a good habit and I still prefer to take the stairs wherever I go, much to the dismay of the company I'm with.\n\nAnyone have a similar weird habit or routine from grad school?", "author": "GSconfessional", "created": 1631545768, "retrieved": 1632844575, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 61, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcsnr32": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnhd5g/whats_a_weird_habitroutine_youve_picked_up_during/hcsnr32/", "text": "I guess I am super routine oriented and take the exact same route to campus every day, enter from the same door, and go to my office the same way.
