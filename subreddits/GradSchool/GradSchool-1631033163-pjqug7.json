I am also enrolled in a non-thesis M.S. in Statistics program at Texas A&M as well. I graduated in 2019 with a 3.7 GPA having studied computer science. I did take all of my electives in upper division math with a 4.0 math GPA, getting A+\u2019s in courses like real analysis.\n\nNow, I am considering applying for PhD programs and leaving my current masters program because I have a deep love for math/statistics/cs, and know I will regret not going for it while I\u2019m still relatively young. \n\nMy main worry is a lack of letters of recommendation from undergrad because it\u2019s been so long. I have some from work which I used to get into my masters program, but I\u2019m not sure if they hold water when it comes to PhD programs.\n\nMy other problem, which is just as glaring, is having no research under my belt. In undergrad I was very industry focused, and my father also passed away which took up time while I went through that with my family.\n\nIs there a realistic road to an interesting PhD program from where I am?", "author": "RawCS", "created": 1631033163, "retrieved": 1632952788, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
