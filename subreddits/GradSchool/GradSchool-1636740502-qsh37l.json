  "text": "Hey all. \n\nSo I emailed a potential supervisor with a letter explaining my interest in his work and if he'll be taking in new students for the spring term. He replied saying that he couldn't consider me because his laboratory is fully staffed, and wished me luck with my graduate studies.\n\nI then responded asking whether he could consider my application for the next summer, fall or winter semester if there will be spots available then.  \n\nIt has been 5 days and I haven't received a reply. Should I send a follow up email? Would it be appropriate, or could it be that he's not interested in taking me in as a graduate student in his group after he read my email/ research topic? (I have generalized anxiety disorder and I tend to over think everything) .\n\nI appreciate any advice.",

I really don\u2019t think he is not interested in you, but he might not have the capacity to take on new students at this moment. I would personally not follow up now because I think he might not know whether he will need students in a year from now. Professors are not always great at planning. If you are really keen on working with him, I would follow up closer to the next admission cycle. Best of luck and don\u2019t let this demotivate you.",
