  "text": "Hey all. \n\nSo I emailed a potential supervisor with a letter explaining my interest in his work and if he'll be taking in new students for the spring term. He replied saying that he couldn't consider me because his laboratory is fully staffed, and wished me luck with my graduate studies.\n\nI then responded asking whether he could consider my application for the next summer, fall or winter semester if there will be spots available then.  \n\nIt has been 5 days and I haven't received a reply. Should I send a follow up email? Would it be appropriate, or could it be that he's not interested in taking me in as a graduate student in his group after he read my email/ research topic? (I have generalized anxiety disorder and I tend to over think everything) .\n\nI appreciate any advice.",

I really don\u2019t think he is not interested in you, but he might not have the capacity to take on new students at this moment. I would personally not follow up now because I think he might not know whether he will need students in a year from now. Professors are not always great at planning. If you are really keen on working with him, I would follow up closer to the next admission cycle. Best of luck and don\u2019t let this demotivate you.",

It's putting all your eggs in one basket so to speak. I'm not sure how Master's programs work in your area though (I'm speaking as someone in a US doctoral program).",

The other choices are quite far from microbiology.. they are more chemistry, physics and engineering based. And  so, I'm more interested in the biology based- microbiology, which alone has many branches. \n\nAlso, my undergrad curriculum focused on microbiology, therefore I'm not knowledgeable enough in the other areas of foodscience. \n\nPresently, there is only one potential supervisor whose research is in the food microbiology field.",

Most people don't have specific experience when going into grad school. PIs care more about someone who has a base level of competence and determonation. Knowledge and skill can all be taught.\n\nIf this one person is the only one you can see yourself working with, then you might just be stuck. You should assess whether grad school is absolutely what you want to do and you are willing to be flexible with your research.\n\nSorry I don't mean to be giving unsolicited advice. To the point of your main question, you should poke the PI one more time. Lots of them are really awful about returning emails, so I usually wait a full week before pressing them again (unless it's more urgent). The worst they can do is tell you no again.",
