  "text": "For my multicultural class we are supposed to give a group presentation about a ritual or tradition about a specific culture. My group is assigned the Latinx population in America. I was wondering if anyone had any non sacred ritual or tradition ideas that Latinx individuals do in America that represents their culture. I know of Dia De Los Muertos and Quinceanera\u2019s, but Google didn\u2019t really give any other examples.",
