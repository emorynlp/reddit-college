  "text": "Luckily, my personal statement from my application two years ago has needed little editing. Just had to add that I\u2019m in a MSc program, have some research experience, east peasy. \n\nHowever, I suck at writing research proposals. Haven\u2019t taken any grant writing courses, and I prefer to help with research by adding my two cents to the design and performing experiments + collecting/analyzing data. \n\nSo I came up with a good proposal, and while it needed a lot of rewording and tweaking, my PI was super pleased. Worked 3 weeks on that bad boy. Then, the bombshell: I\u2019m an idiot and didn\u2019t realize until this morning that proposals on Ag crop productivity are a no-go. Shit.\n\nSo I completely re-wrote my proposal today. It didn\u2019t take as long to write as the first one, since I could pull some pieces here and there, but damn. I feel a little screwed.\n\nPlus if I applied in my second year as a MSc student, and I got funded somehow, I wouldn\u2019t be eligible because I\u2019d be so close to obtaining my masters degree\u2026 right? Anyone have any insight?\n\nEither way, I could use some good luck vibes. Thanks for reading my rant.",
