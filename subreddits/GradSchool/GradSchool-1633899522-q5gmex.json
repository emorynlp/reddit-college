  "title:": "Can I use a graduate school stipend to pay undergrad loans?",
  "text": "Hey everyone, this might be a bit of a dumb question, or something better suited for r/PersonalFinance, but I'm going to ask anyway. I'm in my first year of graduate school, and I've received a loan stipend that I don't really need (all bills are paid, have regular income, emergency savings, etc.). I could return this money directly back to the school/federal government, but I also have undergrad loans at a much higher interest rate. Could I take this money from the stipend, and payoff some of those higher interest rate loans? Just not sure what's allowed when it comes to these stipends, and I was having trouble finding info elsewhere. Thanks!",

You don't actually have to do anything special, just make sure all the money hits your bank account and then out from there, then nothing really matters.",

It\u2019s basically indirectly refinancing the undergrad loan.",

And the risk isn't worth it, you can be barred from all future federally backed loans, all your loans immediately lose the benefits that come with the federal backing, your credit score gets obliterated, and they can (although likely won't) criminally prosecute you. All to save a few extra bucks on interest. Risk/reward doesn't add up.",

I was once given the advice that if an Index Fund makes more than the cost of your student loan interest rate, then you should invest instead. I of course, didn't listen to that advice and instead paid off a loan that was sitting at a measly 3%. Only to turn around a year or two later and have to take out a graduate loan at a much higher interest rate (undergrads get better rates than grad students). \n\nThis might be a question for one of the personal finance subreddits. They could probably walk you through the different options  \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/invest-reduce-debt.asp",

As long as you have an emergency fund you\u2019re good to go. \n\nFor reference, I have a 5k+ emergency fund, 2k discretionary savings, Roth IRA funded at 500/mo and progressively paid off all loans with graduate income and side gigs. \n\nThe only reason to not just pay these loans off (stipend is still taxable income, btw) is if they are at 0 interest until the end of your graduate training. In that case, I\u2019d weigh your risk tolerance to something stable but slow growing like a HYSA vs sp500/bonds/international fund portfolio (see Bogle heads subreddit for further information).",
