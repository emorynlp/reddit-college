  "title:": "Advisor keeps asking me to use personal money to pay for research.",
  "text": "My research involves lots of work in the field and computer work as well. I've generated multiple TB of data. My advisor has only purchased 1 of the 4 hard drives I use to store data, and they want me to use my own vehicle to drive back out to the field without compensating me for miles or gas. I accidentally reported working hours for an extra week this summer, so I was paid $500 more than I should have been. However, between buying all my own field gear (about $2000 worth, not research supplies), buying $200 in hard drives, not being compensated for a $300 car rental for field work last summer, and having to spend another $200 to go back into the field at least, I'm considering just telling them I'm not going back out unless they cover my expenses for this last trip. All our funding has  dried up, so there's no money left to cover me, though.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like it is deeply unethical for a professor making $90,000 a year to ask me, a grad student making $20,000 a year, to keep paying for so much stuff. I somewhat understand covering personal field gear myself, but if anything else is coming out of someone's personal pocket, I think it should be my advisor's. Either that, or those purchases aren't made and the research doesn't get done as planned. I don't value my research more than my financial security, but they want me to since that's what they did in grad school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I off base here? I can technically afford to cover this last trip myself, so turning my advisor down would be on principle.",

      "text": "Yeah you absolutely shouldn't be paying for field work out of pocket. It is reasonable to pay for your own personal field gear (things like a backpack, clothes, etc), and potentially groceries while you're in the field (since you would be feeding yourself at home anyway), but nothing beyond that. It's definitely unethical that you've been asked to pay for things out of pocket and it might be worthwhile to have a conversation with someone in the ombuds office or maybe someone like your department's graduate coordinator. If you do go that route, it would be helpful to gather some documentation about the total amount of your personal money that you've spent on these things over the years.\n\nAs far as your actual options go, I wouldn't tell your advisor that you're turning down field work on principle. If you don't want to pay for anything else out of pocket, you should just firmly tell them it's not in the budget for you right now and don't give them any details beyond that. Unfortunately, I don't think the outcome of this will be that they agree to pay for this last trip out of pocket for you - it will probably be that you either don't do the field work, or you find some alternate source of funding to pay for it",

          "text": "Thanks for the perspective. I definitely wouldn't tell them I won't pay for the next trip out of principle, but that's a good reminder to still be careful with the language I use.\n\nI'm hesitant to go to the ombuds office or grad coordinator. Within my department, I don't know if I'll be backed up by anyone since I think my advisor has been open about some of the expenses they've asked me to cover. For example, that extra $500 I was accidentally paid this summer might just be removed from my salary in the spring semester. And my advisor said that if we go over budget on literally anything, that money will automatically come out of my pay. I assumed they were told that as well, but maybe not.\n\nRegardless, I'm supposed to graduate in May and all I want is to be done as soon as possible. Going over my advisor's head on some of this could spark an official complaint of some kind, and I just don't want to deal with that. I think I'll just keep an open conversation going with my lab mates about what I've experienced so they can act accordingly sooner than I did.",

It sounds like the department chair is a no-go, but the ombuds could still be a good option - the ombuds office is completely separate from your department and having a conversation with them doesn't mean you have to take any official action. They can be helpful for just talking through your options and they are confidential so it wouldn't get back to your department or PI if you didn't want it to. I would also add that this is information your department chair would probably want to have when it comes time for your PI to go up for tenure. Even if you don't feel like doing it now, it could be worth sharing down the line when you have some distance from the situation.",

This becomes a slush fund to cover new computer hardware or research expenses that they couldn't cover in a project or to hold over during a gap period.\n\nIt's basically an account with the university.",

This kind of required expense sounds very abnormal to me. The fact that your advisor took abuse as a student does not mean you should have to. In the private sector, every single thing you listed would be covered, and then some (e.g. food, entertainment). Even as a grad student I've had close to that level of paid expenses; it really should be the norm. \n2. If you are part of a union, your union representative is a great first contact for dealing with this kind of thing. Any other grad student organizations, as well as your program director (usually faculty but not usually a threat to your supervisor since they're peers) should be good options if you want to take it slow before rocking the boat.",

That includes computers, fuel, mileage, clothing, tools, trainings; everything, even if you might end up using it for something else down the road. I can understand why OP would want to grin and bear it just to get finished, but on a macro scale, I think our starting point as researchers should always be that if it's for work, it doesn't come out of our pocket. \n\nThe amount of abuse grad students take because they're scared and don't know any better is insane. We need to communicate better among each other to prevent this type of thing.",

I don't know where you live, but at least where I live there are many small national and international grants to support fieldwork in various sciences, and as a PhD student you would be eligible to apply for some of them.  Obviously it would be easier if your advisor was sorting this out, but it would look great on your CV, and help the money problems, if you could get one yourself.",

If there's no money for research, then you can be dropped unapologetically. Even though your prof SHOULD help pay for expenses, he's not obligated to and might just decide you're not worth the hassle and drop you. If it's a PhD program, you might be able to be pushed onto another prof who has funding, but if that's not a possibility in your department then you might be forced to leave or halt your program. I heard horror stories of this happening when Trump cut the EPA and wanted to do the same with the DOE where some grad students and professors who were on grants from these departments had to scramble for new funding sources. The first option I would try to pursue would be a compromise by trying to see what you can do virtually to minimize expenses.",

I have a semester and a half left. They won't drop me, and I won't try to move P.I.'s. Really just a game of chicken, and I won't blink first. I really hate thinking about grad school like this though. I just want to enjoy doing science and learning.",

In this way, your advisor won't be able to swindle any more grad students and they will be forced to find their own funding or quit Academia altogether.

Unfortunately, some parts of grad school are sometimes not funded.\n\nMeanwhile, you don't know what your professor's personal financial obligations are. \n\nSo I would advise you to make the decision based upon what's best for you, not because you think your professor should cover your expenses out of his own pocket.
