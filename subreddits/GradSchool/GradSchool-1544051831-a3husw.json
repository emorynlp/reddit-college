I've been lurking in this sub since I was informed that I got into graduate school to get my doctorate in chemistry.  I've seen a few posts with the same content but I always thought it would NEVER happen to me.  I joined my lab group exactly one year ago and it is a small group - only three of us.  My adviser was a great person, and wanted nothing more than to see us succeed.  He literally done everything he could to get us where we needed to be both research wise and personal-growth/development wise (if that makes sense).  He always encouraged us to do our best and was kind of like...a second dad?  I don't know.\n\nI do not want to go into details how this played out publicly.  I'm just so upset, this isn't fair.  The department head wants to meet with me tomorrow but I don't know if I can ever walk back into that building knowing that my PI, someone I looked up to and always put us (his lab group) first, won't be there.  \n\nI just REALLY needed to get this out there.  I'm so so shocked, and so unbelievably sad.

We lost a faculty member my third year in my Ph.D. program...not my advisor, but I was his TA and respected him immensely.  Close friends of mine were his advisees. The department-- faculty and grads --was devastated.  They did right by his students though, other advisors took them on after some time to sort things out.  We all spent a lot of time talking about him through that year, and ultimately renamed a graduate student building in his memory.

I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. My advisor unexpectedly passed away 3 weeks ago. He was such a wonderful advisor, and like yours, wanted nothing more than his students success.  His passing was a huge loss for our department. \n\nThe last few weeks have been horrible. I\u2019m so thankful that my department has given me their support, emotionally and otherwise, and are committed to helping me continue. This was my third semester of a PhD and I\u2019m intending on staying. \n\nTake care of yourself. Really. Let yourself be sad and grieve. For me, I\u2019m grieving the loss of an amazing man but also the loss of my normalcy. I\u2019m sad and anxious about the future. I haven\u2019t touched my research in 3 weeks and I\u2019m scraping by in my classes. I\u2019m letting myself feel all of the emotions instead of pushing them off like I\u2019ve done in the past. Self care is a must. Do what\u2019s best for you. \n\nI hope you have support from your friends and family, coworkers and department. If nothing else, you have support from me and all of r/gradschool. Please PM me if you need anything. I\u2019m dealing with all of this right now and will do anything I can to help you.

It must have been such a shock and I am sure this is going to take some time to heal from. My own wonderful adviser passed unexpectedly a few months ago while I was 8 months into my program, so I understand how confusing, painful and traumatic it is. We also had a small, tight-knit lab group and he was most definitely like a father to all of us. I also never, ever thought it would happen to me either, but here we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings are probably going to be really tough for you over the next few months (they definitely were for me). You might struggle with feelings of anger, guilt, confusion, a sense of loss, and anxiety. These emotions might also come up at unexpected times. You might also feel like no one understands what you are going through, and it is true that many won't and never will. It is most definitely OK to feel what you are feeling, and it is completely valid. This is a huge loss to your development as a researcher, a person and your career. But it will be ok, trust me! You will get through it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt helped me to talk about it. Especially talking with people that understood the magnitude of the situation. This could be close colleagues/friends, people that have been through this before, and those who knew your adviser professionally. I would definitely suggest to see a counselor, especially an on-campus one if you have one available. They are really helpful and seem to have a better grasp on academia situations than a non-campus counselor does (IMO), so may understand your situation a bit better. Talking with the department head actually really helped me because I was/am struggling with very strong feelings of guilt (as I had to change my research area). Hopefully once you speak with yours it will help you figure out what your next steps and your options will be. Give yourself permission to rest, grieve, and change things if they need to be changed. You need to look after and be gentle with yourself. Don't feel pressured to dive right back into your work. This is your PhD and your future.
