  "title:": "How do you tell if you have impostor syndrome versus your research is actual trash",
  "text": "I'm kinda worried I somehow managed to make it through undergrad doing very mediocre work, and somehow get into grad school. I really love research, but I also just feel like I suck at it. I totally messed up a major part of my senior thesis because I misunderstood a key concept and calculated something that fed into the core idea of my research wrong. I don't know how recalculating it will change my results, but I just feel so stupid that I did this wrong (and that I didn't question the way I was doing it because once my advisor realized it, it seemed like an obvious mistake).\n\nSo at what point should I be concerned that maybe I'm just bad at research, even if I like it. I know everyone says not to fall prey to impostor syndrome, but what if I'm just legitimately bad at this.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the support - it means a lot :)",

      "text": "This isn't imposter syndrome-you aren't good at research.  But it's nothing to worry about. You will likely become an expert by the end of grad school.  If at that point you have had a really unsuccessful career, that is nothing to be ashamed of since you will have followed your interest.  More likely than not though you will become an outstanding scientist. This uncertainty causes your self-doubt, and it is completely natural, although not imposter syndrome. IMO, imposter syndrome is when a highly accomplished scientist who has a track record of success still has a nagging feeling/voice that he/she doesn't belong (e.g. a postdoc in a top lab feeling inferior to the other postdocs or assistant prof with self doubt).",

I then mentioned it in passing conversation to a physicist from Los Alamos.

Then you can develop a standard for your own work. For me, my masters made a huge difference because I started to very critically read the literature and saw several defenses where people\u2019s assumptions/methods/conclusions were questioned. \n\nSo in addition to all the other advice people have given here, definitely try to check out some critical reading groups (journal clubs etc) as well as defenses so you can start building your own baseline of standards!",

Part of it was that I wrote this just to deal with the anxiety of having a major fuckup pointed out to me, and having taken some time from then I believe I can fix it and I won't have to run anything again just recalculate some values, but after having it pointed out I still feel so dumb. I just can't tell if this is the kind of dumb to be concerned about or the kind of dumb that gets less with more experience.",

      "text": "okay, here's the difference. Everyone makes mistakes. So it happens you made a \"big\" one. that's okay. \n\npeople who are bad at research: would probably ignore this after they realize they made a mistake and continue doing the work incorrectly.\n\npeople who are good at research: would correct their mistake, adjust their results, and do it all over again. \n\nbeing good at research:\n\n-perseverance and hard work. When you've made a mistake, it's okay. take a breather to regroup, and get right back at it! that's the difference between someone who makes progress and someone who doesn't.\n\n-being observant helps as well! take diligent notes. something seem weird or strange?\nsometimes the human brain is pretty intuitive (we know something, but don't know HOW we know it). write it down or ask your advisor.\n\n-You should always doubt yourself and second guess yourself. check your work as many times as you need to to be absolutely confident that you did the math right, etc. I can't tell you how many times I've saved my own ass doubting my calculations and rechecking them. If you are not absolutely sure about something, recheck it.\n\n-research is slow and tedious. it's the norm to feel imposter syndrome, especially since most of research is literally failure. You have to try the 1 million possibilities that don't work to find the one that does. that's how progress moves forward.\n\ngood luck and keep at it! :)",

Hell, i had my 2nd year oral exam TODAY and i fucked up an easy, gimme question right at the beginning. The learning during grad school happens so infinitesimally slowly that you think you\u2019re actually moving backwards. But when I think back to where i was two years ago in undergrad, i know SO much more now. So don\u2019t worry about it. No one is \u201cgood\u201d at research, from the little stuff like how to set up an experiment to the big stuff like what area of research to focus on and how to test important hypotheses - this last one even profs struggle with regularly. This type of learning comes with decades of experience.",

One of my chem coworkers has never gotten a B. Only As. She\u2019s a senior biochem major. Like. What??? And i get scared that I\u2019m not good enough for grad school all the time.

It will make your victories feel more victorious. It will motivate you to make mistakes and then go back and fix them.",
