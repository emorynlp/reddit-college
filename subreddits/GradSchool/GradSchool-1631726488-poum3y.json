It always helped me to lay out the main ideas that I wanted to go over during lecture and diagram it - almost like a storyboard - then I'd go and structure a PowerPoint presentation to support that 'story' that I was trying to tell. \n\nIt also helped me to get into the habit of asking your students if they had questions and understood the 'story' thus far. Your mileage may vary depending on your roster, the complexity of the material, and other factors. It does takes some insight to know when the class just wants to get on with it, or whether people are afraid of asking questions. \n\nDon't know if my approach helps, but I'm wishing you the best!
