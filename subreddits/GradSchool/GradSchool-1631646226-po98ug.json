      "text": "That writing score is below what most schools I see accept. Usually they look for at least a 4.0 (bare minumum really) I would retake, especially if they are competitive schools. At the school I go to, they found that the AWA score alone is predictive of success in the program. So they won't even look at people who don't have a 4.0",
