  "text": "I'm considering applying for graduate school again (masters programs in mathematics/statistics mainly - I have a B.S. in math at the moment). I applied to 3 university MS programs last year and requested graduate funding but was denied every time. Does anyone have advice on how to improve my chances for obtaining an assistantship - as it is the only way I can afford additional education.\n\nFor reference, the last time I applied I submitted my applications not long before the deadlines and did not apply to any PhD programs.\n\nThanks",

OP might be applying for a \"taught master's\", especially if outside the US, or in a non-STEM field. I've applied to master's programs with no research components in the past.\n\nI don't totally agree with \"don't directly ask for money\". Professors know that a lot of students depend on assistantships to pay for tuition, but you don't want to have a misunderstanding and end up penniless because you and the advisor never discussed money. If they don't bring it up, you should feel comfortable asking \"is this a funded opportunity?\" But maybe don't start a conversation with \"hi I need money, can I work in your lab?\"\n\nGenerally, master's programs do not offer funding, but PhD programs do (some master's programs allow assistantships only for especially well-prepared students who can teach). PhD programs are generally harder to get into, but most of them allow students to obtain a master's either along the way or if they choose to leave before completing the program. So one option is to apply for PhD programs and get started...if you want to stay on for the PhD (and pass the requirements) that's great, but if not you could leave with the master's.",

Masters degrees are 100% money makers for colleges as they require zero research and are just classes most of the time. Even the small amount of research in a MS program isn't enough to fund a student. I keep pointing this out but it seems that no one is listening. It seems the MS is the next BS now. Everyone went and got a BS and the US is swimming with people with BS degrees and no jobs, Now people are swarming to a MS and soon there will be too many of them but I digress, a MS is not likely to get TA funding or research funding because of the short amount of time in the institution and the lack of research.",
