  "text": "Should I drop out of grad? Should I change my major? I keep asking these question dozens times on weekdays. I got into a molecular biology program with a scholarship. I only have 2 weeks and its an end of the first semester. But everything makes me feel like I am the dumbest person to exist. My brain has stopped fuctioning it seems. When people try explaining things to me I zone out unconsciously and end up not understanding anything. I don't know I just don't think at all and am finding it very hard to achieve anything through my classes.\n\nI have assignment, thesis works but I just procrastinate and try to go so deep into one assignment that I end up taking longer to complete it while people are already done with 2 or 3. My advisor appears to be unhappy with me. She doesn't talk with me properly and keeps trying to find fault in whatever I do. I feel like I can't  live up to her expectation. I am anxious during the lab works and cant seem to enjoy neither my study nor my lab works. Sometimes I am optimistic and feel like I can do this but most of the time, I am overwhelmed by all the things I have to do, especially stressed about not being able to have a good bonding with my advisor. \n\nThabk you for reading this. Just dont have anyone to tell all this to in person so decided to write it here.",
