      "text": "It's a balance depending on how far you are out of your last academic experience, IMO. Undergrads heading right into a graduate program can use mostly academic references, but it's also good to have a professional reference from internships.\n\nFor older candidates, your recent work experience is much more important than your years-ago schooling. It's fine to lean entirely into professional references to demonstrate your skills and intellect. It's even better when you're working in your field and recommenders can speak to your specific abilities as experts.",

          "text": "I do have a couple of professors willing to write up a recommendation letter, except they haven't seen my skills outside of class, or on more specific topics. \n\nI would trust my past employers more to not only assess but vouch for my skills and knowledge. One internship from a tech giant, and an RA position from an R1 school. I'm wondering how recommendations would be received if they're not coming from my own university, even though those from my university haven't had much involvement in my main work, the same things that would make me a competitive applicant.",

              "text": "As long as the recommender has a clear, relevant connection to your work (supervised your internship, led your project, is your boss, etc.) and can speak to your skills/knowledge/tenacity/preparation, then the letter will be fine.\n\nI reviewed several dozen applications during the year that I sat on the admissions committee for my program. I didn't particularly get quibbly about who authored each letter as long as I could see the relationship and the body of the letter described candidates with the traits of a successful future student.",
