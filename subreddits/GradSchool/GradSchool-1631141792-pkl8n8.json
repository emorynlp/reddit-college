I've seen a few scales here and there that have data acquisition capabilities , which is a bare minimum, but none of the scales I have come across have this capability.  \n\nNote: I have additional parameters that will be tracked against time, so I really need the mass measurements to align with the time domain of these parameters.", "author": "thicc_oatmeal", "created": 1631141792, "retrieved": 1632844711, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hc4n5q9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkl8n8/question_does_anyone_know_of_a_scale_that_can/hc4n5q9/", "text": "Not seen one, but I\u2019m sure you could take a normal scale and wire it to a computer to do that.
