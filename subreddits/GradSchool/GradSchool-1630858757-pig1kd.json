  "text": "Hi,\nI am starting grad school this week and for the first time TAing two sections of an intro class. I have not heard from the professor at all despite reaching out 2 weeks ago and having introduced myself when I was assigned.\n\nI have no idea what I am suppose to do on Friday. All I have is the course outline. I don't have a syllabus yet. It's social sciences, so there isn't really a defined way to start the class.\n\nIs this how it normally goes? I'm confused, am I suppose to totally self start or will I be provided some instruction? It's a remote class and I'm not even sure how to begin, should I contact the students and introduce myself? \n\nToday I'm going to look over the class outline but other than that, not too sure how to prepare and I don't want to look clueless in front of the students..",

      "text": "When I was a TA for the first time, I had to teach a lab in a major I that was completely different from my own, one that I had not taken, and knew absolutely nothing about the material. I was freaking out bc classes were about to start and the prof had not reached out about what his expectations were/what I was supposed to do and he hadn\u2019t answered any of my emails. 1-2 days before the class his assistant reached out with all of the info I needed. Hang in there, im sure you will hear something soon. Also see if you can find out who the other TA\u2019s are for other sections and reach out to them. Maybe they\u2019ve taught it before and have some info",

If you can access course material from prior years that may be helpful for your personal prep before the first day.\n\nEdit: I am TAing for the third time this semester. The first time I TAed I did not really have any idea what I was doing & the prof didn\u2019t really offer much to go on before the first day of class. It all turned out fine. I think it boils down to the personality of the professor.",

      "text": "When does the class start? I have been a TA for extremely large intro classes in the social sciences multiple times so I have some experience with this. If the class doesn\u2019t start for another few days, try not to worry. Professors work really slowly during the summer, and it\u2019s possible your professor is going to reach out to you the day before class starts (which sucks, but that\u2019s how some professors work). Ideally, your professor should have met with you a week or so before with you (and any other TAs for the class) to give you some sort of game plan. \n\nUsually, the first day is introductions and going over the syllabus. It\u2019s not a bad idea to have your own \u201cmini-syllabus\u201d for your two sections to outline the expectations you\u2019ll have for your students. However, the professor really should give you some sort of instruction here.  Typically, you\u2019re supposed to follow their lead in terms of how they would like you to lead your sections. Some professors give very specific guidelines for what to do during each section while others give their TAs a lot of freedom. Hopefully, your professor will reach out to you before your sections start to let you know.",

I'm also like wondering if I will need to send the students a Zoom link since the class is remote but atm I don't have a paid account and wondering if the school will provide or if I need to upgrade..\nThanks for the context though, that is helpful!",

              "text": "It won\u2019t let me reply to your comment, but I would definitely say you\u2019re still in the safe zone. Technically, it\u2019s not even the week of when classes start, and tomorrow is a holiday so the week doesn\u2019t officially start until Tuesday. If you don\u2019t hear anything by the end of the day Wednesday, I would try reaching out to the chair for some quick guidance and instruction. \n\nFrom personal experience, your institution should absolutely provide you a licensed Zoom account. This is often a necessity because regular Zoom accounts have limitations that sometimes makes teaching rather difficult (such as a cap on how many people are allowed in the call). It may be that this is a service automatically provided by your university. I would start seeking out this information on your university\u2019s website ASAP. Many times, a university will have some information about the various software they offer to their students, so it may be found there. Typically, you will need to send your students a private Zoom link, one for each of your sections.",
