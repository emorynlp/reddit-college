  "text": "The path to my first published paper has been so much longer and so much more of a pain than I ever anticipated. This post is probably going to be long and somewhat of a pain too, so buckle up.\n\nI'm now starting my third year- and this paper was from a study I completed in my very first semester. And what an awful semester that was. My study depended on an extremely expensive piece of equipment that broke for the first time ever, so I had to figure out a ridiculous workaround. When I could finally run the study, I worked 10-12 hours a day, every single day, for nearly a month straight- I only stopped the day before Christmas. The only reason I didn't work longer days was because I work with fish and they're less active at night. The only day I didn't collect data was my birthday, because my labmate needed to use my setup and so I did 8 surgeries instead.\n\nPart of the study relied on accelerometry data.. When finally I finished collecting said data and went to analyze it, it was all wrong and I had no idea why. I spent months poring over methods papers and having multiple phone calls every week with the accelerometer manufacturer. Finally, after three months, we discovered that they had programmed the accelerometers incorrectly. Not only were the data useless for our purpose, but it was a kind of data that essentially no one in my field had ever used. I spent the next six months figuring out how to turn that into something useful and figuring out how to write about it in such a way that reviewers would accept this novel type of data.\n\nAt the same time I was working on the manuscript, my dad's health was failing. I would share bits and pieces of it with him, but eventually he got to a point where we couldn't talk about it anymore. I managed to get home just in time for his last two weeks. On his last day, I sat in a chair next to him, working on the manuscript at the same time- because he would've wanted me to continue on.\n\nI didn't get accepted at the first journal I went to- it was a reject, with one reviewer getting uncomfortably personal and aggressive. I submitted it to another, and then covid hit. Six months went by without hearing anything. Then, finally, in June I received (again) two borderlinr worthless reviews. Did everything I could to appease them. And then sent it back for more waiting.\n\nI check my email an unhealthy amount, but I never expected to receive anything on the weekend. My advisor saw it first and texted me. Nearly two years after I did the initial study, finally. Accepted. It doesn't feel real, and I didn't expect it would feel as bittersweet as it does.\n\nSome days it's really hard to want to keep going with my degree, especially now. But days like today make it worthwhile.",
