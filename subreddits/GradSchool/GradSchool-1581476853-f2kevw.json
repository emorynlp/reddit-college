I've had such a hard time in grad school. My advisor was stretched too thin between her students and her other commitments so I wasn't getting the guidance I needed. One of my committee members was fired very suddenly for reasons that are still unclear to me because apparently there are legal repercussions taking place. I seriously have no clue why he was fired, all I know is that I needed to find a replacement for him 4 months before my defense. My ethnography set me back 6 months, which killed the passion I had for my project. I found a way to make it work but getting there was a nightmare.\n\nBUT after all of that I defended my MA thesis this afternoon and I FEEL LIKE IM ON TOP OF THE WORLD!!! Their feedback was so constructive and made me feel like my work actually matters and means something. After months of setbacks I've finally done it. And damn, I'm so proud of myself.", "author": "nacho_fries", "created": 1581476853, "retrieved": 1632953796, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 434, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fhf461w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f2kevw/my_thesis_was_approved_with_honors/fhf461w/", "text": "YEAH congratulations!!!!!", "author": "2awesome4words", "created": 1581535852, "upvotes": 2}, "fhf2ctw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f2kevw/my_thesis_was_approved_with_honors/fhf2ctw/", "text": "Good for you", "author": "Ltrfsn", "created": 1581534787, "upvotes": 2}, "fhf0dur": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f2kevw/my_thesis_was_approved_with_honors/fhf0dur/", "text": "Proud of you x", "author": "Matt_Dave", "created": 1581533616, "upvotes": 2}, "fhee0a1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f2kevw/my_thesis_was_approved_with_honors/fhee0a1/", "text": "Congratulations!! can't wait to get mine done (I just finished my first semester haha)!", "author": "MarbiAmStart", "created": 1581520331, "upvotes": 3}, "fhe43zl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f2kevw/my_thesis_was_approved_with_honors/fhe43zl/", "text": "As a first semester masters student this makes me hopeful.
