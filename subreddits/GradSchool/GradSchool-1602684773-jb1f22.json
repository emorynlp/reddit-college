However, because we have a lot of requirements for this semester, I've been very busy that I can no longer call as often as I did. I resorted to updating her by sending her photos of me studying, attending Zoom classes, and printing papers. \n\nThis semester may be tough for all of us but here's a reminder that our loved ones are proud of us. Their support will be of significance in helping us finish this! \n\nVirtual hugs!", "author": "SnowyTurtle-9357", "created": 1602684773, "retrieved": 1632845325, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 555, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g8vlwxv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jb1f22/good_night_my_little_girl_dont_forget_to_eat/g8vlwxv/", "text": "I will never have this either. \n\nI strive to be that kind of mom, though,", "author": null, "created": 1602745344, "upvotes": 1}, "g8uu5h2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jb1f22/good_night_my_little_girl_dont_forget_to_eat/g8uu5h2/", "text": "Lol yea my parents could NOT care less.
