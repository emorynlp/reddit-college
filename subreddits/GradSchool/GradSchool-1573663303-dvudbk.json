Pomodoro Timer. \n\nYou will get through this. \n\n----->>> Also, use every piece of tech you have available to you to jump start projects- especially things like Dragon-dictation and Grammarly (getting started on papers). \n\nYou will cross this finish line. \n\n--->> Shortcuts? Absolutely. Let's face it, Wikipedia should not be quoted per se, but if you are completely topic-challenged, look to Wikipedia *footnotes/references* Keeping reading til you get academic-worthy resources. \n\nYou will finish this THING. \n\n---->>> Finally, don't quit. Here's why: Remember back when you APPLIED to r/gradschool?? ......writing that essay, ......sweating over those letters of reference, .....struggling to pay your first installment?? You do not want to go through THAT again, EVER. Right? You are learning more than subject matter. \n\nThis heavy lifting WILL pay off. Promise. \n\n---->>> So look at it this way: this is your test. The \"Old Guard\" is making it tough. So guess what? Push back. Give it right back - do not let them WIN. **They** are the ones that YOU will be replacing. \n\nKeep that in mind. \n\nTrust the decision you made waaaaay back when you got into this school, this gig with this faculty. Don't second guess it now - it adds nothing..... especially when the world at large looks like it's falling apart. \n\nRight now, EVERYONE wants to fall apart. \n\nNot you. \n\n*cue the Rocky music*\n\nThis is your time. You ***know*** how you have to eat/sleep/train/prepare and finish. \n\n\n***So go do it.***\n\n\nAfter that, and you have snatched the degree from the jaws of school administrators, you can walk away from this stupidity and NEVER look back. \n\n__[\u2022]-[\u2022]__",

If, however, OP's statement is meant as a comment on the weather, then sure, Texas is a cold place.  Similarly, the lowest ever recorded temperature in Qatar is 1.5\u00b0C (34.7\u00b0F), so I guess because of that, Qatar is also a cold place.",
