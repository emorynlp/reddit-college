Remember this is the time of the semester that sucks for everyone.  The advice already given is useful. Baby steps. Self-care.

Absolutely. Let's face it, Wikipedia should not be quoted per se, but if you are completely topic-challenged, look to Wikipedia *footnotes/references* Keeping reading til you get academic-worthy resources. \n\nYou will finish this THING. \n\n---->>> Finally, don't quit. Here's why: Remember back when you APPLIED to r/gradschool?? ......writing that essay, ......sweating over those letters of reference, .....struggling to pay your first installment?? You do not want to go through THAT again, EVER. Right? You are learning more than subject matter. \n\nThis heavy lifting WILL pay off. Promise. \n\n---->>> So look at it this way: this is your test.
