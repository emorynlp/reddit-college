  "text": "...and they were all positive! I was so nervous all semester that I was screwing up somehow, that I wasn't reaching my students because of the online format, that they wouldn't like me for one reason or another. Getting positive evaluations back at the end of the semester makes me feel so validated and I now know that all of the hard work prepping for class and grading assignments this semester was worth it.",

Both labs I was ta'ing ended up being total fiascos trying to keep parity between in person and online students. \n\nBetween constantly changing deadlines, chaoticly unorganized canvas pages being built in [real time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrmZIgVoQw4), and constant equipment failures coupled with the collection of inexplicable data from technical limitations (imposed so the online students can do it), and there was basically zero morale in either of them.\n\nI know it's a hard semester for everyone, but I had maybe two students who would try something or engage, the rest literally gave up after the first setback in any lab session.   I can't see any of them filling out a positive evaluation lol.",

      "text": "Congrats!\n\nFor those who get course evals back that are less positive, remember that studies have shown they can be biased against women, against people who have accents different from the students' accent, and against members of other groups historically underrepresented in academia. They also don't correlate well with student learning. So a positive eval means the students enjoyed your teaching despite their biases and everything going on, which is amazing, but a negative one doesn't necessarily mean you're a bad instructor. \n\nThey're still worth considering, though, especially the details: did students appreciate the detailed feedback, did you speak too quickly/slowly, etc. Just make sure to take negativity with substantial heapings of salt, especially if you're a member of a historically excluded group.",
