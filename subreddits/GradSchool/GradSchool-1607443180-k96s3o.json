They also don't correlate well with student learning. So a positive eval means the students enjoyed your teaching despite their biases and everything going on, which is amazing, but a negative one doesn't necessarily mean you're a bad instructor. \n\nThey're still worth considering, though, especially the details: did students appreciate the detailed feedback, did you speak too quickly/slowly, etc. Just make sure to take negativity with substantial heapings of salt, especially if you're a member of a historically excluded group.", "author": "omearabrian", "created": 1607449177, "upvotes": 153}, "gf2lqar": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/k96s3o/im_a_firsttime_ta_and_just_got_my_course/gf2lqar/", "text": "Ah fuck.
