  "text": "So, the department I graduated in just published a PhD position. The department is really small and everyone knows each other. I graduated last year and right now I'm about to publish my thesis in an upcoming conference, and the department head will by the last co-author of my paper (she didn't actually take part in it, just skimmed through it briefly basically - but still). I could just expand and move forward with my MSc thesis and turn it into a PhD. Basically it's a golden chance. On paper.\n\nAlso, this position is in Germany, and it's advertised full time. People with experience of PhDs in Germany will know that this is a BIG deal - usually PhD positions in Germany are officially advertised as part time (50 or 75%) and 100% is very rare and usually only reserved for computer science or high end engineering stuff in private companies and things. The uni is among the best in the country, with great networking and a lot of other benefits in a place I love. So it's a great opportunity all around.\n\nHowever...\n\nI feel like I'm worth nothing. Throughout my entire M.Sc. I felt like I just stumbled my way across things, never learning anything. The course is relatively \"techy\" and I came from a humanities background, so I really struggled and even my thesis was the \"least techy\" one in my class. At the beginning of my thesis semester I got this close to quitting because I just couldn't cope with the stress of not being able to put together a topic, not managing to understand things and just feeling like I was not up to standards. I cried a lot and if I didn't quit it was only because of a fantastic supervisor that was oh so patient with me and helped me through the initial stages. Still, when I graduated I didn't feel like I was actually worth it, I just felt I'd gotten lucky.\n\nAdditionally, this position involves teaching. And, me being a worthless piece of crap, I am TERRIFIED of teaching ANYTHING to ANYONE. I feel like I could never possibly know enough about any subject to be able to teach it to someone else - especially not \"techy\" stuff!! And my course is one of those courses where a lot of \"older\" (by uni standards) people apply because of its nature, people that maybe have years of work experience on their back and might be pros on some of the stuff that gets taught in the course. I had classmates like those, they breezed through the M.Sc. So I feel like I just wouldn't give any added value on that front and might actually be an hindrance, and a shameful joke for the whole department.\n\nMy head is a whole mess of \"why would I even bother applying, there's gonna be so many better candidates, why should I even embarrass myself this way by putting forward my application blah blah blah\".\n\nYes I already have a therapist.\n\nThat said, the position is appealing, and I can't help but thinking what if.\n\nI don't know which kind of advice I'm looking for. I guess I just wanted to vent my frustration.",
