  "text": "I\u2019m getting ready to ask for letters of recommendation but I\u2019m not sure how the process works with online applications. Do I need to send the letter writer a list of the programs I\u2019m applying to? Do they give me the letter and I then submit it myself? Is it something else entirely? I don\u2019t want to ask for something that I don\u2019t understand myself, so any help is appreciated!",
