  "text": "Hi all, I'm at the beginning of my third year in a STEM program (PhD, USA) and I'm finding it really difficult to remember why I'm here. I struggle every day to shovel through mountains of self-doubt and insecurity and get one small thing done, only to be back before the mountain the next day. I have been in my program for two years now, and I feel like I don't have anything to show for my time here. I'm just stressed and scared all the time, impostor syndrome pumped to the max. It's really taking a toll on my mental health.\n\nRecently, I thought things were getting better, but now I'm realizing that this may have just been a small window of confidence in a sea of paralyzing self-doubt. I don't know how to be a scientist, and I don't think I'm learning how to do so in my current lab. My advisor is very hands-off, which it turns out was not a good choice for me, and I just feel like I'm on a spinning hamster wheel. Something has to change.\n\nI'm currently in a really bad place, so I know I should wait until I'm mentally stable to consider such a life-changing move as leaving grad school or taking a leave of absence. But anyone who's gone through it and has advice to share on the thought process, please do. How did you make your decision (one way or the other), how did it turn out, what do you wish you'd known or thought of? I'm struggling to fight this jump-ship feeling, but at the same time I know it's a valid option if I feel this is not for me.\n\nAdvice very welcome, thanks in advance!",

      "text": "Go see a mental health professional. I had bad anxiety and self doubt that started around the start of the third year and had similar feelings. I ended up getting on an anti-anxiety med and doing counseling and it\u2019s helped a lot. \n\nAlso if you have a good advisor and feel comfortable with them, let them know you\u2019re struggling with mental health. Mine was very supportive and understanding and took some things off my plate for me that were causing more stress. Hopefully yours is the same, I\u2019m lucky to have my PI. If nothing else hopefully they can point you in the right direction for help and will be aware of your situation. It depends on your PI though and don\u2019t share if you\u2019re not comfortable. \n\nAs for the leave of absence I say do not do it unless you have already decided to leave. If you have decided to leave don\u2019t leave right away, take a leave of absence just in case you just needed some time away to regather yourself. I\u2019ve found taking a week off once or twice a year (outside the holidays) is great for me and helps my productivity in the lab. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not impossible to switch labs. It might set you back a year or two, but if you end up with a more hands on PI or just a better environment that can make a big difference on your feelings towards yourself and your work.",
