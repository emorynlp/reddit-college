  "text": "I have been contemplating on when to start applying. I have my SoP readied but I do think that I might make it better. \n\nSome of my seniors who are grad students said that the applications are reviewed in the sequence they are received and applying early might benefit. Any insights on this?",

      "text": "I work graduate admissions. If there's rolling admissions, then it is worth it to apply sooner, as your application gets reviewed and more likely to end up being accepted. The problem with that is that if you don't apply early during rolling admissions, you can end up being a great candidate and get waitlisted. Hence some programs don't do rolling admissions. For those programs, you don't have to submit early, but don't submit late or near the end. Not because there's some sort of sequence, but rather because you can encounter all kinds of issues, maybe your college is late at submitting your transcript, GRE is notoriously slow at sending results to colleges, letters of recommendation don't get sent in in a timely manner. I've seen plenty of professors and other professionals wait till after the deadline to send in the letter. Doing things with a month or two of anticipation, is for the best. You got any issues, the folks in admissions are more willing to help you. Wait till after the deadline to fix a mistake that could have been prevented with some planning, they are less willing to help you, especially for a program with a high volume of applications.",

Depending on the system the application uses, i'd suggest making sure the recommendation gets in just fine. you could wait till November to submit everything. does that program have rolling admissions?
