Some people need more time to recharge their batteries than others or have different family obligations.  Whatever is the correct balance for you is healthy.\n\nIf you can get research done all while getting through courses, qualifying exams, and doing as much of the extra stuff as you feel is necessary to hit your goals (conferences, outreach, applying for fellowships) while taking all weekend off every weekend, more power to you.  I know some people like that, and they are usually exceptionally smart and focused.  Many of them had children in grad school, which forced them to be laser focused with their time by necessity.  The nature of academia/grad school/research is there is always more you could be doing, so you have to decide when you set those boundaries and make room for other things in your life.  Making room for some of those things is really important--but sometimes it comes at a cost.\n\nThere is a rough, but imperfect correlation between how much you work and your success in graduate school, while acknowledging that no one gets much done when they are totally burnt out.

As for your second question, sometimes. But it's less out of the obligation that I feel it's necessary, and more that I find myself chipping away at something when I'm up early and motivated. Afternoons and evenings tend to be non-work times.\n\nBut the longer story is that sometimes, investing time for homework on weekends is necessary. Sometimes, you might not have time during the weekdays to really give your homework the brow-furrowing and thinking needed.  Other times, people in your class might only be able to meet during certain days of the week.\n\nI think the bigger learning experience this points to is setting healthy work boundaries for yourself, as well as extending those to your personal and professional relationships with people in your classes and your advisor. This is especially true in the age of COVID and political unrest we're experiencing now. That said, when you do get past classes and comprehensive exams, it's easier to not work on the weekends since there are no pressures to do graded work (although the slow burn of research is a different story).\n\nBottom line, I recommend taking a day on the weekend and turning it into your recharging day. Don't do any work, and if you can help it, don't check/respond to e-mail. Also, turn off DropBox notifications and e-mail notifications on your phone in general. It takes some getting used to, but it also means that you have dedicated time off. I know the other side of this, which is procrastinating your way through the day. You still get a day off, but the anxiety/guilt/existential dread you get from not doing work you think you should be doing is harder to wash off.\n\nMost importantly, especially in times like this, forgive yourself. You only worked a couple of hours one day? Take that as a sign that you need rest. Use your downtime to make a goal of doing at least one important task the next day.

You might have to experiment to see which boundaries work best for you. You might have to or want to occasionally be flexible with your boundaries. I have seen other grad students with all different sets of boundaries do really well. The ones who do the worst are the ones with no boundaries at all, who feel obligated to work all the time. This definitely leads to burn out and decreased productivity and decreased happiness. \n\nJust as a point of reference, im in a pure math PhD program. I\u2019m a night owl and a late sleeper, and I enjoy leisurely mornings, so an ideal week for me looks like Monday through Friday, starting work around 2 and working until sometime between 6 and 8, depending how much energy and focus I have. I don\u2019t return to work after dinner. It\u2019s not long hours, but if I\u2019m actually focused, I can get a lot done. I only work later if I\u2019m really interested in something I\u2019m working on or it absolutely must be done. Remember that you can turn in incomplete and imperfect work\u2014in my program this is pretty acceptable. I did this much more in grad school than in undergrad. I usually let myself off the hook earlier on Friday because Friday. Sometimes I do less work during the week if some family or social thing comes up. Sometimes I walk away from work to do errands. Saturday is a genuine day off. Sunday is a day for chores and relaxing. \n\nIn reality, things go wrong. I suffer chronic migraines, so I ended up with about two unproductive days this week. Some of it I\u2019m just going to let be a loss, but some stuff must be done, so even though it\u2019s Saturday, I\u2019m going to work a little so I don\u2019t start next week off behind. If I\u2019m really behind or really on a roll with my research, I might skip chores in favor of work on Sunday, but that\u2019s not ideal because then my house gets too messy. Sometimes I am unfocused during the day or over sleep, and end up working until 10pm or so to make up for it.
