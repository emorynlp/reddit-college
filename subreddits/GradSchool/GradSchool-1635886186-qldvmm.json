They are meant for times when something happened that prevents you from completing the class...\nFor example, when I was struggling with a serious health issue in undergrad, I took medical withdrawal from all of my classes. My transcript for that term is all Ws. In my grad apps, I briefly explained what happened. It did not stop me from getting into grad programs.",
