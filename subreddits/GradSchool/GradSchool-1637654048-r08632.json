  "text": "I was applying to Princeton and for some reason thought that my permanent address would be the same as my mailing address so i never put it.\n\nThen when i hit review, it says \"missing mailing address\", and i couldn't find it in 3 minutes time before the deadline and unfortunately the deadline passed and now i can no longer apply. \n\nI immediately emailed a professor i was in contact with since October and CC'd the graduate d\u00e9partement asking if i could just fill this minor detail in and pay the application fee as  all my documents are uploaded.\n\nWhat are the chances they will retroactively allow me to apply?",
