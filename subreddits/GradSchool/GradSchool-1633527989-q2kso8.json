  "text": "Hello all,\n\nUsing this throwaway account to be on the safer side!\n\nI recently joined my Ph.D. in STEM in one of the top schools. But I am not at all happy with the lab that I am in. The thing is my salary comes from my PI's fund. So I am really torn between leaving the lab and staying here.  It's been almost 5 months in my 4 year Ph.D. program. I really need some help.\n\nFirst of all, I want to know if the things I point below are normal or I am being too critical since I don't like the lab.\n\n1. PI is too controlling and micromanaging: To the extent that all the postdocs ever hired in the lab stayed here for less than a year, 3 PhD students left the lab in the last three years ( one very recently after I joined), because, either the PI fires them or they leave whenever they could. It makes me afraid so much that I may be the next target. I feel that expectations are too high and often unreasonable. I don't know how common it is to expect Ph.D. students to do experiments, write weekly reports, meet with PI weekly, do TA, order lab supplies, and mentor bachelor and master students.\n2. We have weekly individual meetings with PI, which I think is good since it is the only time we can get feedback. My PI is super responsive. It is very likely that I get replies within 2-3 hours of sending emails.  However, let's say, my weekly meeting is on Wednesday, my PI wants me to send my data or experimental plan 1 day before the meeting, which adds a lot of stress every week.  These discussions are seldom casual and I am always on high alert to not offend. This has taken a toll on my mental health.\n3. Lab duties:  I know that it is common to be assigned lab duties as part of our Ph.D. training. However, we don't have a technician in our lab. We, students, take care of lab orders, prepare buffers, replenish reagents and supplies, which sucks a lot of our time. I get 10-20 emails every day from our PI and suppliers about orders, all logistic bullshit to do this, and that. I spend a significant amount of my time doing these rather than thinking and directing my project.\n4. I was gathering info on why postdocs leave the lab. Now I know that my PI can't accept someone who disagrees with them or design experiments independently. It has to be their way ALWAYS.  Our lab is very interdisciplinary. So there are close to zero overlaps between projects and we are on our own. Now that the lab is moving more towards biology, we really need people trained in the field to help teach techniques, collaborate and discuss.  PI refuses to hire a trained person who can nourish the lab atmosphere. We are like 12 Ph.D. students and we all need to depend on our PI for inputs, questions, doubts, discussions.\n5. Is it normal for PIs to not trust their students? It happens a lot that my PI asks another student to repeat my experiment right in front of me because I did not get the desired results that my PI wants.\n6. I do not like the project that I am given. One reason being, my PI did not provide proper information on what they have tried before ( this is not a project from scratch. Some preliminary tests have been done). Neither did PI  discuss why it is important to do this project and what we are trying to achieve. It was more like, I hired you for this project, so do it. I tried to tell him in subtle ways that it is not what I like, but he chooses not to listen. I feel more like a robot than a human. I am being told what to do at each and every step.\n7. It is tough to approach my PI. I understand advisor-student relationships need not be personal. But I feel it should not be robotic.  The very notion that I can't talk to my advisor freely is bugging me. It is all too rigid, suffocating, and killing my passion for science.\n\nGood thing - One thing that stops me from taking a decision is that I was able to get into as 5th author within the first two months of my joining,working on one more paper as well and I do feel that if I work really hard ( forget work-life balance) chances of publishing are quite high with this lab. \n\nI spoke to my program coordinator, the program director. They did not help me much. What I hear from them is that I should give more time and see if this works. But what I feel is, more I delay worse it will be.\n\nAre these valid reasons to change labs? IS it too late to change now? I really don't know if I can approach professors discreetly. Please help!",

      "text": "It is never too late to change labs. Will it take longer for you to defend? Probably. Is that better than dealing with the myriad of issues you've listed? Probably. I have had peers switch in their 4th year and get out during 7th year. You'll need to find a PI who really is an ally to students and perhaps has experience working with later stage lab switches. \n\nHave you spoken to your thesis chair? Or is your PI your chair? I hate programs that make your PI your thesis chair. A thesis chair is supposed to act as a buffer and mediate between the PI and student. When was your last committee meeting? Those are scary and very easy to put off, but they can be helpful in situations like this. Depending on your committee situation, it might be worth exploring adding another person, perhaps more senior than your PI, to your committee to shake things up a bit. \n\nWhere did the other PhD students go? Did they all go to different labs, or did they drop out? I would talk to them for advice. \n\nThe last option is a nuclear one, but it worked for me. Towards the end of my PhD, there were a lot of issues and things weren't really moving along, as I wasn't receiving much guidance or attention from my PI in terms of planning an exit route and writing up my research. It got to be unbearable, emotionally, mentally, and physically. I went to my PI and basically gave her a soft ultimatum: if we didn't come up with a plan for me to get out of here in a year, I was going to have to leave. I explained how this was taking a toll on my health. Surprisingly, it worked. Now, my PI didn't like anyone disagreeing with her on the science, but was far more passive about it than what you describe. I also was fully prepared to master out at that point, so I wasn't bluffing. Somehow, she seemed to respect my scientific opinions a lot more after that too. Use extreme caution.",

      "text": "It is perfectly fine to change if you want to. You need to talk to your PI, or like u/PupperMerlin has mentioned, your committee chair. But keep in mind, it is likely that you may experience something similar in other labs. There is no shame in changing a situation which has become toxic for you. The saving grace is that you realize this early  in the process.",
