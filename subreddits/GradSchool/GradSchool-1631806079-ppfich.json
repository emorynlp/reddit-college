  "text": "I recently had a friend tell me the story about how on the first day of orientation for their Master's, they gathered into a room with their peers to learn more information about the program. After some general introductions, everyone went around the room and stated their name, who our supervisor was and something \"interesting\" about themselves. When it was their turn, they mispronounced their supervisor's name, which became clear to them and everyone else around when the person sitting behind them said their supervisor's name differently (i.e., correctly). They said the worst part of this was that their supervisor heard them mispronounce their name, because they were standing at the front of the room. They still get along just fine though!",

I was so excited to work with equipment and make a good impression - and I broke a mercury thermometer while we were setting up. I was mortified at the time, but now it's funny - refreshing to get the first broken thing out of the way.",

      "text": "1) in my graduate statistical mechanics class, I sarcastically responded to \" I have some exercises for you to do\" with \"jumping jacks?\" The prof ran with it, chuckled and said \"yup. GET DOWN YOU MAGGOTS!\"...only to realize the door was open and two undergrads in the hall were staring in at him kinda weird. He just kinda poked his head out the door and said \"what? It's a hard class\".\n\n2) this was a little while back, but my first year in grad school I didn't yet have a car and used the University bus system to get to campus. I also at the time carried a backpack a lot to carry my books and laptop. When walking to the bus one day some girl chatted me up and started asking me about the bus schedule and school. We went back and forth for a few minutes before she said something that made me realize she was in high school. I asked how old she thought I was and she said \"you're like 16 right? You go to [insert name of local high school]?\" ...i had to kind of sheepishly say I was 26, in a PhD program, and walk away really awkardly... I knew i looked young for my age but I didn't think I looked that young.",

Happens quite a bit but breaks my soul a little bit every time. I\u2019m wondering how the students will respond to me when I start TAing next year lol",
