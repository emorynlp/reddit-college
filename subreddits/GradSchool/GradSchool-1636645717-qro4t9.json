  "title:": "Ten reasons my dissertation has been rejected from the electronic repository four times so far...",
  "text": "1. The title on the title page must be 2\" below the upper edge. Mine was at 1.85\n2. Headings must be centered. Mine were, but the paragraph indent made them shift .3 inches left of center.\n3. \"MAJOR\" headings must be capitalized. Apparently we disagree over what major means.\n4. Figure 10 spills over the right margin by less than a quarter inch.\n5. Arbitrary requirement not listed in guidelines\n6. Weird non standard table of contents format about the dots connecting the entry to the page number that took me twenty minutes to Google and overcome Word's auto formatting.\n7. Landscape orientation pages are okay, but only if the pager number is still oriented in portrait form. Cue more googling.\n8. Table 9 should not break over two pages. (Table 9 is 1.5 pages long? I think they want the top at the start of a new page but ???)\n9. Apparently setting page numbers 0.5\" from the margin in Word measures from the top of the number. My university admin measures from the bottom of the number. This 0.1\" discrepancy is unacceptable.\n10. It's a Thursday and some admin hack is grumpy.\n\nIf only there were just ten. Please dear lord do not let this be the reason I do not graduate.",

That's on you.\n\n>In the case of my institution's dissertation repository, it's a jumble of inconsistent and poorly communicated requirements,\n\nSurely you had classes before where the subject matter was worth learning, even though the professor didn't do a good job of explaining it? You should know better than to equate poor support at learning a thing with the value of learning the thing itself.\n\nThat being said, it would also have not been that difficult for you to download a few recently published dissertations at your institution and use them as models for your formatting to better understand the requirements. That's what I did. \n\n>where expectations are for professional grade formatting software but students are fighting with software like Word that doesn't have the capabilities to comply with the requirements.\n\nAnd you clearly don't know what you're talking about. \n\nWord can do what you're describing above in your list. You just don't know how to do it. \n\nAnd I'm betting they didn't suggest that you learn to use Microsoft Word styles, as that would have made your job even easier. For example, proper implementation of headings with Word styles would have required only a minute or two to change what you needed to all caps.\n\nPlus, you wouldn't want to have to learn InDesign for formatting your dissertation. Both because of the very steep learning curve, and because you might not have access to it again.\n\n>If you want to quibble over a tenth of an inch, you better provide me with tools to accurately measure that tenth of an inch.\n\nYou could help those who come after you by contacting the department at your university that teaches technical writing. Share the link to the dissertation formatting guidelines and accounting resources. Suggest to them that a student project creating a tutorial for how to implement those guidelines in Word would be very useful for those who come after you.\n\nHowever, if you make that contact with them a rant so you can feel better about your frustration that you have some unexpected last minute work to do on your dissertation, they might not listen to you.",
