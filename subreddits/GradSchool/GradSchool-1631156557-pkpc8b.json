  "text": "So the past week for me has simply been awful. I\u2019ve had such a hard time focusing on my classes. I\u2019m a 1st year PhD student in social sciences. \n\nSo over the weekend, there was a shooting very close to my apartment. I heard the gunshots - it was my first time hearing gunshots that weren\u2019t from deer hunting. Shootings/violence in the area are up, and my university isn\u2019t exactly known for being in the safest town. Guns/being a victim of a stray bullet freak me out like I can\u2019t even explain. I was CONSUMED with trying to figure out what happened and how to avoid getting shot by a stray bullet. I couldn\u2019t sleep and every noise or car driving by had me holding my breath. \n\nNext comes my hospital visit on Friday. I had had leg pain for days and was concerned it could be serious, so I went in for an ultrasound. They didn\u2019t find anything (of course) and my leg is back to normal, but I was freaked out for a few days. \n\nTHEN I got into a car accident (my fault, too) and today I found out that my car is totaled. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I haven\u2019t gotten my first grad assistant paycheck yet. I don\u2019t think I can afford another car. I\u2019m lucky in that I live in a town with an excellent bus system, but omg. \n\nI\u2019m just at my breaking point. So many bad things happened and I\u2019m going to be ruined financially. The gunshots already ruined any sanity I had. \n\nIs it possible to have PTSD when you\u2019ve had no former traumatic event? Like I\u2019ve never been a shooting victim or involved in a shooting in any way, but guns scare me so much to the point where I\u2019m afraid to leave my apartment, especially since hearing the shots across the street last week.",

Classes, homework, my job, I also got into a car wreck that was a hit and run, and I\u2019ve been having a lot of anxiety focused on my relationship and future. I\u2019m currently searching for a therapist and I think going to one would really help you, too.",

      "text": "Hi OP. Just want to check in here about this kind of paranoia you are feeling. I have similar issues and ended up needing medication for it, so I encourage you to seek a psychiatrist who can help you determine if this is treatable through medication or if you would benefit from therapy. If you want to know a bit more about my own symptoms and diagnosis please DM me, I am not a doctor at all but it might be good for you to have it assessed in case you can make your life a bit easier through treatment. Also, my school offered the first 6 meetings with the psych and therapist for free as a student, so look into that as well, I know money is tight with all that happened to you!",

      "text": "Go to your counseling center at school and find someone to talk to. You may even be able to do a walk in appt to get started. As for the car, do you know if your insurance covers the cost of a rental? It may cost less than you would think. Being afraid of stray bullets is perfectly reasonable in my opinion, but as long as the violence isn\u2019t happening literally on your block it seems like a remote possibility. (Still scary to hear it at all, but the sound might carry from quite a distance away.) Don\u2019t pressure yourself to read or study when you\u2019re feeling all mixed up inside\u2014 it will only make you feel worse. But, if you can find a way to set aside all of your worries for a little while, having a few hours of concentrated study time might be good for you. I know sometimes it can help me tire out my mind so that I worry less. Hang in there, it\u2019s a lot of adjustments right now but sooner or later you\u2019ll be in a better place and you\u2019ll back at this crazy time in the rear view mirror.",

          "text": "Not yet. I definitely have underlying anxiety or high-functioning anxiety, especially about driving and getting shot randomly. \n\nI\u2019ve never been a fan of driving, but I think in recent years I\u2019ve just gotten more and more fearful of driving. I don\u2019t get anxiety riding with other people or on public transport, just when I drive. I know that my most probable cause of death at my age would be a car accident, so driving makes me very nervous in general. \n\nBECAUSE SHIT HAPPENS. It was my first accident, first ticket. Idk. All the stress from hearing the gunshots across the street, to the supposed blood clot\u2026yeah. \n\nI\u2019m afraid of dying. I have a very strong aversion to anything that might jeopardize my life. I\u2019m afraid to just EXIST because I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s possible that I could legit just be lying in bed and I could be shot by a stray bullet because they can go through walls because I read one comment on Facebook once about a student here who was just chilling in their apartment and a bullet went through multiple rooms. That shit scares the shit out of me. \n\nI think my fear of gun violence has gotten really really strong over the past few year. It just happens so much in the US. You hear about one incident and then it\u2019s like it happens all the time. Logically I know that I\u2019m unlikely to be hit by stray bullet, but it\u2019s always in the back of my mind because I know it\u2019s a possibility.",

      "text": "Take a deep breath. This is a lot to handle at any point in life, especially when you are getting used to a new program, perhaps a new town, etc. Talk to family/friends if you can, but seriously consider looking into any counseling programs your university offers. They can likely help you to process the shooting and your fear of stray bullets.\n\nAs far as  the car goes, take the bus for now and wait for the insurance money to come in (hopefully you will get some). Then, once you've come down from your stress a little, you can reevaluate buying a new car. There shouldn't be a reason why an accident ruins you financially (again, assuming you have insurance). You may have penalties and fees if you were at fault, and surely these can be a lot, but you will figure it out and it'll turn out okay. \n\nAs far as your leg goes, try not to worry about what could have been, and focus instead on everything being okay. If you find yourself catastrophizing things/in a negative spiral, try making a list of the worst possible outcomes that could happen. Sometimes just listing our fears out loud make us realize that they are ridiculous or nothing to fear. \n\nAlso, if you can, take a day or two to truly take a break. Watch TV all day if you need, go hiking, paint a picture, whatever calms you and makes you feel in control and rejuvenates. You went through a lot and it's okay to procrastinate everything for a day or two to give your head a break. \n\nSending positive vibes your way.",

I hope I get more than like $300 for it. A used engine alone can cost like $1600. \n\nFWIW, my PT didn\u2019t have any side airbags, so maybe it wasn\u2019t super safe to begin with.",
