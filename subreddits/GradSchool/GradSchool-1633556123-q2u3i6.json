  "title:": "Do Grad Schools care where you did your undergrad?",
  "text": "I'm an undergrad currently attending a somewhat prestigious (?) state school, or at least that's what I've been told. I have been looking to transfer to a T-25 school for next fall, and hope to do a PhD after I graduate. \n\nI was pretty fixed on transferring schools, however, I just got a research position at a lab that researches something related to my career plans. They offered me the opportunity to co-author a paper, but this is contingent on me dedicating at least a year to the project, to get some meaningful data. \n\nI know that the school I'm seeking to transfer to has many amazing labs in my area of interest --that is why I want to go there. But I feel that I may be wasting a decent opportunity to fully develop a research project, trying to please an admissions officer who may not even care.  \n\nSo, the question is, should I stay at my current school, or would it look better if I transferred to a more prestigious university?\n\nTIA!",

      "text": "Not really, it\u2019s all about what you did in undergrad, not where you did it. \n\nStudents at elite undergrad institutions are probably generally more serious students who are more likely to pursue academic opportunities, and elite institutions generally will have more institutional support and opportunities to take advantage of. They also have a potential advantage that their professors who write their letters of recommendation are more likely to be known to the admissions committee. \n\nIf you\u2019re a serious student with some decent enough mentorship and good research opportunities that you\u2019re taking advantage of though, I think it matters very little where you went to undergrad.\n\nIf it came down to having a diploma from a more prestigious undergrad institution or having a publication, the publication is going to go a lot further in getting you into grad school.",
