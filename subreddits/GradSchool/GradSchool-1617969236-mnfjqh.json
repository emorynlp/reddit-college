  "text": "For me personally, getting two years of work experience was very valuable. I learned so much more about how a professional environment functions and how to act in the work place and that it made me much more mature. Work is not like school-- everyone will not be your friend-- but you have to act professional otherwise you could lose your job. I've found that interviews and writing essays were so much easier when I had actual work experiences to go off of instead of just what I was learning in classes. Also, I've found it'll be easier to get more jobs now with 2 years of experience and a Masters degree. \n\n  \nDisclaimer: This all obviously depends on your career path but for me I'm so happy I worked before grad school.",

They have a workday mentality -- a set time when they work, time when they don't work, and good sense of what work actually needs time. When things aren't going well, they speak up and address it. Honestly if our base dept funding was for some reason set in part by how many people complete the program on time, I'd tell our faculty to never admit people straight from undergrad.",

Especially in the age of zoom university.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy first 2 weeks of online university were last Fall and I had zero compassion from professors because:\n\n1. I missed a quiz because my Zoom calendar was wrong, I came to class 10 minutes late ended up costing me a B and I got a B- in the class - still very very pissed about it. Professor's only response was \"tardiness is explained in the course syllabus blah blah\". It was a really honest mistake, if I was late for work by 10 minutes no one would say a thing.\n2. Exam was 4 questions long (100 points), my respondus browser couldn't read one of the questions, so instead of dropping the exam to a total score out of 75, professor weighted the other 3 questions to a higher grade to total 100. I ended up failing the 3rd question so my mid-term was a D.\n3. The most egregious imo is the professor teaching for example how to solve a problem with code one way and me being like \"nah, I know a better way\" and outputting the desired result in half the work. Professor legit docked me points because she said I did it the wrong way. This has happened to me 3 or 4 times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally the problem is professors who've never worked, who've only been involved in school, so they have this very uptight attitude in terms of how to do things. In real life: if I'm an hour or two late for a project deadline or I fucked up my work, my manager will sit me down, have a convo and say \"get back to me in a week now that we've explained what I want better\".\n\nI frankly wish I never worked as an engineer in industry because so much of college feels like BS now. Don't get me wrong: I love the material, I'm learning alot, but it's already stressful enough with ADHD having to do online classes and work - no compassion.",

I always suggest people work after college rather than go straight to grad school because in my opinion, grad school isn't necessary and you learn a lot more from real world experiences. And, if it IS necessary for your career, you'll know.\n\nFor one of my internships in grad school, they had to teach people how to send emails because for a lot of interns who were undergrads, they just... didn't have that basic skill. Overall, I found that having work experience helps instill confidence in knowing that you've already worked in the real world and know how to act in a professional setting as well as balance work with life.",

I started babysitting at 12 and a paper route at 13, so I was no stranger to work but there is such a difference between undergrad and grad school (at least in my STEM PhD) and I think having a full-time job allowed me to adjust to working full-time in a lab and also allowed me to know what I wanted to study in grad school, which was different from my undergrad research). I definitely think it helped me navigate the politics of labs better than some students who went straight from undergrad to grad school. Plus, it just gave me a few years of time away from school. My salary was the same as my stipend in grad school, so unfortunately I didn't save much, but it did make it so I felt like going back was what I wanted.",

Sure, nothing that happens during grad school will be the worst thing to ever happen to me, but that's because the worst things I've experienced are truly fucking awful. \n\nI don't buy into the idea that trauma makes us stronger or better or more successful because the vast majority of people with my background do not have the same outcome as I did.

A whole lot of casual customer service jobs. Every time he manages to get his foot into something less casual, the company does layoffs or restructuring and he loses his job again. Living hand to mouth *and* not having job security is just so terrifying. It's so easy for them to shed any worker who's not at the top.\n\n>I do wish sometimes that I had a more normal 9-5 though.\n\nI guess this one must vary a lot between groups. I don't have any mandated hours and I don't have to clock in 9-5. As long as I get the minimal amount of work done, it's good enough, and the minimum is a really low bar. I think we push ourselves further because we want academic jobs. But if you're looking at industry then they want to see very different achievements and that extra paper you pushed out by doing double overtime for 3 months is worthless. So you may as well stick to 9-5, or even do less so you can spend a few hours each week on industry-aligned stuff.",

I entered my PhD program with several lines of inquiry because of my work experience, which has also helped, especially when one of them doesn't pan out to be super interesting to the field.\n\nI don't know if I'm \"thankful.\" I'm 33 and still in coursework, which is kind of an awkward conversation with people, but I don't necessarily regret taking this path either. It all worked out pretty well, but I'm sure there are people who are just as motivated who didn't live a previous lifetime before starting their PhD.",

There was a noticeable demarcation between PhD scholars with industry experience and those who had come into the program straight from their undergrad/Masters program. This was primarily an ability to bring different perspectives to their research, but also applied to how well people dealt with things like effective communication, time management and resilience.\n\nI think in an ideal world you would actually make non-academic work experience a pre-requisite to doing a PhD, such is the impact it has on your performance.",
