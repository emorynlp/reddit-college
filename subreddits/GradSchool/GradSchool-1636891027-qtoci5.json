  "text": "I really like to have background noise so normally have podcasts on a low volume whilst I work.\n\nI normally listen to quite a narrow band of podcasts \n\n1. Stuff you should know\n2. Gus and Eddy (until the recent drama/revelations about Gus)\n\nI've seen people go mad for JRE etc and having casually listsened to a couple of his episodes I kind of get it but I want something less controversial.\n\nWhat do you listen to?",

I've never heard of the two you listed, so my suggestions may not be your cup of tea. \n\n My current favorite is Sawbones: A marital tour through misguided medicine (the name is spot on). They've had the show for years, so there's quite a bit of content! If hearing about the crazy things humans have done in the name of medicine doesn't do it for you, but you still want some scientific themed podcasts, I recently started listening to Naked Scientists. It's different, but interesting!",

      "text": "I worked a data entry job where I did a lot more podcast listening than I do now and have listened through a lot of different stuff. I used to love Stuff You Should Know, but after listening to some episodes where I knew the topic well, they tended to be very sloppy in their research. I like entertainment news podcasts a lot + some paleontology ones I listen to occasionally if I want an easy way to catch up on a topic in my field.\n\nWeekly Planet Podcast - 2 cynical Australians  talk about movie news\n\nHow Did This Get Made -Great bad movie podcast, though I find I prefer their older episodes\n\nGame Scoop/ Nintendo Voice Chat - IGN video game news podcasts (people complain about IGN but I like the more low-key, positive vibes compared with a lot of other gaming podcasts I\u2019ve found (I would be interested in new recommendations though.)\n\nGrad School Confessional - pretty new but I\u2019m enjoying it so far\n\nPodcast the Ride - Theme Park discussions, lots of tangents though. I don\u2019t listen to all the episodes. Start with the failed theme park episode it is one of my all time favorite podcast episodes\n\nThe Dungeoncast - DnD lore another nice low key one. I pick and choose episodes from this one too.\n\nPalaeocast - More formal research interviews with paleontologists\n\nPaleo Nerds- Less formal personal type interviews with paleontologists\n\nScience Sort of - General science run by a paleontologist interviewing mostly grad students\n\nAnd of course audiobooks from the library through the Libby or OverDrive apps.",

      "text": "It\u2019s worth going through the archives of John McWhorter\u2019s Lexicon Valley on Slate/its current platform. The podcast explains curious aspects of language and how people speak, so I\u2019ve learned a lot! The Slate podcast is now listed under the name Spectacular Vernacular, but all episodes from 2018 to July 2021 were hosted by McWhorter. You\u2019ve got at least 70 hours of listening material there. \n\nHardcore History rarely posts, but each episode is 5-6 hours long and full of vivid details, so they\u2019ll keep you engaged the whole time. You need to pay for access to episodes from past years, but $1.99 for 6 hours of entertainment isn\u2019t a bad deal. Recent episodes are free to listen to \u2014 I especially enjoyed the Painfotainment one.\n\nThe Dropout tells the story of Elizabeth Holmes from the origins of her business ambitions, to the eventual discovery of her fraud. All in all, it\u2019s only 8 hours of listening material, but well researched and well-told.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand why Joe Rogan has the number one podcast when there are so many better ones. I don\u2019t find his personality compelling, and his reliance on anecdotes about his friends as evidence is annoying.",

Topical news show, typically half an hour per episode but released daily \n\n- Rabbit Hole by The New York Times. Documentary series looking at online extremism and algorithms on social media\n\n- The Experiment by The Atlantic. Cultural programme typically focusing on American culture. Half an hour per episode released every week or two\n\n- Crazy Genius by The Atlantic. Technology and science focussed. Not produced anymore but a back catalogue of 3 series\n\n- The Lead by The Athletic. Sports-based daily podcast. Typically focussed on American football, basketball, and ice hockey but a little extra variation sometimes\n\n- A Thorough Examination by Loftus Media. Documentary series on rise of ultra-processed foods in diets worldwide\n\n- The Food Chain by the BBC. Documentary series on food and technology",
