While this works, I found in my experimentation that it introduces extra, unnecessary steps compared to running native Ubuntu (ex. I had to run a set of commands each time I accessed WSL/Ubuntu to make sure that x-windows was working properly for that session to ensure I could display the plots I was making) either via dual-boot or simply wiping windows and converting the PC to a Linux machine.\n\nWith a Mac, you have direct access to the terminal, and by enabling of a few \"developer options\" basically treat the system as a Linux machine. However, because of the recent switch to the M1 chip, you may run into some smaller or unmaintained programs/code that don't run natively on the system yet, in addition to the extra complication that comes from macOS being an implementation of BSD, not Linux. However, these issues are rapidly being solved given the large user-base within the academic and developer communities.\n\nUltimately based on how you've described your familiarity with Linux, I would dual-boot a PC if I were in your position; but I don't think you can really go wrong with whatever choice you make. It's just a matter of choosing which set of inconveniences won't bother you as much as the others.", "author": "monoDK13", "created": 1630849254, "upvotes": 4}, "hbokjsi": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pibzaz/ubuntu_in_pc_or_mac/hbokjsi/", "text": "All OSes have decent enough data science support.

Seek some reviews of the m1 in a data science context.\n\nTo complicate things, windows supports Linux as a core feature using its subsystem for Linux. You can install Ubuntu from the Windows store and use as if native. The major caveat being gpu acceleration for ds workloads is coming out in the next few months.\n\nAs for natively installing Linux on the PC.
