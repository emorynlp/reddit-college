  "title:": "The post college/grad school depression isn\u2019t nearly discussed enough",
  "text": "I (24NB) received my master\u2019s degree about six months ago now and started my first \u201cbig person\u201d job in the non-profit world shortly after. On the surface, everything\u2019s going pretty well: my job is tolerable most days, I\u2019m valued and appreciated by my boss and coworkers, I\u2019m salaried full-time with benefits, and I\u2019m self-sufficient in a big city. \n\nI was more than ready to graduate too. I was dealing with a pretty significant case of burnout shortly before the pandemic hit and covid exacerbated it ten-fold. Receiving my diploma was perhaps the biggest sigh of relief I\u2019ve ever experienced. Now, I\u2019ve been out of school for a hot second but I\u2019m starting to miss it and I feel like I\u2019m missing a major part of my identity. \n\nThis is the first time in my life where I\u2019m not a student with no prospects of going back to school anytime soon and it\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling. I want to go back for a PhD in the future but my therapist and I have decided that I need some time off from school and I just need to experience life. I 100% agree with this decision but I\u2019ve been struggling with this post-graduation depression. I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. *What the hell do I do now?* keeps popping up in my head. \n\nLogically, my brain knows that grad school was fucking rough (especially during a pandemic) but I feel myself missing the routine, structure, and flexibility of being in school more times than not. In fact, the emotional part of me that is far too nostalgic for it\u2019s own good keeps reflecting on both undergrad and grad school and desperately wants that sense of familiarity back. \n\nI feel so lost.",

It's hard to walk away from.\n\nI don't have great answers for satiating that part that loves school, except that it is now a great time to learn something you never \"had time\" for before. For me, it's languages and soap making. I'm thinking when my husband gets a new job and leaves me with an excepted 1-year gap in cohabitation (academic careers, 2 body problem, blah blah blah), I'll take that time to sign up for a course at the community college nearby or something. \n\nYour degrees are over (unless you wanna be like, Bruce Banner I guess) but that doesn't mean learning new things or getting new qualifications stops.",

I had a class on pedagogy which a professor who I did not really respect (she hadn't been in a classroom since the 1990s but felt she was qualified to teach me how to run my classes and a lot of it turned out cringe-y) but with the issues I had with the class aside, there is a new sense of freedom in not caring about a grade. \n\nI mean, I have a PhD. Even if I get an A+ in this class, what are you gonna do with it? Put it in a file cabinet nobody will ever open? It's meaningless. If I fail, then what? Nothing. It gives you a sense of freedom in the classroom like I've never had before. You get to have your cake (new topics, the structure of the classroom) and eat it too (do your own pace, let assignments go undone, do assignments to your own standards.)",

I left grad school in a really dark place (mastered out) and it only took a few months in industry for my mental health to drastically improve. The biggest reason was that I was finally getting feedback on my work. Outside of my classes, I had next to no feedback, praise, or guidance of any kind during my PhD. I felt lost and like surely this must be my failing for not being motivated/driven/competent enough to figure out what to do and then just keep pushing at it on my own.\n\nTurns out advisors are supposed to give feedback and praise lol. Also, turns out my  coworkers think I'm pretty damned competent, and what do you know, my motivation problem isn't as much of a problem when I get enough feedback to feel confident continuing with my idea.",

I kept thinking \"now what?\" I felt stagnant, like if I wasn't chasing something or working towards something, what's the point of anything? If you're a type-A overachiever, this might be the case for you, too. So I guess I recommend finding a hobby that allows trackable mastery (beating a PR or something), or spending more time in therapy to figure out why you are mostly happy when you're accomplishing. These are the exact things I'm doing too lol, more therapy and I started going to Orangetheory. For me, I only got noticed at all by my parents if I was screwing up massively or achieving the absolute top possible marks in every area. So now I'm learning how to spend time being instead of doing.",

I had a hard time stepping away from it, too, but I\u2019m a healthier person for it. I don\u2019t want to go back to the headspace where what I study is so integral to my identity. It can let us make excuses for overworking and poor work-life balance. It can make failures seem really personal. I love what I do, but I\u2019m also glad to take breaks without guilt, have lots of hobbies, and just generally feel better. \n\nI mean, in any context, getting your graduate degree and landing a job like you did is amazing, right? You should be really proud, especially since you finished up during the pandemic. That was a huge challenge. Of course you have a lot of complicated emotions after all of that. Some of it just takes time, but I\u2019d also find something new you love. Is there a craft that interests you? Books on your reading list you want to get caught up on? Learn more about cooking?

I built resiliency, I realized my self-worth doesn\u2019t hinge on what people think of me, and I learned that most of the world doesn\u2019t give a hoot about the politics and perceptions within academia. Some of those things I had internalized really strongly were no big deal. Plus I currently out-earn many of my friends in academia, I still do research (although I\u2019m not a PI), and I have actual downtime now. \n\nI mean, I was managing a university lab when I went on my honeymoon, and the professor I worked for told me to have a great time and then proceeded to bombard me with emails. I never got a break. I am so happy I can disconnect now. The first few weeks at my new job, I\u2019d get anxiety in the evenings because I was used to waiting up for field crews to get back. I\u2019d wake up dreading my inbox. It took awhile to wind down from all of that.  \n\nJust remember, you\u2019re no less of an expert in your field. Nothing says you have to stop learning because you take a different job. I\u2019m still a member of a couple professional societies, and I have some of my old research going in my spare time. You could do that as well. And you\u2019ll forever be the person your friends and family bug if they have an economics question. :)\n\nIf all of that sounds really weird, imagine what you\u2019d tell a good friend going through the same thing. You\u2019d still value their expertise. You wouldn\u2019t want them to feel stressed about any of this. You\u2019d sincerely wish them well, and you might even be kind of jealous about some of the benefits they\u2019ll be getting. Always remember to be that kind to yourself, too!",

You are also attending lectures and seminars where you have a chance to socialize, and listen. You have time for doodling and letting your mind wander a little bit during the day.  When I am at work, I feel like any activity I do that is isn't directly work related is discouraged and I feel guilty about doing things as innocuous as checking the weather, or responding to a phone message.",

I was feeling burnt out and especially depressed that last semester, then joining the work force as a cog in the machine has felt kinda meaningless ever since despite the salary and benefits. I went from studying something I was genuinely interested in daily to working on whatever I'm supposed to for 40 hrs a week leaving me wondering what the hell to do with the free time. I try and study in my spare time, but without the structure, pressure of exams, and peers sharing common interests it's hard to be motivated. Like others have said, it's super helpful to pick up another hobby. I've started cooking more often, hiking, and spent time to renovate my bathroom.",

So for me it\u2019s been partly keeping in touch with old college friends and trying to constantly make new ones (since that\u2019s what college was like for me). It\u2019s continuing to learn new things outside of school. And part of what\u2019s also helped is learning to enjoy the benefits of not identifying as a student anymore. I\u2019m free after work. No homework or exams to study for. I could go out for drinks, binge a new show, actually have time to workout or cook. My weekends are free. I can take day/weekend trips to a place nearby. I have no time constraints (which is both a good and bad thing for me). \n\nTry to find some of the good things about identifying as a student and good things about no longer being a student.",

It could be as simple as joining a book club or playing video games with a few friends a couple of times a week if you're a more social person. If you're crafty, maybe try picking up something new (3D printing? Laser engraving?).\n\nIt's not clear from your post if you know many people where you're at, but a social support system with some sort of routine seems like it would be good for you.\n\nI've been working a full-time job with benefits since early 2019 and that's not at all enough to feel fulfilled. I'm actually quitting my full-time job without anything lined up because of the complete lack of enjoyment I get out of my work.\n\nDisclaimer: I (25NB) am also struggling with this, and have found that adding in routines (especially ones that help me socialize) has helped a lot.",

I\u2019ve been in therapy on and off for a decade and spent time out of academia and I just get bored when I\u2019m not intellectually stimulated. Exercise and hobbies help to a degree, but the only thing outside of research that has ever truly satisfied that need for me is rock climbing because it\u2019s physically challenging but also requires a lot of problem solving. \n\nPoint being, workaholism can just be the result of your personality type and isn\u2019t necessarily something you need to go to therapy for or work to change.",

It took me an additional year to graduate because I took breaks to do internships and even those semesters of full-time work don't compare to post-graduate depression.\n\nI'd recommend looking into a few things:\n\n* Now that you have arguably more free-time, due to the separation between work and non-work time, look for ways to quantify and gamify your hobbies and goals. I'm a huge gym rat and it's honestly so nice to have those goals in terms of my lifts. Maybe a language, an instrument, or even a new skill like boxing, or painting!\n* As new graduates, our ego is still very much drawn to our academic credentials, especially if we came from highly validated institutions.  It's often a shock that the world doesn't care. Our GPA, our college's name, it doesn't really matter anymore. The reality is that it matters very little from now on and I think that many of us often struggle with this concept more than we are willing to admit.\n* You've mentioned going back for a PhD. Well, nothing is stopping you from keeping in contact and even working (on a casual basis) with professors/researchers/research groups in your field! I'm sure professors would be willing to give you light projects to work on.",

It depends on your field but some conferences are free to attend online and/or post videos of the sessions online after the fact. You can continue to learn on your own time and discuss what you learn with friends and co-workers or by creating a blog.",
