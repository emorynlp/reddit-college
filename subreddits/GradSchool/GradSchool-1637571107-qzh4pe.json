  "text": "So I'm starting my program again after taking a LOA. I am ABD - this will technically be my 6th year. I'm hoping to be finished and ready to defend by Jan 2023. I've decided to document my re-integration process here. I don't know why. Maybe I feel like it will help. I am so terrified of re-starting. I am so intimidated. I don't know if I will be able to do this while working, but that's what I have to do. So much of me just wants to - not. But I also know that if I never finish - no amount of positive self talk will remove the regret I would have. I know that I would never be able to make peace with quitting after coming so far. I know that it would further tatter my self-confidence, which is already in shambles. I've never really been good at self confidence. I know that if I finish, it would give me peace, and would almost certainly effect my self image for the better. I know that if I finish, it will give me more power to effect the change in the world that I want to see. There are so many reasons TO do this, I'm just so worried about whether I actually CAN. \n\nI have about a month before I have to get back into it. I've decided to try to start integrating myself slowly. I made myself a goal for the weekend. I said - I have to open my google drive and spend 1 hour re-familiarizing myself with my data, and the state of my draft. That started to become too intimidating, so I said - fine - 1/2 hour. Still - couldn't muster. Finally, I said - just OPEN a file. That's it. That's all you have to do. And I did. And I cried so much. But I did it. So I'm going to keep trying to do this. Little by little.",
