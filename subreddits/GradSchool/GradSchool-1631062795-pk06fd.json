What can you share about them?", "text": "So I've been thinking about a Masters program but starting to realize it probably doesn't make sense for another couple of years. In lieu of that, I have been looking at some certificate programs as ways to continue my education in the interim and potentially help with my application further down the road.\n\nIf anyone has any completed a certificate program, or has general insights to share about them I'd very much appreciate hearing about those, as well as anything you can add to my questions below:\n\n* Why are some <$1k and others close to $10k? \n* Are they just a money grab by universities or do you feel that you actually learned something?\n* Seems like you can kind of just sign up for most certificate programs if you have a 3.0 or higher - do they even carry any weight on Grad school or job application? \n\nI do genuinely want to learn about the field of study in question, I'm just trying to figure out if a Certificate is worth the time and money since the individual programs seem to be all over the place.\n\nThank's in advance y'all. I hope to pay it forward one day as well.", "author": "clammytoast", "created": 1631062795, "retrieved": 1632952777, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc4rxh4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pk06fd/has_anyone_here_takencompleted_a_certificate/hc4rxh4/", "text": "I started with a grad certificate that focused on fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, and at the end of this semester I should have my master's in aerospace engineering.\n\nSome schools count courses taken for a certificate toward a master's if you choose to continue on. I found it was a good way for me to try out grad school without committing to an entire degree at the start. I liked it well enough that I kept going.\n\nThey often have lower requirements than direct admits, and with a sub-3 GPA from undergrad, it was my best chance to get in at all.\n\nCosts depend on factors including how much each credit hour costs at the school and how many credit hours are needed for the cert.\n\nI am not sure how much weight the certificate carries in the job market as a credential, but if you are learning things that are interesting to you and applicable to your desired job, you can definitely mention classwork in an interview, or mention a classroom skill on a resume. As far as a grad school application, doing well on a certificate should carry a lot of weight because they know the caliber of the courses. Doing well on a certificate should carry a lot of weight at that particular school.\n\nIt can be a good way to start out if you're not sure you want to bite off too much at first, or if the minimum requirements (GPA, GRE, etc) for direct apply are too tough. It worked well for me!", "author": "Tne328", "created": 1631151717, "upvotes": 1}}}
