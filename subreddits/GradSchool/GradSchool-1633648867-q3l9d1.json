  "text": "\nBasically, I\u2019m under the impression that the primary control on whether or not you get admitted into a grad program is whether the potential advisor (1) likes you and (2) is willing/able to take you in their lab. This assumes that your research is in line.\n\nCan any of you confirm or deny this? I\u2019m aware of other factors such as GPA, LoRs and research experience. But as for gpa I\u2019ve found numerous students with sub-3.0 gpas as PhD candidates and grad students being accepted into programs without any research experience so what\u2019s admittance really about then?\n\nThank you for your time!",

      "text": "It depends on the program. In my master's program, it was one of the most important things. In my PhD program in a related field, it wasn't important at all because students don't apply to work with a particular professor, but are instead assigned an adviser after they've been admitted.\n\nA friend of mine was admitted to a PhD program with like a 2.9 GPA because, IIRC, someone in her family was friends with the dean or someone in a decision-making capacity in the department. However, after being admitted, she maintained close to a 4.0, graduated with her PhD and is now a faculty member at a university. She wasn't dumb, she just had some fuckups early in her education, so I would not be surprised if there are lots of students out there who would be successful in a grad program but may have made some mistakes in the first two years of their education when they were 18-19. There's also a difference between major GPA and cumulative GPA. A student who has a 2.9 cumulative GPA might have a 3.8 in major courses, and if you're applying to a PhD program in engineering, nobody cares about your GPA in an art class you had to take to fulfill a university requirement. GPA doesn't tell the whole story, which is why letters of recommendation and statements of purpose come into play. Maybe these students with sub 3.0 gpa's had excellent GRE scores and have an extremely focused idea of what they want to do.\n\nThere are also plenty of folks who look good on paper, with high GPAs and high GRE scores who are absolute garbage researchers.",

Whereas there are also plenty of programs where you don't even choose a supervisor until after you do lab rotations or coursework etc.",

Funding structures by field also vary between institutions, which is one factor that helps make some programs more competitive than others with similar educational profiles.",

      "text": "For my school and program, this was 100% the deciding factor. In fact, after I found a professor who wanted to take me on as a student, the actual application was just a formality. And as long as I met the requirements, I was basically guaranteed admission. Actually, my prospective advisor even helped write my formal application! This was just my experience, and it really is very dependent on the specific program. \n\nMy program also had the option to just apply without securing an advisor ahead of time. But in this case, you cannot be admitted unless an advisor agrees to work with you. Basically the department will keep your application and occasionally a professor will look through the applications if they want a grad student. But the vast majority of times, the prospective students reach out to the professors (not the other way around). The chances of getting into the program without securing an advisor first are extremely slim (again, this was just my experience).",

      "text": "I was proud of my GRE scores (99th percentile in the part of the test most relevant to my field) and GPA, and assumed that they were what got me into my program. Recently I found out by accident that my school didn't even have those scores: somehow they received my GRE scores from several years ago, which were much lower! I've heard my advisor explaining to someone else the decision process for admitting students to the program, and they didn't mention that stuff at all. According to them, the decision was made on the basis of the level of demonstrated enthusiasm for the project areas of his upcoming grants, where \"demonstrated enthusiasm\" includes both what I talked about in the interview and the projects I had pursued in the years prior to grad school. For what it's worth, we also clicked personally in the interview. Basically, they were looking for someone they could productively and enjoyably co-author with for the next five years, and you can't really make that judgment on the basis of GPA and GRE.\n\nDuring my MA (at a different school), the faculty explained admission in similar terms. They did look to GPA and GRE to eliminate most of the lowest-scoring applicants (in order to narrow down their massive stock of applications), but after that initial cutoff they were mostly interested in the fit between our applications and faculty research interests. \n\nI did not contact my advisor before applying; I applied directly to the school. In some fields this is normal and in others you are supposed to contact potential advisors first; my impression even is that within some fields it varies from school to school. The best way to find out what's what is to talk to people in the field -- faculty at your undergrad school, other applicants you know, people you've met at conferences, etc.",
