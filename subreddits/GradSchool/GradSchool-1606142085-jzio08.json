If it is about results, well, you know your research best!\n\nIf something does come up and it is not one that you have thought about, acknowledge that it is a great question, and you have not thought about it but will be happy to get them to back once you've had some time to consider. You're the expert here. \n\nGood luck!", "author": "CalmPea6", "created": 1606144519, "upvotes": 22}}}
