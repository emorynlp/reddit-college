Don't do research Don't get a PhD. If you plan your work around going on vacation you can do it. Most people see crying on here fall into two categories, first years crying they don't get time off or they have adhd and can't study. The other is 6 years PhD student that can't pull their shit together to write a dissertation. Time management is part of the lesson the advisers are trying to teach, that and responsibility. Used to be that students learned that in college but that has turned into babysitting and just getting people out with mostly worthless degrees and profit for the college. In industry your boss isn't going to coddle you if you don't meet a deadline. Grad school isn't for everyone, it's meant for the ones that value the subject enough to devote time to it. The Greek definition of a PhD  is one who \"lives the philosophy of the subject\" people enter into a grad program without any thought other than \"this will earn me more money\" when nothing is farther from the truth.",
