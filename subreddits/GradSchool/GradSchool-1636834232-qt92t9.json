  "text": "edit: TL;DR: Not sure if I should continue in my program because of my poor performance so far. Some failed projects early on coupled with feeling a lack of direction in this program is making me question if I am cut out for it. Looking for practical suggestions for research-related self-improvement and how to start feeling like I can actually do this. \n\n*(I logged back into Reddit for this post a couple days ago, after reading some relatable posts and helpful responses on this subreddit, so thank you in advance).*\n\n I have narrowed down my issues in my current program to burnout, demotivation, and surprising difficulty in learning new skills. For some background, I obtained my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 with completion of my research thesis in the summer. I started grad school in the fall, a little over a week of 'no-school' time which was spent registering for classes, and completing the typical newly-admitted-student tasks. I felt pressure to start grad school immediately - family, work friends, and heavy courting by our school's graduate program with the offer of a fellowship/job. I am grateful for the financial peace it has afforded me, and I am able to partially support a family member through college because of it.\n\nI did myself a disservice with that choice, however, because I never stopped to really think about why I was going to grad school. It was the easier option, because grad schools wanted me, and the job market was more difficult to enter (being an international student added on more pressure). Additionally, I should have fought harder to start with a Master's program instead of feeling honored that I was offered a direct PhD (my program does not offer an along-the-way Master's for direct PhD students).\n\nA few days ago, I was informed that the first publication, which I started working on as an undergrad, will not count towards the 3 publication requirement in my lab. I am starting my 4th year, and I have no significant progress, other than passing my qualification exams (probably with a different name at other schools). My PI has given me till next semester to have my PhD proposal, and the assumption is that I will develop and produce 3 distinct papers required to graduate on my 5 year timeline.\n\nWhile I know nobody starts off strong at the various aspects of research, I have had a very hard time making experimental plans, writing, performing experiments in a timely manner (not scrutinizing results or getting stuck on a wrong variable - often leading to lots of repeat studies or poor data from not being good at pivoting). Overall, I consider my weakest area to be synthesizing information. No matter how much practice I have had doing it, my presentations end up like summaries, and my writing seems like a collection of facts rather than my opinions on the information. It has been hard for me to get over myself and keep trying. I have had periods of depression, and really low self-worth. I have had some progress in therapy learning to take risks, and I took a bold swing during the pandemic into an area that is not my lab's expertise, but some of the skills I have gained could be applied. I was excited and doing a bunch of reading in this area at first, but curiosity and excitement faded to the reality that I didn't really know how to do anything in this area, and most of my time has been spent building testing equipment. It's hard for my PI to support me, since we are both new to the area. One of the things I have battled with, as silly as it sounds, is feeling stupid. I had always been good at school, and even in subjects that I wasn't naturally adept at, I could figure out a way to get a good grade. The problem is grad school is long haul, and all the short-term learning skills I developed are not working as well. I struggle to apply what I learn when I 'teach' myself things.\n\nI had some pretty rough experiments for two years (the first year was working on the paper I started in undergrad) where things just didn't work out, and though my lab mates and PI admitted that some of the hypotheses of the proposal were moot, the consensus was that it sucked that I was the one that had to find that out. I was just so focused on making it work, since the other parts of the proposal were working out fine with other students, that I didn't want to admit failure. I wasted a lot of time and I own that. We went into COVID WFH and right before the lab shut down, I made a big push to gather data on a study - I even enlisted another grad student with a history of getting good quality articles published. We worked together on planning the data collection and I worked till the day before the facilities shut down to get everything I needed so that I could analyze from home. Our core hypothesis was false, and basically all my analysis was a waste of time. I felt pretty depressed afterwards, here was another study I had managed to mess up. I was so tired of isolation + feeling inadequate that when my PI asked what area I wanted to work on, I blurted out this new field.\n\nI genuinely feel like I don't know what I am doing. I prefer to spend my time in my various extracurriculars because I am not constantly feeling stupid there. I have worked on my comparison issue (it used to be much worse) in therapy, and I am trying to face my life head on, and not distract myself. My choices are to continue the PhD, and either continue working on Area2, which may be a very difficult road, and I am not even sure I am still interested in it, find a way to make Area1 work that is distinct from the lab's previous and current work, work towards a Masters - decide on thesis or non-thesis option, or least-likely, quit.\n\nI had an honest conversation with my parents last week, and let them know that I may be ending my program with a Masters' but I feel like such a disappointment to myself and to them, plus I would have ended up taking 4 years for a Masters degree - how do I explain that at job interviews? I am an Enneagram 6 w7 for reference, and I fall in the freeze group on the flight/flight/freeze responses. I am not sure what kind of replies I am looking for, maybe someone who had significant delay in their research program can give some advice on how they moved past it, or some helpful resources that have helped you become a better researcher, or any advice you think I need.\n\nCurrently, I am making a list of potential proposal focus directions, and the challenges, novelties, work done and any relevant experimental techniques I possess for each direction. I am also reading more in the field, something I haven't been very diligent about in the past.",

      "text": "This is really long. I think you should just keep pushing with the Ph.D. You need to work on your feelings of inadequacy. A good majority of grad students feel that way so its not just you. Just keep going, working hard and smart, and eventually, things will fall into place. Take a small break (Christmas), and really think about your hypothesis/new ideas etc next time. Also talk to your PI/ or another mentor, and address your concerns about your progress. Just keep pushing until its not worth it anymore. I don't think that's the case here, I just think you need to make some changes, address your flaws etc.",

          "text": "Thank you! Yeah, I could certainly have summarized a bit better, added a tl;dr.  I set up a meeting to talk to my PI this week. My biggest barrier to working on flaws so far has been feeling absolutely shitty whenever I break down a failure and see all the ways I could've prevented it. But ignoring the flaws don't make them go away, so I've gotta move past that self-pity/'I'm-the-worst'  stage to become the better researcher I want to be. Thanks for responding :)",
