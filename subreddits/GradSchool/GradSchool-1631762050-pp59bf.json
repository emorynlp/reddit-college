      "text": "I probably spend too much on food, but I freeze everything. Every Sunday I do meal prep so I have dinners for the week. I usually make a lot of soup/stews (easy way to get veggies, freezes well), stuffed peppers or meatballs, and roasted chicken which I then freeze. Then all I have to do is put whatever I\u2019m going to have for dinner that night in the fridge before I leave in the morning so it thaws in time for dinner. Stick in the microwave or the oven with some extra frozen veggies, and boom you have a healthy and sustaining meal that requires no work during the week. I usually add a side of instant rice or spaghetti that I can cook in the microwave.\n\nFor breakfast though every morning I eat microwaved oatmeal and then for lunch I have a turkey sandwich. Trying to get variety on that is too much work for right now.\n\nWhen I meal prep stuff I try to find recipes that have common ingredients so if one recipe calls for just a tbsp of tomato paste, I\u2019m not wasting an entire can of tomato paste just for that recipe (and can use it in my second recipe).",

I will make non rice meals in between, but the pot of rice is my backup for when I don\u2019t have much time. \n\nAnd sandwhiches and a piece of fruit for lunch because I don\u2019t trust the lab fridge (frozen dead animals in the freezer are way too close to my lunch).",

      "text": "Hummus. An ungodly amount of hummus. In all honesty though, my diet is just like yours. Crockpots and instantpots have been incredibly useful for easy (and quick) meals. Chili is great and can be made in batches to freeze as well. Even salads are really easy to integrate. Instantpot has helped me take advantage of really tough stew-grade meat by making them super tender. There are times when I forget I am eating value-priced meat because of how tender it is. \n\nMy favorite \"idgaf\" meal at the moment is some spaghetti and meatballs or mac n cheese (ANY mac n cheese). My favorite \"healthy\" meal is a fajita bowl or a pan-seared salmon (the frozen filets from Costco are super affordable) with a side of steamed broccoli. Cheers!",
