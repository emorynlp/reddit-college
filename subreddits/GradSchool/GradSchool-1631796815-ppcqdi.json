  "title:": "How to get original research experience after undergrad in preparation for grad school applications?",
  "text": "I have graduated from undergrad in English literature, but I want to do a masters in a linguistics-related field and continue on to do a PhD researching a topic in the field of linguistic anthropology. I want to get into a stellar PhD program, and to help me do that, I want to get into a stellar masters program. The problem is, I did barely any research in linguistics specifically while in undergrad, only literature. My internships and GPA are alright, but I'm lacking in original, written research on the topic I want to research in graduate school. I certainly didn't do a thesis or any high-level research related specifically to what I want to go to graduate school for. I am trying to find ways to both fill the gaps where I didn't have the opportunity to do research in my newly chosen field and also figure out what the process is for finding research assistantships. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on either of those topics, especially how to find opportunities to do original research in a chosen field after undergrad but before graduate school?",
