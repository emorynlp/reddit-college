Now I\u2019ve got a bunch of them piling up and need some sort of way to organize what I need to read and when/why to read it. I\u2019m thinking of just using an Excel spreadsheet, but is there any software or better methods other people use?  \n\nEdit: Just for clarification, I don\u2019t mean a reference manager, I use Mendeley for that. I mean like a way to keep track of what you actually need to read.", "author": "You_Stole_My_Hot_Dog", "created": 1632108792, "retrieved": 1632952181, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdo8lqx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prmsxo/how_do_you_guys_organize_your_reading_list/hdo8lqx/", "text": "Folders on OneDrive:\n\n-stuff I\u2019ve read\n-important stuff I\u2019ve read\n-stuff I want to read eventually\n-stuff I want to read ASAP\n-stuff I really really want to read ASAP (for when the one above this gets too full)\n\nYou get the idea.", "author": "Weekly-Ad353", "created": 1632192213, "upvotes": 1}, "hdn0orm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prmsxo/how_do_you_guys_organize_your_reading_list/hdn0orm/", "text": "I use [Avidnote](https://avidnote.com). I developed it myself though precisely because I had the same problem that you had. Reference managers are great for keeping track of citation info, but not very useful for managing your reading lists & notes.\n\nYou can read more about Avidnote [here](https://avidnote.com), but essentially, it's a note-taking tool for research. You can use tags to organize your reading list, for example, by using tags such as \"paper I need to read\", \"papers I have read\" or you can use tags for different subject areas (\"physics\", \"research project x\" etc).\n\nYou can also annotate your PDF documents side-by-side with your notes (highlight, colorize, use an iPad etc) as well as find new papers within the web app.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention that it's free & no ads ^^. There is a premium version but the only difference is that the storage space is increased & you can work more than one person on it. The free version has all the same functionalities.", "author": "cabdirazzaq", "created": 1632171965, "upvotes": 1}, "hdk03xp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prmsxo/how_do_you_guys_organize_your_reading_list/hdk03xp/", "text": "I just earmark every morning for reading, and assign each day of the week for a different subject (eg every week, on Monday mornings I do my readings for Class A, on Tuesday mornings I do my reading for Class B, on Wednesday mornings I do reading for my research, etc).", "author": "HouseNegative9428", "created": 1632112933, "upvotes": 2}}}
