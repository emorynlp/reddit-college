{"sid": "9s9yzw", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/9s9yzw/an_amazing_weekend/", "title:": "An amazing weekend", "text": "On Saturday night, I was at my hookah spot in the DC area. I was chatting with some people I had met a few weeks ago. They found out I was doing my PhD.  They weren't only impressed, but also amazed with the work I'm doing. It led me to think about a lot of things since then. From the outside of academia you have people who are vindictive towards us for pursuing a PhD and will punish us if they're in a gate-keeping role for an employer. Meanwhile, there are others who find it fascinating. Being a Black man and being a PhD student I feel as if I'm the results of the sacrifices my ancestors made. For them in their lifetime what I am doing was impossible.  Even for my 81 year old grandpa. I am in this space where I can expand myself and contribute to a field.  It really re-centered me, and affirmed who I am and what I do. I don't have plans to work in academia once I'm done. I'm taking my knowledge into the world once I am done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis weekend made me think about the toxic environment that academia can be, and really understand what it means to navigate it. Not only navigate it, but learn that you may be in the environment, but you aren't of the environment. The moment we start playing the games, start stressing out on our dissertation.  Honestly, I think it is the moment we lose ourselves.  It is always best to remain focused on the reasons you chose this path.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't a post about an event or what happened. This post is more of a message, and that message is quite simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnderstand the space you're in. Value yourself and your work. Everyone here are incredible human beings. No one here is mediocre. We're all strong, and we only become weak when we forget this. Stay strong, keep working; your time is NOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your week!", "author": "kamon405", "created": 1540786738, "retrieved": 1632846461, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"e8o7vpl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/9s9yzw/an_amazing_weekend/e8o7vpl/", "text": "Great message, this definitely resonates with me as I sit here trying to decide what to tell my PI I have been working on for the past two weeks when I really haven't been working on anything.

My first year was insane, trying to do an accelerated timeline (finished comps first year, yikes!), and my second year I've been taking it so much easier.

Maybe some people (like my advisor and my housemate) work way longer than me, but my work is valuable and good. I met a friend two weeks ago who thinks my research is the coolest and he always asks about my data. I might not have a lot of publications, but I'm not off-track. We're all doing fine.
