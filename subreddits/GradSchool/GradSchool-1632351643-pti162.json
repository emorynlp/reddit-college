My own research has started to expand into how technology intersects with my field. I've been really disappointed that my field has seemingly been ignoring the influence of technology and was excited to be able to make some important work as such a young student. \n\nA professor sent me a workshop for my research interest at a human-computer interaction (HCI) conference today. This is like a whole subfield of HCI that seems pretty active and it doesn't interact whatsoever with my field. I can kind of get it, my field is a mix of theory and practice, whereas theirs is mainly practice, but still... It's two sides of the same coin.
