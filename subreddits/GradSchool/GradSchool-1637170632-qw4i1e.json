  "text": "This is mostly venting I guess. In addition to being a PhD student working on my thesis project, I\u2019m also president of a campus organization and I am on 4 committees in my program or department. I\u2019m fortunate to have roles where I can gain leadership experience but it\u2019s starting to get really exhausting to stay on top of everything and trying to communicate with everyone and being the positive one in the group. I didn\u2019t even want to be in these positions. But I was asked to take them mainly because nobody else would take them or do the work. I\u2019m so tired of trying to get others to participate but I also don\u2019t want to see any of these committees or the organization fail. I\u2019ve gotten good at \u201cturning on\u201d the charismatic and positive leadership persona to try and keep pushing projects/our goals forward, but honestly I\u2019ve been getting really depressed and overwhelmed lately and don\u2019t know if I can keep this act up along with doing my own thesis research. I know I need to get better at saying No to people and time management, and trying to get a therapist (although getting mental health services at my school requires so much work). Not really looking for advice but can anyone relate?",

But if you always say yes, at some point you're going to be overwhelmed. Because if you're any good, you're going to get more and more opportunities.\n\nIf you feel like you've taken on too much committee work, there's no shame in resigning from one of the committees and say you need to focus more on your research and coursework.",

      "text": "i know you\u2019re not looking for advice so I\u2019ll try not to go there, but offer my personal experience. :p all I can say is that this was me for about 12 years straight, when I was a student/student-scholar and community organizer. At one point i was the youngest board member in a room full of retirees, trying to make a difference. it\u2019s a very lonely and exhausting space, and I almost flunked out of college before an academic advisor intervened, had tenuous relationship with my partner at the time, and my parents. I burnt out. It\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve become more selective about where I invested my time as a MS, now PhD student. So I COULD relate, but I also just want to be real. There\u2019s a reason why flight attendants ask you to put your mask on first before helping others, in case of emergencies. The \u201ccause\u201d can\u2019t afford to lose well-meaning individuals who want to make a difference because they burn out. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.",

      "text": "Oh yeah I can relate. I was president of our professional Org's student chapter and on committees at the national level in the beginning of grad school. We're a small school, so I ran for president of the org unopposed and I was replacing a president who had been running the show for multiple years. We did good stuff, helped get students to conferences, even won a national award. But I absolutely knew I couldn't do multiple years of that or I would either burn out or be in grad school for like 4 extra years. The temptation was to do it for multiple years like the student before me. But I stepped out and someone else took over the club and I absolutely made the right decision.",

A president in my org, involved in several committees and groups, etc. It is tiring and I won\u2019t quit because I\u2019m worried that the orgs won\u2019t survive or because nobody else will volunteer to take my place. I am exhausted and burned out. However, I am getting to the point of not caring about those things and focusing on myself and finishing my dissertation. Whatever you decide to do, hopefully it works out for you. \ud83d\ude0a",

      "text": "Yeppp. Although I never got to your level of involvement. I was letting friends walk all over me because I didn't want to disappoint them even tho I felt overwhelmed. I would also commit to all the things: certificate programs, hosting t giving, volunteering at the food pantry, taking dance classes with a friend, walking my other friend's dog every morning...\nBut this semester my only focus is research. Told my \"friends\" to bother someone else. My advisor keeps asking me to update the lab website and I keep saying I'll get to it later. It's not what I'm being paid to do so I honestly am waiting until I'm bored enough one day to work on it. Idc. Feels good, man.  And I'm more productive than ever! I got a paper accepted recently and two more that are nearly ready for submission.",

      "text": "I came from a background where I did all sort of volunteer works for 7 years + prior to entering gradschool. Only to realize, they did not help much in terms of qualifying as a good resume booster. I took them as a learning experience and the moment I entered grad school, I rejected every leadership position that was given to me except for one or two which were related to grant applications. \n\nYou need to start saying no. I'm sorry to say this but from my experience in and outside of academia, if you do not know how to say no, they will butter you up so for free labour. They will continuously butter you up and put you on some kind of high feeling of being in charge etc. but it really serves their purpose, and not yours. 4 committees sound like too much. Even 1 is already a lot. Free labour in exchange for \"leadership experience\" is something that grad students are overwhelmed with. Start saying no. You can still contribute even without committing to become a committee member.\n\nFor myself, I commit to one off projects only if I can help it. I do not commit to anything, long term. If I have to, I make sure I am not the leader. This is because if you lead/commit long term, you willllllll absolutely feel overwhelmed. Grad school is hard. Strategize your time well.",
