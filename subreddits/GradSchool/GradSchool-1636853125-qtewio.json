  "text": "Update: yall I got a 74 on my exam idec just gonna study harder for the next one I'M RELIEVED\n\n\nI've been feeling so burnt out. I be working full time in lab and doing this degree on the side. I'm feeling so isolated I have like no friends at my school and everyone around me is so negative and unsupportive about doing this masters for some reason. I'm sitting here laying in my bed rn after studying all day and all yesterday for my exam tomorrow. I'm about to go to sleep 3 hours earlier than I planned to. I've been thinking a lot of negative thoughts recently and not really caring about my grades cause I have so much going on in life rn. Just want to go to bed and pretend I don't have an exam. Then I'm just laying here in bed thinking about everything I don't know yet. That I will need to know to do well. Ugh. \n\nWell I'm gonna get out of bed and study for atleast another two hours. Then wake up early and study more. Determined to get atleast an 80% on this dumb exam. Can't give up now.",

      "text": "This is similar to my situation. Full time industry job, PhD on the side. Im in my last class now and it\u2019s one that\u2019s really making me feel the 2 decades between undergrad and now.\n\nBut my employer is super supportive, which totally makes the difference. I have a wife and 2 kids, one of which is special needs, so I care a lot less about peer connections.\n\nMake sure you are doing this for you, and put that effort in. It sucks now but will be worth it. I know it\u2019s hard to not let stuff bother you, especially feeling isolated, but try to keep your eye on the prize. It\u2019s worth the sacrifice now",
