I started off my program so enthusiastically and it was great until Covid hit. My field work got shut down and I lost all reproduction data for that year because I couldn't go out and check on my quail even though I'd literally be by myself in the desert, as socially distanced as you can get. I think this is where I started losing motivation and it's kind of spiraled ever since. Especially since I often had to deal with extreme  levels of disrespect from a particular person I work under to the point where they were contacting my advisor to complain about me for ridiculous reasons.\n\nI'm getting off topic, suffice to say I've been thoroughly demoralized already. Well I then lost my brother a month ago, 2 months away from my anticipated defence date. I'm heartbroken, freaking out about having no job lined up yet for after I graduate, not having my thesis done yet, my coursework piled up, plus a good dose of imposter syndrome. \n\nI guess I'm just trying to rant. I know at the end of the day I just have to suck it up and keep going, but goddamn this past year has throughly kicked my ass. I just want to be done and out of school.

You can always do something in the short terms to tie you over, but I think they'll be a place for you. Just keep yourself open to potentially moving away from where you are now.

You're so close!! I got hit hard with imposter syndrome too last year after getting my MS....I found talking about it with friends in/or just post graduate school helped quite a bit actually (for whatever thats worth). Took me 8 years on/off to get my first undergrad degree so my only advice is to just push through it all and get it done so you can walk away from school completely if thats appropriate once you get your masters (basing the comment on the assumption you arent after a PhD or any other degree past an MS). I will say there is absolutely ZERO wrong with taking a semester off or drastically reducing a course load for a semester or two to be able to better handle all the other life stuff that tends to rain down on us in graduate school.", "author": "Contagin85", "created": 1619381041, "upvotes": 1}, "gvup7wo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mycpdr/2_months_away_from_defending_just_lost_my_brother/gvup7wo/", "text": "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.

Have you checked into whether or not you can delay your defense? You might be able to defend over the summer or another semester in the future without taking any other credits or anything.\n\n[Captain Awkward](http://www.captainawkward.com/) is an advice blog that has a lot of good advice about self-care in the academic sphere, among other things.

You may find some advice from a similar situation there.\n\nIn any event, take care of yourself.
