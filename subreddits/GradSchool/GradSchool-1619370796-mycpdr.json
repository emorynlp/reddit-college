  "title:": "2 months away from defending, just lost my brother and I feel like I'm suffocating",
  "text": "I'm a MS student in wildlife management and conservation. I started off my program so enthusiastically and it was great until Covid hit. My field work got shut down and I lost all reproduction data for that year because I couldn't go out and check on my quail even though I'd literally be by myself in the desert, as socially distanced as you can get. I think this is where I started losing motivation and it's kind of spiraled ever since. Especially since I often had to deal with extreme  levels of disrespect from a particular person I work under to the point where they were contacting my advisor to complain about me for ridiculous reasons.\n\nI'm getting off topic, suffice to say I've been thoroughly demoralized already. Well I then lost my brother a month ago, 2 months away from my anticipated defence date. I'm heartbroken, freaking out about having no job lined up yet for after I graduate, not having my thesis done yet, my coursework piled up, plus a good dose of imposter syndrome. \n\nI guess I'm just trying to rant. I know at the end of the day I just have to suck it up and keep going, but goddamn this past year has throughly kicked my ass. I just want to be done and out of school. I'll never look back.",

Your uni probably has a counseling center that you can utilize for short term appointments.  Definitely use that resource, it can make a big difference!",

You are right, just try to put the distraction aside and focus long enough to get yourself out of this program, so you can start the next phase of your life. I think you'll find a job, not to worry. You can always do something in the short terms to tie you over, but I think they'll be a place for you. Just keep yourself open to potentially moving away from where you are now. There will be brighter days ahead although things kinda suck right now.",

      "text": "Sorry for your loss....but you got this!! You're so close!! I got hit hard with imposter syndrome too last year after getting my MS....I found talking about it with friends in/or just post graduate school helped quite a bit actually (for whatever thats worth). Took me 8 years on/off to get my first undergrad degree so my only advice is to just push through it all and get it done so you can walk away from school completely if thats appropriate once you get your masters (basing the comment on the assumption you arent after a PhD or any other degree past an MS). I will say there is absolutely ZERO wrong with taking a semester off or drastically reducing a course load for a semester or two to be able to better handle all the other life stuff that tends to rain down on us in graduate school.",

I lost my stepdad just before starting grad school, and he would have been my number one person I\u2019d go to for encouragement since he was a college professor himself. It sucks so much, I\u2019m truly sorry. I\u2019m also having similar issues with my research. I\u2019m also studying wildlife management too, and my field work timeline is so fucked. I\u2019m supposed to have my first round of trail cams deployed with experimental treatments applied, but I\u2019ve barely even started. It fucking sucks A LOT, One of my project objectives is a springtime specific thing, so I foresee myself staying an extra semester next year. I\u2019m curious what your research is about?",

I know there is definitely no such thing as a good or bad time to lose somebody, it's always bad, but sometimes the timing is just super fucked you know? I feel for you with your research timeline. I did a two year translocation project with Gambel's quail where I moved nearly 400 quail from golf courses to wild habitat to see if translocation was an effective means of boosting extant populations after a long period of drought. The trapping seasons were awful. I was so behind with everything but somehow I managed to get through it and I'm sure you will too <3 just make sure you are thinking about what is feasible for you and be able to put your foot down to say I need extra time. For my second trapping season I had to delay it a couple  weeks despite everybody telling me that the quail wouldn't come to the traps after the Spring vegetation green-up. Still worked out and I reached my goal faster than the first year even with some medical problems.",

It\u2019s been so hard for me to focus on school work since the diagnosis and I really struggled to find the motivation to defend and submit my thesis on time.

Fortunately I did just receive a Covid relief grant that will help and I have some savings so I definitely won't be going into debt or anything. I just need to communicate to my committee what my expectations are for my completion date.",

      "text": "\"Suck it up and keep going\" is a toxic idea that unfortunately powers a lot of people into unhappiness. I understand wanting to be done with your program, but it seems like you're overloaded and you might want to reassess what you've got in front of you and what you can handle. Have you checked into whether or not you can delay your defense? You might be able to defend over the summer or another semester in the future without taking any other credits or anything.\n\n[Captain Awkward](http://www.captainawkward.com/) is an advice blog that has a lot of good advice about self-care in the academic sphere, among other things. People write in with some seriously heavy shit, and she really gives good blueprints that break down life situations and how to proceed with improving your life. You may find some advice from a similar situation there.\n\nIn any event, take care of yourself. Make sure you're eating, make sure you're taking walks to clear your head, make sure you're doing something to unplug for at least a small amount of time. It helps. Trust me.",
