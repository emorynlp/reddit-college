The fact our stipends aren't that great and we aren't making amazing money during the PhD doesn't help either.  \n\n\nSo for those who were able to meet people, how'd you do it?",

That said, he was very comprehensive when I was writing my thesis and had to take time off to do that. If you date a good person, they'll usually accommodate your academic needs (and also grad school doesn't last forever, thankfully). Also, imo it helps if your SO is not an academic or at least isn't in the same field as you. This gives room for more growth and interesting conversations about each others work!",

Anecdotally I met my husband first semester first year on a dating app. Most people in my program are married or dating someone long term, so my general impression is that it's not unusual to be in a relationship during a PhD. Most of us are mid-late 20s  both male and female. Dating advice is very basic. Put yourself out there as much as you can, be respectful to people you end up being not that interested in, and you'll want to spend more time with the person who's right for you.",

You just gotta see if you can make time and make the expectations of time clear when you start dating someone. It's not easy but not impossible.",

Dates are initially just affordable things like just getting ice cream or just going on a hike together.

What works for you works for you, but I wasn't originally expecting to date within my program (the old \"don't date where you work\").  We originally started as friends.  Two years later, I guess one thing led to the other and we connected.",

Now we're trying to see each other every 3 weeks, for a weekend, or if he can, more. But we're trying to work out something else (he living with me half the time or 40%) if we can, because travelling is expensive and long distance is annoying.\nWould definitely be easier if we were living together; at the same time, I can also appreciate having weeks all by myself since we can't just casually go out for dinner or whatever. If we had been in the same city not living together, it would probably have been harder to find the time!\n\nI also have to say he was already a PhD student when we met, and he found the time to get to know and date me, mostly we'd meet for dinner or afterwards till the morning, and on weekends.

We could only go out for groceries, alone. If it weren't for covid, I don't know if we'd still be together!\n\nMy previous relationship was also long distance, we briefly met in person and then I left for my bachelor. It didn't work out, also because we had no money to travel as much as now, but at the time it was really nice to have the free time to enjoy the uni life and we skyped every day. Then we got closer, about 3h away. It didn't work for various reasons, but also because we were probably incompatible in real life, I got tired of always having to leave my life to go to his place, and I didn't see a way to close the gap anytime soon.\n\nI think with the right mindset, and especially if you can see an end to the long-distance, it can be pretty nice if you're very busy!",

It's the same reason why people don't get into PhD programs. It isn't because of a lack of talent or ability, but some people are going through many external events that prevent them to allocating time. Likewise socioeconomic factors come into play.   \n\n\nWe went through a global pandemic, and although I didn't disclose details in OP there are still things I'm dealing with in the aftermath. But that's why I'm asking the question. A good quality of any researcher is to ask questions and parse through the information to get the best decision, which is what I believe I'm doing here",

Different levels of privilege allow a person to do other things besides work. As I mentioned earlier it's the same reason people who can't get into PhDs or certain prestigious jobs don't necessarily lack talent, ability, or work ethic. There are socioeconomic factors affecting people and that's why there have been bigger pushes to encompass things like diversity and inclusion. Likewise it's the same reason people have been unionizing and protesting for better working conditions and pay.\n\nI'm not from a privileged background and there's many things I have to take care of along with my graduate education. I'm aware of that though and that's why I'm trying to figure a solution. I'm aware a stroll through the park is free, but if I never get to the park it's not a solution.",

Literally during football season I'd work on Saturday while watching football and he'd sit right next to me playing a game and we'd talk back and forth and make jokes. I cherished those Saturdays so much.\n\nAt the same time, you have to prioritize time with them too.

We\u2019ve just moved into an apartment together yesterday!\n\nWe met after being assigned as flatmates for my college\u2019s accommodation, so that made it very easy to spend casual time together. \n\nWe do go out on dates maybe once a week (when possible) though. It\u2019s not really my preference to go out a lot since I\u2019m very \u201cintroverted\u201d and have autism, so I enjoy quiet time alone, but going out occasionally isn\u2019t too much of a compromise.\n\nMy partner is also a physicist with a very active social life and works out quite often with the gym and rugby. Those aren\u2019t negatives to me, it just gives me more alone time to decompress.\n\nI think the most important thing is to find someone complementary to you. If you\u2019re quite busy then you need someone who\u2019s okay with that and who doesn\u2019t need or want constant attention from you.\n\nBut pro-tip: leave work at work. I finish at 5 if my partner is home that evening. Make your work day end time absolute and you\u2019ll probably get more done.",
