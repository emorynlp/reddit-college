It is quite rare that people see the error of their ways and genuinely change, mostly they will either not change or change because of the consequences of not changing.",

      "text": "I want to scream this from the mountaintops but reddit will suffice: YOU CAN CHANGE ADVISORS AT ANY TIME. If your advisor is harassing you, talk to your DGS and inform them that you will be switching advisors. Don't ask permission, don't take no for an answer. Remember, your advisor is important not just for your time in the lab, but for most of your early career progress, especially if you want to stay in academia. Don't shoot yourself in the foot because you don't want to \"go through the hassle\" or \"stir the pot.\" You are only hurting yourself, while giving them credit for graduating another student and getting papers out of their lab.\n\nETA: by anytime, I mean literally anytime. A month from graduating and your advisor is threatening to force you to stay for the cheap labor? Switch advisors. A month into your first year and your advisor turns out to be a real dick? Switch advisors. Don't ask for permission, it will only hurt your future.",

He thanked me for bringing to his attention. Said he was still learning because he\u2019s new. \n\nThings didn\u2019t improve. I can\u2019t say for sure but I\u2019ve sort of become ostracized from lab. He cultivates a feeling of collaboration for all members and their projects except mine. It\u2019s not a big deal though because I got a 3 year fellowship on my own. My committee took notice recently of my poor performance and basically took over and no I report to them every other month. I\u2019m grateful for them because they noticed my advisor isn\u2019t doing shit and basically saved me.",
