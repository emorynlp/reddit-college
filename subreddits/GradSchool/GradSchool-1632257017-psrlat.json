  "text": "Ok so I'm having a lot of anxiety about this and just want an outside perspective. I'm applying to a speciaized kind of masters program and applied to my top choice already. I have a list of other programs but I only realized this week that the deadlines are in two and three weeks from now. Is it ok to ask for LOR with such short notice since these people already wrote letters for me?",

      "text": "It's not ideal but it's possible that they won't mind. Just be ready for rejection and obviously be gracious either way.\n\nAs u/myristicae has already said, if they can use the same letters, it shouldn't be a problem. But what admissions committees are looking for can vary between programs and thus may require these letters to be reworked.",
