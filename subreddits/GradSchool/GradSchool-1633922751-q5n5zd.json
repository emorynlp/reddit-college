That was difficult because I kept getting mostly results for a personal statement of interest for grad school application when I needed to know about a statement of purpose for a thesis proposal. I do remember finding some articles discussing research statements though.",

      "text": "To me, statement of purpose is why you want to do grad school, and what you'd do with your studies afterward. As someone said, it's you-focused. In my SoP to grad school, I explained my experiences and how I got interested in what I wanted to do for grad school. It was a bit personal.\n\nResearch statement is like the specifics of the project you are working on and what skills you have that will benefit and make you an asset to work on. It could also include your research interests and motivations for future work.",
