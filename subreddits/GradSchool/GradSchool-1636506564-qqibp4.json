  "text": "First time writing a literature review and I found a book review that makes a few key points I\u2019d like to use. Is this usually ok rather than going to the individual books? All my other sources are regular journal articles and books. Thanks!!",

      "text": "I would not use a book review in place of the original source in a literature review. If you haven't seen the original work, how can you evaluate the book review?\n\nBut certainly if it offers perspective on the original source, which you are also including in your lit review, then you could certainly include it\n\nBook reviews or letters to editors about journal articles can often bring up important issues with an original work. And so they are an important part of the discourse around that original work.",
