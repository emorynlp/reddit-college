  "text": "Hi there. I am a PhD student who has been in USA for two years almost. Often I see other international students from my country visiting home at least once a year or once every other year. But I personally so far don't feel the urge considering the costs of flight, taking time off, and also I kinda like the grad student life here. But seeing all these people, I start blaming myself that maybe I am acting selfish. Does anyone else feel the same way? Is it wrong that I don't wanna visit home anytime soon, until I personally feel comfortable?",

      "text": "That seems less like peer pressure and more like guilt. I don\u2019t see any reason that you should force yourself to fly overseas if you don\u2019t want to. Do what you want and don\u2019t compare yourself to others. You\u2019d never judge your peers for something like that, so don\u2019t judge yourself for it.",

      "text": "No, it's not wrong to not want to visit unless you want to. I am not international, but many of my friends are and, one day out of curiosity I decided to look up how much a flight would cost to China (lots of international students in my department are from China). It was $5,000! I don't understand how a grad student could afford a flight that expensive, and I don't believe folks should burden themselves financially to take a trip, even if it's to see family. It might mean a lot to family members, but if it means you will have difficulty paying rent and buying food, then it's not a good decision and people who care about you should understand that.\n\nJust not feeling like traveling is also a totally valid reason, especially with all these COVID variants running amok. Being selfish now and then is not a bad thing, but I also would not consider your situation to be selfish.",

          "text": "Thanks a ton for replying! Its reassuring. Yes the flight costs overseas are enormous now. And I am considering other facts as well, such as I changed school this year so basically started my PhD again from scratch. I just do not want to feel guilty about not going home anytime soon. The way you put it, it feels way reassuring and comforting. Thanks a bunch!",
