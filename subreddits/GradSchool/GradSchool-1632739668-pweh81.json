      "text": "The precise answer will vary by region and education system.\n\nIn the US or Canada, medical schools generally accept pre-reqs from any accredited institution, so it's fine with them if you take the courses in grad school. Rather, you're pretty likely to run into pushback from the grad program. Medical school pre-reqs are intro-level courses across several fields, so there's no reasonable way to build them into your grad curriculum. You would need to take them on top of your regular grad coursework.",

You'll want to pick up the domain-specific knowledge that you need... but general introductory biology, physics, chemistry (gen & o chem) as well as English are not likely to be required.  Your time will be taken up with advanced classes in your subject area.  I don't want to say 'It's impossible', but it will be very strongly frowned upon.   \n\nIf you are doing a thesis program, your advisor will not want to split your energy and attention with whatever random undergrad courses you're taking.",
