Then you can easily search through your citations using key works and include notes. Lastly, with the microsoft word plug-in you can quickly link your in-text citations to your Zotero library and then automatically import a references section when you\u2019re done. You can also change the style of your in-text citations and references with just a couple clicks (for example, when I needed to change my in-text citations from APA to AJP format for a resubmission). The bibliography automatically updates as well when you insert a new citation to the text. It probably has a bunch of other features that I\u2019m not aware of but this is how I use it. All in all, it\u2019s a very helpful program.",
