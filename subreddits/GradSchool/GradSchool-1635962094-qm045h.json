  "text": "Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qmxesq/update_depression_and_burn_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nPreface: Sorry for the wall of text, and if this is not very eloquent. Currently not doing well as I wait for class lol. \n\nBackground: I (23/F) recently started a PhD program in a public health-related field this fall in an entirely new city with no family or friends. I graduated undergrad in May 2019, at the start of COVID, and finished my graduate program in the summer of 2020. Essentially started and finished my masters during COVID. I also worked full-time while completing the program. \n\nI was so so excited to start this program and was so eager to start in a lab that was entirely new to me. Starting fresh after being online for several months. 3 months in, and I am more depressed than I have ever been. \n\nThe feelings of isolation and loneliness are debilitating. I feel almost passively suicidal, like I\u2019d never act on it, but wouldn\u2019t mind simply not existing. Tidal wave-like. I have never felt like this before. I cannot stop crying. \n\nI have no friends here and I spend the majority of my days alone. I go to class, do my lab work independently, and then go home to an empty apartment. On the weekends, the most exciting thing I do is grocery shop. I\u2019ve tried to make social connections. \n\nMost of my friends are in industry, several hours away. My partner and family are also hours away. This also makes things a bit more difficult, since I feel as if I have no one who truly understands. \n\nI felt like this earlier in the semester, but it passed. Last weekend, I went to visit my partner for a wedding and had the most wonderful time. I was entirely carefree, I didn\u2019t even check my email. When I can home to my empty apartment, in my empty city, I broke down. It was like I had a taste of freedom and it was snatched away. \n\nThese feelings coupled with the fact that I know I don\u2019t want to stay in academia (my PI knows this) are truly making me considering quitting. I know I can get a decent job without a PhD, but I feel sad. I don\u2019t want to be a quitter, but I also don\u2019t want to suffer for the next 3+ years. \n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m really posting this for. Maybe to vent, maybe for some advice.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the comments - i can\u2019t begin to explain how comforting (and unnerving) it is to hear that I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m sorry if i haven\u2019t replied to you yet, it\u2019s been a hell of a day.",

All I really have is my work and I just been throwing myself into it, but doesn't feel sustainable. For myself, I think being isolated in the pandemic changed my personality in a way that I find it harder to connect with new people.\n\nI finally have an appointment with my school's counseling services this week and I am hopeful that it will help. I worked so hard to get here, I don't want to give up, but it has definitely been tough. You are not alone in your feelings.",

I think there were a lot of external factors that really led to a lot of my depression (health issues, pandemic, changing life priorities), but I think doing the PhD at the same time as all of those things made it significantly worse. It's too isolating. I also put too much pressure on myself at the beginning and had too high of expectations of myself. I've needed a lot of therapy to get through. I'm planning to finish becasue I'm in my 5th year and closing in on the end, and during the pandemic whatever job I would get would probably not be that different. But at this point I look back on it and am not convinced it was worth it.",

      "text": "Are you me? I am 23, moved to a new state, and my first year in grad school was just like this, down to wishing something bad would happen so I could justify dropping out. I would dress up to go to the grocery store on the weekend (if I could get out of bed at a reasonable time). I was so cripplingly lonely, and the anxiety of starting a PhD program in a pandemic with absent advisors sent me into a tailspin. Things have gotten slightly better now that places have opened up. I started seeing a new therapist during the spring semester, and even that little bit of interaction helped. I am also \"mastering out\" with a non-thesis degree in the spring because I just don't want to do this anymore. So, maybe not the happy ending you were looking for, but just know you have options. \n\nAlso, **it is 100% OK to mourn the experience you thought you were going to have**.  COVID messed up a lot of things for a lot of people. It is really, really difficult to start over in a new place, nevermind starting grad school during a pandemic. You are not alone in your feelings. And this experience does not have to define you. It is not the end-all, be-all. Reach out to your advisors, higher-ups in the department, or even find a therapist if you are able. Making connections and having support are the things that are going to help you find yourself again.",

      "text": "It's not a great place to be that's for sure. I myself lived through few years of similar hell (moved to a different country with no friends, family, speaking a different language and was depressed as fuck for a very long time). But I also made my best friends in grad school and they have been the best thing that happened to me in grad school (we are still in touch 10 years after completing my PhD) You really never know what the future holds, so don't think that this is the \"normal\". I reckon things will get better as some time passes by, you meet more people, etc.\n\nDo you have a \"Graduate House\" kind of place to drink beers, etc.? This was usually a great place for us to hang out and meet folks in a similar situation. I also recommend getting some exercise, maybe you can join a running club, hitting the gym, or swimming classes. I met one of my best friends in the pool, out of all places!\n\nThe trick is to make sure you do some stuff outside of your PhD work. It's easy to get sucked in and let the days pass, but you will be better off taking some care of yourself, hanging out with people and doing some extra-curricular activities.\n\nIf you are really depressed as hell to the point that it affects your work (and you mentioned non-active suicidal thoughts, which is not a good place to be in) it can also help seeing someone at counselling services. I was always skeptical of these kind of services, but they can be of great help.\n\nIn a somewhat bizarre way, I now kind of think of that period as most important in my life. It really made me \"grow\" emotionally and I was also able to really make some great friends, specifically *because* of the depression I was dealing with. It allowed me to really filter out the people I wanted to be with and people who really cared about me.\n\nAll that being said, if you are really confident about not continuing in academia, please consider carefully what is it exactly that PhD is going to give you. It's a pretty long time commitment and unless it really gives you a strong advantage in the industry I would really consider my options (especially since you are early into your PhD). Five years in industry can be huge for your skillset.",

Here's why: \n\nMy cohort-mate and I both realized we hated academia and wanted to leave our program early on.  She left after her masters, and I stayed on. Only one of us regrets our decision--and it's me. I have gone through what you're feeling over and over and over again for four years, and the more time that passes the more it feels like I've invested too much to leave. I've decided to stick it out, but if I knew what I know now 2 years ago I would have left. \n\nSomething that has come up in my conversations with my partner is that leaving a PhD isn't quitting--it's choosing something else. Staying is a choice, leaving is a choice. I thought by doing nothing I could put off making a choice, but in reality I was making a choice that I wasn't happy with. \n\nAt the end of the day, you have a masters and will probably land on your feet. Life is too short to stay where you aren't happy. I wish you the best of luck, and hope you can be reunited with your loved ones soon!",

If you find yourself perpetually wanting to do something different always hoping the next thing will be better then that's an issue, but simply deciding what you're not happy here and doing something else is fine.  \n\n\nI would recommend thinking about what actual value a PhD has to you. Stripped of all the prestige and admiration, is it actually gonna to help you pursue your goals? If not why get it?  If so then you can build off that to figure out a plan for the next few years.",

I know that I don't have any problem doing the grind of PhD but what I can't tolerate and what breaks me down is that I have no emotional support system. You can make me work 12 hours of the day if the rest of the time I have friends and family around me (like I had before), but now even working 5 hours a day seems such a monumental task. I think education, PhD and career are all okay and great but there are certain needs that if left deficient fucks you up and over. The prospect of being in a state like this (which I hope not as things will change as I settle better) for the next 5 years seems fucking scary to me and not at all a tradeoff which I was prepared to make. \n\nThis actually made me one day wonder whether I really wanted to do a PhD, turns out its like a job, just like any another that I might be doing back in my country, but with a hell lot of sacrificies. After some point, there is no honour and no need of making those. So as of now, I am going along but I swear if I have a few of these emotional breakdowns more, I will take a decision in a jiffy and leave this town.",

      "text": "Not only are some departments and labs garbage at connecting students, it has been really difficult to regain the social dynamic that we once had prior to the pandemic. I'm a third year PhD student, and it's been nearly impossible to recreate thriving social scene my department had. My university still has some stricter covid protocol, so it's been so difficult to do any social gatherings at school that a lot of students think that it's not worth organizing/attending them. \n\nHave you tried to explore social circles outside of your university? Try looking into hobby groups to meet other people. It can be really scary going outside of the comfort zone at first, but you can usually make some great friends! I'm a runner, so I found some groups that did runs and races on weeknights. I'd head over after work, and those 1-2 hours around people just making small talk, really helped. I've had some friends use [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) to find events and make friends with some varying degrees of success. Bumble BFF can also be really useful in meeting other people who are in similar situations to yours.\n\nCan you possibly get a pet? A dog could be the perfect gateway into social interactions, as you could take it to training classes and play groups to meet some other people. Cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, etc are all great too to keep company.\n\nYou're not alone, it's scary and difficult moving to a new area alone. Sometimes it's just not meant to be and that's ok, sometimes you just need to give things a bit more time until they get better :)",

Although it was not directly related to PhD (past trauma) the stress of the PhD, of keeping up and of not being sure if I was good enough and all that definitely made it worse, so I definitely sympathize with you so much here.\n\nIf you want to talk about any of this definitely send me a message. And remember that leaving academia is absolutely not quitting. Your mental health and happiness are always top priority, and if leaving is the best thing for you then I think you should be so proud of yourself for taking care of your health.",

      "text": "Hey! Just wanted to say I'm in a similar position to you -- I just started a PhD program in a different region of the United States after finishing undergrad, and the emotional labor of moving and adjusting is really taxing for me also. For me, I'm grateful for my cohort that I'm working with, as we try to make plans to grab ice cream and go on weekly runs together, which is doing wonders for my mental health. But when I went to visit friends still close to my undergraduate university, or when I visited family near me, I also broke down when I arrived back at my university because of how isolated I felt. Even with people around, I still miss a lot of the close connections that I've invested time into.\n\nIt's important to realize that making close friends takes a lot of time and effort. What you're feeling is natural -- as someone who also experiences passive suicidal thoughts though, I'm not saying that you shouldn't seek help (because it's important to reach out to a counselor or therapist near you), but I'm saying that it's also important to validate how you're feeling. Recognize that you are going through a big life change right now.\n\nAs others said, it's so important to find something you love doing outside of your PhD. For me, joining a graduate student a capella group is helping me balance my work-life -- when I return back to lab, I feel a little more motivated to continue my work. Try to take small breaks throughout your day as well, even if it's just walking around campus and listening to music or taking fifteen minutes to drink some coffee/tea at a coffeeshop near you.\n\nAs someone also not going into an academic career, you should evaluate whether your PhD is worth your time. Could you find a different group to join that might value your mental health? Does completing your PhD give benefits to your career goal, even if it's in a non-academic field? You might want to talk to someone from your career office about this and talk it out. It's important to note that you also don't need to make this choice yet; I'm giving myself until the end of my second year, when I finish my coursework, to make that decision for myself, as I'm also still adjusting to the environment I'm in. Just focus on adjusting socially first, as it seems like a lot of your problems are related to adjusting socially, before you think of what you need to do professionally.\n\nBest of luck, and genuinely hope you feel better no matter which decisions you make! Feel free to reach out if you need someone to message, and just wanted to say that I think that you're brave for admitting how you're feeling and actively seeking advice.",

Especially the part about passive suicide and feeing like a quitter, it was something I never really experienced before but when I started grad school during the pandemic I started thinking about dying every day and it was fucking with my head. Now I am on anti-depressants and I was able to take a leave from research activities which has honestly worked for me. If your school has the resources I would suggest trying to get a counselor at the very least if you don\u2019t want to try medication because even just talking about it can help a lot.",

      "text": "Are you me? I also moved to a new state, hours away from friends or family, to start my program during the pandemic, with no roommates, though I started last year on a 2 year masters program. I understand that passively suicidal feeling, and also have no local social connections. I cope with escapism (watching shows/livestreams/reading to forget reality), but I also interact with some communities on the internet, and occasionally I drink my troubles away and it's a happy time. I wish I knew of a healthy long term solution, but for now this is all I know.  \n\n\nA PhD is a lot to undertake in these conditions. I hope you're able to find the solution that works best for you, whether that be working with a therapist, taking a break from your program, or finding ways to make accessible social connections. I don't know where you are in the world, but if you are in a place that gets winter, my advice is to tackle this well ahead of seasonal depression. I almost couldn't function when seasonal depression was added to the mix of awful circumstances last year, it's not a good place to be. Prioritize your mental health.",

Out of my young social group, I was the only one who went onto college so I had to meet new people and was uncomfortable for most of the time, but it got easier the more I learned how to be \u201cindependent/alone.\u201d The couple of friends I made in college were just during the span of the courses, but even then you should attempt to talk to other grad students even if they\u2019re in different labs. \n\nIt\u2019s uncomfortable going off on your own at first, and even though you may feel like you\u2019re missing out on everything back home, you\u2019re doing fantastic things. At 23 and doing a PhD is impressive, It\u2019s literally a once in a lifetime chance to go and do science at another location. However even after giving it a chance, in the end if you don\u2019t feel comfortable still, you don\u2019t have to force yourself to do anything.",

On the weekends, the most exciting thing I do is grocery shop.\n\nI can tell you from personal experience that you can have this exact same lifestyle (for lack of a better term), and the mental health issues that come with it, while working in industry. Nothing you've written makes me think that this is caused by your PhD program, so simply trading the PhD program for an industry job, without changing anything else about your life, is not going to solve the problem. \n\nMy advice for you is this-- when you're thinking about quitting, or any other big-picture decision, you need to keep two questions in mind. What is the future you want for yourself, and what are the steps toward getting there? \n\nAnd I get that those are big questions and very hard to answer. And I know I made very little progress in answering them for myself until I started seeing a therapist. If it's at all possible, I would definitely recommend seing one.",
