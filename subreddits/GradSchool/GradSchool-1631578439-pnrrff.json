  "text": "back when I was doing master's, I knew this dude who were also doing master's in the same department. He one time complained to me that his advisor, who is very influential in the field and industry, was cutting his and all the other international students' support plans...I found it suspicious because there were plenty of foreign students in the professors' lab and I was fairly acquainted with them. Later, someone who graduated from the same lab told me that the guy in the question was basically being asked to leave the lab because he cost the lab several thousands of dollars loss due to botched experiments that were done for an outside company, struggled with research, failed to understand lab instruments over two years, etc eetc....so I lost all the respect for him because he tried to make his advisor look like a xenophobic to cover his ass. \n\nI just got a linked in request from him and I was curious what he was up to because the last update I got from his FB profile was t hat he was working for amazon. Lo and behold, he got admitted to one of the best known school for the same program! I instantly felt jealous because someone who got kicked out of lab for his incompetency *and* dishonesty somehow got into the most prestigious program in my field...or am I being unreasonable?",

      "text": "You're being very unreasonable.\nI've been in your friend's place a couple of years ago(incompetency, but I did not pin it on others), and one could argue that I was unfit for any programs. But now, after 2 years, I've come a long way and have achieved many things throughout the time. Thus, making me a perfect fit for any programs in the top schools too. I don't think the mistakes or my incompetency of the past should dictate my future, and it all depends on your growth as a person. So I'd suggest you to let go of the jealousy and acknowledge his success and growth.",

They\u2019re expecting to get fired, but then the boss keeps them on board because they just spent all that money basically training them not to fuck things up like that again. \n\nIf you make a serious enough mistake, you will 110% never allow yourself to make such a serious misstep again in the future. So if he did botch it in his lab, chances are he learned the lesson and moved on. \n\nWhether or not that\u2019s relevant in this exact situation is a different discussion, but I thought it\u2019s a useful perspective.",

He might be trash, but you and he will be afforded completely different opportunities in your life. Lives are not apples to apples comparisons.\n\nJealousy is not positive or motivating. Instead use this to drive yourself further down your own path.",
