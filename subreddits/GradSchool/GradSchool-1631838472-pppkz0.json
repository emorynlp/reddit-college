I am currently in the process of applying to IUPUI\u2019s master\u2019s program for Library Science. About a month ago I reached out to a few of my old professors seeing if they would mind writing a letter of recommendation for me. Three of them agreed and one has been turned in. I informed these professors that I would need these letters turned in by two months time and sent them the links. It\u2019s about a month till they need to be turned in and I have not heard a peep out of the two other professors. Would it be a good idea to check in with them and see what is going on? I\u2019m rather new to applying for graduate school and don\u2019t want to seem like a nag. Any tips would be appreciated.", "author": "ScreamingOntoTheVoid", "created": 1631838472, "retrieved": 1632952536, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hd5fjir": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pppkz0/when_to_start_asking_about_letters_of/hd5fjir/", "text": "Professors often wait until the deadline to submit letters.
