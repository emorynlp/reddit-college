  "text": "Hey \ud83e\udd20\n\nI am still in the first year of my Master's degree in Tourism. For five years of study at the university, I got a hell of a job working in boring Google documents or other similar services where it is impossible to work creatively.\n\nSo I created a small startup with friends to solve this problem. If you fill the same and want to look at how to get rid of boring documents, let me know in the comments. \n\nI don't advertise or sell anything. I need your opinion right now to create a handy thing.\n\nThanks for understanding :)\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qzldvk)",

Documents need to be rhetorically situated for the specific context they are used to address specific audiences.\n\nNow certainly, in some contexts, pleasing aesthetics can have a rhetorical benefit. But even within that range of rhetorical situations where that's true, creativity typically needs to be limited to suit the specific audience and genre.\n\nSo when you pitch this as getting \"rid of boring documents,\" that doesn't seem a very rhetorically savvy way of document production.\n\nFinally, Canva is a very powerful online, desktop publishing tool that has a free version. It has templates to suit a variety of writing genres. So you might want to think about how you would be able to compete with it\n\nhttps://www.canva.com/",
