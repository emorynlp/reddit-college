I also smoked for relaxation and to cope with the daily struggle of PhD life (it was also a ton of fun initially). It got to the point where it began to severely affect my quality of sleep and mental health, which resulted in my quality of work declining significantly.

But I can assure you, you\u2019re definitely not alone.\n\nI\u2019m an older student and now that I\u2019m back in grad school, it\u2019s kind of jolting how much my classmates talk about using alcohol or drugs to cope with \u2018stress\u2019. They mention it at least once in every conversation we have together, like it\u2019s a given that grad students turn to substances to cope. The crazy thing is that most times it seems they only need them to cope with anxiety related to their procrastination habits, and not the work itself.\n\nIn truth, whether it\u2019s an issue all depends on the substance and what you\u2019re getting out of it. If you\u2019re using CBD oil every now and then to manage anxiety, that\u2019s one thing. If you\u2019re consuming weed to the point that you think you\u2019re high every time you go to class or complete an assignment, that\u2019s definitely a concern. It sounds like you also have an issue with procrastination. It might be worth looking at how your marijuana use might be contributing to that. Procrastination amps up anxiety and stress by 100 easily, meaning all of that stress and anxiety can be avoided in another way. Alcohol is another beast. I won\u2019t even go into it.\n\nWhat helps you manage your anxiety and task levels day-to-day? And more importantly, what can you do in your daily life that *prevents stress from happening* in the first place? \n\nFor me, it\u2019s keeping my space (home and office) tidy and clean by doing a little cleaning every day, setting aside time to spend/play with my family, planning what I need to get done week to week ahead of each minor and major assignment, eating healthy (most of the time), exercise, and trying to limit interruptions while I work. I don\u2019t always do these things, but I\u2019ve been able to ingrain them into my life enough that they usually pick back up again quickly.\n\nTLDR, no you aren\u2019t the only one. But it\u2019s worth picturing how your life (and what you\u2019re getting out of you\u2019re degree) would be like without weed. Is weed helping you become the person you want to be?
