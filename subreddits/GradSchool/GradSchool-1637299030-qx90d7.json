I\u2019m lucky that they are mostly nice people, and tolerable enough to hangout with. However, as for making close friends outside of your comfort, well, hopefully someone will let me know that they figured it out",

      "text": "It's fun to talk shop with your graduate colleagues (a rare privilege to find other humans to speak with about your studies, the deeper you get into your field). I have seen other folks in these forums discussing competition and personality conflicts within their graduate programs. However, my grad school experience included zero \"popular\" people and zero dating.\n\nI did my MA in an intimate program in rural Indiana, over several summers in residence, so we really bonded; my experience was atypical, and incredibly religious. We still have a group text going, and it is active every week. Thank God someone was there to wake me up for class every morning.",
