  "text": "Hi,\n\nI've been thinking about entering graduate school to focus on economics and finance. However, many programs require one to have a minimum experience with economics such as having majored in econ or at least have taken intermediate micro/macroeconomic analysis. However, I went to engineering school for undergrad so I don't have any econ coursework. I do have coursework in intermediate mathematics (linear algebra, statistics, etc.). \n\nWhat would be the best way to get the requirements for entering into a graduate economics program?\n\nThanks :)",
