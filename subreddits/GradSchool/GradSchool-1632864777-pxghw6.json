So I just graduated with a BA in Psychology, and I'm looking to pursue as MA or MS in Clinical Psychology. I have no idea how to find masters programs or if I need to take the GRE. I'm a first gen immigrant and the first in my family to get a college degree. I don't know who to ask for help or advice.
