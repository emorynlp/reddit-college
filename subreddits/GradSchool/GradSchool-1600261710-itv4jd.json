My professor didn't solve a derivation in lectures and I received many questions about it over the week, so I posted the derivation on our online system two days before the exam. I just got an email from my professor letting me know my derivation was completely wrong. I fixed the issue but the exam is this morning and I am worried people will use my incorrect derivation and get the problem wrong.\n\nI feel guilty and like a horrible TA and could really use some advice and reassurance. How do you not let this affect you for the foreseeable future?\n\nEdit: I wanted to give you all an update. First, thank you so much for the encouragement and kind words it really helped me today!  \n\nThe first thing I did this morning was to update my announcement with the correct derivation on our online grading software. I also sent a mass email to all of the students in the class apologizing and including the correct derivation. Once I met with my professor, I apologized and he was very understanding and let me know that since it is such a tiny part of the exam we don't have to worry about it too much. If a lot of people have the wrong derivation I sent out as an answer he said we will discuss further and figure out what to do. All and all, it was a great learning experience for me and I will NEVER post anything without double-checking with someone again. \n\nThanks again for all the kind comments!", "author": "lep187", "created": 1600261710, "retrieved": 1632846310, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 321, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g5liecf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/itv4jd/i_messed_up_as_a_ta/g5liecf/", "text": "I feel like there's no one who will TA for a significant period of time in grad school who won't make a mistake here and there.
