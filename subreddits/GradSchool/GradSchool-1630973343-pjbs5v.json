Fresh masters student here looking for advice!\n\nMy university provides a lot of onedrive space. In my undergrad, I never backed up my files to the cloud. I just backed them up to an external drive whenever I thought to do it (every two ish weeks). Now that I\u2019m starting a new degree, I feel like I should just have everything saved to onedrive. \n\nIs that safe? What if something happens where I can\u2019t access my account at a crucial moment or something? I\u2019m on a Mac, so sometimes Microsoft things are iffy. Plus, it feels weird to not have local files. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts?", "author": "TheMadeline", "created": 1630973343, "retrieved": 1632844750, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "comments": {"hbyirc3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjbs5v/is_it_safe_to_put_all_your_files_on_onedrive/hbyirc3/", "text": "> Is it save to have only one copy of <important data>?\n\nNo!", "author": "Single_Blueberry", "created": 1631037707, "upvotes": 1}, "hbyhbts": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjbs5v/is_it_safe_to_put_all_your_files_on_onedrive/hbyhbts/", "text": "Time to scare you into being a bit of a paranoid data goblin. During my masters I had all of my data, articles, and thesis drafts stored in various locations. It went something like this Google drive, external hard drive, USB drive, SD card, and the computer internal hard drive. I was about half way through writing my first copy of my thesis when I had a power surge, I was in the middle of updating the cloud drive so I lost my whole folder from my internal hard drive and my cloud copies. A few months later my whole external hard drive bricked. The only ones that never failed me were the USB drive and the SD card. However both of those have the risk of being lost or misplaced due to their size.   \n\n\nI think it is safe to have one internal copy, one cloud copy, and one external copy.
