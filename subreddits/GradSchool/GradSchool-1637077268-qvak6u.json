      "text": "I've found the whole thing of \"networking\" as a specific task to be kinda bullshit. If you drink coffee and beer with colleagues sometimes that's just about as good as networking gets. You don't need to be dressing up, attending special \"networking mixers\", doing all these 2 minute theses things or whatever, unless you want to and enjoy them. Just talk to people normally and have a few friends working in the same general field as you (even if you don't hang out outside of work ever).",

      "text": "go into the lab with the intention to learn from others. your lab mates have all had the problems you are going to have and they can help you out. Your adviser is not really going to be teaching you a lot but your lab mates are. Misery loves company so be miserable with them... Hah.  do try to make friends with your lab mates and cohort. These are the people that are going to help you get ahead in the working world after grad school is done. it's not what you know most of the time but who you know. (and what you know but you get it)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm an extrovert and I usually made it my goal to help out others in grad school. I realize that it's gonna be a bit overwhelming at times but do try. It will make grad school more enjoyable.",
