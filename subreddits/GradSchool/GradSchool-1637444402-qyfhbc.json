  "text": "(I don't use reddit that much and I'm not sure where to put up this post.) \n\nI'm 19, doing Biochem (undergrad) since 2020. Out of 6 sems, 3 have gone by - online, without doing a single thing in the lab. One of the main reasons for me choosing biochem was the practicals, which I was looking forward to but still haven't gotten the chance to even see my college. I have no idea if my university has plans to open anytime soon and I have frequent breakdowns thinking about how I'm wasting my life learning a practical subject online. Also, I don't understand a lot of things online. I was super excited and happy the day I got my admission in this course but it hasn't turned out the way I was hoping. I don't even know how I'm supposed to think of what to do next when I haven't even done what I was supposed to do 1 year before. At this point I've also started doubting if this is the right direction I'm going in? I could use some help: should I visit a career counselor? Are there any online resources?",

      "text": "You should contact some professors in the department (via email since your online mostly) and ask if they would accept an assistant in their lab, someone will say yes and then that professor can be a mentor for you in the lab and teach you useful techniques and equipment/instrumentation. I took many in person labs in my undergrad and the only really important skills I ever learned were in my internship and when I volunteered to work in a lab during my undergrad.",
