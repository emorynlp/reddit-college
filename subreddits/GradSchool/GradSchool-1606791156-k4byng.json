Kept wanting to make a post here to vent how stressed I was beforehand, but I was too pre-occupied with prep and never got around to it.\n\nToday has been surreal; it was a remote defense and I passed and I've gotten tons of congrats from colleagues and acquaintances, but I haven't seen anyone in person all day except the lady at the coffee shop this morning. \n\nIt still doesn't feel quite real. Maybe posting about it here will help.\n\nEDIT: Oh, just realized I need to update my flair.
