  "text": "Hi all, I\u2019m a first year grad student in a science terminal-PhD program (I have not gotten my masters yet). I started research with my PI right away, and I am currently working on a project that is publishable. My PI wants me to write a paper detailing these results for a standard journal by the end of this year (my first year). Is this normal? Have any of you had this experience? When did most of you write your first papers? I do have several years of prior research experience in and publications in a related field, but I have never written an entire paper myself before. I am fighting that imposter syndrome and do have confidence that I can do it, but it seems much sooner than I expected (and is still daunting).",

      "text": "There's huge variation in fields there and in program structure. I'm in a field where PhD students typically need to take lots of classes and a substantive paper usually takes years, but you can conceivably be working on multiple papers at the same time. The timeline usually ends up being finishing the three papers at the ends of years 3, 4, and 5. \n\nHowever, it's a lot more conceivable in even some fields adjacent to mine, both because fewer classes and lower barrier to \"publishable results\".",
