I\u2019ve been set up for success. I have publications, I\u2019ve gotten grants and fellowships. I am on the short list for a great post doc position on a project with major implications for my field. The PI for the project pumps out papers like a beast. The post doc position has potential for advancement to faculty. \n\nAnd I have yet to go 4 days in a row without a an anxiety attack since returning from the on-site interview. I\u2019ve always dealt with anxiety, but not like this. \n\nI realized that I absolutely do not want to do this, and I should have known this a long time ago. \n\nI thought academia is what I was supposed to do. To do anything else would be wasting my intelligence and giving up (I am fully aware that this is nonsense). I\u2019ve always been a high achiever- this is just how it\u2019s supposed to be. The fact that almost every meeting with my advisor for the last year has resulted in a meltdown has nothing to do with the sinking feeling in my gut that I\u2019ll be miserable in academia.\n\nExcept it totally does. I\u2019ve finally started to listen to myself (yay, therapy!). That feeling in my gut was there for a reason. It\u2019s ok to not want to be under the constant pressure to publish, or the constant need to bring in grants. I\u2019d like life to be less of a struggle and a little easier for once, please and thank you. It\u2019s not giving up- it\u2019s deciding what I want to put up with for the rest of my career, and what\u2019s important in life. I don\u2019t have to make myself miserable to prove whatever the fuck I was trying to prove. I\u2019m not giving up.

This is something I've struggled with over the past four years with a lot of my anxiety and everything else coming to a reckoning point last year when I went to the annual national conference in my field and was questioned by former mentors and colleagues about what was next as I was approaching my final year of my PhD. After making the decision to leave academia, I felt better but I avoided sharing this information with my current PI because I still wasn't 100% sure that I would be happy outside academia (it's difficult to get hired with a PhD in my field outside of academia). Given the potential difficulty of finding employment outside of academia with a PhD (I'm willing to branch into other fields/types of jobs), I thought about every instance of my gut feelings of my body progressing to the point of physical sickness over the thought of all the pressure I was under and would continue to face post-PhD if I remained in academia, I seriously considered quitting. However, I also considered how I would feel about myself to have gotten as close as I have to completing the PhD only to quit with close to 2/3 of a dissertation completed (stupidly doing the 3-publication format, so that just makes it 10x more difficult/slow at this point). I knew I'd hate myself if I did quit having come so close, so I'm finishing the PhD with the knowledge and better outlook that I don't have to face this same kind of pressure and anxiety when it's all finally over. I also told my PI early last summer (about a month after the conference) after I was certain that I did not want to continue in academia. I can seek a job that allows me to leave work at the office and not have to face anxiety over the late-night must-reply-now emails from PIs demanding drafts and updates, an endless stack of papers to grade without picking up some undergrad illness from them, or the overwhelming pressure to hurry up and get those grant applications done or the long to-do list of other things to get done for various publications. I hate leaving loose ends, so I will seek to publish any remaining odds and ends following my PhD, but it will be on my terms and on my own schedule. \n\nGood luck to you in your post-ac journey!", "author": "Keoqe", "created": 1582144780, "upvotes": 2}, "fi4huue": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/f66a9k/i_didnt_realize_how_badly_i_did_not_want_to/fi4huue/", "text": "Be happy!
