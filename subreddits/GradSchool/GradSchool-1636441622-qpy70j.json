  "text": "Some background: I am considering applying to a master program in my field of expertise (engineering). I have a bachelor's degree in this field. However, I also plan to pursue another degree in different field (science).\n\nOne of my friends pointed out to me that once I hold a degree, it becomes harder to enroll into another at the same level, let alone getting a scholarship. This is very counter intuitive to me. Do anyone have any idea why?",
