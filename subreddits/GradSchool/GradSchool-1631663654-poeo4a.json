My institution does use grades (GPA), but as I'm new to my program, I don't have grades yet. The application asks whether your institution uses grades and what your cumulative GPA is.\n\nIf I'm new to my program, do I just put 4.0? I've tried to look for information on this, and I can't find anything. My institution doesn't provide me with a GPA so early (since... I don't have grades yet). What have others done?\n\nThanks!", "author": "littlereptile", "created": 1631663654, "retrieved": 1632844560, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcw98lx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/poeo4a/nsf_grfp_gpa_if_new_to_program/hcw98lx/", "text": "My program director said to just put 4.0.
