The events unfolded as they did and that is the only way they could have unfolded because you were never in control. The collective state of the universe was such that the events that unfolded were the ones that did. \n\nThis also means that being an impostor is impossible. You are just \u201cacting\u201d as your history has conditioned you. Regardless of whether you \u201cfit the criteria and requirements\u201d, you had no real control over anything so you couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. You are just a process running, experiencing the world, and that\u2019s it. \n\nI know it seems fatalistic, but it isn\u2019t really, it means that you get to enjoy a movie at the cinema, with all the pain, the happiness, the suffering, the touching moments, the confusion, and the awe, the inspiration and every range of human emotions, and that\u2019s it. You are just watching events unfold and there is no reason to feel bad about it.\n\nBy staying around for the movie you get to take in the good things, and by understanding that you never really had control, you can lessen the suffering. \n\n\u2014-\n\nPsychologists don\u2019t tell you this, either because they ascribe to free will, or because an internal locus of control is correlated with happiness, but this approach nullifies the very notion of external or internal locus control.", "author": "MythicalPan", "created": 1632906659, "upvotes": 3}}}
