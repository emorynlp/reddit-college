  "text": "I graduated undergrad in December 2019, so although I got to have my graduation in person, I also had the pleasure of starting grad school during a global pandemic after having a semester off.\n\nI felt so much drive and inspiration in my work before. I knew what I needed to do and exactly how to do it. Sure, the work is harder here, but after a year of being here, I'm convinced that had things gone down differently, it would not have been the uphill climb it has been.\n\nAny tips on how to get out of the vicious cycle of imposter syndrome, wondering how things could have been, procrastination, and self-loathing? ~Thanks.",

      "text": "This will be against what many therapists say, but I feel that it is the only immediate and intellectually honest way of getting out of your situation.\n\nAccept that free will is an illusion and that you are a mere observer.\n\nEven if this is wrong - which by the way, it isn\u2019t and I am willing to argue for it - accepting this as the de-facto state of life is exhilarating.\n\n>\tOkay\u2026 what if free will is an illusion? \n\nIf free will is an illusion then you have no reason to wonder how things could have been because they would have never been as they \u201ccould have been\u201d. The events unfolded as they did and that is the only way they could have unfolded because you were never in control. The collective state of the universe was such that the events that unfolded were the ones that did. \n\nThis also means that being an impostor is impossible. You are just \u201cacting\u201d as your history has conditioned you. Regardless of whether you \u201cfit the criteria and requirements\u201d, you had no real control over anything so you couldn\u2019t have done otherwise. You are just a process running, experiencing the world, and that\u2019s it. \n\nI know it seems fatalistic, but it isn\u2019t really, it means that you get to enjoy a movie at the cinema, with all the pain, the happiness, the suffering, the touching moments, the confusion, and the awe, the inspiration and every range of human emotions, and that\u2019s it. You are just watching events unfold and there is no reason to feel bad about it.\n\nBy staying around for the movie you get to take in the good things, and by understanding that you never really had control, you can lessen the suffering. \n\n\u2014-\n\nPsychologists don\u2019t tell you this, either because they ascribe to free will, or because an internal locus of control is correlated with happiness, but this approach nullifies the very notion of external or internal locus control.",

          "text": "Interesting perspective. I often find myself fluctuating between grasping for control and acceptance. The lesson I'm taking right now is that, as in most things, it is neither one nor the other. There is a balance. There are things that are certainly out of our control, more than we care to mention or even think about. Acceptance of these things is healthy. But I like to take agency for the potential positive impact I could have on people. Not that I'm under the delusion that I can save the world, but I can be nice to people, try to make their day better, treat them the way I'd like to be treated. I believe there is a certain amount of inertia against these sorts of actions, and thus accomplishing these actions requires a choice. Again, I'm not under the delusion that we are completely free. I'm not sure that we're even mostly free. But I'd like to believe that we do have *some* free choices, and it's best to take those opportunities to make our immediate proximal space better.",

              "text": "I think you do hit upon it which is the issue of agency (or motivation or meaning or locus of control as psychology conceptualises it) The observer perspective is detached and has that benefit of not getting too close and caught up in the coulda shouldas, but at the same time is perilously close to surrendering agency. Which arguably you need some amount of, as youve pointed out, simply to do things, make choices, and go through your day. You cant just sit back and watch all the time, or maybe you can, but thats more or less the definition of a rut that many of us feel in covid. That might be a good way when youre looking back though, reflecting on what has passed, and acknowledging that you cant change that now. So i guess going forward through life maybe its about toeing that line. still have agency, still strive, but when you inevitably get tired or face failure, accept it as it is, watch it like a film maybe or as if youre controlling a character in an rpg, and take in the tiredness and pain as not an indicator of blame, but just another part of the experience of life. So yeah I do think theres that balance to it as mentioned. Which is tricky to manage at times, so probably why therapists dont use that as a goto for long term mental health. but if it works for some then thats pretty good actually.",
