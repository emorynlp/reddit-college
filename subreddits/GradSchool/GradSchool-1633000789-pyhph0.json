  "text": "Is anyone else getting by on 3 hours of sleep a night? Will this have long term health risks if its only for 2 years?\n\nI just added my hours for the month and realized between TA duties, research, and coursework im averaging 69.75 hours of university work per week. I've not imploded yet and ive worked longer hours in the past, but this labor is entirely intellectual. Is everyone else sleep deprived?",

I\u2019d your not spreading it out over weekends.. you should (course work). \nThat leaves time for some personal like and sleep.. if your getting that little sleep it\u2019s probably either something else in your life\u2026 like staying up playing games/tv/going out.. our anxiety. If it\u2019s the first.. you need to prioritize sleep and give yourself at least 6 hours.. if you can\u2019t sleep go see a doctor (psychiatrist). Grad school is stressful, but they can help you deal with stress so you can sleep.",

          "text": "Agreed. Even if we assume that weekends don't count, that creates a scenario such as: 14hr work day (9am-11pm), give ~4hr for personal time (11pm-3am), then sleep 5-6hrs? Obviously one can't optimize life all the time, but averaging 2 hours a night is unsustainable and definitely will take a toll on mental and physical health.\n\nEdit: not to mention, this kind of workload became unsustainable for me personally very quickly. Be careful of burnout, OP.",

I've come extremely close to losing my mind and fully breaking down from lack of sleep, I was at the point where being awake was physically painful, missed shifts at work, and the quality of my school work plummeted.

Having said that, you are certainly on the extreme end and are getting an unhealthy amount of sleep. \n\nAs the others are saying, you need to give your body time to recover and rest. Think of it this way - you are likely going to be more efficient and productive if you are well rested, so sleeping is the smart thing to do. Also, sleep deprivation is tricky - it makes you impaired without knowing you're impaired. There are research studies showing that sleep deprived people **feel** that they are functioning as well as someone who is getting enough sleep, but then they perform worse on even simple tasks.",
