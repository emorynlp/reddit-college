  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am planning to start my PhD in electrical engineering next year and quit my job in top tech company where I work in the same field of my potential PhD.\n\nI would like to hear thoughts from other PhD students/graduates who returned to school after industry. How was it for you? Was it worth it? Do you regret it? How was the financial situation especially if you had a small family?\n\nEdit: to give context, I have a master's degree, work in Canada and plan to do my PhD in US. \n\nThanks",

      "text": "I returned to do a school in general and have ended up going all the way for a PhD in Environmental Engineering after \\~15 years in the restaurant business. To be fair, I had failed in my first attempt in college all together, so for me it was a totally new path. \n\nI found it was worth it, and I am sure it will be a quicker transition for you as you already have the masters.\n\nI do not regret it for a second. It can be stressful as all hell, but it sure beats trying to manage a region of restaurant managers and deal with generally shitty people.",
