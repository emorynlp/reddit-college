As time went on, my interests in research started to fade as I wasn't sure this was a path I wanted to continue pursuing. I kept my head down and continued on because I did not want to disappoint my parents or P.I.s, but I was miserable. On top of not enjoying the program, my P.I.s are incredibly difficult to work under. Extremely high expectations, couldn't have a personal life, I never saw my family even though its just a 4hr drive for quick weekend trips or holidays, and was constantly fed their twisted view of \"there's no such thing as work/life balance\". They seriously have tried to brain wash me and the rest of the grad/undergrad students to believe that worrying about work/life balance is for people who hate their jobs. They have even said things like how our postdoc ruined her career by having children....\n\nThis toxic work environment sent me into a spiraling depression and I hated the person I had become. Thankfully, I sought out therapy and that did help, but I still needed to do more. I needed to do what was right for me and pursue my own goals. In June, I sent a letter to my P.I.s explaining my own unhappiness (without burning any bridges) and explained that I intend on mastering out.  This was met with a lot of friction and manipulation as they said things like \"I hope this relieves you of your anxiety and depression, as it greatly increases ours...\". It was tough dealing with them after that, but I got through it. (To their credit, they did become more supportive towards the end as they saw I was serious.)\n\nI have since accepted a job offer from a biotech company as an account manager (the role I wanted), gotten engaged, successfully defended my master's, and I will be moving a few states away to leave this behind. I am so excited for my future now! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I was unhappy and now I am happy with a master's and a job in biotech.", "author": "smashvillian35", "created": 1628639871, "retrieved": 1632846478, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 269, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h8l23jl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p21hgn/my_journey_to_mastering_out_i_passed_my_defense/h8l23jl/", "text": "As far as mastering out....did you have to write a thesis, or some kind of final manuscript?
