The principle is that changes in humidity and temperature affect the resonant frequency of the sensor. \n\nOur goal is to make a calibration curve, so that we can measure the resonant frequency of the sensor and then tell what the humidity is in the environment. So the typical process is to control the humidity as an input, and then measure the output-the resonant frequency. Then fit a curve and invert the equation.\n\nMy major roadblock is that I\u2019m not provided a temperature/humidity chamber to control the environment so that we can characterize this sensors behavior. I\u2019ve tried using saturated salt solutions but the temperature of the room changes in day-night cycles and that also affects the resonant frequency so we would need to control the temperature too, or at least hold it constant. \n\nI was able to find a professor in my department with a broken chamber. I found out about him by talking with an IT guy who\u2019s job was to catalog equipment owned by the univeristy (anything over $6k.) this was just by luck/chance that he knew Dr. XYZ had a humidity chamber. But like I mentioned, a technician from the chamber\u2019s manufacturer came out and diagnosed a $2800 problem with the chamber. Dead end.\n\nOne of my professors had mentioned before that she had contacts in ABE (just another engineering department) who had temperature-humidity chambers. She said she could reach out to them possibly. \n\nAfter Dr. XYZ\u2019s chamber didn\u2019t work out, I emailed my professors (co-advised by 2) saying I needed help, \u201cwould you be able to reach out to your colleagues and ask about their temperature-humidity chambers?\u201d A week passed without reply. So I sent a follow up email. My professor responded with \u201cBefore I reach out to ABE, please provide more context why the current humidity chamber is not working for your experiment set up.\u201d I guess I was expecting \u201csure, we can help you.\u201d I explained to her the issue the technician found with the chamber and the quote for repair. She then said she would reach out to ABE and keep me posted. That was August 11th, she hasn\u2019t told me anything since.\n\nSo I guess what I want to know, is this normal? Am I supposed to have to fight just to get the equipment so I can even just collect data? Am I being underserved by my professors? What should I do to resolve this?", "author": "youre-a-good-person", "created": 1631374593, "retrieved": 1632844641, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
