  "text": "Basically what the title says - I struggle with anxiety surrounding math. I was a good (in fact, advanced) math student up until my HS calculus and advanced science classes, then things stopped coming so naturally to me. With a lot of effort and outside help, I was able to succeed in those classes, but along the way I was teased by my peers (my school was very STEM-focused and I was/am an artsy kid who excelled in English instead) and even some teachers.\n\nI did my undergrad degree in an arts/humanities field that didn't require anything above the most basic college math (easier than what I did in HS). Now I'm in a master's program that requires some quantitative courses. I'm currently in stats and I'm really struggling. I'm going to the professor's office hours this week, but does anyone have any advice on how to make the most of it/ask for the help I need? What's frustrating is I'm not sure if the problem is the material or my anxiety with the subject (I'm doing well on the homeworks but bombed the midterm). I'd like to succeed in this class, as it's important for some of the electives I'll take in the future. I also recognize that some of this is on me for not going to office hours until after midterms, instead of going weekly the whole time.",

      "text": "I research math anxiety, so I have some advice to offer for sure! In terms of short-term things you can do (like before a test for example), it can be really helpful to get your mind into a calm space. Look up some YouTube videos with basic breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation - if you practice those while you\u2019re feeling calm, then you can use them when the stress starts to hit to refocus! Methods from cognitive behavioral therapy are also thought to be effective - if you\u2019re doing a problem and you catch yourself thinking \u201cugh this is too hard and I\u2019ll never get it\u201d try to catch yourself and reframe that thought to something like \u201cthis is challenging but with practice and resources I can get there\u201d. It feels really silly at first but eventually it\u2019ll start to become automatic. Negative thoughts can get you in a negative headspace and make it hard to persevere, as well as being distracted. \n\nMath anxiety typically involves fear of evaluation, so the fact that you\u2019ve had negative experiences with peers and teachers can definitely contribute to how you\u2019re feeling. If you\u2019re doing well at home without the time and evaluation pressure, that\u2019s a sign that this might be anxiety-related. Try to remember that math anxiety is really common, but also it can be managed! People with MA can still do really well in math, but it\u2019s definitely something that can be highly unpleasant and debilitating if you don\u2019t have the tools to manage it. Get the support you need from your prof for the math skills, but know that the anxiety part might need some non-academic solutions! Best of luck, you\u2019ve got this.",

      "text": "Have you identified what, specifically, about math gives you anxiety? I have a similar story to yours in that in middle school I was actually moved up a grade in math and science classes, but ended up having more trouble in senior year of high school. I was never sure exactly why I couldn't seem to get things right because, conceptually, I understood things. It wasn't until college I found out that I am dyslexic. Sometimes knowing what is wrong can help you accommodate. For example, if I have to look at correlation matrices, I always cut off or black out the bottom half so it's easier for me to read. If I'm doing things in R, I tend to only print things to 2 decimal points because .05 is easier to read than .049967424556. \n\nIf you struggle with the statistics *conceptually, a*nother thing you could think about is watching YouTube videos. I don't know about you, but I hated learning statistics from textbooks because they were either written very poorly, or the examples were not at all helpful. If you're learning about a statistical technique like structural equation modeling, there's many youtube videos that cover that topic and many of them are well produced. I'm sure similar math subjects have channels or videos devoted to them that would be easier to learn from. [Statistics of Doom](https://www.youtube.com/c/StatisticsofDOOM) is a good one. I watch their videos, and my friend told me that's the only way she got through her stats class.",
