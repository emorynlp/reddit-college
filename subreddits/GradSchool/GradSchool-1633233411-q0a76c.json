  "text": "Okay, that's not correct, I do care but I'm not the person who wants to play mediator between citizens and the government. I was an Urban Planning student, and yes these issues are important, I'm just not that person. I've always wanted to be an elementary teacher so I'm pursuing that  instead. I will finish the semester but then I'll be finished. I just couldn't do it and that's okay for me, my family are happy I graduated high school and my bachelor's was a bonus. I just don't see myself happy in that field, I would have forced it but I'm happier this way.",

Really it all comes down to what sort of city you find work in and how much their city council/zoning board listens to their planners. \n\nMost American cities don\u2019t really do that, so planners can burn out from being ignored. There\u2019s a ton of potential to do incredible things, it\u2019s just difficult to see that happen. That and planning efforts are extremely long term things (15-30 years before you see the fruits of your labor for a particularly big project, for instance).",

You will find many more jobs in the suburbs, and this can be pretty frustrating. First, it\u2019s even more of an uphill fight to get small improvements to equity, walkability, or sustainability in most cases. Second, because you may be the only planner or part of a small team, you have much more responsibility. That\u2019s good because of the influence, but you have to handle all the cases and will likely work lots of extra hours. Third, if you want to live in a central city you will end up commuting, sometimes long hours. I commute about 3 hours a day - I\u2019m lucky and can use public transit. It\u2019s a frustrating field, but I still find it rewarding.",
