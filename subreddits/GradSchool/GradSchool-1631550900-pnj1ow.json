In the meantime, I've gotten involved in some cool open source work with other grad students. I'm curious if there is a way to find more interesting projects/other work that results in published papers by offering up my expertise to other graduate students. (Is this ok to do or bad practice in any way? Let me know if it is.) I've read that I'll be able to do this with other students in my program but that's about a year away and I'm happy to contribute something to a project in the meantime. Is there a good way of finding projects or fellow students for this type of thing?\n\n  \nI'm particularly interested in NLP or climate change work, but open to anything interesting. I have experience with Python, C++, and Swift, and web/mobile (ios) development (and I have undergrad degrees in Political Science and Public Health).", "author": "apkswift", "created": 1631550900, "retrieved": 1632844593, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcq7flw": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnj1ow/how_to_find_other_students_to_co_author_papers/hcq7flw/", "text": "You can offer to other grad students or your faculty.
