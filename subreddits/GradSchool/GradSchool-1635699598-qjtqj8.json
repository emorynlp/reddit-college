I often freeze up if asked a difficult question and I occasionally blank tbroigh nervousness too :(",

      "text": "I feel you, friend! My first ever conference, I got a question from a hostile-ish listener and I totally froze. Didn't even know what they asked in the first place let alone answer it. Lol.\n\nI decided to learn from other speakers, see how they reacted to (tough) questions, how they formulate the answers etc. Starting with that is an interesting question, thank you, is a good idea; it gives you some precious seconds to think about a potential answer and sometimes just speaking a few words kickstarts your brain into action. Another possibilty is to say something along the lines of thank you for the question, I had not considered this line of thinking but will be sure to examine it in the future (even if you don't), or this is a very contentious issue in the literature because xyz and these are some options they mention, but for reason zyx it can't currently be resolved...\n\nHope this helps! I'm not an expert on public speaking at all, and the pandemic didn't help my budding skills, but I have learned a lot in the past three years since my first conference.",

      "text": "Knowing how to respond to stuff you don't know graciously while acknowledging that you, in fact, just haven't thought of that, as u/opheliazzz points out, is a key thing to know. Having that in your back pocket can help take the edge off.\n\nBut there is no substitute for simply rehearsing your presentation. Pretend you have a full audience in front of you (whatever that means for you, it could be 30 people or 300). Give your presentation out loud, in full setences, presentation slides and all--no shortcuts!--before this imaginary audience.\n\nThen do it at least six more times.\n\nYou won't necessarily \\*feel\\* less nervous or more prepared. (The literature on speaker apprehension tells us that people appear to be much less nervous as perceived by audiences than those people feel internally when speaking.) But you will in fact be more prepared.",

      "text": "Write down the question (or keywords that are part of it) as it is being asked to you. Like writing lecture notes, it helps your mind focus on what's being asked, and sets your mind to start connecting essential words, concepts, ideas, and potential responses. When you're nervous, your mind can't juggle as many things at once: by writing the question down, you also don't have to waste precious bandwidth trying to hold the question in your mind, and can focus on coming up with the answer instead. This works even better when the questioner uses way more words than necessary to ask their question, or uses time after the question to start rambling on their own ideas about the topic, during which you can basically tune them out and get a head start on thinking through responses.",

      "text": "On presenting confidently: practice helps a lot! Both for practising your particular presentation, and also presenting more often. I started doing outreach just to practice talking to an audience as the idea terrified me, and it helped a lot.\n\nFor answering difficult questions... Well, I still suck at it! I've never been good at thinking on my feet or under pressure, let alone in front of an audience and on a difficult topic. I also have a terrible habit of assuming I don't know the answer and panic and try to justify why I don't know it. I still run on nervous autopilot during question time. Taking a deep breath and taking time to think, and rephrasing the question back to the asker to make sure I understand what they're asking, can help calm. I still usually struggle with answering but the world hasnt ended yet and I'm the only person who seems to remember my fails. So that's something!\n\nEdit: being a good speaker seems to redeem my uselessness at answering questions. I put a lot of time and effort into my presentation anyway, but that helps me feel better to balance out how bad I felt about answering questions.",

I started off really bad at presentations and because my mentor was able to tell me exactly what I was doing wrong, I learned how to incorporate that into my presentations and got better and better over time. It's also the best confidence booster when a harsh mentor tells you you've done a great job - then you know they really mean it.",

      "text": "if you're presenting to a research group or a group of similar small size, then knowing your audience is pretty important. i would guess potential questions my previous advisors could ask with a pretty high accuracy, since they tended to dwell on details and connecting key features to topics i should have (and generally did) learn in class. now with my new advisor, i asked around his current and previous phd students what he'd look out for during presentations, and i did reasonably well for my first time. so yeah, get to know your audience.\n\nsecondly, as others have already pointed out, practice. make mental notes of what to point out in your slides. personally, i don't like to present with prepared speeches since they tend to come out unnatural, and the structure of my speech could be at risk if someone were to ask a very 'destructive' question. so i tend to go with a somewhat planned flow, if that makes any sense.",

So far, the best thing I have found is to just take a couple deep breaths if I notice myself getting too shaky or speaking too fast. I used to worry about creating awkward pauses, but it's much less awkward to take a moment to compose yourself between slides than to keep going and getting more nervous.\n\nAlso, if someone asks a question I don't know, I do one of two things. My first choice is to answer a similar question if possible. If someone asks a question about one set of data and I know the answer for another set, I might mention that and draw a comparison. Otherwise, if I'm really unsure, I try to be upfront about it. If it's a good idea I hadn't thought of, I'll say that as well. People will generally be more understanding of that than some bs answer, and it also prevents people from asking further questions about any bs.",

I usually try not to BS answers too much because I've see situations where speakers try to do that and step backwards into opening themselves up to more questions based on something included in their answer.\n\nIf you want to stall and are tripped up by a question you can also always ask them to repeat it.\n\nI should add that I get super nervous presenting too and haven't mastered most aspects of it, but question & answer usually goes better than expected in my experience (if only because I tend to expect the worst). You can always have someone review your presentation ahead of time to give you some ideas about what questions may arise, or you can try to anticipate them yourself and then prepare answers for the ones you think are likely to come up (though often will end up being pretty random vs. expectations).",

Think of your presentation more as a conversation, like you just have some interesting thoughts to share. Don\u2019t have a script ready, don\u2019t rush, speak slowly and take your time; before moving on look at your slides and think critically about what you want to say and get across. Let some silences happen, it\u2019s hard for someone watching to keep up with people talking fast with no breaks. With regards to questions, just be honest! Think about what was asked and answer directly, take a few moments to consider the question and repeat it if necessary. \n\nTl;dr: try your best to approach it as a casual, lighthearted conversation. You will have a good time and your audience will probably have a good time too!",
