  "title:": "My mentor published my results without me.",
  "text": "I noticed this today, but it was published last year.\n\nTo give some background: He was mentor of my master thesis which I\u2019ve done as an exchange student, plus I was having additional mentor from my home institution. He didn\u2019t mention anyone, not as coauthor, not in acknowledgement, but he managed to use ALL of my results, literally c/p, and ALL of my microscopic images which are literally the SAME as in my master thesis.\n\nAt the time of publishing, I wasn\u2019t working in academia, but now I\u2019m working as researcher (in that same field) enrolled in phd studies (in third institution) and I have no idea what to do. I just know I feel very disturbed.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks everyone for advices! I talked with local ombudsman and scheduled a meeting with legal services. Advice I got is to protect myself first, and I hope I\u2019ll find a balance with protecting, doing the right thing while avoiding conflicts which I heard in academia can be on primate level. I also hope I won\u2019t become one of those extra paranoid people concerning my research. Hopefully, I still try to believe how collaborations can make great stories in science.",

Assuming your Master's thesis was published first, it should be easy for you to prove.\n\nAddress an email to the Dean's office of the college where you got your Masters. And if there is a Dean of Graduate Studies, include them in the email, too. \n\nWell document it by attaching PDF's of your thesis and of the journal article. And then provide page number references for each.\n\nIf you're hesitant about doing that, talk to your current PhD advisor. Show them your thesis and the journal article. Ask them what they think you should do.",

And so the op would not have to bother.\n\nPlus, it would be better to let the institution be the first to confront the professor, so that it appears on his employment record for tenure and promotion review. Once the journal changes the authorship, then the institution might decide not to get involved at that point, to just sweep it under the rug. \n\nSeems important to have the institution involved, to make sure the professor doesn't do this to any other students.",

      "text": "It sounds like you\u2019re no longer at the same institution, which is great, because you have to worry less about any backlash.\n\nI think there are at least three people to notify: the university (his dean, or an ombudsman), the journal, and the co-authors (or your other supervisor, if he contributed).\n\nFor the journal, I would look at their website and authorship guidelines. There will 100% be a section about authorship and who MUST be listed as an author and approve the submission. In the email, reference/quote that guideline, PLUS the policy they have against plagiarism, which should also be in the guidelines. Even if you\u2019re concerned about the equipment use, those guidelines should clearly state that contribution to the writing, photos, analysis, etc. count for authorship. List exactly what work he DID contribute, as well as yourself or other authors. I would assume your thesis is published online in a repository of some sort? If so, link it in the email so that the website shows the date you published or defended it. You can also tell them that if necessary, you will provide email communications that show drafts of your work passing hands that show you were the author (assuming you have these).\n\nI\u2019d also email your other supervisor. You may reach out via email and link the article, and just say \u201cwe\u2019re you aware of this publication? He did not get or seek my permission and I plan to bring this to the attention of the journal. Would you like to be involved or cc\u2019d on the email?\u201d If your worried that they may not want to make a fuss and stop you, you could tell them that you HAVE made a complaint to the journal and you wanted to inform them also.\n\nThen, reach out to someone higher up at the university. The university is likely very clear about plagiarism in its guidelines somewhere as well. If you are worried about communicating with them directly, you could always cc them on the email you send to the journal, or when the journal responds THEN involve the university by forwarding the response to the university and say \u201cI am forwarding a complaint I have lodged against (name) to the (journal). I was a master\u2019s student in (year) supervised by (name) and have recently been made aware that (name) published my work without my consent or knowledge without listing me as an author or acknowledging my contributions. This is against the guidelines of the journal (link to the specific authorship and plagiarism guidelines) as well as your school codes (if applicable and you can find that written somewhere).\u201d\n\nYou do NOT need to give the professor a heads up or confront him. He will be notified by the journal. If you do want to contact him, you can say you were made aware of the publication and as he did not get your permission and copied your work, you have/will reported it. No need to ask questions or anything, but if you DO want his reason for it, I\u2019m sure that will be enough for him to respond with a defence. Depending on his answer, and if he gets aggressive about it, you can include that communication in your complaints. I wouldn\u2019t personally inform him, though. \n\nFeel free to contact me if you want help looking into or writing it! I work on a lot of manuscript submissions and I\u2019m very familiar with the guidelines of journals and finding them. DM me the journal if you want help locating them or composing an email, I\u2019m happy to help.",

For professors, many have their names on papers that they contributed very little to - it's just how it works for some research (if you considered to the conceptualization, any of the drafts, any of the data collection/analysis). The professor said this is YOUR research. Does that mean he wrote the draft of the article, but it is based on the research you did/data you collected or analyzed? If so, that is absolutely grounds for authorship. If ANYTHING, I think that this just shows you how much more you deserve your name on the other paper: if one mentor is willing to name you on this paper with little contribution, then the other author should be naming you on the paper that is almost entirely your work.\n\nI honestly wonder if he's done this before. Where your thesis is published, can you search by supervisor and see a list of all theses he has supervised? If so, you could compare them to any single-author papers he has to see if this is routine for him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso consider that this article was published! That means the work was good, and publishable. YOU should have had the chance to publish that, and now you can't as long as the article is out there with his name on it. He took that chance away from you.",

I think that is the point people are making. \n\nAlso, the entire \"this isn't an opinion, it's reality\" approach is not great. Yes, the PI and moreover the University owns the data. That doesn't mean they can falsely represent that they produced the data themselves. The difference is nuanced and not really given to black/white thinking. \n\nSince I have had this happen to me, and I spoke to my department head about it, I know for sure that the OP could reachout to the journal and the journal would NOT be happy. And while the PI owns the data, they still can't use the OPs writing without attribution. In my case I just let it slide because that PI was getting fired and I don't want my name associated with theirs. But a PI can't take the OPs writing from their thesis and publish it would listing the OP as contributor.",
