  "text": "I'm at the end of my first year as a master student and I dread everything, from the classes to the project I'm working on. I believe I made a poor choice of program, even more after accepting change the subject of my project - it's too late to change it.\n\nI wanna drop out, but I won't, since I'm so far now. But I just want to know: have you (or some friend of yours) gone through the same? How does it felt the thesis presentation, the feeling of looking at your diploma and thinking \"this is nothing of what I actually wanted\"?",

      "text": "Unless you can run through that thing in another year, there's no point in keeping up with it. There's no shame in dropping a program and it's not going to impact your ability to go into a different one that you're actually passionate about or interested in. Your mental and physical health should be priority and if you're suffering and questioning your decision after one hear, it's only going to get worse. I know this isn't what you asked after, but seriously consider if staying is worth the investment. Sunk cost isn't real when considering things like this.",

      "text": "It's hard! Also it is ok, and not uncommon to drop out. Especially if you also think you would not enjoy jobs within the field, in which case there is not much point in sticking it out. I've loved my classes and love TAing so not quite in the same situation as you, but I hate research. I don't find my topic intresting, I'm not good at self-guided research, and in the rare moment I actually find something intresting, I do not feel like I'm doing it any justice... I'm hoping to graduate this semester, still trying to finish writing my thesis but am not excitited for my defence. I have debated switching to non-thesis but in that case it would be hard to get a job within the field and I don't dislike the field in general although I'm not very passionate about it either...  I think it is worth pushing through it for me since it will hopefully allow me to get a job I enjoy. However if that turns out to not be the case (whether I can't get a job within the field or if I hate it) I will try to work within something else that does not require significant additional schooling and I know I will not pursue a PhD.",

      "text": "If you don't like what you're learning, you don't want to be there, and the degree will definitely not help you with your career path, then there's no sense in staying.\n\nIf it will significantly help with your career path, then just push through it. You're already halfway there and it's only one year. See it as an investment. View it as a professional, and get the job done.\n\nThe same thing can happen in the professional world. People sometimes find themselves in jobs that they don't like. But they stick it out for a year or two because the experience will be helpful for their long-term career goals.",
