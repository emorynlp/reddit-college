I also turn in papers feeling terrible about them and end up receiving As. I never disparage over it, even if it feels surprising or even undeserved at times.  I think it comes down to my perspective on academic success, not being indicative of wholistic ability or self-worth.  \n\nIt sounds like your perception of yourself relies on a series of external factors, like grades. Being a *perfect* student, researcher or academic ultimately proves very little about your success in any of those endeavors.  Having the perfect paper will not do as much for your career. \n\nLikewise, reaching the next level on your academic chapter, without achieving an imagined standard, does not undermine your credibility as a smart person.  You likely already are all of the things you hope to be.  You just haven\u2019t undergone the entire process mandated to demonstrate the degree of certainty that having a degree brings. That process will teach you how to do many things better, like writing papers, thinking critically and time management.  You will become more informed through the sheer volume of reading you will need to demonstrate your comprehension of in order to complete coursework.  But it will not change the capability you already had when you entered your program.  \n\nYou\u2019re meeting the standards set forth by those in charge of deciding who is an authority on the subject.  Your only task is to appreciate that there is a method to the madness, and follow the process by engaging in each step as it is laid out in front of you. That\u2019s it.  One foot in front of the other, all the way to the end.  Academic degrees prove to the outside world, first and foremost the fortitude to forge ahead and complete a long and difficult process.  It\u2019s a process that many people will never bother to embark on, let alone complete.  They don\u2019t prove anything outside of that in terms of the value of your personhood to anyone else but you.  The only one who can free you of the association between being a worthy person, and obtaining a level of competency as a student is you.  \n\nYour degree performance should be a means to an end.  The only attention you pay to grades should be on the basis of what they mean for scholarship funding, acceptance to future programs you may seek to apply for, or maintaining a gpa that keeps you active in your program.  Grades have no intrinsic value for you. They only serve as indicators that you were able to complete the process laid out before you.  Those indicators are for the outside world to observe, not for you.  Each teacher uses their own combinations of subjective and objective criteria in assigning these indicators.  They are not entirely reliable at assessing skill, ability, or even wholistic academic performance.  They are equally as fallible as the people you aspire to be.   Sometimes you might be assessed with more scrutiny than deserved, or with an erroneous or unfavorable set of grading criteria.  Sometimes, you will enjoy favorable results.  Take the wins when they come, but understand that they aren\u2019t worthy of the value you are placing on them.  \n\nImposture syndrome presupposes that everyone else knows what they\u2019re doing and has it all figured out.  The longer you stay around those who have reached the level of success you desire, the more you become convinced that they are all just figuring it out as they go.  Every career academic has papers that they submitted as busy work and would rather never see again.  Their success is a result of continued trial and error, and MAYBE a few good hits along the way.  They aren\u2019t successful because they were without mistakes, but because they stayed with the grunt work after all those years.  \n\nI connect to that sinking feeling of unworthiness only in hindsight now. This is helpful as I\u2019m in a Master\u2019s degree program now, and my grades are only important for the reasons I mentioned above.  \n\nI\u2019m not sure what your goal post is for proving your capabilities to yourself, but my guess is it is unrealistic.  I don\u2019t know what brought you to your graduate degree but it sounds like you are in a field of education.  You might be hoping to compete a PhD, or just finish a masters degree for career advancement as a teacher.  Either way, everything I said is true and you know it.  In a few years, when you\u2019ve reached your next goal post, you won\u2019t be thinking about these grades.  Try to place value instead in your stamina and ambition to pursue this dream. Those are factors within your internal locust of control.  Try to remember that the goal posts you set will be moved farther away by your own standards.  After an achievement, you will have a new set of goal posts.  This process will repeat again and again for all of your adult life.  Reconsider the way you internalize your ability to reach these goals exactly as envisioned.", "author": "Onelaughatatime", "created": 1607938018, "upvotes": 2}, "gfsoyfj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kcnoly/grad_school_has_turned_me_into_a_person_i_dont/gfsoyfj/", "text": "This absolutely resonates with me.

Never happy about the quality of my work, somehow it always ended up being \"good enough\" to not draw attention. Stress kept building, slept less, eventually broke and dropped the program altogether. I was never told my work was bad. My advisor only ever noted that I seemed to be losing interest in what I was doing. He was right, I just failed to see how my work was acceptable and that was what ultimately weighed me down. \n\nFirst, know a part of it may be imposter syndrome. It's super sneaky and normally more visible in retrospect. Don't let it get you down too much.\n\nSecond, if your prof is going out of your way to comment that your paper was good, then it was probably genuinely good, all things considered. Remember, you're not turning in stuff you aren't proud of because you just didn't want to work on it. You're turning it in like that because you have a lot on your plate and trying to manage your time as best you can. It may not have been your best work, but in the time allotted, you still stood out from your peers in a positive way. Focus on that, it will help. \n\nLastly, keep in mind that your advisor, while admittedly busy themselves and not necessarily giving the closest look to your work, will let you know if you start noticeably slipping and turning in poor quality work. At least if they are halfways decent they will. It is, after all, in their interest for you to perform well too, as that reflects well on them. \n\nIn addition, if you really keep feeling like this try one or more of the following:\n\n* Talk with your advisor about it and express your concerns. Make sure they know how much it is bothering you and that you're worried those feelings may start negatively impacting your work. \n\n* Consider looking into student counseling services your University offers. They likely will be able to help you better come to grips with possible imposter syndromes and perfectionist behavior that is hurting your performance and mental health. (At least if they are decent)\n\n* Do your best to set up a schedule for yourself that includes non-work time. Sometime when you can just go for a walk/run/destress/whatever you need, just make sure it can help you stop thinking about your research and school work for a bit. The break will help you come back to look at whatever problem you're facing there with a renewed perspective, among other general health benefits. Particularly if the break involves some form of exercise. \n\nHope this helps, keep your reasons for starting grad school and goal for going to grad school in mind as a guidepost to strive towards. You're work may not be acceptable to you, but that is okay. You don't always have the time to put forth work you are perfectly satisfied with. And that's okay.
