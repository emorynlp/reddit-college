{"sid": "dayu2n", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/dayu2n/i_got_an_email_today/", "title:": "I got an email today", "text": "I have never been the smartest kid in the batch, since middle school - I was decent. I barely got into one of the better undergrad schools for chemical engineering in India. I did not like what the curriculum had to offer. In my school, we did not have the option of taking courses from other departments even if you have the acumen or are interested. I wanted to do computational bio, so I started learning stuff on my own and applied for REU fellowships and when I was in sophomore year, I bagged a prestigious fellowship from the Govt. of India. I started believing in myself more.  \nAfter undergrad, I joined Penn State for my PhD where I was super happy to work on computational biology. Again, since I had no prior formal training in neither computational science and biology, my progress was very slow. My advisor isn't the best person to be with if you are a slow learner. I had to digest numerous humiliating one-on-one meetings for being slow. I knew I am getting there, but he would be the last person to buy that. I started putting in more hours and started talking to more students to broaden my knowledge horizon. Last year, I ended up publishing in a top journal after working out a problem for three long years. I am a sixth year PhD student now. I want to stay in academia, so I started applying for post-doctoral positions in several universities. My advisor initially had said that he would forward my applications to some of the good labs, but now insisted I submit a certain manuscript before I apply anywhere. I got some interviews after 50 applications or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I received an email. It read - \" We would love to have you join us and contribute in our computational protein design efforts at the xxx lab at Harvard Medical School \". I am really happy after a long long time. I am about to defend in a month now.", "author": "Lutar24", "created": 1569780721, "retrieved": 1632953290, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 616, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"f213raf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/dayu2n/i_got_an_email_today/f213raf/", "text": "Are Bhai sun na Mai class 11 me hu aur Mai undergrad ke liye MIT ya Caltech Jana chahta hu.\nMera ntse aur nsep aur nsec qualified hai .", "author": null, "created": 1569867521, "upvotes": 1}, "f20f89i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/dayu2n/i_got_an_email_today/f20f89i/", "text": "Congratulations!
