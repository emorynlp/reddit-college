I don\u2019t have motivation, I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t want to do it. But I don\u2019t want to quit at the same time.",

      "text": "Same thing here. I have this fall semester and then lastly my spring term. Though, I\u2019m just a senior environmental engineering major. It\u2019s tough because my brain feels like it needs a 5 year hyper sleep to work off what feels like brain inflammation from the years of stressing my brain tf out coursework. I didn\u2019t start with an advantage in uni. I came from parents who only got high school diplomas and to top it off out of a high school in a southern Bible Belt. Hell, I didn\u2019t talk until I was 5, and I didn\u2019t read until I was 7. Life\u2019s been difficult. I\u2019m struggling to find where I fit in and who to relate to. I come out of a state with way different values than say a northern state. I\u2019m surrounded by people who won\u2019t even touch a sip of alcohol. Yet I want an education and want to buy that nice big home and have my child have a wealthy start with the resources to do anything they want. My mind is constantly teetering and trying to find the right mix of these elements and wondering if there\u2019s someone in a similar boat. I feel like my soul is the perfect mix of the most contradicting elements society has, and I wonder if someone else is out there like me. \n\nRight now though\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to not think about all of that and muster up the courage to finish this semester. I\u2019ve been doing it for nearly 3 1/2 years now. So I think I can finish strong. \ud83d\udcaa",
