      "text": "Same thing here. I have this fall semester and then lastly my spring term. Though, I\u2019m just a senior environmental engineering major. It\u2019s tough because my brain feels like it needs a 5 year hyper sleep to work off what feels like brain inflammation from the years of stressing my brain tf out coursework. I didn\u2019t start with an advantage in uni. I came from parents who only got high school diplomas and to top it off out of a high school in a southern Bible Belt. Hell, I didn\u2019t talk until I was 5, and I didn\u2019t read until I was 7. Life\u2019s been difficult. I\u2019m struggling to find where I fit in and who to relate to. I come out of a state with way different values than say a northern state. I\u2019m surrounded by people who won\u2019t even touch a sip of alcohol. Yet I want an education and want to buy that nice big home and have my child have a wealthy start with the resources to do anything they want. My mind is constantly teetering and trying to find the right mix of these elements and wondering if there\u2019s someone in a similar boat. I feel like my soul is the perfect mix of the most contradicting elements society has, and I wonder if someone else is out there like me. \n\nRight now though\u2026 I\u2019m just trying to not think about all of that and muster up the courage to finish this semester. I\u2019ve been doing it for nearly 3 1/2 years now. So I think I can finish strong. \ud83d\udcaa",

      "text": "Me too. I'm so heartbroken by my grad school experience. I started my MPH in fall 2020. It was remote. I struggle a lot with online formats but I can do it, and they told me a lot of it would be synchronous zoom classes, which I thought would be a good stand in for in person. They assured me spring would be online and that I shouldn't defer for a year (which I immediately considered when they said it would be remote).\n\nIt wasn't the worst semester I have had (that would be next semester!) But it wasn't great. Still I had a favorite class that I looked forward to, and that was something.\n\nSpring 2021 rolled around. They announced it would be remote again. I went part time with my course load because I truly felt I had learned nothing the previous semester. I threw myself into my job and world of warcraft to distract myself from how miserable school was making me. I felt like I was insane because NO ONE seemed willing to admit it was bad. Most teachers and classmates just mentioned it was \"not ideal\" but they were \"making the best of it\". \n\nWell I wasn't. I wasn't making the best of it because I can't fucking learn like that. I learn heavily through discussion. In fact, that was what I was most excited about for graduate school. I was so so so excited. I loved school in undergrad, I excelled with lecture and discussion classes alike. I was enthusiastic, and even the classes that I \"didn't like\" still had elements I could enjoy.\n\nDuring finals in the spring I snapped. I made the mistake of filling out course evals before completing my finals. It basically forced me to reflect on my experience spring semester. The thing I had been forcing myself to dissociate from in order to get through it. I filled out evals and was unable to do finals. I managed to get one in on time, which was for my slightly-less-miserable class. The other class I can say without a doubt was the worst learning experience I have ever had in my life. Lightly sexist teacher with unclear assignments and unidentifiable grading criteria and also 100% remote. Every time I tried to start on the final for his class, I became so angry that I would sob uncontrollably. I got an extension and managed to get it done somehow. \n\nI fell into a deep depression over summer. School wasn't the only factor there but finals was definitely the beginning of a very dark spiral that lasted for months. I decided to not take summer classes and just focus on myself, and hope that the time would help me feel better about school.\n\nFall 2021 was back in person. I didn't feel excited about school. I've never not been excited for school. I signed up for all in person classes. I hoped that it would feel better once I got there. I have gone from feeling overwhelmingly negative about school to neutral, sometimes skewing slightly positive or negative depending on the day. This is also I new feeling for me, I was always so positive about school in undergrad. But it was a step in the right direction at least.\n\nHowever, I have one class that keeps getting shoved online for arbitrary, totally non-covid/non-health reasons. She clearly wanted it to be hybrid from the beginning because she had the class vote on whether they wanted in person or hybrid (it was listed as in person on the course sign up)... The class voted heavily in favor of in person which she said was \"unrealistic\" and that she would \"try but it would be some zoom classes\". \n\nI went to one zoom class and nearly cried in the first few minutes. It took me right back to the last semester, dragged up anger that I've never felt before, refreshed the zoom fatigue I had been building up all of last year in an instant. I can't and won't go to zoom classes now because of that. It instantly makes me angry. It makes me think about the education I was promised, the education I was excited for, the education that is so expensive.... And what I got instead was this.\n\nI need the social elements of learning to retain information. I'm \"that kid\" in class.... You know how there's always three kids that talk in any undergrad discussion class? Well I'm always one of them, and I'm the one who talks the most. I love learning this way. I love learning through discussion and through answering questions. It's how I learn best. I can't do it on zoom. I don't know why but it just doesn't work on zoom. I can't engage with classes how I used to.\n\nI just got notified that a class I'm signed up for will be hybrid next semester instead of in person (it was originally listed as in person). I was supposed to spend the day working on a project and instead I just cried. I wish I never decided to go to this school. I wish I never decided on this program. It is a huge regret of mine. I'll finish my degree because I'm more than halfway there at this point, but if I could do it over again knowing what I know now, I never would have made these choices.\n\nI feel slightly better about school compared to how I felt last year, but I still struggle to feel even a fraction of the enthusiasm I had in my undergrad, and my newfound \"neutral\" feelings about school are difficult to maintain. I'm trying so hard to feel okay about it. I'm trying so fucking hard just to not hate school. \n\nNext semester I'll be forced back online. I'm so upset. I'm so heartbroken. I'm so tired. I wish I never went to this school. I wish I could do this over. I wish I felt like I have learned things in the past year and a half, but I don't feel like I have. I don't feel like I'm in school. I don't feel connected to school or to people at school or to the university. All I know is I want to be done as soon as I possibly can so I can get my piece of paper and get out. Hopefully none of my employers ever notice that I'm at the same level academically as I was my senior year of grad school.\n\nThanks zoom university. You robbed me of the joy I once felt for you. You've made me hate my choices. You've broken my spirit. I went from loving and looking forward to school to despising it in two semesters. I hope I can get even a fraction of that back so I can make it through this degree without it affecting my mental health so much. If I ever have to do zoom learning again I think my only course of action is to throw myself back into WoW and try to not think about it as much as possible.",
