What stood out to me was how a seemingly reputable university (uChicago) preys on naive undergraduates and uses personal prestige to sell an expensive graduate program that has terrible market value. And yet, their marketing is so good that an average student, or one desperate to go to grad school, wouldn't even notice.\n\nSo my question is: what are the red flags of low quality graduate programs? What advice can you give for students trying to wade through the marketing bs to find a good program?\n\nArticle: [https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-masters-trap](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-masters-trap)\n\nAnother Article: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: If you want to get into the data, check out the source directly - US Dept. of Educations College Scorecard offers information on income, debt, acceptance rate, field and level of study (e.g. associates to phds).

It will only cost me a few thousand every 6 months to get my masters in a feild that typically you pay to get it (def a cash cow for schools, but it's a professional program). My perspective here is for a masters in a professional program. Red flags from what I saw where:\n\n1. Schools that offered admissions to a certificate program or newer masters program after denying you your first choice. These where almost always useless certificates or radically different programs that would cost thousands of dollars. Huge pass.\n\n2. Programs and schools that had zero flexibility for working students. My top choice program told me when I was accepted that they strongly discouraged students from working and had zero processes in place if you ever needed to drop below full time status for any reason. It was basically a full commitment or you where kicked out of the program. In a post covid world it seems unrealistic to expect that from students and crippling their ability to make money while in school is a big red flag. They should be actively helping you find work in your feild and willing to work with you on life events.\n3. Schools that are cagey or vague about funding. Again, my first choice school told my cohort that none of us would know if we got a scholarship or funding untill one month before the program started (ie after acceptance deadlines for our program and others had long passed). They also only offered 1 full scholarship, and if you weren't the lucky person who got it your would need to pay full price. They where incredibly dismissive and unwilling to work with any of us to be more transparent about funding and ultimately wanted to play \"will they or won't they\" with our finances. Compare this to my school I'm at and accepted which told all admitted students that they can and SHOULD always ask for more funding and got us all our funding offers within 1 week of our acceptance notifications. In addition they provided us 1:1 hour long talks with financial aid to get all our questions answered and to negotiate our aid packages. My school even adjusted the amount of funding I got after the school did raise tuition by %2 to cover the difference so my scholarship was still covering what we negotiated (they did it unprompted). Long story short, one school treated it's students as a cash flow and you where on your own vs the other bent over backwards to help students get more money.\n4. Lots of recent graduates on LinkedIn only have \"recent graduate\" as their job or are working in completely unrelated industries. That means their school didn't do well helping connect them with employers and just took their money. Or they learned little to no marketable skills.\n5. Ask for the course catalogue and see what kind of classes you'll be taking. Are they all ungrounded, thought based work? Run. Are they teaching you hard skills like R, Python, writing, research design, community work, etc? Great! A few classes about feminism in the 21st century are fine, but you need hard skills to make your program worth it. They should be teaching you something more than you could read in a book. And hard skills should be grounded in some kind of work or result you can add to your resume, not just a course you could have watched for free on YouTube with no product.", "author": "mysideofthemountain_", "created": 1627835887, "upvotes": 5}, "h7bvag7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ovlzo2/what_are_red_flags_of_low_quality_graduate/h7bvag7/", "text": "Large cohorts.
