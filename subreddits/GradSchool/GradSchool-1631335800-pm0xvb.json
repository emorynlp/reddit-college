The review process usually means *negative* feedback though. ~95% of all journal club discussions and presentation questions are focussed on finding flaws in the work, so are paper reviews and draft reviews. There are *always* limitations that can be pointed out. There are *always* flaws or mistakes that can be poked. Academia is constantly critical, and not usually in a constructive way. \n\nSo academics spend all of their time picking others\u2019 work apart. \n\nIt takes a mindset shift to get away from that negativity and I don\u2019t think most people can (or will) do that for their lunch break.

Working with other folks in computer science and statistics at my university, those are the most toxic departments at my university where students are overworked and abused. There was a big scandal in, iirc, the engineering department with an abusive professor. \n\nI think the way graduate school is structured inherently invites toxic and abusive behavior. Grad students have no power, and faculty have all the power. If you are a project assistant, you are dependent on your supervisor for your income and tuition remission and there often aren't positions you can just move into if that relationship turns sour. There just aren't many good mechanisms for disciplining abusive faculty members that do not disproportionately impact grad students. For example, if a professor is fired, everyone who is funded by that person and advised by that person is going to be impacted, and many departments don't have the ability to deal with that situation without disrupting the students' education or finances. \n\nThen there's also the fact that, after you get your PhD, many positions *still* want letters of recommendation so that can be held over people's heads. Personally, I think letters of recommendation should have been done away with years ago. It might have made sense in the 1700s when it took half a year to get from New York to California, but the internet exists and people's work history is available online so letters of recommendation just seem like some ancient practice that people hold onto for no particular reason. Letters of recommendation also don't have any value imo because they're almost always good. Why would people ask for a letter of recommendation if they aren't confident they'll get a good one? It's no surprise everyone looks good on paper.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1631344487, "upvotes": 16}, "hcenueg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pm0xvb/why_are_so_many_departments_so_toxic/hcenueg/", "text": "No job security + formal hierarchy = a bad time no matter what the industry.
