Seems like academia is in denial about the impact of the pandemic on grad/undergrad students", "text": "Currently I'm a second semester MA student at a top 20 school. So far I've frankly been baffled how desperately academia is trying to pretend everything is normal. There is a massive global pandemic which forced everything online, we're seemingly in a second great depression, and many countries including my own (United States) are falling into deep civil unrest. And while all this is going on, as graduate students we're expected to carry on like everything is fine. But everything is not fine. The world is on fire, yet professors keep piling on the work expecting us to keep up.\n\nIt's absolutely unreasonable to expect us to be able to focus on our research during a time like this. Personally, online remote learning is absolute hell. The lack of libraries or cafes open to study outside my room makes studying sooooo much more difficult. Add to that the lack of social interaction for those of us living alone and it's no wonder grad student mental health going down the drain as the world also goes down the drain.\n\nBut strangely...academia has failed to recognize these issues in any meaningful way. When reaching out to professors, advisors, and family friends in academia they all echo the same sentiments \"Push forward\" and \"Seek therapy\". Even today I received a tone deaf email from the dean of my school saying something along the lines of \"During these unprecedented times I hope we can seek refuge in our intellectual research\". To me this is a refusal to acknowledge the emotional, mental, and sometimes even physical difficulties some students are now going though. We're not research machines....we're human beings. Since the beginning of the year I've moved 5 times and was staying in motels for a bit. I know quite a few other grad students with similar experiences...\n\nI find it funny that academia prides itself on being so open to change and forward thinking. Yet when push comes to shove and the world rapidly changes around them, academia proves itself to be just another large (profit motivated) institution that is slow to adapt and recognize problems.\n\nAcademia is deeply in denial about the current state of affairs and it's expectations of students. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way but nobody wants to talk about this. What do you guys think?\n\nUpdate:  Since this seemed to really resonate with fellow grad students and some  faculty in this sub I decided to expand it and post it on medium.\n\n[https://brooks3532.medium.com/academia-is-in-deep-denial-about-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-its-students-and-faculty-db15ffcf910f](https://brooks3532.medium.com/academia-is-in-deep-denial-about-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-its-students-and-faculty-db15ffcf910f)\n\nI really want to encourage people to start talking about this.
