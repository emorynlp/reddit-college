I really liked doing the bioinformatic analysis on the covid sample so I tried applying for bioinformatics jobs here in India and after 'n' number of rejections i have given up hope of getting into the bioinformatics field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to ask whether I should try to get into a diploma course in bioinformatics abroad or should I just go for PhD or BINAC here in India", "author": "Gokul_Suresh01", "created": 1630774053, "retrieved": 1632953145, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
