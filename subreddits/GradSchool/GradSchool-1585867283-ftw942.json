  "text": "I just received an email from administration informing me of the passing of one of my students. There was no other information. I don't know if her passing was Covid related or due to other circumstances, but it's hitting me in a way I wasn't expecting. I didn't know her super well, but she was always pleasant in class, asked good questions, and we occasionally ran into each other around campus.\n\nAs a TA, I'm new to teaching and this is a first, but it feels magnified given everything going on right now. It makes sitting down to do research feel trivial and like there are bigger things to worry about.\n\nI feel like I should bring this up with the rest of the class, but doing so over zoom or email feels so impersonal. This is mostly just me needing to put this out there, somewhere, but this week was already starting to get to me and this news brought it to a new level.",

Any time a student passes our Uni sends it out to everyone and offers condolences, but I'm sure current instructors are notified first. I had something similar happen to me when a former student (from the first class I TA'ed) who had graduated and was a local bartender committed suicide. He was one of my favorite bartenders in town and it hit me pretty hard. \n\nMake sure that, if/when you notify your students, to put them in contact with mental health/counseling services in the area. And head there too if you feel so inclined.",

      "text": "Hey, I'm very sorry this happened to you and wanted to offer some words of advice for closure, because, unfortunately, I've been here. One of my students (when I was still in undergrad serving as a peer mentor) passed suddenly in a car accident. I figured that part out on my own. I was told very bluntly, before a lecture, by my supervisor. I collected myself in a matter of seconds because I had to, but it shook me. \n\n\nMy advice here is - look for an obituary. It's kind of morbid, but it brings closure. Read it, and then gather your thoughts. Breathe deeply, and if you prescribe to religion, pray/meditate accordingly. \n\n\nI'd also recommend reaching out to counseling services on your campus, your department or your advisor to get some assistance in coping with it, as well as to tell them maybe to tread lightly in the future regarding the topic of death, as it's a sensitive subject, and should be handled as such. Addressing your class would be wise, as well as directing anyone affected to counseling or crisis management. \n\n\nI hope you find peace, OP.",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry. Are YOU ok? Even if you barely knew her, it\u2019s just a reminder of how precious our time is. It\u2019s sad and horrible and scary that this happened. \n\nSo my university usually sends out emails to the whole campus whenever a student, staff member, or retired faculty member passes away. You should bring it up during class, just to let them know, point them in the direction of the school counseling center (if they\u2019re doing online appointments) or another online counseling service, let them know you\u2019re here to talk (only if you feel comfortable). \n\nBased off of my schools personal experience with the current events, you *need* to stress that we can\u2019t speculate or start rumors right now about how she died. My university had a Chinese student pass away due to the flu earlier this year and initially didn\u2019t announce the cause of death. Our online groups were flooded with racist trolls who didn\u2019t have any affiliation with us accusing us of covering up coronavirus, saying it was a shame that he went home over break and brought the virus back (although the student hadn\u2019t been in China in over a year prior to his death). After some further investigation, it turned out the student had called 911 but they couldn\u2019t find him in his apartment building based off of cell phone location. The police and EMTs never got to him, so he was found hours later by his roommate. A tragic, easily preventable death that we had to cope with while dispelling rumors.",

It is just this reminder that people can be here one day, and gone forever the next. \n\nA lot of students at my HS died (mostly related to opiods and drunk driving), and it was always announced. \n\nHow big is the class? If it's a big class (100+ people), I personally would do it through email, and make it clear that if anyone wants to discuss it further, they can reach out to you (if you feel comfortable with that), or just provide campus services that are meant for dealing with this sort of situation. Of course, if any classmates are friends with this person, expect them to be affected and be flexible to work with them.  And then in the next Zoom lecture, I would carry on as usual. \n\nIf it's a smaller class, I'd say something in the Zoom lecture because in that case, the setting is a little more personal and people are more likely to know who you're talking about, so an email might seem cold. I'd just keep it brief, though, let people know they can reach out if they need t (or provide resources), and then carry on with the lecture.",
