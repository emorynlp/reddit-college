There was no other information. I don't know if her passing was Covid related or due to other circumstances, but it's hitting me in a way I wasn't expecting. I didn't know her super well, but she was always pleasant in class, asked good questions, and we occasionally ran into each other around campus.\n\nAs a TA, I'm new to teaching and this is a first, but it feels magnified given everything going on right now. It makes sitting down to do research feel trivial and like there are bigger things to worry about.\n\nI feel like I should bring this up with the rest of the class, but doing so over zoom or email feels so impersonal.

One of my students (when I was still in undergrad serving as a peer mentor) passed suddenly in a car accident. I figured that part out on my own. I was told very bluntly, before a lecture, by my supervisor. I collected myself in a matter of seconds because I had to, but it shook me. \n\n\nMy advice here is - look for an obituary. It's kind of morbid, but it brings closure. Read it, and then gather your thoughts. Breathe deeply, and if you prescribe to religion, pray/meditate accordingly. \n\n\nI'd also recommend reaching out to counseling services on your campus, your department or your advisor to get some assistance in coping with it, as well as to tell them maybe to tread lightly in the future regarding the topic of death, as it's a sensitive subject, and should be handled as such. Addressing your class would be wise, as well as directing anyone affected to counseling or crisis management. \n\n\nI hope you find peace, OP.", "author": "rnorrell27", "created": 1585886368, "upvotes": 6}, "fm9vtrx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ftw942/i_was_just_notified_of_a_students_passing/fm9vtrx/", "text": "In one of my early CS classes, we had a student who passed away due to an odd medical condition.

Are YOU ok? Even if you barely knew her, it\u2019s just a reminder of how precious our time is. It\u2019s sad and horrible and scary that this happened. \n\nSo my university usually sends out emails to the whole campus whenever a student, staff member, or retired faculty member passes away. You should bring it up during class, just to let them know, point them in the direction of the school counseling center (if they\u2019re doing online appointments) or another online counseling service, let them know you\u2019re here to talk (only if you feel comfortable). \n\nBased off of my schools personal experience with the current events, you *need* to stress that we can\u2019t speculate or start rumors right now about how she died. My university had a Chinese student pass away due to the flu earlier this year and initially didn\u2019t announce the cause of death. Our online groups were flooded with racist trolls who didn\u2019t have any affiliation with us accusing us of covering up coronavirus, saying it was a shame that he went home over break and brought the virus back (although the student hadn\u2019t been in China in over a year prior to his death). After some further investigation, it turned out the student had called 911 but they couldn\u2019t find him in his apartment building based off of cell phone location. The police and EMTs never got to him, so he was found hours later by his roommate.

If it's a big class (100+ people), I personally would do it through email, and make it clear that if anyone wants to discuss it further, they can reach out to you (if you feel comfortable with that), or just provide campus services that are meant for dealing with this sort of situation. Of course, if any classmates are friends with this person, expect them to be affected and be flexible to work with them.  And then in the next Zoom lecture, I would carry on as usual. \n\nIf it's a smaller class, I'd say something in the Zoom lecture because in that case, the setting is a little more personal and people are more likely to know who you're talking about, so an email might seem cold. I'd just keep it brief, though, let people know they can reach out if they need t (or provide resources), and then carry on with the lecture.", "author": "iloveteax", "created": 1585873908, "upvotes": 10}, "fm9ktgu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ftw942/i_was_just_notified_of_a_students_passing/fm9ktgu/", "text": "I sympathize.
