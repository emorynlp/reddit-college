  "title:": "Revelation: PIs Lack of Work-Life Balance is Not My Problem",
  "text": "I am entering my 4th year in my PhD program, and since coming to the revelation in the title I think I've finally found inner peace. My PI is incredibly hard working: with half a dozen projects, multi-million dollars in yearly grant revenue, a national lab appointment, has an impact factor through the roof, and dozens of collaborators. Everything is an emergency because she has to meet so many external expectations, and works all hours of the day. She often says she sleeps 2 hours a night, and I tend to believe that. She also has a family, and has to balance those expectations as well. I have a tremendous amount of respect for her, but she also had those same expectations for me.\n\nTook me most of my first year to realize that isn't normal, not something I should emulate, nor something any person should be expected to do. Took me longer to stop feeling guilty for not being able to perform and deliver like that and actually take a weekend off. For a while I felt bad about not working that hard. Although given she makes 10-20x my salary, not that bad. She has a family, kids and aging parents, and sometimes I'd pick up some extra slack if she'd sent me an email at 9PM. But those woes continued, my extra work wasn't appreciated it was expected, and she would ask for more involved help, including submitting papers and proposals to projects I wasn't involved with at all and would receive no credit on and TAing an extra semester. That's where I stopped, when it caused friction I raised this issue to the department head and dean, and we've had a great working relationship since.\n\nPoint being, her career goals and 'grindset' aren't fair to anyone including herself, and once I learned that it's not my responsibility to fill in her gaps or emulate her work, I was able to set sane boundaries for myself. Regardless of the chaos she is currently living through, I can't make that better or fundamentally easier. That's the field she sowed, not my job to reap it. If I'm drummed out of academia, so be it, but I won't work and live like that. I just wanted to share this, hopefully the experience I had will prevent the overwork and unrealistic expectations many grad workers feel.",

If OP thinks she isn't there for her family as much as she should be, then that's between his supervisor and her family. I understand its not healthy to overwork ourselves but this sub can sometimes be ludicrous with all the judgements passed on supervisors who seem happy with how they have structured their lives. If they werent happy they would probably leave academia. We all complain about our lives, just because a supervisor complains about theirs doesnt make them unhappy",

How those unrealistic work habits were bad for my health.\n\nYou proceeded to post how I was a leech and said you'd never hire me, and how you're too good for this subreddit but have since edited it away (gaslight much?). That aksually unless you're working 60 hours a week and suffering you aren't cut out for it (abusive). That I wouldn't know suffering amd hard work because I haven't had a child. I'm sorry. That's actually sexist. Women choose to have children or not have children for a multitude of reasons, that decision does not make them more or less a women, more or less capable of working hard and understanding pain.\n\nSaying girlboss is sexist is like saying you can't call cops pigs because its fatphobic, its such a stretch and devalues the actual experiences of sexism women do face in grad school.

Just not versed enough on specific policies and programs that's other countries would have.\n\nHowever based on my experiences both in industry and union organizing, I could give you some examples at a micro level which would be easy to implement at both department and college level. Easiest thing right off the bat is universal benifits, health, dental, vision, childcare/child leave and paid/accruable vacation. No R1 has any excuse not to provide these to its PhD students, but track record varies institutionally and many programs aren't transparent in recruitment. Paid vacation time that you either A) use or B) are compensated for is standard at national labs and within industrial R&D so the idea we need to be on the clock all the time doesn't track.\n\nWhich brings me to working hours. I'm sure you can do a search on productivity studies, sleep, and hours worked; such that we are less effective at our jobs after ~50 hours. Two ways to address this: cultural and financially. Financially would be overtime pay for grad workers who need to be putting in those hours, because they are going above and beyond, while providing a metaphorical thorn in the side of department admin which can then encourage labs who are overworking to bring in more students instead which from a cost-benefit perspective makes more sense. Same incentive structure as literally everywhere else. Culturally though, that's a tough one. As evident by a lot of replies, at a spiritual level a lot of people tie their identity to hard labor, and at least in the USA that protestant work ethic doesn't just vanish and runs beyond academia. Big discussion with lots of ways to approach it. Having grad unions or orgs have actual voting power at trusteeship/deans meetings would be a place to start, we currently have no input into the culture we live in.\n\nLastly, every department should be doing rotations before students commit to a lab. Currently in many programs you're tied to your lab for a fixed amount of time lorded over by someone you may or may not have had a good opportunity to meet and see if the next 5 years will be a good fit. You can transfer labs, but that's often detrimental or not possible, or you can quit. I think offering rotations prior to qualifying exams (or similar) would alleviate a lot of these student-professor mismatch issues while allowing incoming grad students to develop a breath of knowledge and skills they need in their field.",

                          "text": "Hey sorry about the delay, real work/life called.\n\nA lot of these policies would effectively increase the cost of graduate student labor. In terms if capitalist market negotiation, we as grad students don't really hold enough power, individually, to demand more. To the Provosts and bean counters, why pay more when you can pay less? Even assuming good faith on behalf of administrators and PIs wanting to pay us a fair wage and decent benefits that any worker has earned, increasing cost per head of graduate worker and giving them more time off would decrease the amount of students most colleges would allow in and thus reduce the degree of work/productivity in terms of publication metrics. Research and academia is just as beholden to the same forces of capitalism as we all are. So that's the answer in a nutshell, below is my rant about why that is and what we can do to start fixing it. Its unions.\n\nIn America, wages have not kept up with productivity; yet my University's endowment grows and its president makes 45x my salary. Clearly, they are not operating in good faith. Universities COULD stop paying their presidents and upper admin crazy high salaries and instead of investing the endowment in real estate or the S&P, invest it in its students and workers; but, since that is unlikely to happen we are left with the situation we have. \n\nGrad students are largely captive labor, we are tied to the institution and our PIs like peasants to their lord and field. You could leave, but you cannot transfer your skills, negotiate salary, or interview for better position. It is a very narrow and precarious spot to be in, admin knows this, and can pay accordingly. Because, at the end of they day we aren't here for a paycheck we're here for a degree and to do research, and many students will put up with the abuse to get that degree. We are stuck, and in the case of international students, quite literally; your immigration status is tied to your employment. This is structure which compels quiet compliance and is by definition non-democratic.\n\nThis is why it is critical for grads to unionize, and why we are seeing such a big push for that right now. Individually, we can't do much more than send a pleading email. But united, our labor makes the university function and without us it would grind to a halt. We can demand things like cost of living adjustments and vacation time, but only if we work together. The only reason things like a 40 day work week or vacation time exist at all is because of the labor movement of the 1890s-1920s. The American labor movement never really 'won' or formed its own political body* so over time the New Deal was gutted. In my view, this helps explain the growing income inequality and income productivity gap, and should be a call to revive labor movements.\n\n* Footnote: America is unique in that it never succesfully formed a discrete labor party. Most industrialized countries that had a labor rights movement ended up forming it's own lasting political party, be it UK Labour or the French Socialist Party.",

Just because you're a non-profit doesn't mean you'll make student-first spending decisions. I think you'll find plenty non-profits, University or otherwise, spending quite frivolously. 501(c)(3) doesn't preclude you from paying your president a seven figure salary or buying up land and buildings in the area.\n\nIronically, in the States STEM labs are pretty well funded and most PhD students with active research projects are fully funded. In my field, ARL/ONR/AFRL grants pour billions into fundamental research because America has prioritized funding of \"defense\" research in interests of national security. So depending on your country, they might have other priorities.\n\nI think my broader point is that our academic output has increased but our quality of life and pay has decreased relative to the cost of living and inflation. We could alleviate this, but it requires systemic change, which is why I can't say \"Oh look at country X or University Y\". It requires a revaluation of how we prioritize research and labor and a fundamental shift in how our economy works. But, just like in 1900 the idea of a 40 hour work week seemed ludicrous with no one implementing it, we can change our world through coordinated action.",

I am more interested in critical analysis of who is currently directing those economic forces and if the trajectory of those forces is leading us in a net positive direction. You are viewing things with a very narrow cone of reference, treating these things as a zero sum game of winners and losers. Nothing in analyzing academia, and the degree holders and careers it produces, would imply that it is a zero sum game so I am not sure how you came to this conclusion. \n\nYou are working from the assumption that the US system is better, I disagree. By what metrics or contexts is it superior? Can you honestly say the United States, and/or its University system, is a perfectly healthy with a positive trajectory and no need for improvement or critical analysis? I am saying that the current resource allocation system is not functional, competitive, or beneficial to society. Academia is competitive, but one which is competed against on many fronts and across many events/skill-sets. The multitude of economic, political, and social levers which select who climbs the ivory tower and who stays at the bottom is anything but meritocratic OR democratic. It is this I am saying we should change.\n\nI think if you want an introductory text into the critical analysis I'm discussing and the reasons why I think we need to radically change our approach to not only academia, but our broader economic, political, and social frameworks as well then you need to read \"Why Socialism?\" by Albert Einstein. My philosophy of how we should change things and shape society stems from that understanding and worldview he espouses.",

From chattel slavery to inperialist wars of conquest, these are features of liberal capitalism, yet we continued to analyze, build, and improve until we reach the present day. How many millions die from inadequate medical care and nutrition, yet the UN has had these as human rights since the mid 1950s. Capitalism has failed deliver on those goals, and instead enriched an increasingly smaller minority of people at the top while driving us to the cliff of climate catastrophe with no solution in sight.\n\nMarx understood the value of capitalism in accumulating sufficient surplus and level of industrialization to transition to socialism, a more efficient and equitable economic system. To me, we have long past the neccesary productive forces to enable socialism. We produce enough food, medicine, and technology; it's a question of distribution and what purpose the technology is serving. Socialism in the 20th century were our first experiments with State Socialism, largely in impoverished, semi feudal, or post colonial nations. They were encircled and fought in a cold war, and in the case of Veitnam, literally bombed back to 1890 infrastructurally, with 3 million killed, and are still dealing with the effects of chemical warfare committed against them. Perhaps if capitalist countries weren't constantly exploiting and invading the 3rd world, these nations wouldn't experience crushing poverty. The reasons for the failures of socialism in the 20th century are a big discussion, but there are many successes and lessons to be learned in those experiments. For being such an advocate of STEM, you do not approach economics as a science. \n\nSeems like every 8 years they need to prime the pumps and bail out some massive sector of the economy. My family lost their jobs, nearly lost the home, in 2008. I began working when I was 13. We relied on charity and community to get by until things stabilized, we never got a bailout but Wall Street did. Perhaps I wasn't a \"competitive\" enough child laborer in your world view; but my world view stems from that, so spare me with \"you should be more grateful\". Parts of America are a third world country, 1 in 7 of our children go hungry, lacking running water or are food deserts. What you don't understand is many Americans are already living a third world existence. The apocalypse is here, it just isn't evenly distributed yet.\n\nChange is inevitable. Socialism or barbarism? As the pressure cooker of climate change literally boils the world, will we use our technology and surpluses to empower and serve the people or will we face common ruin and war over dwindling resources and shrinking markets?",

Now we're talking about something different. I'm not describing the LVT, and there is and isn't value in adherence to Marxist orthodoxy. You wouldn't argue Deng, or even the Soviets under Khrushchev, as adhering to LVT, but in the case of Deng was able to rapidly industrialize and modernize his country irregardless. I've read more than a few hot takes, certainly know more about socialism than a self proclaimed investment banker; someone directly benefiting and profiting from this exploitation. Do you not think that would introduce some bias into your view? Academics still discuss the validity and application of LVT, but again, you're attempting to change topics. \n\nIf you don't want to pay graduate students, then higher education will only ever be available to the wealthy. Same issue with unpaid internships, which are required in many fields for people to ascend, get a career, and escape poverty. Or, you're requiring those from the working class to work more than their wealthy cohort to make a living which would negatively impact their ability to obtain a PhD. I am well aware of the race to the bottom mentality of capitalism, like rats crawling over each other to escape a barrel. Perhaps this is what people like you want, humanity to constantly be fighting itself to the bottom, but I will work for a better, more productive, and more humane system.\n\nI'm not writing you a paper with calculations and 45 citations about where and how value is stolen in the form of IP at universities. You could commission that research, and my rates are competitive, but otherwise you can do your own work. I am simply answering the question of where my surplus value has been stolen, and you are not entitled to a research report in a casual conversation. Now, unless you're willing to actually respond to my points and argument rather than project your own lack of knowledge onto me and insult me with this, you can continue to gish gallop your way to the door.",

There was an immense amount of planning to take on two appointments, a dozen students, tons of grants, and the responsibility therein. An immense amount of planning and work went into creating this situation.",
