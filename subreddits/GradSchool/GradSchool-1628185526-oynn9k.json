My PI is incredibly hard working: with half a dozen projects, multi-million dollars in yearly grant revenue, a national lab appointment, has an impact factor through the roof, and dozens of collaborators. Everything is an emergency because she has to meet so many external expectations, and works all hours of the day. She often says she sleeps 2 hours a night, and I tend to believe that. She also has a family, and has to balance those expectations as well. I have a tremendous amount of respect for her, but she also had those same expectations for me.\n\nTook me most of my first year to realize that isn't normal, not something I should emulate, nor something any person should be expected to do. Took me longer to stop feeling guilty for not being able to perform and deliver like that and actually take a weekend off. For a while I felt bad about not working that hard. Although given she makes 10-20x my salary, not that bad. She has a family, kids and aging parents, and sometimes I'd pick up some extra slack if she'd sent me an email at 9PM. But those woes continued, my extra work wasn't appreciated it was expected, and she would ask for more involved help, including submitting papers and proposals to projects I wasn't involved with at all and would receive no credit on and TAing an extra semester. That's where I stopped, when it caused friction I raised this issue to the department head and dean, and we've had a great working relationship since.\n\nPoint being, her career goals and 'grindset' aren't fair to anyone including herself, and once I learned that it's not my responsibility to fill in her gaps or emulate her work, I was able to set sane boundaries for myself. Regardless of the chaos she is currently living through, I can't make that better or fundamentally easier. That's the field she sowed, not my job to reap it. If I'm drummed out of academia, so be it, but I won't work and live like that. I just wanted to share this, hopefully the experience I had will prevent the overwork and unrealistic expectations many grad workers feel.", "author": "Outmodeduser", "created": 1628185526, "retrieved": 1632953767, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 459, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h7y8fz9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oynn9k/revelation_pis_lack_of_worklife_balance_is_not_my/h7y8fz9/", "text": "These are all amazing points.
