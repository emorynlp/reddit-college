I am putting together a PowerPoint presentation for an upcoming job interview and I want to build in a \"status\" bar into the template of my slides.\n\nAt several conferences, I have seen researchers put a pseudo status bar that is grayscale above the title of each slide. The top portion of their slide had a light blue background, while the status bar was grey and the title of their slide was dark blue.\n\nFor example, when the researcher was explaining their research methods,  they would change the greyscale color of \"Methods\" in the status bar so that if anyone tuned out of their talk they knew exactly where they were at... I want to make this, but am not incredibly artistically inclined and had trouble finding an example on the internet...\n\nDoes anyone here know what I am talking about and if so, do you have an example you wouldn't mind sharing?", "author": "OceanDrive_23", "created": 1631232158, "retrieved": 1632844676, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hc94xwx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pl9tcl/status_bar_for_ppt_presentations/hc94xwx/", "text": "Go to View tab \"Slide Master\" then create a rectangle or group of rectangles with your labeled sections and place them where you want them positioned.

Right click, Format, Solid Fill, pick whatever color you want (gray is typical), then change the transparency percentage. Changing the transparency depends on the color you picked, font color, color of you new rectangle, etc. I like to start with 40% then go from there.\n\nYou'll have to manually copy and paste the transparent rectangle to \nhighlight or shade the section you're describing on each slide.", "author": "ismyusernameoriginal", "created": 1631235488, "upvotes": 2}, "hc92o3d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pl9tcl/status_bar_for_ppt_presentations/hc92o3d/", "text": "You should be able to do this with two PowerPoint features - the \u201cslide master\u201d and adding header and footers to each slide.
