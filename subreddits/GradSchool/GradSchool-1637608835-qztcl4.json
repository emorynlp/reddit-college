  "title:": "Advice about Writing Sample",
  "text": "Applying to a program in the computational sciences, and don't really have something obvious like a thesis or solo paper to submit, so I wanted to ask for some advice.\n\nRight now the two clear options I have in my mind are:\n\nA) Excerpting the portions that I wrote from two preprints for which I am the second author. I'm not totally sure about this because it feels like there won't be a lot of content and its probably going to be pretty disjointed.\n\nB) Submitting a course project that I worked on with somebody else, but where the write-up was done by me exclusively. Is it a bad idea if I got permission from the person I worked with to submit as my own writing?\n\nReally confused about this, so would definitely appreciate any advice!",
