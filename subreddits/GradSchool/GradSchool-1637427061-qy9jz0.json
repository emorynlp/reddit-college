They like to collect data about how they compare to their peer institutions.\n\nThat being said, if you're only applying to one institution, then I would probably state that there. If it was a choice between two candidates who were otherwise equivalent, and they felt like one of them was more likely to take the offer over the other, it might influence their choice.\n\nBut I wouldn't overthink it beyond that.  If you're applying to multiple institutions, provide the information if you want to.",

There are certainly theoretical reasons that it could hurt an applicant, but there are also real stories of how this helped people get better outcomes, such as more competitive funding packages. More likely, it depends on what exactly the array of programs is.",
