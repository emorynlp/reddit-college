  "text": "I got used to my undergrad where I had classes from 9 AM To 3 PM and that was it.\n\nI had a few lab deadlines that involved just taking time to write neatly.\n\nWe never had to do pre-class reading and everything was easy shit.\n\nSuddenly I have like 3 classes a week total\n\n\nI need to read before each class. Once I am done, I need to solve my doubts online or with professors and then read and take my notes my way so I can study them later with ease.\n\nPlus actual homework that takes effort.\n\nI'm just not sure how to do it and it's a burden on me.\n\nI don't know what is expected of me and how much I need to do.\n\nI have no basis to compare stuff to.\n\n\nExecutive dysfunction is hitting hard.",

      "text": "First, take a deep breath. Take it step by step, one day at a time. Open up google cal and put in all the classes and meetings you need to go to and the big deadlines for the semester. Then make a list of what you need to do this week. Schedule a time to do it. Pick one thing to get the ball rolling. You'll figure out what the expectations are for your program (how intensely to read the papers, etc) as you go.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a big adjustment.  The trick is to schedule your time and focus during work time.  Reading before class helps you understand the lecture more thoroughly and participate in discussion. Write down your questions and ask them in class.  Give yourself plenty of time for the homework.  Shoot to put in 40 hrs of high focus time each week to start and go from there.  I use the pomodoro technique where i work without interruption for 30min and then take a five minute break.  It helps me tons with minimizing fatigue.  I like BeFocusedPro to track my pomodoros and my time.  Hang in there, you will get there.  And don\u2019t forget to schedule time for self care.",
