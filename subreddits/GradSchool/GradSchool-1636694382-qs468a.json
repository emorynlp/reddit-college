      "text": "I'd imagine your department is quite large, right?\n\n At my university (and especially department), the 2nd year grad students quickly got to know the upper-level students and even us first-years. It probably helps that the dept puts together many social-type events for us to get to know each other. \n\nIf these are ppl with similar interests and what not, I've not seen a single grad department (in Earth System Sciences) where people don't at least entertain the idea of talking to other students in an attempt to make friends. Even though it may feel too late, it probably isn't. Maybe your school has a grad student association or something to attend events through?",
