We were still on winter break at the time (I\u2019m from Canada). He was literally my BEST friend and #1 confidant. I was a daddy\u2019s girl my whole life (I\u2019m only 23) so it\u2019s been pretty hard. I was initially still in shock at the time of his death because I had to take care of my mother and her fight with the virus for a couple weeks after (she is over the virus now \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc). Since then, dad\u2019s death really sunk in and I miss him TERRIBLY. School started on January 18th and I told my professors that I wouldn\u2019t be attending the first week of classes. For the most part, my professors were very understanding and accommodating. It is now the second week, and I have been attending but I haven\u2019t been doing the readings for class. I have no motivation to do them right now. I\u2019m usually a motivated/studious person and I did really well in my first semester. Now I feel so much guilt, because I don\u2019t feel too motivated now. Perhaps it\u2019s because I am still grieving. I just feel so lost without him because he was my biggest cheerleader &amp; always encouraged me to attend to my studies. I feel like I\u2019m just holding onto surviving for the sake of my mom (who I am close with, but not as close as I was with my father). The thing is though, a leave of absence is not an option because it would mean that I wouldn\u2019t be able to take classes until they are available again next year. \n\nWhile he was in his death bed, I virtually promised him that I would finish my master\u2019s. I really want to. But as of right now, I only have motivation to attend class. Not sure what I should do to get all of my motivation back. Should I attend grief counselling? Has anyone been in this position? \n\nThank you so much\n\nSide-note: I love you all so much. Loving all of these posts right now, I am in awe. I\u2019m sending Internet hugs to you all, especially those who are also facing their own situations with grief. Praying for you. All of your messages have given me so much reassurance that my feelings are very real and valid. My Asian mother had been pushing me to continue (it is in her belief that you just need to move on and deal with it), so YOU ARE ALL HELPING ME SO MUCH AIN REALIZING THAT GRIEF IS A REAL PROCESS THAT TAKES TIME.

It sounds like your big barrier here is emotional though - your dad would absolutely not have wanted you to stress about this! Taking some time off is not the same as not finishing. And circumstances change - he would not be disappointed if you decided this masters isn\u2019t for you.

I lost my dad on January 6th 2020 to cancer, one semester into my PhD. No advice can really tell you how to cope with that kind of loss, especially during such a stress-filled and trying period in your life. \n\nI ended up (on the advice of a professor) taking a semester off. It was an unofficial mental health leave during which I still TAed but took no classes. During that time I felt like I had essentially given up, or at least proven that I didn't have what it takes to stick through my degree. \n\nNow I realize that if I HAD tried to push through I WOULD have given up. 9 months later I got back into school full time. I'm not a perfect student (and a pandemic doesn't help), but I love what I'm doing. I'm not 'over' losing my dad. I don't think I ever will be. But I'm in a better place now after being able to grieve without the stress of grad school over my head. \n\nI don't know you or your program, but I know that grad school is about being able to immerse yourself in your work and having the freedom to chase down every lead in the literature to answer your questions. Honestly ask yourself if you will be able to do that this semester, even with a few weeks off. Grief is not something that you can schedule like a vacation. It is going to come in waves, and sometimes you are going to feel like you are drowning in it, a minute after you felt like you just learned how to swim. I think a future you (a successful academic, I'm sure) will be grateful that you took time off to deal with your loss, rather than struggling against the current just because you want to hit a dead line. \n\nI realize that I was in a privileged position of being able to live off of my funding and savings for a few months without taking classes. I hope you are in a position to be able to do the same. \n\nLastly, I am so so sorry that you lost your father. It is the worst thing I have ever felt. The feeling of loss, the absence of that steady guiding hand, that honest advice-giver, and that dedicated hugger, is really indescribable.

My heart goes out to you and your family. I really don't have the right words to say, all I can do is share my experience with you if you'd like to read it. \n\nLast year, 2020, I graduated from my undergrad program in May. Two months before that (March), my father died, his heart stopped but it was mostly related to his kidney failure. It was a very tragic experience to go through as I was 26 years old with only 2 months to go to graduate with my BA. \n\nOn top of that, the covid restrictions had taken place literally the day after. My sister (24) is the one who finds it more challenging at the moment. Myself, it sucked, cried my heart out, sleep, eat, didnt eat, insomnia, thoughts, dreams. I accepted the fact that he gone and that it is part of life, even though I drive up to the cemetery and cry at random. \n\nI miss him so much that at times I dream of him and hug him, only to wake up in tears hugging a pillow. What I miss the most is his voice. But those cries help me clear my mind. I allow myself to have a good cry, I allow myself to feel as a man with a hispanic culture, where it is typically looked down upon for men to show feelings. \n\nYou say you are thinking of counseling, so whenever you are ready to talk to someone besides your family or friends, go ahead and make that phone call to make an appointment with a professional. There are also hotlines you can call (**1.833.456.4566)**  or [Canadian Crisis Services](https://www.crisisservicescanada.ca/en/) is a website you can look at in case you are in crisis and need to talk to someone.\n\nRemember, school will always be there. If you decide to take a break from school, that is absolutely okay. If you want to push through this semester, that is completely okay as well.

I started with a grief counselor who ended up referring me to a psychologist and from there a trauma specialist (I ended up being diagnosed with CPTSD and my father\u2019s death triggered a lot of suppressed emotions). Also be open with your professors.

I\u2019d say therapy would definitely be helpful. I was in therapy for about a year after my mother past away and don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve been able to process it in a healthy way without that outlet. Ultimately you know whether you have it in you to continue the semester or not, either way is okay. If you need to take a break that\u2019s not giving up, you Can take a leave and come back to the program when you feel like you have the headspace for it, or if you feel you can continue but may just need supports, talk to your advisor or head of the program.

One of my closest friends in grad school lost his dad suddenly as well, and he did therapy and found it valuable; he said it was more focused on developing coping skills and setting up a support network, since he wasnt ready to talk about the grief yet. He took a semester off after that and the academic counselor allowed the schedule of courses to change in his circumstance- he still did the capstone but attended a research seminar the following semester when originally it was a prerequisite to capstone.

More than a decade ago I was accepted into two graduate programs and was in the process of picking one and enrolling. My parents were part of the conversation and I had about a month to decide.

I barely slept back then and it was also my first time being away from home and on my own.\n\nTo say that it was hard is a big understatement. I survived but it definitely took everything I had. My mental health suffered and I made many mistakes and acted in ways I wouldn't have otherwise. But I've learned that grief changes you in many ways no matter where you are and so in hindsight I'm glad I didn't take any breaks.\n\nI was sort of on academic probation at the beginning so that gave me something to work on. Also, I was lucky to be part of a small cohort of students and we were very close.  I can see how in current times you may not have the same luck. I think seeking counseling is a good idea.
