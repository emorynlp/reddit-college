  "text": "I'm a young grad student (22) and I teach an intro level course of primarily freshman. My students are pretty comfortable with me and some of my more vocal ones tend to chat with me before/after class about random things. Today I saw that one of them found my insta and requested to follow me. I personally don't care about it too much because we're so close in age that if they weren't my students we could easily be friends. Is this wrong though? Should I be concerned? I'm not really sure how to handle this situation",

      "text": "As long as your instagram is professional and you do not engage socially with your student, I don't think it's a *major* problem although I personally would not accept their request until after I was no longer responsible for grading them. \n\nYour closeness in age is extremely irrelevant. There may not be much of an age gap, but there's a wide power gap, and that is way more important. If you were 60 and your student was also 60, it still wouldn't be the best idea for you to accept their friend request on social media until after you are no longer in a position of power over them. \n\nI follow some professors on Twitter (from other universities) and evidently they have some students following them on social media so it's not a huge red flag like giving your personal cell number to a student. However, I still think it can create a sense of undue familiarity and make it more difficult to establish a professional boundary as an authority figure if students know too much about your personal life. They can be friendly after the semester is over.",

Despite being closer in age, you have a professional relationship with them and presumably your social media profile would be a glimpse into your personal life. \n\nAs a rule of thumb, I only add/accept requests from students on LinkedIn/Twitter. On any other platform, I don\u2019t. \n\nShould you be concerned? I don\u2019t think so. At least not at this point",

      "text": "Tricky one. I'm an early grad student and follow a whoever pops up in my suggested follows. One professor did not let me follow him and I think even blocked me (because when I saw his profile again I couldn't even request to follow \ud83d\ude05), and a different prof follows me and replies to my stories (not in a creepy way, this guy is chill). I respect and appreciate both approaches. But I'm a pretty reasonable person haha, can't speak for how other people would be. \n\nI don't teach so haven't experienced the other side of this but I think a lot of the PhD students follow undergrads and vice versa, especially the students who are more involved/volunteer etc.",

      "text": "So I am friends on social media with three students in the class I'm TAing. However, they were students who worked with me in the field all summer and we followed each other before I was assigned to TA this course. I'm not even that close in age to them (just about to turn 30 and they are all between 20 and 21). \n\nHow I am handling this is by essentially being extra careful that I don't post anything referencing the class or grading exams etc. And otherwise, well we lived in a house together for a month so they already know more about me from that then they would ever find out from my social media. I would not have friended them until after the class ended if requests came during the semester. And in that case only if I had gotten to know them very well during the class, not just them being some student who I never talked to.",

      "text": "If you were allow some students to follow, those who do not or you decline could accuse you of showing preference and blame you if the students accepted got better grades, and possibly try to use it against you.\n\nI know this is not the same situation, but an extreme to show a point - I needed references to get into an internship program that was very competitive. Some of my classmates were having affairs with my professors. I had no intention of sleeping my way to a good reference and was angry thinking they had an unfair advantage over me, especially when one of them got the spot I wanted the most.",

      "text": "Well there are certain issues with this. I have teens following me on insta but they're all family or family friends. Unfortunately because of them though, I can only post certain content in my stories which I can hide from certain followers. My IG posts have to be more neutral than I'd like them to be. I can create a Finsta, but that requires too much work/energy. It's certainly something to think about: you will need to censor some of your posts for your audience, possibly on a regular basis. Can you commit to that?\n\n\nI regret following some of my coworkers who are the same age as me on insta because now we know each other on a more personal level than I feel comfortable with. That's another thing to think about as well.",

      "text": "When I began teaching, I encountered the same issue, albeit without the closeness in age (I look younger than I am). After a few students requested to follow, I had to think about what would or could result from giving them access to a different side of me, & if I were to follow them, I too would be able to access a different side of them. After thinking about it, I decided that wouldn\u2019t create positive vibes. After that, I brought up the topic in each of my classes (& did so again for about two semesters after) & discussed the issues that could arise. I just asked them to ignore that I might exist on social media sites they used, & noted I would do the same for them. It became a moot point after a few semesters, as I stopped using social media. It might be awkward to decline their request, but unless you are comfortable sharing all of you with your students, it might be a preferable awkwardness to deal with now than the potential frustrations that might arise in the future.",

What I\u2019m saying is how you portray yourself on social media could have a good or bad effect on how your students (or people in general) view you",
