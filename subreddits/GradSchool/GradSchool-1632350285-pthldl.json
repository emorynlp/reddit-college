Please Help.", "text": "I am an anthropologist and I got my master's in 2017. I knew I wanted to get my Ph.D. and work in academics but wanted to take time away from academics after my master's. Now that it has been 5 years since I was at university I feel like it's a glaring weak point in applying for Ph.D.\n\nIv started planning and research for my proposal. I have applied to lecturer/adjunct positions at my local university and community College but again time away has hindered my prospects.\n\nSo any help brainstorming other things I can do to add more recent academic experience to my CV and/or otherwise improve my prospects when submitting my application and proposal would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWould making my own blog to document the research I do in developing my proposal be worthwhile?\n\nFor anyone who does or has been involved in accepting Ph.D. applications what are the factors most valued for a successful application besides the quality of the proposal itself?\n\nAre letters of recommendation the next most important or relevant experience on my CV, etc?\n\nI am also posting this in r/GradSchool, r/AskAcademia, r/PhD, r/academia, r/AskProfessors, r/GradSchoolAdvice, r/gradschooladmissions", "author": "Pynetr33", "created": 1632350285, "retrieved": 1632952120, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
