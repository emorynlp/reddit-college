  "text": "Hi, TYIA. \nAs the title suggests I'm looking for a tablet recommendation. \nI don't like Apple products.\n I'm looking for something inexpensive (hello tuition) but good enough for reading e-text books & note taking apps. I have a computer for actual typing but want something small and durable transportation.",

      "text": "The Surface line of products from Microsoft may work well for you; I have a beefier Surface Book 2 so has all the keyboard and everything, but they also have more tablet-only versions. The Surface Go 3 looks decent. What I love is they run full Windows, not just a mobile OS, so you shouldn't have any issues with software restrictions. Also you can hand-write your notes on the screen if you prefer that way. (Great if you're in chemistry and need to draw mechanisms or structures!)",

              "text": "Totally valid to not be an apple fan - I'm not either and if you don't go for apple, totally cool. But I gotta say - I got an iPad and apple pencil a few years ago for organic Chem and it was... Life changing? I take notes (hand written and typed) via one note and used Papers by ReadCube as my citation manager because you can download pdfs and annotate them right in Papers. This is likely a feature in other citation managers.\n\nPresumably other tablets could do that just as well but I see more iPad support than android tablet support, at least mentioned, and I'm not sure where the windows surface line lands between tablet (with apps) and little touch screen computer. Best Buy employees aren't on commission and I've had good experiences getting recs from them, if that's at all of interest.\n\nLots of good options out there!",
