Tell yourself you're going to work on a small part of it for 20 minutes, then take a 5-10 minute break. At the end of your break, decide whether or not you're going to do another 20 minutes, and repeat. I have been so much more productive with this over the last few days, just because it's much less daunting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to do awesome :) I believe in you!!!",

You know more about your own work than others and your only goal would be to present it in an understandable way to experts and your fellow colleagues who are potentially new to the subject!\n\nWhat I learned is to not make the presentation more complicated or formal than it needs to be. Spicing it up to sound more complex or academic just results in more stress and there is a good chance that the audience won't even follow the presentation anyways.\n\nyou got this! ;)",
