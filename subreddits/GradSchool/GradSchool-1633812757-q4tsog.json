  "text": "I graduated from undergrad a few months ago and decided to get a job at a gas station while waiting and studying for the GRE to apply to grad schools for next fall. I\u2019ve done research, published papers, had a 3.1 GPA with my biochem degree when I graduated and yet\u2026. it all still feels like I don\u2019t deserve it. Does the imposter syndrome linger even during and after grad school? How do other people handle it?",

Had a historian with an international reputation tell me that I am \"a damn good historian.\" I cried. \n\nThe greatest problem we all face--in terms of imposter syndrome--is none of us really know just how good we truly are at our particular fields and sub-fields. It would be great if every graduate student could have this small experience that I did.",
