I busted my ass and barely slept and found out today (after the slides were all fixed and stained) that two of the mice were pregnant in the experiment.  What does that mean?  Well, we don't know because pregnancy is a majorly confounding variable that we were never accounting for or anticipating.  So we (meaning me) have to the scrap the whole experiment and start over.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we can kill each other if you want.  Quick and painless, same time.",

Each picture under goes a rather intense treatment with binarization, thresholding, and then shape extraction, conversion to elliptical Fourier descriptors and so on.\n\nThe problem was that lighting was uneven and for many samples the automated script didn't work out good. After testing the waters with specific automated macros, testing back and forth for a week, and finally manually correcting a lot of pictures, we discovered that an error came from the initial script.\n\nFixed it, generated a whole new set of shapes, only to find out they came with a new array of problems.\n\nBottom line: spent the last 7 days manually checking and correcting the pictures in Photoshop. Every. Single. Picture. No matter how good the playlist, you'll find your brain snapping at least once ...",
