There was no micromanaging which was great, but faculty were more than willing to help you whenever you needed it. There was also no hounding committee members to review your paper.

My advisor strongly recommended I work Monday to Friday from 9-5 and that's it. She also recommended I take about 3 weeks of vacation per year. This is what most grad students did from my experiences (the ones that worked in a lab had a bit longer schedules, but most of us didn't work in a lab). \n\nThere were also great opportunities to present at national and international conferences.
