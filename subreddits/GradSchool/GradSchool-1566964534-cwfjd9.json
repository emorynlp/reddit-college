I got a grand total of 1 (one) extension in undergrad for an assignment, which I didn't even end up using. I keep up with treatment, I do my work, I don't complain. During the first year of my PhD I had to take a week off for treatment, and when I came back, my supervisor called me incompetent and a burden, saying I needed to learn to deal with it on my own, that everyone has challenges (suggesting I was asking for special treatment), and that I shouldn't ask for advice or time off again. \n\nNow it turns out I have a (non-cancerous) brain tumour, and have had it since before my diagnosis. My supervisor has completely changed his tune, telling me to take as much time off as I need. He asks me every meeting how I'm feeling, and says I can work to whatever schedule works best for me. \n\nI'm a bit tired and have headaches and have to wear glasses, but I don't really notice it much otherwise. There's every chance that my \"schizophrenia\" is actually caused by the tumour, and that once it shrinks, my symptoms will disappear. Ironically, being diagnosed with a brain tumour may end up being one of the best things to happen in my life so far. My life may get *easier* after this. \n\nI go to therapy every week and take expensive medication every day to treat my mental illness. I've had a single round of radiation therapy to treat the tumour. Yet he treats schizophrenia like an annoyingly bad character trait that I'm too lazy to overcome and a tumour like some glorious personal battle that I'm bravely fighting.\n\nI always knew that mental illness and physical illness aren't treated the same, but watching my supervisor do that massive backflip is disgusting.", "author": "NoxiousQuadrumvirate", "created": 1566964534, "retrieved": 1632845785, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 437, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"eyf84xo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/cwfjd9/the_way_we_treat_mental_versus_physical_illness/eyf84xo/", "text": "Sounds more like a shitty advisor to me.
