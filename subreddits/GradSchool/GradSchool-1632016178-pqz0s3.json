I\u2019m now looking at MFA programs, but I\u2019m hung up on one thing - letters of recommendation!\n\nMy conservatory program had us working with 4 professors very closely, and it was amazing. Those professors put so much into our tiny cohort, they basically lived with us for 3 years. But, shortly after graduating, my main professor passed away from cancer, and a few years later, another passed. The third died from covid a few months ago, leaving me with one professor I\u2019m still close to who is willing to write me a letter. But it says I need 3.\n\nThere were some peripheral teachers that we worked with, but it was almost wholly those 4, and now I\u2019m stumped as to what to do. \n\nDo professional contacts work for these? I have done art as a contractor for my current boss, so that is one I could potentially have, but I am not sure where that would go as their actual field is unrelated to my MFA application. Also, it would be in.... not the best English, as that is not their first language, and I\u2019m afraid that that would reflect poorly on me, even with the caveat that they are not native speakers. \n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for your time.", "author": "chicken-nanban", "created": 1632016178, "retrieved": 1632844148, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdm2sxm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqz0s3/not_able_to_get_letters_of_recommendation_due_to/hdm2sxm/", "text": "I used professional contacts for my references (MFA theater design) since I graduated a really long time ago.

The contacts could speak to my reliability, adaptability, creativity, communication skills, etc. which I assume is what people reading them want to hear about regardless of the specific program.
