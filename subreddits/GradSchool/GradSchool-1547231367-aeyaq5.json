Many people gave me so much shit for turning down a postdoc position for a \"low-level\" graduate role but to me it was a no brainer: I get paid 100k for 8-4pm permanent job which could go up to 120k with bonuses, versus 80k for 24x7 work on a temporary 3 year contract. My new boss even asked me this week if I was free in September to attend a conference in Europe, without any BS like having to apply for grants or beg for money. I couldn't care less about seniority, I swear I've been shown more respect this past week than in Academia during the last 5 years!",

          "text": "For me, I treated my research as if it were a project in industry, though this may has been easier for my dissertation as it was developing and analyzing a medical device.\nA few questions I was asked that could be tricky to navigate as a grad student were about things like leading a team of researchers.  In my case, I talked about a multidisciplinary paper that I was primary author on and making sure that the other authors were on task to get their portions over to me for analysis.  \n\nOther questions I ran into were more based on the hard skills I had learned over the course of my research, with a lot of it focusing on analytical skills and software packages I had used.  \n\nOne final tip, is that you shouldn't pigeonhole yourself into trying to find something directly related to your research.  There are tons of jobs out there that look for the quantitative or analytical skills that you pick up as a PhD.  You just have to spin your research and tailor your resume to match what the job description is looking for.",
