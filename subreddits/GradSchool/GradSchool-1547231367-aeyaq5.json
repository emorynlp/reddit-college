I just finished my first week as graduate data scientist, after completing my PhD a few months ago. Many people gave me so much shit for turning down a postdoc position for a \"low-level\" graduate role but to me it was a no brainer: I get paid 100k for 8-4pm permanent job which could go up to 120k with bonuses, versus 80k for 24x7 work on a temporary 3 year contract. My new boss even asked me this week if I was free in September to attend a conference in Europe, without any BS like having to apply for grants or beg for money. I couldn't care less about seniority, I swear I've been shown more respect this past week than in Academia during the last 5 years!", "author": "CaptCookieMonster", "created": 1547275712, "upvotes": 10}, "edv8spi": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/aeyaq5/just_got_an_industry_job/edv8spi/", "text": "Many congrats!!
