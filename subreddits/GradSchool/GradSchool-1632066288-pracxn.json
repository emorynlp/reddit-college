My life is miserable.  The environment is toxic.   Teachers say \"You might think you are studying too much but you are never doing nearly enough\".   The only way I could do more is stay up 24/7.  \"Lives are in your hands and if you don't study more you will kill people\".   This program is fucking cruel.   We have to learn every medical condition and medication in ONE FUCKING YEAR.   Maybe that worked 40 years ago when the profession was formulated but it makes no fucking sense now that there are so many more meds and so much more known pathophysiology and is absolutely inhumane.\n\nI have lost 20 lbs since I joined (already on the skinny side), I was broken up with due to my fucking stress,  I am on multiple meds and see a therapist and all that jazz but nothing helps.

I make A's and B's but I feel like I've just been pushed through without learning how to actually do any research. I'm in my semester before capstone and I've only written one research paper this entire time. I'm currently trying to write one now and have no clue what I'm doing. Most of my classes for this masters are hybrids with undergrads and the department is so small that I might have one or two options for a class if I'm lucky. No TA spots either. \n\nI'm just venting at this point but I feel like I've learned nothing and I'm just a ball of stress, anxiety, fast food, and sadness. I want to transfer but I have one more semester till I'll be done so there's no point. I hate it. I feel like if I quit I'll let everyone down including myself.

I keep going because I can\u2019t do and be who I want to be with out it. And in my program C\u2019s get degrees. I actually went to grad school later than I wanted because I was constantly looking for someone to affirm my decision or at least treat me with respect and never got it.

I\u2019m not sure if you suffer from depression but one thing my therapist told me was depression is anger turned inwards.
