  "text": "I've (26)  been out of school since I finished my MA in political science in August 2019. I've suffered major issues with depression and anhedonia since then. I've been unemployed for basically the last 2 years. I really want to go back to school for something practical (and preferably in a different area of the province or a new province entirely) but I can't seem to get a part time job I even sort of want. I'm stuck working part time jobs no one wants or that the bosses suck. \n\nI'm so tired of this! I can't even get hired as a bank teller or barista regardless of whether I take my MA off my resume or not. Hell, I can't even get hired as a bus boy. I can only seem to get job offers for extremely boring temp, data entry jobs which I've tried and I'm really not suited for\n\nAlso, I can't get even sort of hired for any government jobs. ATM. Like, my MA was the worst thing to ever happen to me.\n\nI'm seeing a therapist and taking anti-depressants but while I was initially looking forward to getting a job to save up to go back to school a few months ago, I'm just done now.\n\nShould I just give up and enlist in the military? I don't really want to but I'm sick of living at home and never being able to get any job I even sort of want. It's either that or I think I'm going to say goodbye to my therapist and kill myself. I'm just fucking done. I can't even get a date and I have few friends. Life has not been worth it for me, also the abusive childhood sucked.\n\nSorry for the rant, I'm just at the end of my rope.",

I have my SmartServe (alcohol serving licence) but that doesn't help much. I worked in retail\n\nFWIW, I have 2 years experience working as a cashier but that doesn't help much.\n\nI think a lot of it is that  I have a 2 year gap because of depression (worked a temp job for a month and a bit and then quit so at least I have relevant experience).\n\nI think some employers don't like hearing that I'm planning to save up to go back to school.\n\nI've talked to my university career office before and they really helped with my resume but while I'll try talking to them again, most of the time they tell me to network which I can't because I really don't have many if any connections.\n\nAlso, tbh I think part of it is that unless you have relevant experience, most employers just don't give two fucks about you here if you're above your early 20s.\n\nTBH I'd really like to work something a least sort of using my degree but hell I don't think that'll happen unless I try data entry again. I just want a part time job that doesn't suck but it's so damn hard.\n\nI think selling my soul to the army is somehow a good idea but even in Canada it's hard to get in due to weird requirements about eye sight (mine's good now but still) and just a lot of stupid bureaucratic hurdles.\n\nSorry for the long reply. Thank you for the kind response.\n\nedit: sometimes I can speak to a manager but although it usually goes over relatively well I never hear back.",

My friend had to spell out to me that saying I had grad school plans was probably the biggest reason. Why would they hire someone who is telling you right out of the gate they plan on leaving (no matter the turnover rate of shitty entry level jobs \ud83d\ude44)?\n\nJust don't tell them. It's really not their business and you don't owe them that info. People leave jobs without much notice for much smaller reasons; the company will survive. And if it's just a retail job or something to make ends meet that's not in your field of interest, maintaining that bridge after leaving can be a lower priority.",

Couldn't accept bc I was no longer in the area though lmao.\n\nI was also accepted to multiple positions in my parent's area without mentioning grad school, and worked for a survey research firm for several months (entry level position) before starting my current master's program. The experience was relevant and helped my grad application I think.\n\nSo I can't say for sure with all the other factors but I certainly feel like it did. I went from 0 acceptances to multiple acceptances and an acceptance in my career path within like 2 months of moving.\n\nEmployers want to get the impression that you're not flighty, and won't drop the ball on them. Grad school plans probably sound like dropping the ball on them, so I don't see the harm in not mentioning them. Best of luck though, I hope things turn around for you!",

It could be something else about your application or cover letters that you haven't thought of yet!\n\nOff topic but I'm honestly debating getting a CDL after this degree and becoming a professional truck driver... There's a severe shortage of qualified drivers and if you can be a union company driver, you can make very decent money. Talked to a lot of drivers for my research atm and some of them really have it down to a science how to maximize their freedom on the road; seeing the sights, staying healthy, and enjoying the drives. It honestly sounds appealing at this point. Figured I'd throw it out there as a possibility too \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

                  "text": "I plan to apply to government jobs like the type you mentioned. The thing with Canada is that government jobs pay pretty well (better than other middle class jobs sometimes) and are highly desired and as a result, they're really hard to get especially if you didn't work a summer job or do a coop with the government. Will definitely apply to all 3 levels though. It's just that I don't think I can rely on it as a short term job to save up for school.\n\nFunnily enough one of the things I plan  to go back to school is for a master of public policy (with coop of course) as that tends to be a really good route to get into a policy level civil service job.\n\nAlso, I think you make a really good point about going the officer route, if I went that route I'd definitely think I'd try to be a military police officer or maybe some sort of administrative or civilian equivalent route. FWIW, I'm probably going to try joining the reserves (Canadian version of National Guard) and try being an officer there first just to see if I actually can handle basic and some of the military lifestyle without singing the 3-5 year contract.\n\nAlso, I do plan on applying to the RCMP (federal police), provincial police and local police forces but like civil service jobs, it's very hard to become a police officer in Canada because like the civil service it pays extremely well and has excellent benefits and job security. Having an advanced degree doesn't help me that much.\n\nLastly, thanks for the CSIS rec but it's not something I'm that interested in and tbh they have something of a reputation for being incompetent and racist. \n\nBTW do you have any suggestions for short term jobs that don't suck? RN I could use the money and spend some time getting out of the house but tbh I don't think I can do much rn.",

After finishing their masters, they also still couldn't find a job. They had a stack of dozens of rejection letters. They had worked in lumber mills as a teenager, so they figured they'd go do that again to try to make ends meet. They couldn't get a job in a sawmill though.

I never give employers more info about my life than I have to--especially future plans. And like, I assume you're gonna be working for longer than just a summer job, so whats it to them if you decide to go back to school in a year or so--I don't think that reflects badly on you and I doubt they would give you a bad reference if you gave them to two weeks notice as required. \n\nI just ask because I've been in the same boat. When I was applying to uni for my undergrad, when i told them I'd be going to uni in the fall, it was harder to get a job so i stopped and literally any time they mentioned future plans I'd just say that I'm still working on future plans, something like that and I got a lot more callbacks that way.\n\nAlso the military is probably the most soul sucking job you can do. They melt away your individuality and you truly feel like you're just another replaceable number in the machine--I have never felt more depressed than when I had to experience that (I was only in air cadets for a short time but it was absolute hell for my mental health to feel so worthless).",

Like for me it's the idea that you have to work for the rest of your life and there's no choice--you have to participate in exploitative work and if you don't you starve. People of our generation seem to be becoming aware of how bleak it is and so there's this mass epidemic of depression and loneliness and anxiety and it's not even something that therapy can really help you with cuz it's a problem that's created by the very essence of our society--how do you reconcile with that even? I think something that helped me was to find others who understood why existence felt like a burden under capitalism-- r/Anarchy101 kind of helped me feel a little less helpless/hopeless since they're pretty open and understanding.\n\nAs for what I do, I'm one of the undergrad lurkers (mostly) on here (I'm in my final semester of my undergrad though). I think when I'm done I'm gonna be living at my parents for at least a year or so while I try to gather myself to do grad school.

Actually my boss is a girl I went to high school with and that's awkward all the time. Grad school left me feeling less efficacious and like a normal person than I have ever felt. I also have basically no friends. I was gonna get counseling, but I couldn't figure out how to do it without my mom find out and blaming herself or some shit, plus my inflammatory bowel disease has flared up for the first time since 2005 and I probably can't afford therapy on top of that.\n\nThis really sucks. I see you. But we're in this together, I guess?",

              "text": "In undergrad I had panic attacks and weird ruminations/intrusive thoughts about stepping in front of busses and other ways of ending my troubles. I used to wonder what my funeral would look like and who would come. Who would be sad. It was a whole deal. I never took medication for it because I was afraid, but I went to counseling for it. Eventually it lessened, and now it's sort of like a stress barometer. When i get overwhelmed and it pops in my head, \"you should kill yourself,\" it kind of lets me know how I'm doing.\n\nMy degree is in communication, and I read a modest bit of philosophy and psychology while I was trying to \"fix\" myself or my head. You'd think I'd be capable of some artful entreaty not to end it all, but it would seem disingenuous, I think. All I can offer of my personal experience is that, in the moment, my problems always seem larger than they really are. When I'm on the other side of them, I feel a little silly. I know it doesn't help at all when people say, \"it gets better, trust me,\" because it feels like they don't get how bad things are. I get that shit sucks, though, and I guess what I really am trying to say is we've come this far, we've endured this shit for this long, wd can keep going. As much as it seems like nothing will change, it's possible.\n\nLook up A Liberated Mind by Stephen Hayes. That has helped me a lot with anxiety/depression stuff. I dunno. I don't know you, but I really hope that isn't your choice.",

      "text": "Hey, I had a similar experience as you (MA, live in Canada), struggled to find a good job for a while, eventually found a job in customer service and then moved up through the ranks in various departments.\n\nHere's my 2c of advice:\n\n* Try to contact employment centres. They may be able to find leads for you and/or help you with your resume.\n* Imposter syndrome... learn how to recognize it and learn strategies to fight it. Imposter syndrome that isn't addressed will make you come off worse in interviews.\n* If you're not sure what types of jobs are out there that you could get, go on LinkedIn and search for people with similar academic backgrounds as you, and see where they ended up. See what additional qualifications they needed to get to get the job(s) that they are in now and what kinda paths they needed to take after being in academia. You could also consider messaging them on LinkedIn to see if they'd be up for an online coffee chat where you could learn more about their career paths. Then...\n* (once you decided on your direction) Do online certifications or take additional courses in field(s) that you want. For example, LinkedIn Learning or Google or Coursera have a lot of courses that you can take on Customer Service, digital marketing, IT, etc. Then put these courses on your resume. This shows employers that you're committed to moving towards that particular field.\n* Look up common interview questions and prepare answers to them. This will help build confidence about how you position your skills to employers. Prepare a 30s \"elevator pitch\" about what makes you stand out and why companies should hire you. This will help you build confidence and also be succinct about what your \"unique selling proposition\" is.\n* Just keep applying. Don't give up. Perserverence will pay off in the end. Sometimes getting a job is about being lucky and being at the right place at the right time, and playing the statistics. Sometimes companies are desperate to find someone for certain roles. If you keep applying you'll eventually stumble upon such positions and maximize the probability of luck going your way.",
