It\u2019s just not a good use of your time. Either get a job postgrad and reapply or accept a PhD app. I applied to 12 universities which was way too much. I got accepted to 4 PhD programs. I took the second \u201cbest\u201d school I got into because it was a good balance of lifestyle and prestige. I already feel like a PhD can be a bit of a drag sometimes and I\u2019ve really enjoyed my internships. My least favorite part of my PhD so far has been classes\u2026 \n\nWeird that the default seems to be if you don\u2019t get into a PhD (which you\u2019re paid to do) is often times to do a masters (which you have to pay even more than you\u2019d be making as a PhD in tuition), when the more pragmatic alternative would just be to apply for jobs and reapply. If anything, a PhD student with industry experience is rid of the anxiety that they \u201cmay have liked industry more\u201d which is a huge plus to an advisor since an anxious doubtful student is an unproductive one.", "author": "gentleboys", "created": 1631881909, "upvotes": 2}, "hd6fxei": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ppls2q/do_phd_rejected_applications_at_a_university_gets/hd6fxei/", "text": "This is something you would have to consult on a department to department basis.
