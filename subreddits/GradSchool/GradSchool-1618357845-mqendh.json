I used to be the \u201cyes\u201d woman who would take on extra activities/work or perform favors for little, if any, compensation. I would over-extend myself to be there for family, friends, and classmates even when I was drowning in neglected depression, anxiety, and numbness. I just couldn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d because I was worried if I did, I would be seen as unreliable, lacking leadership, or not competitive. \n\n But I\u2019ve chosen myself. Radical self-care is asking for extensions on my papers when I need them and taking breaks because I deserve it. It\u2019s not feeling inadequate when I\u2019m not achieving, but placing more importance on how much water I drink or whether my personal finances are on track. It\u2019s making sure I stretch my legs after attending hours of lecture and taking a brief walk outdoors. It\u2019s giving myself grace and allowing myself room to fail. It\u2019s prioritizing and compartmentalizing my goals so my thoughts don\u2019t run wild with fear. But most importantly, it\u2019s saying \u201cno\u201d to those who expect my yes. \n\nSo if you\u2019ve reached your limit, this is your sign. Just tell them no.

To employees, and by extension to students, these traits are detrimental. In every circumstance cooperation and consensus are far better.\n\nThis whole thing, grad school, academia, research, it's about you, me, it's about the dreams and curiosities of people like us. Not about ticking boxes or accumulating numbers or satisfying reviewers, grant agencies, advisors, or universities. We risk a lot and forego a lot for what? Personally, my answer is, I want to do honest research, teach honest science, go where my curiosity takes me, and collaborate with curious people like me. People's expectations have no place in that answer, nor toxic totems of 21st century, like competition, hustle, or the commodification of one's own personality and life.\n\nIn that regard saying \"no\" is actually the least you can do for yourself. It's great to be helpful, caring, and cooperative, but the line between those and being exploited and abused is _very_ thin. People will be, often unintentionally, pulling you over to the wrong side of its. It is fundamental to one's wellbeing to resist.\n\nThis whole thing might sound a bit selfish, but it's actually the opposite. If you feel better, if you _are_ better, happy, and not overworked, you can be more helpful and charitable to everyone around you.\n\nSo congrats on caring for and prioritising your self!
