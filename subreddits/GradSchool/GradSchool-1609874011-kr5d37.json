For the second case my (not so comprehensive) advice would be:\n\nDon't put all your proverbial eggs in one basket is what I think did the trick for me. It's easy to get lost in the detail when it comes to open-ended research. It should be natural to feel awful and feel like you're not being productive enough when this is the case. But then getting stuck in a downward spiral of more \"pointless\" work and consequently feeling more awful should, ideally to a large extent,  be avoidable misery. But you might just never know it was kinda \"pointless\" to keep pushing a dead end if you don't step back, zoom out, do something else and then come back afresh. Keeping perspective is key. Burning out might not really be burning out and might just be someone genuinely hitting a dead end yet not realizing they have.\n\nAlso, take care about your biology. You are not a machine and even machines can't keep running forever without maintenance. Exercise, get sleep, take breaks regularly when things feel like they're not going anywhere and you are actually feeling exhausted. Grad school is tough. I don't think intellectual burnout is the same as other burnouts people talk about in industry.

I used the exact same term often, I was just trying to drag myself through the mud to the finish line.\n\nThe good news: It is definitely possible to recover from even long-term burn out. \n\nThe bad news: It is very difficult to recover from burn out while still doing the thing that led to it in the first place. \n\nTaking a break from the work is really the only way to really recover, but that is way easier said than done, especially since taking just a full weekend or even week to recharge may not cut it for years worth of burn out. So if you want to work on full recovery before finishing you may need to consider taking an actual leave of absence or long break, or at the very least adopt a really strict schedule so that you consistently have time evenings/weekends with no work. \n\nThat all is further complicated by the nature of burn out- if you're like me, the burn out initially was part of overworking but has turned into an inability to do any work over time. It feels like you can't take any sort of break because you aren't actually getting work done, so there isn't anything take a break from. This is not true though, constantly trying to work and stressing/thinking about work is incredibly taxing, and just because it may feel like you already aren't doing anything does not mean you are getting a break. \n\nYou know yourself better than anyone, so only you can decide if you are at a breaking point or if you can try to push through. It is 100% okay and good to leave a program, take a leave, etc. for your health and well-being if needed; I know many people who did so and they were far happier for it and have found good jobs. \n\nIf you feel that you want to try to push through, you still need to address the burn out as much as possible since it will not go away on its own and burn out makes even simple tasks much much harder to do. Therapy, medication, social support all help. The most important thing still is establishing time where you are not working at all, meaning you are not allowed to do work and have to do something else. This is really hard because if productivity is low it feels like you should be trying to work all the time to make up for it, but this will only make the burn out worse and you will not be more productive. So even if you don't get anything done during \"work time\", \"no work time\" still means you step away from the work for the day. I lost weeks/months of time to burn out and health issues and I graduated in 5.5 years (avg for program is 6) with a very happy advisor/committee- beating yourself up over not getting stuff done won't help and in the long run those low productivity days mean nothing, and I would have been better served using that time to rest and recover.\n\nTalk with your advisor and committee. Determine what you still need to do to finish. You don't have to commit to a specific timeline necessarily, it's more important to know what's left. Then you can implement strategies to work towards those tasks.", "author": "meesakeeta", "created": 1609879553, "upvotes": 185}, "gi7v945": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kr5d37/its_it_possible_to_burn_out_and_never_recover/gi7v945/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1609877990, "upvotes": 64}, "gi7lxlt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kr5d37/its_it_possible_to_burn_out_and_never_recover/gi7lxlt/", "text": "Idk but that\u2019s how I feel now", "author": "LiveNDiiirect", "created": 1609874681, "upvotes": 131}}}
