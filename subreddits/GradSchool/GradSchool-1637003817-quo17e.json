  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm kind of worried about my future. So basically, I thought I was ready for math graduate work but unfortunately, that ended up being wrong. One of my professors is nice of them to have my midterm grade be dropped if I do well on the final. However, I am uncertain if I can be able to do that. Taking the Abstract Algebra graduate version without any background of taking it as an undergrad is hard. However, I do feel like rings are much better than group theory. So hopefully I do well in the final. The chair and graduate coordinator have told me that I should consider switching programs. Switching program as in go to the Masters of Science in Education. I really want to teach and I feel like it will be the best option for me. However, my question is. Will I get into my education program if I do end up failing the two courses? My ugrad GPA was 2.95 and graduated in May 2021. If everything goes well and I do get accepted to the program then graduate with the degree, will applying to a Ph.D. education program be a reach for me?",

      "text": ">Taking the Abstract Algebra graduate version without any background of taking it as an undergrad is hard. \n\nYeah, that would definitely be true. I can't imagine having taken my algebra course without having seen the basic definitions beforehand. We covered composition series on day 1. I would have been 100% lost. \n\n>The chair and graduate coordinator have told me that I should consider switching programs.\n\nDo you know what the deadline you have is? I'd be surprised if failing two courses right away *instantly* booted you out of the program. You probably have another shot at things, but you'll be on some form of administrative thin ice. In my program (and I imagine in all programs) it's not unheard of for people to fail semester one classes because they weren't prepared for them. What they're \"supposed to\" do in that situation is take the dual-listed grad/undergrad course on the same topic to remediate and then retake the core class a year later. It's not *good*, but it happens. Everyone gets advised to just take the dual-listed course first if their undergrad coursework in an area isn't sufficient prep for a class, so they don't have to waste a semester. I dunno if a similar system of courses exists where you are, of course. \n\n>Will I get into my education program if I do end up failing the two courses?\n\nIf this program administered by the same department? If the grad chair and coordinator are suggesting switching objectives to you and they're in control of what you'd be switching to, then you're probably close to a shoe-in. You should ask *them* about this, though, not us. Even if you have a separate education program, maybe this is a common thing--maybe they have an understanding with the other department that math students who struggle can fail into the education track? No one on here would know that. \n\nIf this is just a totally separate program and your application is going to be considered alongside everyone else's equally then failing two graduate courses certainly won't be an *asset* to your application. You'll probably want to write some sort of statement to the effect of \"I always wanted to pursue education but I now realize that an education program is the more intelligent way to go about that than a math program\" rather than \"I'm doing this because I tried something else and failed\"--that sounds bad. \n\n>If everything goes well and I do get accepted to the program then graduate with the degree, will applying to a Ph.D. education program be a reach for me?\n\nSure. Stuff from *before* your most recent and most relevant degree will still get *looked* at, but it won't matter as much as the education degree that you just completed. \n\n/r/math has a weekly \"career and education\" thread that people can ask these sorts of questions in. You might get more responses there than here--there are definitely some math people who roam around these parts but there aren't a ton of them. But talking to other people *at your institution* will definitely be way better than talking to strangers online. None of us know the policies and culture of your department or the exact details of your situation.",

          "text": "Hi! Sorry for the late reply. Thank you taking the time to write this. I submitted my application Monday night so hopefully I\u2019ll hear back pretty soon since is rolling admissions. The only thing I\u2019m worried is if I get TA ship. I\u2019m hoping everything works out but I need to really quick since I live in the dorms and if I don\u2019t hear back before December 17 I\u2019ll have to vacate and have to go back home. I don\u2019t want to do that since I have a small car and won\u2019t be able to take everything with me. I\u2019ll probably have to take two trips back and forth to get the rest",
