There are endless conversations about method, approach and criticism in graduate school that are all aimed in you finding your postage stamp of original scholarship.  The real problem is, because the discipline is often based on argument within the context of an existing body of literature, all historians can be trained to essentially argue with one another \u2014 unlike the image of a more collective connotation like the \u2018scientific community\u2019.  Which, I know is an oversimplification.  The result can be historians overturning decades of bad history where an uncritical approach to primary sources led extreme misrepresentation of historical circumstances.  The result can also be three tenured professors in a spirited debate for four decades about detail so ancillary that most people in the public couldn\u2019t tell the difference.  The entire discipline is built on criticism and contestation, which is why I focus most on reading interesting sources that haven\u2019t gotten a lot of attention and stay out of the more crowded parts of the melee.",

I always look at history as a social scientist, and history looks in many ways so similar to one, but it also clearly does not operate like a social science. That makes it hard to interact with the scholarship (as in, I might want to consult or cite some work where it relates to what I'm doing, but even monographs are far, far too narrowly focused to be useful to me - I'm almost forced to go to popular writing to find the level of abstraction that I can meaningfully consult and refer to). \n\nAnd \"the crowded parts of the melee\" - at least in the US, history seems very narrowly focused. I occasionally listen to the New Books Network podcasts, which perhaps does not give a fully representative view, but the absolute dominance of relatively recent US history is stunning to me. Comes with the demand for people who teach in that area, I guess.",

That brings to mind the idea that it's escaping to space or something... nothing heavier than helium can escape Earth's gravity well without assistance; either on a rocket or ejected forcefully after a bolide impact.\n\nHowever, yes! Fluctuating pCO2 concentrations indicate a dynamic climate system where the relative sizes of carbon reservoirs (as atmospheric CO2, dissolved inorganic carbon, organic material, etc) evolves in response to changing physical parameters. Through Earth history this has been dominated by the two primary first order controls on global climate: orbital cand nfiguration of the celestial bodies in respect to Earth (resulting in rhythmic Milankovitch Cycles, and tectonics).",

Even the countries with the most progressive climate policies (carbon neutral by 2050) aren't remotely enough to curve the looming crisis. Even if they do hit that target, without any real binding incentives to do, it will be a disaster. I mean, it will be the greatest disaster humanity has ever faced anyhow, but at this point continuing to kick the can down the road is.... something else. We are staring in the face of a near complete collapse of the marine ecosystem, massive droughts and famine due to shifting precipitation patterns, Australian scale wildfires on nearly every continent every summer, intensified monsoon and tropical storm seasons, and upwards of an estimate 300 million people out of a home by 2100 simply due to inundation from rising sea level.\n\nThe only reasonable choice would be to aggressively slash emissions, get the planet to net neutral in the next 5ish years economic consequences be damned (because no matter how bad it is it pales in comparison to what is coming), and to immediately begin throwing World War scale resources at preparation. This means shifting supply chains, making every region self sufficient for basic necessities, revolutionizing the logistics of our agricultural system because where we farm is going to begin migrating all over the globe, and establish real binding international law concerning water rights. Above all we will need an international body capable of organizing and redistributing the hundreds of millions to billion(s) of climate refugees that will be created in the coming century amongst the nations capable of taking them, and this body would obviously need the backing of an overwhelming military force.\n\nIn short we desperately need societal revolution. Capitalism, unfortunately, is ill-equipped to deal with this sort of problem. The costs are enormous and due today and the risk if we remain stagnant is outside the bounds of the quarterly earnings sheet.\n\nThis is purely anecdotal but across my three institutions I've come to find a very large majority of my cohort (myself included) have decided not to have children, citing the looming climate crisis. We are on a train headed toward a cliff and the people driving up front have bolted the door and continue to drink champagne while we accelerate.\n\nThings are bleak. They seem hopeless, but what can we do but continue fighting for change? I don't know. Small hobbies help. So do good friendships. At the end of the day it seems as if we are destined for this catastrophe beyond imagination, and unfortunately it will hurt those least responsible the most; but it may be the only way we take our next step in our social evolution. \n\nAnyhow, I can't believe how long I've just droned on haha, goodmorning!
