I left my first program after a year and just successfully completed a PhD institution #2. My transfer was driven by two things:\n1.\tChanging research interests that I couldn\u2019t pursue at institution #1\n2.\ta bad fit between me and advisor 1. \n\nHonestly #2 drove the departure, and I was looking to return to industry when I stumbled upon my second grad program.  As far as the logistics: my application to the second program focused on my changing research interest, but I personally focused a lot more on advisor fit when I was deciding whether to accept the admissions offer or not. I used the same folks that wrote recommendation letters for my first attempt at grad school for the application, basically. I didn\u2019t even tell anyone at institution 1 that I was thinking of leaving until it was all squared away, for fear of funding loss, so I\u2019m not sure that not having a LOR from your current institution will be that big of a deal. I was able to transfer some coursework, but lost about 50% of the credits I had at institution 1 (was able to transfer some math courses, not able to transfer classes like research methods and seminar). Good luck with your decisions!\n\nETA: ease of transferring is likely somewhat field dependent so I think your best path forward is to start talking to folks at your potential program #2 and see how they would deal with your situation", "author": "AKiwi89", "created": 1631970822, "upvotes": 2}, "hdazht7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pq6lx7/is_transferring_to_another_phd_program_a_thing/hdazht7/", "text": "The most common reason for transfers is if your advisor changes universities and you go with them.\n\nOther transfers with your advisor\u2019s support are also sometimes possible, eg. they don\u2019t have funding or your research interests have diverged from theirs, and they have a friend at another university who can take you.\n\nYou can also transfer if you are changing fields, eg. you started a PhD in A but realized you really wanted to do a PhD in B, and your advisor and old program support your decision.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the support of your advisor and program, a *direct* transfer to another program is unlikely. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t transfer, you just have to do so indirectly. Withdraw from your current program for some reason like \u201cpandemic-related stress\u201d (do NOT criticize your old program as you leave), wait at least a year, then apply to the new program. At this point people at your old program should be willing to be references. If they suggest you could return to your old program, thank them, but tell them that after everything that\u2019s happened (implying pandemic/mental health) you think it would be best for you to get out of (city) and get a fresh start.\n\nEssentially, transfers are possible whenever transferring does not imply that you are dissatisfied with your old program/think your new program is better. As long as the necessary quantities of ego lubricant are applied to avoid giving that impression, you can get letters of reference for a transfer.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that PhD transfers aren\u2019t like undergrad transfers. You may be able to waive some duplicate coursework, but the credits don\u2019t transfer, so you\u2019re still looking at 1-2 years of coursework and a qualifying exam at the new school.", "author": "tentkeys", "created": 1631948208, "upvotes": 1}, "hdanpxn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pq6lx7/is_transferring_to_another_phd_program_a_thing/hdanpxn/", "text": "Totally fine.
