{"sid": "jjorxk", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jjorxk/update_passed_my_qualifying_exam/", "title:": "Update: Passed my qualifying exam", "text": "So just wanted to give a positive update [to my panicky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jbvyei/how_to_deal_with_panic_over_qualifying_exams/) from a couple weeks ago in case anyone in the future is doing a deep dive for qualifying exams related posts like I was, and because the comments I got on that post were super kind and helpful. \n\nI passed, no conditions. I was sure I was going to fail but it ended up being not nearly as horrible as I thought. My committee is phenomenal, and overall their questions and feedback made me way more excited about my project than I was before. And no one mentioned the typo (probably because they didn't read it that closely lol). \n\nSo if you're reading this pre-quals, you got this, even if it seems super bleak right now. Breathe a bit, and remember that your committee is there to make your work better and not just tear you to shreds. Thanks to you guys who reminded me of this earlier.
