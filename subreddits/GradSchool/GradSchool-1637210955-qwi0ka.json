  "text": "Y'all, I almost thought I couldn't do it, but I am! It was a tough semester. My mental health slowly and then quickly declined the last 2 months from week one out. I got accommodations for my disability for the first time ever in school, so I got some extensions I really needed. I am really glad I am doing this, because after a decade of tough front line work in social services with a BS, I am fulfilling my dream of becoming a licensed mental health worker!\n\nI decided to do my final year in 2 years instead of one so I can actually do the thing and be as stable as I can and not flame out. 7 semesters left!\n\nI am very grateful for this community, my social supports and patient therapists and professors! <3",
