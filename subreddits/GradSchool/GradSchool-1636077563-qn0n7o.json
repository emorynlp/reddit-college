I don't have much else to say, except that I hope everyone still in the struggle is doing alright. Just remember to take care of and be kind to yourselves, you are worth it!

By this time they aren't there to screw you because they have already read your dissertation several times and forced you to make changes that make it read like a 5th grader wrote it anyway.
