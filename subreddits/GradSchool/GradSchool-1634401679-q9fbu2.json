  "title:": "Massive impostor syndrome because I got an MA at SNHU...(rant)",
  "text": "I was so stupid when I was younger.\n\nI finished my BA at a reputable state school. I didn't want to leave my area due to family concerns, but wanted to get an MA in the same field (the place I got my BA didn't have an MA in my field). So, I did a distance MA at SNHU. I passed, got into a reputable school for my PhD, and now I'm a tenured professor in the same field. \n\nI have massive impostor syndrome. I feel like my MA isn't legit and that I didn't earn it. I feel like I was basically handed my MA as I've been told that SNHU is equivalent to a diploma mill. This idea is reinforced by the fact that a family member got into SNHU after just barely making it through high school. I never had to do an oral defence of my MA thesis. Also, the commercials make the whole school seem sketchy and like a for-profit diploma mill. \n\nI fear that, someday, someone will tell me that my MA doesn't count.",

      "text": "Outside of elite schools, most people can get into an undergraduate program after barely making it through high school. Most colleges accept most students. Universities like SNHU or WGU generally don't accept people straight out of college, because their CBE and fully online models aren't always best for a 19 year old who might not be able to self-pace. Also, SNHU is non-profit.\n\nThere is always going to be some level of taboo associated with fully online, CBE, or any combination of the two. The research into either of the modality of fully online education or the framework around CBE doesn't bear out the negative feelings that even sometimes academics have about them, but nonetheless occasionally even smart people base their opinions on those antiquated taboos. In my career I've seen that most don't care though.\n\nAbout your impostor syndrome, I've never been able to overcome mine, so I don't have a ton of great advice other than the observation that your PhD is obviously a better standard of your academic rigor than anything you've ever done before, even if you gave an oral defense of your thesis.\n\nOn a complete side note, I didn't think that MA programs required an oral defense. I have two masters degrees. One of them is an MS, and to get that I had to defend my thesis. My other is not an MS and it was all project based. It might be different for every school though.",

It is less than 2% FYI.. you have paid your dues and earned your right to move away from your imposter syndrome. \n\nWith grad school in general, this belief in imposter syndrome is dangerous and is neuroplastically reinforced the more we think about it. We need to do our best to think otherwise. OP, it\u2019s time you fought against these feelings you\u2019re having. Good luck and Godspeed!",
