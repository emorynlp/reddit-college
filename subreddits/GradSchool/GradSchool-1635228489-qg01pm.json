  "title:": "How to deal with toxic lab mates?",
  "text": "I just started my MSc early September. At first, everyone was decently friendly and super helpful in my lab. My PI operates on a \u201chands-off\u201d style and relies on senior grad students to help new ones. Recently, there have been several instances where my lab mates have not treated me very well, and it makes me dread coming into the lab. (For some context, I started the same time as another girl who has 0 experience in the field so she\u2019s been getting help from someone, whereas i\u2019m working on a new solo project)\n\nSome examples are:\n\n1. Blaming me for messes that I didn\u2019t make and then making me clean it up by pressure.\n2. Being incredibly dismissive when I ask legitimate questions\n3. Making jokes about \u201ckilling me\u201d if they had the choice to replace me\n4. Making offhand comments about how they like \u201cmost\u201d of the people in the lab\n5. Making plans in front of me with other new girl and seemingly purposely not inviting me (which is whatever, they are not obligated to invite me)\n6. Saying *insert equipment name* \u201cis for the boys only\u201d (as a joke, but still annoying)\n7. Snapping at me for doing something incorrectly when everyone else in the lab did too\n\nMost recently, due to a series of events, i ended up at a gathering with them. They somehow brought up how they have to look after me and new girl. Then they started roasting me saying I ask too many questions, and that other new girl is great cause she doesn\u2019t ask questions (she asks me her questions actually, plus they are basically doing her project for her). They said i shouldn\u2019t be asking any theory questions.\n\nThis honestly just made me feel awful, since i already felt that they hated me and i\u2019m feeling the imposter syndrome. \n\nWhat would you do in this scenario? I don\u2019t really want to seem like a snitch and bring it up with my PI, but even talking about it makes me want to cry. I\u2019ve even considered dropping out and applying elsewhere\u2026",

You could do some research around to see how previous candidates did on  the lab, and if they were similar cases.\nAfterwards you could try to communicate your points of view with them in a way they can be given notice as to set up an attempt of reconciliation of the situation, so that later when you contact your PI as to inform him/her of what's going on you can have evidence on your side so they can't get away with it.",

      "text": "I'm so sorry you are putting up with this. Unfortunately some people are such emotional dumpster-fires that they have to build themselves up by putting others down. \n\nTo me, a few things in your list are not like the others. Joking about killing you is totally not OK. Talking about violence, even in supposed \"jest\", absolutely doesn't belong in the workplace. Likewise, saying the \"boys only\" bullshit is sexist. Doesn't matter if they think they're joking around, it makes you uncomfortable so the joke failed and they are responsible for that. Just on those two points alone I'd say you need to talk to your PI. \n\nUnfortunately, even am intervention is unlikely to make any of your labmates decent people and you'll still have to deal with them. If I was in your position I'd try and ask them as few things as possible, even if that means I spend 15 minutes looking for the sonicator or am extra day or two doing titration. I'd also keep my giant headphone on like all the time. Don't take responsibility for and clean up shit that isn't yours. If they are pressuring you then put in your headphones. \n\nAgain - sorry this is happening. There are shitty people in every workplace, but having shitty labmates is particularly hard.",

I would also file a hate and bias incident report, and speak to someone at the Title IX office regarding the sexism. \n\n>Making jokes about \u201ckilling me\u201d if they had the choice to replace me\n\nThis comment alone would be enough for me to pursue disciplinary action against them. It's not funny, and if you are in a laboratory with potentially dangerous chemicals, it's not appropriate to joke about murdering someone. \n\n\"Joking\" about certain equipment only being for people of a certain sex or gender identity is discriminatory and unacceptable. It's not funny, not professional, and has no place in your lab. Look up what your local laws are regarding recording people. You mentioned you're in Canada so I'm not sure how it works there, but there are many different laws in the US that govern that. If you are not able to record, send emails to yourself detailing each incident as comprehensively as possible. That way, they will be contemporaneous and time stamped. The more detail you can provide, the better (e.g. Susan was wearing a yellow jacket and brown pants) because it can boost your credibility. \n\nWhen you talk about this to your PI or whoever, don't frame it in terms of them not liking you. Frame it in terms of how their behavior and the things they say make you feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and then give clear examples. It's not a matter of them not liking you--you can not like someone and still be professional. This is a matter of them bullying, harassing, and \"othering\" you and creating a hostile (and potentially unsafe) work environment.",

The unsavoury behaviour stopped but the person knew I had complained and was very difficult to work with (until he got fired eventually anyway).\n\nSo my advice is:\nDefinitely address it with your PI, including sending evidence (screenshots of written communication, quotes/details of spoken communication) of specific events to show you're not just moaning about vague social worries and the extent of the issue (as the others will probably refute your complaints by saying you're imagining it/it's lab banter). However, expect they will still be bitter and unhelpful towards you afterwards. Since they're being horrible as it is, you don't have anything to lose and they shouldn't get away with this crap. Also, you will do better the more work you do yourself based on your own understanding of the literature and methods, rather than relying on second hand learning from them.\n\nThey sound like jealous asshats who are threatened by anyone showing genuine enthusiasm for the field. Any good lab member would encourage and welcome questions from new members about what they're doing and why they're doing it.",
