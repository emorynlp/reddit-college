  "title:": "Dreading tomorrow\u2019s project update meeting, I have made absolutely NO progress",
  "text": "Just gotta vent I apologize in advance for all of the complaining\n\nI set a deadline for myself to do a HUGE experiment, and that deadline just happens to be tomorrow. I have not made ANY progress on the experiment :\u2019-)\n\nI am PARALYZED with anxiety over this. My PI is aware of the deadline I made and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re expecting a decent chunk of progress in my project update meeting tomorrow. To make it worse, we haven\u2019t had meetings for the past 2 weeks so not only am I rolling up to this meeting empty handed, but it has been OVER TWO WEEKS since my last update.\n\nI cannot even begin to express how upset I am with myself, this specific experiment has been hanging over my head since the semester started. I\u2019m also really trying to focus on my classes and keep my grades up, since I need to maintain a certain GPA to keep my assistantship and I am DANGEROUSLY close to falling below that. Plus, it\u2019s midterm season. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here at this point. I\u2019m not even close to sticking to my project timeline, and my grades are mediocre at best. I have exactly 0 redeeming qualities. I feel like I\u2019ve been a huge disappointment to my PI / lab / department even since I started last year, and tomorrow is really going to solidify that. I\u2019m terrified of my PI\u2019s reaction when they find out I haven\u2019t made any progress. I\u2019ve never wanted to drop out more in my life. \n\nFeeling absolutely useless and like my life is falling apart. Mental health is at an absolute low. \n\nThanks for reading and letting me express my overwhelming existential dread. For your own sake I hope you can\u2019t relate but if you can please feel free to let me know lol\n\n*spoilering this last chunk of text because it\u2019s mainly just me being insufferable and making excuses as to why I haven't done anything, so not necessary by any means but may add context if you\u2019re interested*\n\n>!The issue is that this experiment has to get done in one continuous stream of work, which comes to 15-20 straight hours in the lab. I\u2019ve gone over the protocols a bunch and in the end it\u2019s just gotta get done that way. The reason for this is that the main component of my experiment degrades quickly even when frozen. So I need to go through the entire synthesis reaction, and then right when that\u2019s done I have to move on to the actual experiment with the synthesized product. I just haven\u2019t been able to find a chunk of time to do it, but in the end this experiment is pretty much the main reason I\u2019m in this program to begin with so it is ESSENTIAL and I need to MAKE time.!<",

      "text": "Mm. ok. I could relate.\n\nLost all my motivation, entertain myself often at the thought of quitting. You can see my post history. Yet we're still here, not following through with those thoughts. On Reddit right now when I should be finishing up a manuscript. I am my own obstacle.\n\nJust sit down and do it. You don't have a way to go around it unless you want to quit. That said, if you want to quit, that is also ok. Just don't waste too much of YOUR time doing neither.\n\nGuess I should wrap up that manuscript huh.",

      "text": "I could relate to that dread and anxiety of not having shareable results. Why don\u2019t you email your PI and say you\u2019ve been overwhelmed with class work and personal things these past two weeks and that you need extra time for your experiment? That way you don\u2019t waste his time and your time by going to a meeting with nothing to discuss. I think he\u2019ll appreciate the heads up and he can plan his day accordingly. He\u2019s a human being and may have experienced something similar when he was a grad student, so hopefully he\u2019ll be sympathetic and empathetic. But be prepared to take a bit of a scolding! That was always my case. I only learned to change my behavior when I realized that i was actively choosing to get scolded by not doing what I had to do.",

          "text": "That's a really good idea! Honestly should have sent them an email earlier, considering it's 3 am and the meeting is at 8:30 am I think I've missed my window of opportunity. Maybe not, Idk\n\nIt's also a group update meeting (a bunch of us go around and share progress) so even if I don't have much the meeting will happen either way. Not looking forward to getting a scolding in front of the rest of my lab but we'll see how it goes! \n\nThanks for the advice I really appreciate it :)",
