This is the first week. I have 2 small assignments to complete and 3 different chapter reading plus preparation for my first TA session of a new subject area to complete for submission/ instruction next week. I thought I'd be self motivated for this, I want it so bad. \n\nI also, just can't get up.\n\n\n\nUpdate: Listen, I can't thank you all enough for your support. Thanks to the advice given I found the motivation to get up, make that list and get to scratching things off (super fulfilling btw). I'll leave the post up in case anyone needs encouragement later and for me to reread when things get tough. It's good to know that I'm not an isolated case, I'm not crazy and I'm not alone. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nI noticed alot of persons seem to be slipping into depression and just pushing through because, well, you're already here but please reach out to student counseling resources. Mental health can be a slippery slope. I want us all to achieve our best. You can dm me if you'd like to chat but I am not a therapist/ counselor and can only give basic encourage and advice.", "author": "lavender-trainer", "created": 1631312007, "retrieved": 1632844631, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 184, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hcg9tcr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pluwo6/i_worked_and_stressed_so_hard_to_get_into_grad/hcg9tcr/", "text": "Connect with your cohort, chances are most of them are feeling the same/similar.

First week of grad school, first session of TA next week, and a few short assignments. I\u2019m freaking out as well\u2026 but there are many great comments coming from wise individuals in this discussion. I break up my day in chunks. Work on one thing at a time. Make that list! And don\u2019t forget to TAKE BREAKS. I can\u2019t stress that enough. Don\u2019t stare at a screen for two hours. Drink water. Take a small walk. Watch an episode of something. Then get back to work. Oh, and don\u2019t procrastinate (or try not to). If you fall behind on something, you will have a hard time catching up. (I used this routine when I was a research assistant back in my undergrad\u2026 my supervisor was basically prepping me for grad school, and this method worked well). \n\nI wish you the best of luck.
