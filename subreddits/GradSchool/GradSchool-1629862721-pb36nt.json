I\u2019m teaching a biology lab for non-majors, and it\u2019s a lot of freshmen. I teach two sections, a morning lab and an evening lab.\n\nMorning lab went great, everyone was respectful when I or another student spoke. However, in my night lab I had a situation that kind of shook me up. We were going over the lab safety contract and students had to go around the room and find the safety showers, chemical spill kit, etc. Afterwards, I asked for volunteers to point out the location each thing in the lab to make sure we were all on the same page. \n\nOne student was pointing out the safety shower, and I noticed two students talking loudly to each other. I went over and asked if they could please listen to the speaker. One of those students gave me a bit of sass and told me they were talking about the safety contract and if I had listened I would of known that, but okay, he\u2019ll listen. Thanks, awesome, that\u2019s perfect. I walk away.\n\nThen, he proceeds to (in front of the whole class) to say we need to clear the air and I need to get the class under control, that\u2019s there\u2019s no reason to single him out - that I should understand since we\u2019re both adults, and have no idea what is going on in his life. My adrenaline was pumping, I\u2019m not great with confrontation. So, okay, I addressed the whole class and laid my expectations out that when another student is talking, we should all be respectful and listen, particularly when it involves lab safety. \n\nHe continued, and I then said that if there\u2019s issues with my communication, we can discuss it after class. That was that (if I can remember it all correctly). After class, he left without talking to me further. One student mentioned that I handled it \u201clike a champ,\u201d so that felt good. But, I can also see his point, I don\u2019t have any clue what his life is like or his sensitivities. \n\nDid I handle this professionally? Do I bring it up with the professor? How often does this happen? I\u2019m hoping someone else has gone through something similar and can share their experience! Thanks.\n\nUpdate: Thank you for all of your suggestions and insights! I documented the incident to the professor in an email. They informed me that I handled it professionally and that we can discuss it in our next TA meeting.

I have been in the position of talking to a neighboring student about the current class content and being chastised by a teacher. I do not like that experience and would like to feel comfortable asking a classmate for clarification or help if I missed something. Sometimes that is the easiest and quickest way to clear up confusion if I missed a word or something. \n\nWaiting to ask a question can really suck because it may mean that in the meantime, I don't understand what is being talked about if the knowledge builds in each other. In other words if I missed one or two words or didn't understand something, and the class is continuing to talk about it, I can either\n\na) ask a neighbor for clarification and then hopefully understand the rest of the class convo/lecture\n\nb) wait to ask and then have to have the whole thing re-explained and feel lost\n\nB might be extra stressful on the first day of class because that's a time when I for one want to feel oriented to what's going on around me. \n\nAlso people have different learning styles and maybe the student's neighbor explained it in a way that was easier for him to understand. So in this case, I don't think expecting absolute silence while someone else is talking is a reasonable expectation. I would ask students, if you are clarifying something with a neighbor please do so quickly and quietly. \n\nI highly discourage you from buying into the stories people have here about this student being \"entitled\" or a \"problem student.\" If you buy into this, I think you may be setting up both the student and yourself to fail. \n\nAlso, any advice to turn into rigid authoritarian is bad pedagogy imo. The teacher/student relationship works best when run on mutual respect. You interpreted this student's behavior as disrespectful, but he also interpreted your behavior as disrespectful. It sounds like it was due to a misunderstanding and perhaps unclear expectations. Look for ways to restore respect and trust, not dominate the student into submission in a power struggle.

All those things you've seen a professor or grade school teacher do when someone steps out of line, you're now empowered to do in your lab section (possibly after a discussion with your instructor-of-record for the more drastic measures.) If this student wants to act like a child, then it's not just your right, but your duty as an educator to stamp that out and protect the learning environment for the rest of your students. He's testing the waters to see what he can get away with, and by heading it off early, it's much less likely to continue to be a problem.\n\nI would say it's perfectly acceptable to bring it up with your professor, and strongly recommended to bring it up if disruptions continue; there's the potential this student also goes to your professor to file a complaint against you -- in this situation, it would be best that the professor has already heard the story from you.", "author": "mwobey", "created": 1629890142, "upvotes": 6}, "ha9wqzc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pb36nt/first_day_as_a_ta_already_had_a_sour_experience/ha9wqzc/", "text": "From experience, there will always be that one kid who hates you for no reason.

I had assumed this would be clear to anyone, but as a matter of respect I would like everybody to listen, when one of your peers is saying something.\" You are conceding a point to him, which let's him save face, while establishing boundaries at the same time.\n\nStudent still trying to stir shit? \"Let's discuss this after class.\"\n\nEDIT: As an example of what not to do.

I know maybe you want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but this student does not have a point at all. It's not his show, it's yours. Maybe it sounds mean, but what he is going through is not really relevant at all. If he is having some difficulties that preclude him from acting in a polite and professional (and safe!) way in class, he should withdraw from the course. \n\nYou mentioned he was an older student and, tbh, sometimes the older ones can be worse than the teenagers. Older students can sometimes have a hard time taking you seriously if you're much younger than they are because they think you don't have \"life experience\", \"maturity\" or whatever--but it's not a class about life. It's a class about biology and you know more than he does, period. And this person is evidently a veteran and hasn't learned you don't talk when someone else is talking? I'm sure his superiors enjoyed him. \n\nDon't be afraid to push back on rude and disrespectful students. When he said \"we can discuss it after class\" would have been a good time to point out that *you* dictate when and if we have after-class discussions, not him, and if he wanted to have a chat you'd be happy to, but he can come to your posted office hours as listed on the syllabus. \n\nI would bring it up with the professor, but just as a heads up that this student might be an issue in the future.

It might be beneficial to send him an email, say you didn\u2019t get a chance to speak after class but would like to address his concerns and ensure that going forward you both have clear expectations of what to expect in class. Suggest making an appointment or office hours. That should set him back to thinking (hopefully). You could also send him some resources, eg if your school has counseling services. Either way I would run the situation by your prof, some have specific ways they like to deal with it.
