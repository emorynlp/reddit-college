There are no labs, the program director described it as \"not a research master's,\" and I'm rapidly discovering that PSMs are geared towards people trying to get into industry, not research. I had wanted to use the degree to become a conservation biologist.\n\nThere is a capstone research project, which is good, but I can't help but wonder if I should cut my losses and bail for a different program. I was accepted into an MS program as well, but I already told them I wouldn't be attending... did I really, really, mess this up?\n\nPanicking a little bit.
