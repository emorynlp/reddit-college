  "text": "Every semester I go through a motivational roller coaster where I am either highly motivated and do lots of reading or extremely unmotivated and get virtually nothing done. I've mentioned having these motivational crises to my cohort and they said they've never experienced anything like that.\n\nIt has me wondering am I'm just lazy, are they having similar experiences but frame them differently, or am I potentially having some mental health stuff that I've never been made aware of?\n\nLife kinda goes to shit both in class and at home every semester",

Among other things, I let my bad habits amplify, instead of keeping them in check with a daily routine and healthier habits like pre-pandemic me.  I had some really, really unproductive months for research that I wish I could get back.  I\u2019m still struggling with staying on task, but the motivation is coming back and that\u2019s the big thing.  Small successes each day can make a big difference within a month or even a week.  We are creatures of habit.  The best I can suggest is to cultivate as many good habits as you can, and accepting you may have to grit your teeth to finish some tasks.",

It could even be a hormone imbalance like your thyroid. Really, it could be anything. But that doesn't mean you're out of luck, I would talk to my doctor, get some vitamin & hormone bloodwork and see if there is anything that could be causing it. Things like vitamin D deficiency, low thyroid hormone concentration, and even elevated cortisol can cause what you're describing. But if there isn't anything obvious, you might want to get an assessment at your university's psychology clinic.\n\nPersonally, I experience this a lot, but I suspect I have ADD and am going to the doctor next week to discuss it.",

Advising those people to seek therapy etc. is excellent advice. But man, it seems like there's a lot of \"oh you're going through an underproductive patch? Seek therapy ASAP because it is you that is the problem - the system is Cool and Good and you need to be better for it\" going on here lol.\n\nI'm on year 5 of my PhD and I am incredibly burnt out and tired and slogging along inch by inch. My productivity is shit and I am borderline going to screw myself out of my milestones. But it's very clear what's going on: I'm fucking done and trying to squeeze blood from the rock isn't effective. This doesn't mean I should be scrambling for an ADD or Depression diagnosis.

      "text": "The variation in motivation is mostly normal. The goal though should be to move towards more consistency in output/productivity, even if the variation in motivation still occurs. So what that means is building systems/habits that help you get things done even when the intrinsic motivation isn't cranking. There are a ton of ways to do this. Routine helps because you just have momentum and it lowers the amount of instrinsic motivation you need to well up each time. Having different projects, in different places in the process of completion also helps, because when you're burned out on one project or one type of work, you can switch to another. For example, I try to always have a project in the beginning brainstorming stages, a project in the data collection phase, a project in the analysis phase, and a project in the writing phase. If I get sick of writing, I can switch to data analysis, etc. Plus, the excitement of having projects in the beginning brainstorming stage can pull you out of a low motivation phase. \n\nOne thing that was super key for me in graduate school was learning 1) when to cut my losses and 2) to be kind to myself. As far as cutting losses, it's not worth it to beat your head against the wall on work that's just not gonna happen on that day for whatever reason. If the work just isn't happening, I'll go grocery shop or take care of administrative things, etc., because then at least that clears up time down the line where maybe I will feel capable of working on whatever I need to work on. As far as being kind to myself, do your best to move away from thinking of low motivation as an intrinsic failure. You have high motivation phases, you do have that capacity, there's nothing wrong with you. The question should be, how can I structure my life and my work so that I can maximize high motivation phases and minimize low motivation phases?",

I know several of my cohorts have mentioned similar feelings. Seems pretty normal. I can't speak to the mental health component. I personally haven't talked to a doctor about any of it, so others may be more helpful there.",
