I can't bring myself to open my emails and see what's in my inbox.\n\nMy biggest fear is that my professors are angry at me and fail me. I am so worried. Due to depression and anxiety, I avoided communicating for months.\n\nEdit- Thank you so much everyone for your help.  I checked the most recent important email. I'm still anxious to check the others. I wouldn't have been able to do it at all if it wasn't for your advice. \nI am upset because I found out through that email that my supervisor has retired. I feel like a bad person for not communicating with her. I really hope I didn't leave a bad impression on her. I honestly wanted to reach out for help and speak to her but I just couldn't.\ud83d\ude1e",

But for now, you need to do two things. 1. Contact a doctor. A GP, visit local walk-in centre. Call 111. Something. You need support, 100% top priority. They can help with poor mental health, and refer you onwards if needed. 2. Contact your university. Tell them you have severe debilitating depression, and are trying to get medical help, but need assistance because it has severely affected your studies. Universities can apply \"extenuating circumstances\". I had severe anxiety in my second year, I asked for help, saw a university counsellor, and they were able to wipe off some of my bad grades for affected coursework and let me retake them without a cap on my retake mark. Universities can be very understanding. Find support at your university too - is there a student support service you can contact?\n\nThis is not the end of the world. You can get overcome all of this. Take a deep breath, take a walk, and remember: you can do this, and there are people who can and want to help.",

It takes a lot of energy to respond to emails and thats okay. I also suffer from email anxiety but stopped shaming myself on not responding on time (or at all) because that worsens the problem. Instead, what worked best is to trick my brain into drafting and sending a response:\n\n- Open any text editor and copy and paste the email contents\n- At first, your goal is to write any response without the intention of actually sending it right now or at all.\n- Write down bullet points on each subject that has to be addressed.\n- Complete each point with sentences and there you have a draft of your response.\n- You can imagine you are writing the response to your mom or friend to make it easier.\n- After you are done, recheck typos, formalism etc. Don't over think it.\n- Save the document then take a walk or get coffee.\n- When you are feeling comfortable return to the text editor and send it \n\n70% of the time I actually end up sending it right away (without the intial intention), otherwise I always send it after returning from a walk. The point is just to reduce the friction and anxiety from overthinking.",

      "text": "I tend to have this problem too, especially if I'm awaiting feedback, criticism or if the email could contain rejection. I'm not sure what's the exact problem for you but I'll just write a bit about my experience.\n\nIf I apply to something and get a mail back that could contain the rejection, there is no way I can open and read it myself. Any rejection feels like a punch in the guts and sends me to the hell of depression for at least three days. The last time I just gave it to my sister who then told me the result.\n\nFor smaller things I also need to mentally prepare. Funny enough, one or two time I just couldn't open an email on my phone or on my PC because it felt too intense, but I managed to read it on my tablet (super dumb I know). Sometimes it helps to drink coffee, because it can make me lose up a little bit and make me more energetic so that I get into this 'just do it' mindset.\n\nAnother important point is however how you react when you read your emails. What I do is that since I have low confidence, I tend to read and perceive the email in a negative tone. So, the writer might have written the text in a completely neutral and respectful tone, but my brain will read it as if they're annoyed with me and rude, because that's what I'm expecting people to treat me (bc low confidence). That's actually the core issue in my case. I'm afraid of getting hurt, but because I have this negative mindset that I read anything in an annoyed tone, I am guaranteed to get hurt. So the key is to keep telling yourself that this negative perception is just shit that your brains makes up. In most cases the other person won't have any problem with you and won't mind writing to you. I mean, most times it's their damn job to answer emails. Try to consciously read the email in a way that you are not making up negative stuff but instead give the other person the benefit of doubt that they actually mean well. And if a person does write in a not that friendly manner, it's much more probable that they are stressed or have a bad day than that it is because of you. It's not your responsibility to keep everyone happy anyways, so just concentrate on your job, which is writing those emails, and not what other people might think about your emails. That's their job.\n\nAnd the more often you do it, the easier it gets, ideally. Because you will make good experiences of people treating you well, so if someone doesn't, you can confidently know it's because of them, not because of you.\n\nI have no idea if this helps but yeah. Good luck, you can do it!",

But opening it makes it just a little bit easier to work yourself up to it. Set your self a time limit (say 10 minutes), and browse Reddit or something in the meantime. When your time is up, swap back but close your eyes. Give yourself a pep talk, and go for it. Once you've read the email, absorb the fact it wasn't that bad.\n\nFinally, remind yourself that grad school is a job, but not your life.

And the more that you do this, the more your brain should start to recognize that *most* emails won't be from someone who is annoyed with you. Maybe you can only do a couple of emails today, but work yourself up to doing more and more. Once it's in your routine, a lot of that anxiety (as someone who also has email anxiety, probably not all of it) should subside. :) \n\nAnother thing that helped me (that I didn't see mentioned in OP's post, so I apologize if not relevant) was to designate certain hours as non-email hours *and* to change the ringtone on my phone for work emails to just a little tiny blip. I found myself becoming anxious just *hearing* the email tone, so removing that from the equation helped minimize one of those barriers to checking emails.",

I think that's important information to be able to understand where this anxiety comes from and how one might help to deal with it. \n\nI used to have a bit of anxiety when I saw unread emails in my Outlook because, at one point, I was working with someone who was being very difficult and who was emailing at all hours of the day marking everything as URGENT regardless whether it was urgent or not. For me, it was like \"what kind of hellscape am I going to wake up to today?\", so removing myself from that environment helped a lot. \n\nIf you're in grad school then email is unfortunately just something you have to deal with, so it might be helpful to schedule a routine for when you check emails. If you try to keep a \"typical\" 9-5 schedule, then you can check your emails at 9am, 11, 1, 3 and 4:45pm, for example, but then choose not to look at them after 5pm or before 9am. I have a similar schedule and it helps because I don't feel pressured to respond every time a notification pops up--as long as I respond regularly, those I work with won't feel like I am ignoring their emails. Also, if you have your emails linked to your phone and have notifications turned on, turn them off. There's no reason for email notifications to be on one's phone, imo.",
