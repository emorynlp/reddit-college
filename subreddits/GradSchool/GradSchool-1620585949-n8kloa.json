A brief note on hope.", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just turned in my final assignment as a doctoral candidate in psychology. I will be completing my APA internship this year and hopefully defending my dissertation before June. I hope this does not seem like a humblebrag, as that is **NOT** my intention with this post. \n\nNow for the hope for those who feel like they can't make it.\n\nFirst off, ***you can.*** I wanted to share that I am someone that struggled academically. I started off at community college, did very well but always had to work \"much harder\" than the other students. For example, if someone told me they were studying for 5 days before an exam, I knew I needed to study for at least a week or two. For my bachelor's degree, I did fairly well but still made the occasional B-/C+ in courses related to statistics and research methods, which killed any hope I had of being a researcher. I was able to get into a master's program, but it was grueling. I did not believe I would pass some of my classes but I still never gave up. I found new study techniques and emotional support to offset the exhaustion and fear of failure. My dream has always been to be a doctor of some sort, but I felt like I was not intelligent enough to make it. My master's GPA was 3.63, compared to my classmates who had 4.0's and were thriving. I still wanted to pursue a doctorate but I was terrified of rejection and confirming my greatest fear: I am stupid or an imposter. Nevertheless, I was encouraged by a faculty member to apply to a few programs, and to my shock, got interviews at great programs.\n\nFast forward to today, I passed my doctoral comp exams with honors, have published a paper and poster presentation, and landed my dream internship (I'm studying to become a clinical psychologist). I know it is difficult and this may seem like fluff to some, but for those who have felt like me, please just keep going. It is possible to make it when you don't think you can.", "author": "Btrad92", "created": 1620585949, "retrieved": 1632953831, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 409, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gxl8pbs": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n8kloa/done_with_classes_forever_a_brief_note_on_hope/gxl8pbs/", "text": "Thanks for posting this.
