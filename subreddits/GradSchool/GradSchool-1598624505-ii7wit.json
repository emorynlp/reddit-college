There is no reason why you would ever need to work 80 hours; that just means your lab is short staffed and opting to abuse you rather than hiring more hands to get that work done in a 40 hour week. If you are working 80 hours before some writing submission, take a step back and ask why you are working in desperation at the last minute. Most likely, it's from spending too much of your time at the bench when you should have been exchanging that same time for writing time, rather than sacrificing your free time for writing time and working the same hours at the bench. \n\nThe sad part is a lot of people in these sorts of labs that love to wring students and post docs dry have developed massive Stockholm syndrome and don't see this as an issue. I've seen people sell their soul to the devil to spend 5 sleepless years on a single Cell paper. Not worth it. \n\nTreat it like a full time job and not like more undergrad.
