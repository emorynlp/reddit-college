  "title:": "I refuse to allow grad school to take over my life",
  "text": "I\u2019ve recently started the second year of my PhD program. Since March I\u2019ve finished classes, formulated, wrote, and defended my thesis proposal, and took more classes. I spent most of that time alone in my room researching and allowing my physical and mental health to take a backseat because \u201cthat\u2019s what all grad students do.\u201d\n\nBut I realized that\u2019s not sustainable and I\u2019m SO TIRED of this toxic narrative that grad students can\u2019t have lives because we\u2019re supposed to dedicate them to our thesis work. \n\nSo I\u2019ve resolved to make time for my old hobbies. Three times each week I will go do something I absolutely love that has been on the back burner for seven years because I\u2019d convinced myself I couldn\u2019t do that and school simultaneously. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m being naively optimistic, but we have to break the cycle of abusing grad students the way we do. We shouldn\u2019t have to lose these good years because we\u2019re working so hard that we can\u2019t enjoy anything. I also believe that not making time for our favorite things now, will lead to not making time for them in the future.",

      "text": "When I first got into my program, the program advisor told us to basically forget we have a life. She scared us saying how we\u2019d lose friends along the way who wouldn\u2019t understand our busy lives, and how we basically should wake up and start working then stop working and go to bed. I was like \u201chell no\u201d and I designated times to give myself breaks and do stuff I enjoy. I\u2019m only in my second year, now with a research advisor and I\u2019ve yet to pull all nighters or damage my mental health. My research advisor actually supports us having healthy lives and healthy minds so I don\u2019t feel the \u201cPhD mentality\u201d.",

      "text": "Can I ask where you heard that requirement/who told you you have to let your mental and physical health deteriorate? Maybe my department is unique and I\u2019m just lucky, but our advisors actively tell us to take time off and take care of ourselves. Sure, there are crunch times when we are approaching a deadline, but then my advisor will actually get mad at me if I don\u2019t take a few days off after meeting that deadline. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of 1st and some 2nd years tend to feel this insane pressure to be working 24/7, and free time is just glutinous. However, when I ask them where that pressure is coming from, it\u2019s almost always from within and not from the faculty. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s definitely never coming from the department, but it\u2019s something to question and reflect on. It may also be worth bringing it up with your advisor or mentor if you feel comfortable doing so.",

I feel very fortunate that my advisor is very accommodating and doesn\u2019t pressure us to work insane hours. \n\nBut I do think that if we don\u2019t have priorities outside of grad school, it\u2019s very easy for it to take over our lives. I believe it\u2019s a decision we all have to make and a lifestyle we need to actively maintain.",

Despite these basic facts, we pretend as if the more we work, the better things will be. But the opposite is true - working just enough yields the best results.

      "text": "After working for a year between undergrad and grad school, the veil of being overworked and underpaid was lifted permanently for me.I don't respond to emails before 9 or after 5, full stop. I fall off the face of the earth on friday and appear again on monday. I take time off, and set autoreplies. I feel no guilt about this when people occasionally comment how I'm never around after 5 or never work over the weekend, because the school is providing me stipend for full time employment, not infinity time slavery. \n\nThat line that Deans just love to use, where they go 'sometimes you work 20 hours a week and sometimes 80' is completely toxic. There is no reason why you would ever need to work 80 hours; that just means your lab is short staffed and opting to abuse you rather than hiring more hands to get that work done in a 40 hour week. If you are working 80 hours before some writing submission, take a step back and ask why you are working in desperation at the last minute. Most likely, it's from spending too much of your time at the bench when you should have been exchanging that same time for writing time, rather than sacrificing your free time for writing time and working the same hours at the bench. \n\nThe sad part is a lot of people in these sorts of labs that love to wring students and post docs dry have developed massive Stockholm syndrome and don't see this as an issue. I've seen people sell their soul to the devil to spend 5 sleepless years on a single Cell paper. Not worth it. \n\nTreat it like a full time job and not like more undergrad. Put your foot down firmly, and don't feel bad about it. You will be happier and far more efficient and productive as a result.",

My supervisor (mostly jokingly) told me that I would need to not have any kind of social life for the next while (I was just in the process of dramatically changing my thesis topic). But I proceeded to throw myself into a number of hobbies: lifting, boxing, piano, composing. I even met and married my wife during the first draft writing stage. This summer, I completed my degree in six years which for my department is pretty much the average.\n\nEveryone works differently, but I found that I was a thousand times more productive in my writing when I had other things to look forward to. My own personal rule was that I never worked on my thesis past 4 pm, and I generally only wrote for about three straight hours a day. I think by deliberately making sure that I didn't sacrifice my hobbies and social life on the altar of the PhD, I also managed to avoid the usual grad student bitterness (which I felt more before making this resolution).",

              "text": "I am in my fourth year of grad school and have had a lot of success with keeping an 8-5 schedule during the week, a half day on Saturday as needed (~8-12), and Sunday off. Courses still use brain energy that is difficult to bounce back from, and that is part of your job as a student, so I include that in your hours. If you take good notes and are engaged, you are doing important work. I'm not sure your field (I'm in the humanities), so YMMV, but I try to do my most brain-forward tasks in the morning (writing, difficult reading, designing projects, etc.) and the less difficult tasks in the afternoon (grading, responding to student emails, outlining a teaching section, doing the reading for the class I'm TAing, etc.). Your TAship should only take up the number of hours you are hired for--at many universities this is 20 hours/week--so roughly 3 hours a day. This leaves 5-6 hours to dedicate to your work. If you actually work those hours I think it is plenty of time. I use methods like the Pomodoro technique, time blocking, and task lists to help me stay on track and make sure that I am prioritizing what I need to do. I recommend looking to online resources/podcasts geared toward self-employed people because much of your academic work is self-driven and they have a lot of tips that are applicable to our day-to-day lives. Academia is behind with respect to understanding true productivity and not just living the job. Honestly you will feel a lot happier and healthier and be able to successfully work during those \"work\" hours if you have a little time off each day, get adequate sleep, and try to take a full day off each week. Grad school is not unlike undergrad in that its still a big pissing contest of who is most stressed/most sleep deprived and the biggest advice I can give is to NOT FALL VICTIM TO IT. There will be weeks you need to work more (like any job), but having balance will allow you to rise to the occasion when that does happen. Best of luck!",

              "text": "Yeah- the numbers for hours get tricky. I\u2019ve been meaning to come back to reply about hours etc. but let\u2019s face an unfortunate set of facts or at least experiences.  Most programs hire you as a 50% RA and then the rest of the time is classes. (PhD or Thesis MS)  That technically means 20 hours a week on research, 20 hours on classes. (At least what OSHA and the employment office would recognize.). The reality of this is that most profs expect 40 hours a week of research, and it\u2019s your job to deal with the 20 hours a week of classes and homework. Never mind some appointments for lab TA\u2019s are 67% appointments and they expect both classes and research to continue. :shrug:  That\u2019s nearly impossible. Unless of course you do your best to be more effective.\n\nBy effectiveness I mean how we deal with how we work.  I say \u201ctreat it like a job\u201d because most paying jobs wouldn\u2019t let you surf between tasks, chill with friends for 2 hrs at lunch or similar.  So if one can be \u201con\u201d for those 8am-5pm hours, fully there, I suspect that you\u2019ll get a lot more done than someone who gives all their hours to the job/classes.  I usually told the incoming grads that most grads mosey into the office around noon and stay until 6/7pm and then may come back for a few hours at night.  Just by getting in at 8am like a normal job, you\u2019ll make a few waves and your Prof/Profs will notice your decision to be there and be working.  That goes a very long way with both impressions and work. \n\nBeing effective and efficient is difficult if you are currently struggling with Imposter Syndrome as well as Procastination/time/resource management issues.  It\u2019s too bad they don\u2019t teach a course in this type of stuff or have mentors who only focus on this for students. (Some day I\u2019ll have to propose my two-Prof model for upper Ed in another post.)\n\nI strongly recommend Neil Fiore\u2019s \u201cThe Now Habit\u201d as well as David Allen\u2019s \u201cGetting Things Done\u201d. (The first is more important.). Fiore\u2019s book is very interesting- he was a Prof I think in Cali- has PhD psychology students who to a T all procrastinated even though they knew about procrastination and psychology. Lol. So he wrote a book. It\u2019s fantastic. It won\u2019t solve it completely, but it opens your eyes to catch the reasons for that behavior and give you pointers on how to stop it. \n\nBut I agree- full time job and full time student isn\u2019t going to work well. One of those things will fail.",

First prof would chuckle with other profs about how he forces his students in to group meetings on Saturday morning at 10am. As if that was an accomplishment.  All it told me is he was inefficient with his management of his resources and thought that doing this would make us work more. Joke was on him- we treated it as if we had the right to reverse that during the mornings or afternoons during the week.  Certainly it didn\u2019t motivate us in the least.\n\nI\u2019ll add he was a very well respected business manager/ ran major corporation divisions and had numerous world-wide patents that are still critical to this day in his field. So, it was hard for anyone to stand up and say: \u201chey man- your old school management techniques that breed contempt, in-fighting, and frustration isn\u2019t working.\u201d  I\u2019m sure he would just shrug and chuckle.
