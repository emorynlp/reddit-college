Help.", "text": "Has the pandemic destroyed anyone else's ability to concentrate to a concerning degree? I had attention problems even before but now it's so bad I'm actually afraid part of my brain is broken and my ability to focus won't return post-pandemic.\n\nI'm still WFH and reading papers is like pulling out teeth. I've been reading the same paper which I have to present at a journal club for the last two days (I finished it yesterday and managed to take notes while reading, but didn't process it at a high enough level, I feel, which is why I'm trying to read it more carefully today). I don't have outside distractions, just me at my desk on my work laptop, but my brain is full of a million unrelated thoughts, like having 10 TVs all playing a different channel at once.\n\nI'm getting more and more frustrated because I want to read this paper! I want to be productive, the paper itself is interesting, and I've removed all outside distractions. But my brain still refuses to process. I can't hold the information in my head for long (hence the need for detailed note-taking). It seems to just float away like air.\n\nPomodoro isn't effective. I've tried it at progressively shorter intervals but literally after reading 2 or 3 sentences my brain will go \"Ooh shiny!\" at a thought drifting through my head, I'll chase the rabbit down the hole, and 15 mins later realize I've been staring into space. Then I'll return to the paper, re-read the same sentences because I didn't process them, and the same thing will happen. The thoughts range from an interesting article I read that morning, memories from years ago, a cool concept from a class I took in undergrad, a song on the radio...except they all run into each other and I can't even hold onto one of them for long before I flit onto the next one. I don't respond to positive incentives, either, since I know I could just give myself the reward anyway even if I haven't done the thing.\n\nThe attention issues have gotten worse since I started staying home in March. There are still some things I can focus on; I do bioinformatics, and am much more productive when I'm coding than reading. But since everyone's been home, there isn't any new data to work on anyway, and any old data from the backlog goes to the lab's computational biologist first. And what I really need to be doing is reading because I have a written qual in the form of an F31 due at the end of the year. I can still read general news articles/features (the longform kind The New Yorker or Atlantic put out), though that also takes effort.\n\nI'm really freaked out by this and don't know what to do. I've always had focus problems, but they've never been this severe, though now I wonder if external structures just masked them in the past (I've always joked that I need meticulous external organization because of how disorganized my actual brain is). I've thought about whether this may be undiagnosed ADHD, especially since 3 of 4 of my immediate family members have the inattentive variant. But I was apparently a VERY organized and well-behaved child, especially in contrast to my brothers, whose ADHD was very obvious. So I don't know.\n\nThis is making me wonder whether I really feel passionate about my field and whether I can really succeed in it. I figure, if I just cared enough I'd be able to focus on this, right? And the constant effort yielding minimal results is just worsening my (diagnosed and pre-pandemic) depression and anxiety and making me feel like I don't deserve to be at my school. I've talked to my PI about feeling unproductive, and he was very supportive and reassured me he wasn't expecting anyone to perform like their pre-pandemic self, and that he had no issues with the quality/quantity of my work beforehand. But I didn't tell him how bad it is, and I'm afraid my ability to work is going to continue to deteriorate until it becomes noticeable even to him.", "author": "neurosock", "created": 1596842427, "retrieved": 1632845940, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 351, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g0tsnal": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/i5ogue/my_attention_span_is_gone_help/g0tsnal/", "text": "This is not uncommon at all.
