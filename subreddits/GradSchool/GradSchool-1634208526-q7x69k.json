  "text": "Im preparing my proposal defence presentation and my supervisor is insisting I include atleast 5-6 papers in literature review. \n\n\nI have a confusion on what things should I include in a presentation from a paper.  Should i just add what this paper did and show their results or should I also add their method and some mathematical notations?",

      "text": "Some form of a literature review is necessary in any academic writing. It sets the stage for your work by introducing important concepts, discussing how those concepts have been evaluated within your field, identifying knowledge gaps, and justifying the relevance of the topic. Review papers are essentially one big lit review. Introductions to peer-reviewed papers are generally a type of lit review. \n\nWhat you include from a paper depends. What is it about that paper that is relevant to your work? Often, it is a specific finding or interpretation of their results. Sometimes it's a methodology they employed. \n\nI'd recommend just being honest with your advisor. Tell them you need more guidance. Discuss what they expect from a lit review. This is exactly the job of an advisor. Also, ask your more senior peers for examples. I'm currently writing my dissertation proposal and I have 9 proposals from more senior grads in my department as examples. \n\nI'll also add that it's hard to image writing or presenting a thesis proposal with only 5-6 papers cited in the lit review section. I mean, your advisor did say at least 5-6, and maybe it varies by field (I'm STEM), but most \"References\" sections to thesis proposals that I see go on for pages and pages.",
