  "text": "Context: I am an undergraduate physics student\n\nThe reason why I am asking, is because the nanotechnology institute has very high level machinery and I won't be allowed to use them in any way. The only thing I will be taught is the concept behind these machines. No tasks at all.\n\nMeanwhile the institute that runs the rusty particle accelerator will give me many tasks to do and I will be doing actual work rather than listen to someone explain things to me.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I want to go into gradschool and cares a lot about what will sound better in my CV.\n\nMany thanks.",

Here it's not at all uncommon for undergrads to do a little bit of work in the nanotech institute while working with a relevant research group. I also think you'd be surprised at how many particle accelerator people eventually end up doing nanotech work to make CMOS components, thin film characterization, etc. \n\nAlso, what school is this? There are only so many with a great nanotech program and a particle accelerator - if it's an Ivy in upstate NY, DM me.",

The skills you will learn and equipment you will be exposed to will far more relevant to the economy of the future and might help you get a job down the line. My suggestion is to get more information about the nanotechnology research you would be doing and exposed to.",

      "text": "Is this for a summer internship?\n\nIt's not at all uncommon to have undergrads working in university cleanrooms. Sure the tools are expensive but much of the actual work is tedious and repetitive. You won't be using an EBL but you could do basic substrate and glassware cleaning, do a parameter sweep on some common tools, etc. If they won't give you lab experience, I'd say pass on it and do the particle accelerator. \n\nHands on experience is hugely valuable. You can always read up or take courses (credit or non-credit) on nanofab, so just being taught concepts as an undergrad doesn't sound super useful.",

(e.g. do one co-op one place and one co-op at the other, in different semesters)\n\nThe particle accelerator will give you hands-on experience with electronics and electrical circuitry to an extent as well as give you insight into the maintenance issues older facilities deal with. But the nano is newer and more broadly applicable, as others elsethread have pointed out.",
