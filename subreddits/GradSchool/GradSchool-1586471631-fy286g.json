I know this paper is going to get done. The studies were crap but my advisor and committee and I all want to just see it defended so we can move on to the next thing. I just want to be DONE. But any time I start writing after 5 minutes I want to beat my head against the desk.\n\nThe only thing keeping me going is thinking about how I can finally relax and play animal crossing when I'm done. How did such a lazy sloth like myself even get in to grad school in the first place?? Pray for me, friends.\n\nRant over, thanks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the advice and words of support, you guys are the best :) We can get through this!", "author": "BrainlessPhD", "created": 1586471631, "retrieved": 1632845807, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 411, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fn0aa3c": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fy286g/im_so_close_to_finishing_this_stupid_dissertation/fn0aa3c/", "text": "Go stare at a wall.

I did nothing for 3 weeks. Lost all desire. With corona happening...all lost sight of all my long term goals. Didn't see the point in something trivial as a degree. I'm back on track with the right mindset but I no I'll be delivering an inferior product. I don't think it will be to the point of a serious detriment but man am I cutting it close now. What an absurd way to finish so much work ive done for the last three years. My biggest motivation is not wanting to embarrass my SO and have to imagine a scenario where she cant be proud of me...or mg family who thinks I'm about to have a masters. The terrifying fear of having to admit to them I failed because I just lost sight of my goals temporarily made me sick to my stomach. So I'm back on track and trying to rush like a mad man. But today it took me six hours to right 1 page!  Anyways. May is almost here. The finish line is insight. Try to push through. I am struggling to.
