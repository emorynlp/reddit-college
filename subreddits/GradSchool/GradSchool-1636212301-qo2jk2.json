  "text": "Hey all, \n\nI just got a grade back for a statistics class that I'm in, and I haven't gotten anything less than an A all semester until now. I got a B, and my professor said that one of my interpretations of a statistical model was \"concerning.\" I had since reviewed the assignment/material and I think I have a better grasp on it now, but my confidence in myself is still a bit shaken. My personal life has been rough lately, too; my dog has late-stage cancer and we're going to be forced to make a very difficult decision soon. I also had an injury on the day that I did the assignment, and I admittedly did not do my usual thorough work because I was at an urgent care facility for a few hours. \n\nMaybe I just needed to vent to people who understand. How do you keep up your work on assignments when there's a lot happening in your personal life?",

In what ways are you trying to make the world and yourself better through this experience? Chances are, your B does not negatively impact any of those deeper aspirations.

      "text": "That kind of feedback from your professor is out of line, if you ask me. \"Concerning\"? You're a STUDENT. If his students are off on a concept, that can just as easily be his fault as it is yours, but more importantly, what is there to be \"concerned\" about? You're doing school work that has no impact on lives. This is where we mess around with concepts and straighten things out and LEARN. Hard to see what's \"concerning\" about that at all!\n\nYou are probably a perfectionist if a B bothers you THIS much. Let those of us looking at this from a neutral, non-perfectionist standpoint remind you how little a single B matters. I have a class right now that's so tough, I'd be THRILLED to walk away from it with a B. Seriously, you're going to be fine, you survived all of grade school, all of high school, all of undergrad, and even when you started grad school, you were STILL getting As! I mean, my God, I think you've done more than enough to prove to the world that you've got what it takes to survive this program.\n\nBelieve in yourself! It's not just a suggestion, it is NECESSARY. (BTW I credit that one to my therapist, and it turns out she was right. Believing in yourself is NECESSARY.)",

I\u2019ve had professors in the past tell me I was wasting time if I was trying to get As in every class.",

      "text": ">How do you keep up your work on assignments when there's a lot happening in your personal life?\n\nKeeping up doesn't mean straight A's, especially at the PhD level. As long as you maintain a B+ average (or whatever you need to stay in the program), you're doing just fine. I've even heard that you should aim for a B+ average, because with straight A's, you might be over-prioritizing classwork at the expense of research and work-life balance. I'm a perfectionist too, and I know how even a 'B' can sting. But try to have compassion for yourself and remember that being a student is only one piece of your life, and it's not the most important piece. If getting a few B's means having precious time with your dog, preserving your mental health, or even just making more progress on research work, it's probably a worthwhile exchange.",
