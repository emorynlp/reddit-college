I passed fine. If you want DM me and I will send mine to you!\n\nWhat helped me is sit down with a friend and describe my research (I already started mine as we had funding). He stopped me when he wanted more to really understand it. That helped me to notice what I completely thought was a given. Your defense is not only for your advisors, but for the entire department: don\u2019t forget the basics. Also be clear about why your research is needed/important, explain why you have your hypotheses, and be clear about your methods (why those methods? Who used them before? How will it help you answer your questions?). Use your time smartly, but leave some room at the end - we tend to be quickly at presenting when we\u2019re alone, but we need to slow down a bit in the presentation for everyone to follow. Use pictures when you can (methods, background, etc. are good places to use more images than text). Make short bullet points, no full sentences if possible, and do talk about each bullet point. Don\u2019t just put it down so you don\u2019t have to talk about it. People have a hard time reading and listening at the same time - work with that.\n\nEdit: present it to your friends! See if some in your department want to present and give feedback to each other.", "author": "Federwolf", "created": 1632764388, "upvotes": 1}}}
