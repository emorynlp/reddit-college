  "text": "I'm an undergraduate (civil, water resources) stuck between two paths. I'm new to this scene and I was wondering if this scenario is normal and something to take a chance on, or to evaluate other options.\n\nBasically today I talked to my potential PI about his lab and the type of research I want to accomplish. I heavily respect him, we get along great, but after that conversation I'm concerned about the program requirements. Particularly the fact that:\n\na) I'll have to TA\n\nb) It's expected that students earn a PhD. I'm fiercely set on earning only a masters, because a PhD would not help me achieve what I want from my career. \n\nMy goal after graduate school is to enter industry. The two points above, my research into the grad school experience, and the nightmare stories from this sub, are making me question whether this is the right track for me.\n\nIs the TA position common amongst every grad student? If it is, then I'll just suck it up, but I'd rather not get shoehorned into it. Note: the other professors in my program either can't take on another student, or don't conduct the kind of research I'm specialized in, so I don't have any other options beside this professor, or working in industry full-time and pursing a part-time degree on the side.",

      "text": "TA position is a very common way of getting funding in grad school. The alternative if you're still funded is generally to be a research assistant \nwhich isn't uncommon if there's a lot of money within what your working in. I've actually really enjoyed TAing while getting my masters but it definetly does take up a fair amount of time.",

              "text": "It'll highly depend on your school and your department. I'd recommend reaching out to someone in your future department at this potential school. I'm a lab TA for an intro course (intro geology lab).  I teach lab, grade (lab), have office hours, and there is a weekly meeting. We're also required to attend an hour long seminar each week (they invite guest speakers and forcing TAs to attend means there is always a respectable amount of students attending.)   \nThey thankfully make it a pretty easy gig at my school which I'm super happy about. (We're paid for 20 hrs a week and some semesters/weeks it is that much but others it's more like 8-15 hrs). There's a lot of us TAing for the same course so we have 1 hour long weekly meeting with our supervisors and one TA is in charge of making and going over slides for the next week of labs. We're lucky and we're 2 TAs per class. My peer TA and I teach one 3 hour lab a week, and swap who's in charge of the lab, mainly who lectures for about 30 min during that lab. (In our case if it's your first semester you're expected to teach less labs and often again during your last semester). We'll edit slides for that but thankfully don't need to make them from scratch as it's an old course and there's a lot of TAs. We pick what exercises they do out of a lab book but don't need to make any exercises ourselves. We also swap who is grading labs. I have 3 hours of office hours a week. These take place at a learning center on campus, so I'll also get students with homework questions from their lecture. I'm also assigned to a lecture class where I occasionally need to proctor exams and/or help with in class assignments, that takes up about 10 hours a semester.  \nI really like the added strucutre it adds and I like my co-workers. I like working with undergrad students as well. It pays enough that I can cover all my (cheap) living expenses and I would struggle to find a part time job that fits into my schedule as nicely. It also really does make you remeber intro content better. Although it's not an especially fancy job it is one that is quite easy to talk about in job interviews.",
