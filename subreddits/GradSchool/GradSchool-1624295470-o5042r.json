Thank you! I wanted to write an update for how things have gone since.\n\nI spoke with my university's graduate support advisor and he was fantastic. He walked me through the various options available to me as a response. While my gut feeling about the correct course of action remained the same, it was great to get a better sense of what options and resources are available to me and other members of the trans community. This led to a different tack, which I'll get to in a moment.\n\nSo, I decided that I was going to email my supervisor and lay things out firmly and clearly, asking him to use the correct pronouns in the future. He and I have had a decent camaraderie since even before I came here, but I knew there was so much on the line if I pushed back and he doubled down. I felt a block about actually writing the email.\n\nThen, I attended an online conference and got a boost of confidence about my thesis (a professor I admire used similar sources to construct a parallel argument to one of my chapters). I sat down and wrote about that to my supervisor and then threw in a few lines about using my pronouns.\n\nA day later he wrote back, apologising for misgendering me and assuring me he won't do it again, and then went into thesis talk around this conference. I'm so relieved! I am so glad I wrote about it, and that my supervisor is understanding and supportive. While I don't think I'll be in a traditional TT academic career, it is great to know that path isn't closed to me by a hostile PhD supervisor.\n\nOtherwise, however, things have taken an interesting turn. When the support advisor gave me the rundown of my university's 'Gender Identity and Gender Support Policy' (which itself comes from a legal act!), I asked how their own Academic Registry (AR) still only supports M or F in its database. He didn't believe me until I showed him the screenshots of my requests to AR to fix my student record. The university's own gender support policy explicitly includes non-binary people! I had previously spoken about the limitations of AR's gender scheme to various groups on campus and everyone goes 'that's unfair!', but now we can say, 'that's illegal!'\n\nI'm not sure what the next step(s) will be. The support advisor says he's meeting with AR to fix this, but I've been trying for years now and don't have confidence in the process. I don't want to kick up a fuss for its own sake, but I'm much older than most students and I'd rather deal with the harassment and nay-saying myself in order to clear the way for teenagers to have a supportive environment at their university.
