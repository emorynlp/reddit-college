  "title:": "Letter of Rec \u201cwhat do you want me to write\u201d",
  "text": "I had a zoom meeting with an old professor to discuss my letter of rec. I did research in her lab over the summer. I emailed her and she said she would agree to write me one and we met schedule an online meeting. \n\nWhen she asked me what do you want me to write on the letter. I was caught off guard. I should have mentioned our interactions together and about the research we did. But the research didn\u2019t have anything to do with my future plans career wise. I had asked her bc I know schools are impressed when someone has research experience. \n\nI feel embarrassed because I mentioned on what I have done to prepare me for the field - my passions my upbringing etc. (non research related)\n\nShe continued asking me about the research I did, what courses I took prior to the research, the amount of presentations, the oral presentations and so on. And I responded with one word answers. \n\nIf I can go back I would discuss more about our interactions but tbh. I felt as though it wasn\u2019t all that impressive. I did what I was told. I asked questions when I was unsure about something. When I was done with the research over the summer she said she would write me a letter of recommendation and that was that. Four years later and I figured I\u2019d ask her. \n\nBut now I feel so embarrassed and want to dig myself in a hole. I didn\u2019t summarize my research for her convenience. She said she\u2019s going to have to read my paper to refresh her memory.\n\nHave this every happened to you? Wouldn\u2019t professors likely just say they don\u2019t think they have enough info to write a good one? Am I just overthinking?",

      "text": "Professors go through a LOT of students and write a LOT of letters. Even for students they love, they usually need refreshers and guidance because they want their letter to line up with your goals and your presentation of yourself.\n\nI recently had to request letters and for each I provided my CV, an example cover letter, and a bulleted list of priorities in describing my strengths/experiences. These are professors I\u2019ve worked closely with for nearly 5 years (and I still am) and it was still helpful to have as many materials and examples as possible",

      "text": "It\u2019s been 4 years, she needs a reminder of what you did. Send her an email thanking her for meeting/agreeing to write. Summarize what you worked on-did that become part of a larger project etc. , give a brief description of your goals and traits you think help get you there. Provide a copy of your cv/resume. Passion is great and gets mentioned here a lot, but results matter. I am passionate about more than one thing I am not qualified to be an expert in. Ex. My interest in underwater basket weaving was sparked after attending a demonstration in undergraduate by world renowned Basket B. Weaved. Following that I learned more through insert path here. I identified an opportunity to explore research in letter writers lab where I learned-transferable skills list[don\u2019t forget soft skills like time management, working as a group etc]. This paints a much better description of your background and highlights things like drive, results oriented behavior, self directed learning etc. ( what passion looks like in action).",

          "text": "I think that\u2019s the problem. I sent her a draft of things I did outside of my interactions with her. And when we met online, I did the same. Then we had to ask specific questions about our interactions and I feel embarrassed. Like I didn\u2019t have any positives about what we did together. Now I feel like it\u2019s too late to email her about our interactions together as a refresher. Especially since she said she\u2019d email me if she needs anything else",

I was just embarrassed that when she asked me what she should right I didn\u2019t touch on anything between our interactions or how intrigued I was with our research results. But that was only because our research does not relate with what I will be doing in grad school. Sigh - I wished professors just showed us what they wrote.",

              "text": ">I wished professors just showed us what they wrote.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, the reason you waive the right to see the letters is so that graduate school admissions know for sure that the letter was written with complete candor. If they didn't, then the letters couldn't carry much weight.\n\nBest just to realize that you can't affect what those letters say, even if you do get to see them. So try to put the anxiety aside. Focus on things you do have control over.",

She was taking notes during our meeting and ended it with saying that she will email me if she needs some additional assistance. I don\u2019t want to come off like I don\u2019t trust the notes that she\u2019s already written. Ya know? I am just afraid she won\u2019t write me a strong one. Feel like there\u2019s no way to ask if she will or won\u2019t at this point",
