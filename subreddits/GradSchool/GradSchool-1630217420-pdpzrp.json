(Btw I think every lab should have this kind of thing).\n\nI started my program (Chemistry) during the pandemic and am finishing up my first year. I tried so hard during my first year here doing research, TA, and taking classes at the same time for 9 months. The research I\u2019m doing was totally new to me and I had to learn everything from the beginning. I also learned to code and took several relevant data science courses because I thought it would benefit me later.\n\nLast year was also brutal to me not only with covid, I lost weight, stressed out so much, broke up with my boyfriend, my grandpa passed away, and had a few serious dental procedures due to a car accident several years ago. I never complained to my advisor about my life except the dental part since it affects my lab schedule before because I don\u2019t like using them as excuses.\n\nDuring the annual evaluation, my advisor told me that \u2014 I am the most productive first year she has ever had \u2014 my presentations, reports are the most professional and beautiful ones she has ever seen \u2014 she loves how much I have grown since the first time she met me \u2014 and she believes I will do great in my PhD time.\n\nThose words just mean so much to me after all the efforts I put in and all the burdens I have been through. I know the hardest part has yet to come but I\u2019m thankful to have my advisor as a great mentor and supporter. I hope y\u2019all the best in your journey.", "author": "snorlaxkg", "created": 1630217420, "retrieved": 1632846489, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hauvif7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pdpzrp/just_talked_with_my_pi_and_now_im_feeling_really/hauvif7/", "text": "Wow, that must have been so great to hear!
