  "text": "I'm in a PsyD program, but my MS degree did not require a thesis, I did a culminating exam and case evaluation instead.\n\nFor my infant and child psych class, I am working on a lit review of preemies and attachment style.  I've written papers, of course, but a lit. review is different.  I have ~20 sources right now, but how do I know when to stop?  Do I go back to the year 1600?\n\nAlso, I feel like this is taking me a very, very long time.  Do lit reviews take hours to read through things you don't end up using?  I am using Zotero and Research Rabbit, which helps.  I also know to read the Abstract, Intro, and Conclusion mostly.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I\u2019m also in a PsyD, and my method after collecting potential sources in Zotero is to do an annotated bib first. I usually spend up to half an hour per article taking notes and writing up a blurb that I can use to identify the usefulness of the piece in the broader context of my other sources. Once I use that info to outline my paper, I sometimes re-skim them or read them more closely, but I don\u2019t spend a ton of time unless it\u2019s something I have zero knowledge of. \n\nI stop looking for sources when I have a solid understanding of an issue\u2019s definition, historical and sociopolitical context, contemporary usage or state of research, any recent controversies, most useful instruments of measurement, and the broader consensus on future directions. And any special considerations for my lit review\u2019s specific angle, of course. \n\nFor me, the most time-consuming part is wrapping my mind around methods and assessing whether the instruments were appropriately selected. Writing lit reviews is pretty formulaic once you get the hang of it.",

      "text": "Hi! PhD student and writing consultant here.\n\nI find it really helpful to set inclusion / exclusion criteria for myself when I'm writing papers. Typically literature reviews focus on empirical articles - you might use book chapters if you're talking theory, but the bulk should be journal articles. When I am looking for literature I select: peer reviewed journal articles, published in the last 10 years (this depends on your topic and your professor, many require you look at recent literature but if your topic is very narrow you might extend back a few years), and then other \"criteria\" based on my topic. For you this might mean excluding anything that doesn't focus on preemies, some search engines will filter those out for you with age criteria that you can select or deselect. Be strict with yourself when you're pulling papers, if it doesn't seem relevant do not download it. \n\nOnce you have some literature in mind read the abstract, sometimes a title is misleading and the abstract will give you the gist of the article. If it isn't relevant, do not include it. The purpose of a literature review is NOT to read every article that has ever been published on a broad topic area. You want to include those studies that are relevant to *your specific* area of interest (this is probably repetitive for you, but I've really had to learn myself to stop downloading and reading through irrelevant articles because they \"seem interesting\").\n\nOnce I have a solid foundation of literature I'll put together a bibliography matrix using excel. I typically include columns for: full citation, in-text citation, purpose, hypotheses, sample (n, and relevant characteristics), design, statistical analyses, results, conclusions, background information and limitations. Once you've read a few foundational pieces you may have all the background you need / find it is repetitive, so you can start really skimming those sections. Skim the methodology for the information that will be relevant to you and stick it into your spreadsheet. Once you go back to actually write it will be SO much easier to skim your spreadsheet and throw it into paragraphs. This is also much faster than reading whole articles and taking notes by hand, or going back to read your highlights down the line.\n\nFrom there I chunk articles into different themes, construct and outline, and start writing.\n\n I usually aim for 3-5 \"themes,\" depending on paper length. If one theme only has one or two articles you'll need to find some more literature. If all of your themes have a handful of articles then you are probably done searching. I know this is probably more information than you wanted lol but I've found that the best way to be speed up the reading and writing process is to be well organized and know exactly what I am looking for. The matrix also helps you get a sense of how comprehensive your literature search was.",
