  "title:": "Thoughts on including advisors in author contributions to paper",
  "text": "My field is in engineering, and I am mostly a theoretician. I have been working under experimentalists getting my Ph.D.. My problem is that I have a NSF-GRFP and I have used it to the extent that I have autonomy in my work. This works great as a theoretician, because I can derive equations and carry out simulations on my own without problem. However, my main PhD advisors are soo bad at math that I can literally witness their eyes gloss over every time I introduce them to something novel that I've devised in the theory.\n\nI'm currently about to publish a main paper in my dissertation, and I am having doubts of weather to mention their lack of help in an 'author contributions' section. I don't want to come off as pompous or give them a bad rap, but I feel like I deserve all of the recognition of the paper for essentially doing everything on my own.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: I want to say something like this:\n\n\"OP derived all equations and code and wrote every section of the manuscript. (PhD advisors) advised, reviewed and edited the manuscript.\"",
