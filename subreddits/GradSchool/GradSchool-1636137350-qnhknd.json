  "title:": "Thoughts on including advisors in author contributions to paper",
  "text": "My field is in engineering, and I am mostly a theoretician. I have been working under experimentalists getting my Ph.D.. My problem is that I have a NSF-GRFP and I have used it to the extent that I have autonomy in my work. This works great as a theoretician, because I can derive equations and carry out simulations on my own without problem. However, my main PhD advisors are soo bad at math that I can literally witness their eyes gloss over every time I introduce them to something novel that I've devised in the theory.\n\nI'm currently about to publish a main paper in my dissertation, and I am having doubts of weather to mention their lack of help in an 'author contributions' section. I don't want to come off as pompous or give them a bad rap, but I feel like I deserve all of the recognition of the paper for essentially doing everything on my own.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: I want to say something like this:\n\n\"OP derived all equations and code and wrote every section of the manuscript. (PhD advisors) advised, reviewed and edited the manuscript.\"",

      "text": "Your solution should be to find more appropriate advisors for your further work, not to make public snide remarks about the ones you have. \n\nThe specific wording you mention---especially the use of \"all\" and \"every section\"---is rather unusual (at least among papers I've read) and bordering on unprofessional. You will get the recognition without the snark. You certainly do *not* want to gain a reputation as someone who is arrogant, uncharitable, and difficult to work with---and especially not leaving the evidence in writing in public view---if you want to continue in academia.\n\nedit: misplaced word",

      "text": "You should be factual and list the exact contributions. There is no need to add your personal opinions. There is ethical obligation to be truthful and factual in the publication. Otherwise, there may be negative consequences in the future.\n\nAll this does not relate to how you might be perceived in the future and so on. Those concerns should not be primary or even necessary in your decision-making. The primary responsibilty is as noted above. You cannot control what others would feel in the future. I disagree that those concerns should cloud your decisions.",

      "text": ">My field is in engineering  \n>  \n>my main PhD advisors are soo bad at math\n\nlol wat?\n\nIf these people have PhD's in Engineering, they are probably not bad at math. It could also be that your explanations are too confusing or your writing too disorganized/incomprehensible that they just trust you know what you're doing. If your advisers legitimately do not understand, that is a problem. Either their expertise and your research interests do not align and you should seek other advisers (as the other commenter suggested), or your writing is very bad (note: bad writing is published all the time). \n\n If people with PhD's are having a difficult time understanding, I think it's unlikely it's because their math skills are not up to par. \n\nI would definitely not add anything remotely close to your suggested note. It does not come across professionally to me and it sounds like you are deliberately minimizing/insulting your advisers whether that is your intent or not. At *most*, you could say something like \"author order is determined by contribution to the manuscript\", but even that is often unnecessary because that is frequently implied in the order of authorship.",
