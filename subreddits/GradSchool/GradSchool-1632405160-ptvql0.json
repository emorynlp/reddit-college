  "text": "I don't have a publication, so I guess I have a resume. \n\nanyway. I got an advice from my school's career center that to shrink my 4-page resume, I can cut out the descriptions of my extracurricular activities but save the descriptions for my research/teaching. is that something to do for grad school apps?",

      "text": "Look at how other professors put together their resumes (you can frequently find these on the faculty page of any department or their own website).  \n\nKey thing here is to highlight important details and get rid of useless information.  Descriptions of extracurricular activities are useless unless there's something unique about them that makes a strong argument **and** will transition to research work.  4 pages is too long.  2 pages is good.  \n\nFor example don't have descriptions for honors/awards.  I'm sure people know what Dean's List is and if there's an award that they're not familiar with, they can always google it up.  Just put award name, month, year. \n\nAlways get it reviewed by someone else before you actually send it.  Something that you might know/think is great might be taken completely differently by another person.",

              "text": "No worries!  You're not an idiot.  I don't think they teach \"how to write an academic resume\" in class so it's perfectly fine to feel underprepared in this.  \n\nI'm not a wet lab person so my advice might not be as useful or accurate, but try Googling examples on how wet lab skills are shown in a resume to get some ideas.  \n\nI put my programming skills and other marketable skills (e.g. languages) under a \"skills\" section on my second page (before the publications section, but not having that then before the language section).  \n\nBy interests do you mean research interests/topics?  Depending on the resume it might be useful and it might not.  For grad school resumes, keep it in but don't have it take up too much room.  I'd put it closer to the front as it's a \"summary\". \n\nVolunteering at a museum is great and you should keep it in.  But only if it adds value to your resume.  What's the purpose behind adding that experience in?  \n\nYou should include academic poster presentations and any other presentations you've done even if you don't have any publications.  Keep them in APA format (again, refer to a professor's CV to see how that's done).",

      "text": "They\u2019re definitely correct. Graduate programs want to see that you\u2019ve done most of your work in the field that you want your PhD in, and don\u2019t care as much about your extracurricular activities if they don\u2019t relate somewhat to your field. You would keep your research/teaching descriptions because those are more relevant. Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions!",
