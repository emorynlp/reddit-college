I'm sure people know what Dean's List is and if there's an award that they're not familiar with, they can always google it up.

Graduate programs want to see that you\u2019ve done most of your work in the field that you want your PhD in, and don\u2019t care as much about your extracurricular activities if they don\u2019t relate somewhat to your field.
