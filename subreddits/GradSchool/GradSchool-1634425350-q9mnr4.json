  "text": "I've been having some problems with motivation lately because it feels like all I'm doing is running batches of code and sending them off to my supervisor.\n\nI'm about halfway through my first year as a PhD student and I'd really hoped it'd be more hands on than this, I want to do more work but it feels like my supervisor is holding it back.\n\nI'm also losing motivation because covid restrictions and the general feel of the office make it a bit unpleasant to work in. \n\nAll in all I'm struggling to keep going and I'm planning to speak to my supervisor about this to see if there's a way for me to get back on track.",

Nowadays practically all I'm doing is writing, whether it's a paper or my qualifying exam proposal or an IRB submission or reviewing a grant, and it sucks when I hear other people in my lab are doing experiments and generating data. Makes me feel unproductive and sometimes I feel like I just end up staring at a screen all day without writing much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think part of the solution is just to try and mix things as much as you can so that you're not constantly doing only one type of work. I'm trying to get some experiments in even though right now it's imperative that I'm writing so that I don't feel like I'm just spinning my wheels.  From what it sounds like for you OP, it seems like once you can get some more hands-on type work, you should feel a bit better.",

I'm just really done with this paper but still have some way to go. I try to work on it every day. If I manage to work even a little bit on it each day I'm happy, even though I know that with motivation I can finish my tasks much quicker. In the end it comes down to discipline, because motivation isn't enough.",

I've been in a similar situation with COVID - I was stuck 10,000 miles away, without any great contact with my uni, and had little to do a lot of the time. Some of the things I worked on were:\n\n1. Documentation. Sounds boring, and kinda is, but one day you'll need to know what you did and you'll appreciate it being in a searchable PDF. I write my notes out as though I were writing a guide for a future PhD student.\n\n2. Analysis scripts. If you're producing data then you'll eventually need to analyse it. You can write some scripts to read the kinds of files you need and to do the basic operations. You can even do this with junk/fake data, so long as it's in the right format.\n\n3. Prepare for 1st year review / quals / whatever review you have. Even if it's just downloading the template into Overleaf and sticking some basic info in, it's time well-spent. You can even do this with your thesis template! \n\n4. Start a side project. My main simulation was taking ages to get working so I started working part time on a smaller, easier simulation. Didn't end up going anywhere, but I had fun and learnt a lot.",

I've given up on having a passion for anything. Tbh the thought of getting out of this hellhole Republican state I live in is the only thing that helps me get through the day. I think about being somewhere better, where I'm not a prisoner in my own house and where people actually respect each other, and how maybe I could be somewhere like that one day, wherever that is.
