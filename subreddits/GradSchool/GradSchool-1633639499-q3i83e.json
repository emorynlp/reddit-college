  "text": "Hello! I work full-time, 40+ hours per week. I am in my first semester of grad school in an online program. I love my job and I love the program I'm in. I'm genuinely excited to go to work AND look forward to my school work.\n\nProblem - I have started getting headaches, feeling nauseated, and I'm exhausted every afternoon by 3 or 4 pm for the past two weeks. I'm wondering if it could be from staring at a computer screen for so many hours (all day and then most of the evening until bed) and/or not enough breaks and/or stress trying to fit everything in. My eye has started twitching every few days which has never happened. \n\nAlso, I have ADHD and an anxiety disorder so that probably doesn't help. ADHD means I also hyperfocus and will forget breaks but that I have trouble with feeling overwhelmed and remember what I'm supposed to be doing when. Each day feels like a tornado.\n\nAnyone else have physical symptoms like this and any recommendations?",

      "text": "I think a lot of us have experienced things like this before, and to be honest, there could be a several variables that are hard to isolate that are contributing to the way you're feeling. The helpful clues you do have though are a) consistent symptoms at b) consistent times of the day. \n\nI would suspect that there is something biorhythmic going on here. In which case, you should consider your sleeping, eating, exercise, etc. habits. What has habitually changed? Are you eating worse foods than before consistently? Has your sleep cycle been completely disrupted and are you getting enough of it? Are your bowel movements regular? Have you recently switched medications? Are you exercising/changed the time of day or type of activity you do? Are you drinking enough water early enough in the day? \n\nAnother thing I would consider is tension. Feelings of nausea can be a sign of back/trap/neck/scalp tension, so reconsider the way you are sitting, how closely you are staring at the screen, brightness settings, etc. and make sure to add a regular stretching routine to your day to help prevent longer-term injuries. \n\nThe truth is, your lifestyle right now is unsustainable, and based on your account here (regardless of physical symptoms) you are already headed for some serious burnout (we've all been there). SO. My suggestion is that you evaluate what responsibilities you can defer, which ones you can pull back on, and which ones you absolutely must attend to in the immediate future. Especially if your graduate program is multiple years, you will not be able to get through this without significantly worsened mental health and very possibly physical health problems unless you adjust your lifestyle to become a more humane one.",
