  "title:": "Benefits or downsides to having a co-advisor?",
  "text": "I started my PhD in September and sent my advisor (PI) a first draft of my thesis proposal earlier this week to get his feedback. My advisor told me he'd be speaking with another professor at different university about my project after he'd read my draft. This other professor was supposed to be a possible collaborator.\n\nI found out today that my advisor let the other professor read my proposal and she now wants to be my co-advisor. I was surprised to hear that she was that interested in my project. My advisor thinks it would be a good idea to have this professor be my co-advisor because she has technical skills that would compliment my advisor's skills and help me with my project. I plan to meet with her next week about the possibility.\n\nIf you had two (co-) advisors/PIs, how was your experience? I am concerned I might struggle with meeting two potentially different sets of expectations.",

      "text": "I tend to think more advisors is better. You never know when one of them could be sick or indisposed or provide you with help getting through a disagreement with the other. I would suggest clarifying roles and expectations at the start to improve communication later. Who is the primary? What is the co-advisor\u2019s role? Who do you contact about paperwork vs technical advise? \n\nAlso having someone at another university is a great safety net for you. If a problem arises in your department you need to talk about but are concerned about backlash from your department, you can bring it up with your co-advisor who (hopefully) will be more concerned about you than departmental politics.",

As it stands, my existing advisor would be the primary and the co-advisor would be for technical advise. My project would still be based at my current institution and not the co-advisor's institution.",

      "text": "I kind of have an informal co advisor. The advantages are that you get more feedback and can ask more people for help. The challenge comes when they disagree with each other and you are kind of in the middle.  It is like having two parents. It can be great as they can both help you grow in different ways but they also can have nasty fights. (Although academia is normally a tad bit more civil than most marriages).",

      "text": "Talking to prior students who have had them as co-advisors helped me. You learn about their differences (in advising style, feedback, etc), and then, like some kids do with parents, go to one in particular when you need a specific thing done. \n\nAlso, even tho they may be \"co-advisors\", make sure it is clearly established who the primary advisor is. \n\nHaving co-advisors that complement each other can be super-advantageous.",

Get recommendations from people, but in the end use the ones that will serve you best. \n\nCollaborators and advisors (PhD-committee members) have different roles. Many people make the mistake of having their collaborators be their advisors, and then end up with various conflicts of interest. Don't fall in that trap. This is a crucial expectation that you need to discuss in depth wiht your main advisor and with your director of graduate studies. Both of them.\n\nIt is normally bad to have a co-advisor who is not at your school. Your school confers the degree, and people who don't work there do not really have the authority approve your degrees. There are a few special cases where you can petition to have it, but only if there is absolutely nobody else at your school who understand your field of study.",

But anyways, it can be a pain in the ass, or it can be a blessing. I have seen maybe a half dozen students like this throughout my time as a PhD student. I think two of them would constantly complain about it --- it seemed like one of the advisors was the \"normal\" one and the other unreasonable. But I guess two out of a half dozen isn't bad? I would speak directly to people that have done the same, but also learn more about this new professor through their current and past students.",
