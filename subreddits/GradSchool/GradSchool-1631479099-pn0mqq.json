Any advice?", "text": "Hi all. Brand new to this space. I was historically a really crappy student (High School 2.53 GPA, Undergrad 2.6 GPA), partially from lack of time management skills and partially from severe and undiagnosed ADHD. I did much better in my MBA (3.4 GPA) and I also got a whole bunch of insurance designations which have done amazing things for my career. I also wrote a non-fiction book about how to engage and retain millennials in the insurance industry, while not academic, I lost any fear of writing.\n\nRecently one of my friends from high school started a DBA and then my girlfriend started the same DBA program, both are doing it online at a school in Europe (because it's much more cost effective). It's a 3 year program. Sitting around while my gf was listening to her first couple of classes I started thinking that I might want to jump in too... I downloaded a bunch of academic articles from Google Scholar around the topic of employee engagement and retention and I'm having a blast going through them and planning potential dissertation topics. It would absolutely be a qualitative project because I suck at stats.\n\nFor those of you doing your DBA or who have done your DBA: How was your experience? What advice do you have? What software did you find useful? (For now I'm using Zotero.) Any books that were very helpful on how to do a DBA dissertation? Are there other forums on Reddit or elsewhere specifically for DBA students?\n\nThank you!", "author": "TonyinIowa", "created": 1631479099, "retrieved": 1632952663, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {}}
