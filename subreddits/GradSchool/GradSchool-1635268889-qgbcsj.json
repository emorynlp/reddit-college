  "text": "I am third year PhD student (passed comps and take quals in March). Im currenty taking a random elective outside my program. After 3 homework assignments and a test, my average in the class is about a 74-- even after busting my ass to try to pass the exam. I am really worried I might not pass this class and how this would affect my standing in the program (i.e. funding and not getting kicked out). Any thoughts/advice you can give\u00a0me would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Really doubt you'll get kicked out, but I know nothing about your details. At my uni I might just have to pay for the credits for the retake.\n\nAlso - what grade is passing? In my program it's only courses in our discipline that requires above a 75, out of areas would be 65. \n\nAlso also - you're still (barely) passing. C's get degrees and that's more true in grad school than anywhere else.",
