  "title:": "I am finally switching my advisor",
  "text": "We have a Zoom meeting in 15 minutes.  I have been anxious for over a week thinking about how to bring this up to him without upsetting him or feeling like I'm a failure for not sticking with him.  He is incredibly smart, experienced, and is generally extremely kind and helpful.  But we just do not work well together.   He's super hands-off and comes off a bit distant, so for the past year I've been wrestling with whether he hates me or not (lol).  After our meetings I would feel confused, sad, frustrated, and honestly stupid.  I know that isn't his intention, but it's just really hard for me to interpret what he thinks, and that spikes my anxiety.  I feel like I could never make him proud.  The main reason, though, is that my research interests are different now than when I first got into this program.  There is a new professor who came here last year -- whose interests line up *much* nicer with mine -- and I've finally asked him if he would be up for the switch.  He said yes, clearly, and we've already drafted up some much cleaner ideas for my thesis.  So now all that's left to do is break it to my original advisor, in what is now 8 minutes, and pray he doesn't tell the rest of the department how awful I am :). \n\nIf anyone was looking for a sign to switch advisors, here it is.  Wish me luck!",

      "text": "This, very much! A month ago, I was in the same position: sad, frustrated, burnt out, and felt really dumb every time I met with my previous advisor. They were kind and patient, however, my research interests no longer aligned with the problem given to me or the branch of math I was working in. I emailed them that I was no longer interested and started working in the field of math that I enjoy and feel much more supported by my current professor. \n\nFor those of you thinking about switching, it is perfectly fine to switch. I thought that there would be some magical consequence to switching, from not getting a job to I won't be able to get my degree because I switched. But really, nothing happened. My previous advisor was salty (lol), but who gives a shit? I didn't do much anyway ( or I was so told :/ ). Anyway, good on you OP, I hope your thesis the smoothest ride.",

          "text": "Wow, that's super similar!  It's always interesting to hear the perspectives of other majors.   \n I have assumed from this sub that some hard sciences (chem, microbio maybe?) have a whole lab group working with them, rather than just the advisor/student pair, which seems like an interesting dynamic if I'm assuming correctly.  \n\nI'm in anthropology, and there's a lot of different, highly specialized avenues within my subfield to focus on.  My previous advisor's specialty was something that I wanted nothing to do with when I really faced the facts (too much math, haha!).  So aside from not jiving well, it really was the only thing that made sense.  \n\nI'm glad that you were able to switch too and that things are going amicably.  I was also under the impression that everything in my life would fall apart if I did this.  So far so good.  Thanks for your comment & I wish the same for you!",

          "text": "Well I told myself that I wasn't going to go into a schpiel but I did anyway haha, I started by saying that my research interests are changing and that I have to follow them or I will be miserable.  I emphasized how much I value his insight and experience and that I hope to continue learning from him.  But holy shit it was so awkward over Zoom.  He did say that he had been anticipating this conversation for a year -- which is how long I've been here lol -- so I'm not sure why he didn't say something sooner if he also felt a disconnect.  Overall he was very understanding.  He said he could understand my anxiety about it, but also that it's important to be passionate about my project and my work, and that I should do whatever necessary to ensure that.  \n\nTo be honest I don't think he really feels hurt or anything (which is good!) because if he's felt this way for this long, he must have seen it coming.  I feel guilty for wasting his time, but I really wish he'd told me sooner if he didn't think we were a good fit either.  I really was gonna try to make it work now that classes are in-person but realized that being terrified to talk to my advisor and losing my drive isn't a good sign.\n\nThank you for asking - I've always been more of a lurker on this sub, but it's great to be able to talk about these things with others, and this post really helped me calm down before meeting with him.",

              "text": "I'm glad that everything worked out for you! \n\nI'm in my PhD now, but when I was doing my masters I had to switch advisors very late in the game. My advisor was emotionally abusive, a total jerk, pit me and my cohort against each other, and made us do ten times more work at each step than was required so those of us with this person as advisor were all behind. I was lucky to find someone to switch with and pull through. \n\nI know that the moment I switched I felt a big weight lift--I know you seem to be earlier in the process and with a much less toxic advisor, but I'm sure you feel a similar relief. I'm so happy it went pretty well! Good luck with the new advisor! :)",

I am always blown away by the ways in which people who are supposed to be *educators and leaders* treat those who are just there to learn.  I'm glad it all worked out in the end and that you are in a better place; everyone deserves that.  I hope that professor got what he deserved. \n\nI am very fortunate in that my previous advisor was not a bad, rude or disrespectful person.  But he did certainly make me feel like shit, inadvertently or not, and I think he should have read the situation better and worked to ensure that I was feeling confident.  Anyways, thank you again, and I wish you continued success and happiness! :)",
