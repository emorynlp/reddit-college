  "text": "Come join us!\n\nDuring the lockdown we all realized that we missed the kind of casual lab chats where you make your coworkers speculate on when we\u2019ll clone a woolly mammoth. . So we started a twitch channel where we talk about different science topics each week!\n\nWe\u2019d love if you come join and talk with us about science some time! We\u2019re live at [https://www.twitch.tv/philososcienceing](https://www.twitch.tv/philososcienceing) from 9-10 PM EST on Thursdays, and you can also see some of our previous videos there!\n\nWe also have a twitter where we do...basically the same thing: https://twitter.com/PhilScienceing",
