I worked very hard to maintain a decent profile by upskilling myself and adding achievements to my resume. I even cleared GRE, TOEFL and IELTS with good scores. But I'm getting cold feet now while applying.\n\nI cannot get myself to start working on the SOP and other application formalities. For the last entire academic year, I maintained a steady income by writing SOPs for other students. So, it's not that I cannot write a decent SOP, I've done it many times before. But I go blank every time I start working on mine. I have no motivation left to get it done. \n\nAfter quite some introspection, I think it's the fear of rejection. I'm applying to a few safe ones, but it's the fear of rejection from the ambitious ones.
