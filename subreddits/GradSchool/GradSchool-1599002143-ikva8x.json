Maybe they think they deserve it after whatever they went thru to get there, but I just can't empathize with people like that (and, of course, not all professors are like that).",

She\u2019s very apathetic to us too. Tells us that if we don\u2019t feel like our heads are about to fly off, we\u2019re not trying hard enough. Really hammered in the idea that out of the 10 of us, only a few will ever get PhDs, and only a couple from there will go on to teach. \n\nthe TL:DR of my comment is for the first time since junior year of high school, i have an educator that has completely crushed my morale and love for the field i\u2019m in\n\nthe one thing i hate about reddit is i wish i knew why i was getting downvoted when i just share stuff like this",

Some profs are super nice some are mean but at the end of the day all they really care about are grants, tenure and reputation i think. The really good ones quit being research profs and become mainly teaching faculty cos they don't like how their life is going. idk the teaching profs i know are all very human but the research profs all seem too busy to live properly.  \nI'm also someone who gave up some academic fulfillment for the military. It was pretty worth it. The ppl you serve alongside in the military are simply awesome!",

You\u2019ll notice one of my most upvoted comments on there was about things to share with first generation college students\u2014on a thread where everyone was sharing resources. It was a great thread and there wasn\u2019t any negativity on it.\n\nDo those negative threads exist? Of course. But either I ignore it or I even comment to commiserate with the person or if I really think they\u2019re going overboard then I\u2019ll try to give them some perspective. It\u2019s the same strategy I use for all the negativity in this sub.",

I taught math and science, so grading meant using an answer key and checking off on points for individual steps, then getting it into a gradebook, and by then the next assignment is already ready for grading. If you gave me something late, then it got added to pile, I have go hunt down that answer key, then go back and find that item in the gradebook. And then at the end of the semester I'd end up with a stack of random assignments plus their final and it's a mad dash at the end.\n\nIs it hard? No. Is it a pain in the ass, especially when I start getting the \"when are you going to grade that?\" because apparently I'm on your timeline? Absolutely. And yes it's my job, but I have to set boundaries to maintain everyone's sanity.\n\nI would try to be fair and split the difference- anything that is autograded by the computer or complete/incomplete I would take late. Big projects I would take late with a heafty penalty. But 3 month old homework from the beginning of the semester? Absolutely not.",

                  "text": "I'm okay with a participation grade as a \"bonus\" that can't hurt students but otherwise feel like it's just a way for professors to inflate their importance. If someone manages to learn the material by the end of the semester they should get good grades regardless of whether or not they came to listen to a useless lecture (if people can learn without coming to your lecture it is indeed useless for them, if not for everyone else). They shouldn't be penalized for not sacrificing hours and hours of their time. If attendance is important, it would be reflected in student's final grades. If the lecture was useful and students did not attend, they would still get poor marks as reflected in their exams and assignments. \n\nBut on the other hand, if a student comes to class all the time (and isn't just shopping on their laptop the whole time*) and fails to do well on the exams and assignments perhaps it's a good idea to give a bonus (perhaps 5 to 10%) to their final grade.\n\n*BTW another thing I've observed as an undergraduate is that with mandatory attendance for bad lectures, people just show up and screw around on their laptop or on another class' work the whole time. It's actually distracting for people who want to be there for the lecture when people are showing up just to get .5% of their grade per class but have no interest in actually paying attention. \n\nSorry for the rant I've just thought about this a lot lol",

              "text": "I totally get where you are coming from because the concept of fairness in grades is held up as so important in academia... but I think it's generally not a helpful or good ideal. Grades will never be 'fair' across sections/years/universities, and often are not reflective of the skills students come out of a class with. It's complicated because obviously they are motivating to some students. But think how much better the learning and teaching could be if the focus was on learning, rather than assessing!! Clearly this would need to be a big shift in the way we think about education. But I think the first step is realizing that there is no such thing as 'fair' when it comes to grades.  \n\nPS a _whole day_ is terrible??? I often don't start grading for several days after a deadline. And what if a student is sick, or has something else critical to do that day? Is that fair?",

That's actually just a missing hand-in - and I say that as someone who is notoriously late with things like that. \n\nFortune favors the bold, and apparently that seems to also work for your students.\nGrades are never fair across different institutions, or even different years, but at the very least should be across your class. \n\nFor context, in many lectures I'm familiar with the exercises only serve as a condition to be able to attend the exam - they are not graded. You just are allowed to go to the exam when reaching some score.\n\nWith theses or long-term projects I agree that a day is not much.",

I teach at a community college, and while I personally don't care whether my students attend- though I obviously think they should- the school is heavily subsidized by the federal government and we have to prove that the number of students we say we have in class are actually in class. \n\nOn late homework: another poster described it well. It's way more effort on my part to go back and grade something once I've finished the whole class. I think each teacher should set a policy they like though. My department has a no late work policy that I slightly don't agree with- I'd probably do 10% off per day late since I don't usually grade the same day I get it. But I think it's important to set expectations and stick to them.",
