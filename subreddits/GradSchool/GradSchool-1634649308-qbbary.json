  "text": "I am currently in my second year of a US Masters program in counseling psychology. I, and other classmates, feel that we have learned nothing. Especially those who started in the fall of 2020 (when things were still shut down a bit). We're all supposed to be taking comprehensive exams soon and feel that we haven't learned much and I was wondering if anyone else felt the same way lately. \n\nI thought about reading books on the subject I'm interested in and the theories I like, but will that only do so much...\n\nI am supposed to graduate in the next year or so, and I'm feeling very defeated and just absent minded about my studies. Anyone else in the same \ud83d\udef6?",

Its like being given a puzzle to solve and you know all the pieces fit together, but you cant remember what one piece looked like after looking at the next piece. Idk if that even makes sense lol. \n\n\nIts also kinda terrifying for like our futures yknow? Like counseling and engineering are serious things that can have major consequences, good or bad. I'm scared to be thrown in the deep end next year.",

It makes me wonder if it was always like this....",
