  "title:": "Note taking \u2014 how do you organize all of it? Digital or handwritten?",
  "text": "I\u2019m in my first year of a science PhD, and am quickly realizing that as is expected in grad school, there are ton of papers/textbooks/etc that I am reading, as well as tons of course notes that I regularly refer back to. I think I take pretty good notes\u2014 but I take a lot of them, and they\u2019re all strictly handwritten (I\u2019ve always preferred reading a physical paper than something on a screen). However, I\u2019m realizing that I will have way too many notes to be able to easily refer back to something (I regularly look through 7-8 notebooks at a time which is a lot to be carrying around) , so I\u2019m thinking about shifting to digital note taking.\n\nHow do you all take notes? Are there are products or softwares that you use? Do any of you still use handwritten notes? What about when reading papers? I don\u2019t think I could switch to purely typed notes, so do you have any recommendations for things that feel the most \u201cnatural?\u201d\n\nAlso: A bonus would be a software that works on both Windows and Apple (I might be able to borrow my brothers iPad for note-taking, but I have a windows laptop).",

I\u2019ve got a workflow that allows me to extract my annotations from Zotero and import them into Obisidan using Zotfile/mdnotes. \n\nIn conclusion, check out Obsidian. It\u2019s a game changer.",

I started using Zotero about halfway through my first year as a PhD student and it was a complete game changer.",

      "text": "I take reading notes and lecture notes. It might seem excessive, but in my field it's the easiest way for me to keep everything organized for future reference in discussions/research.\n\nAs I'm reading articles or books I jot notes on a sheet of paper as I work through the document. Once I'm finished, I type them up in Word so they're easier to read, but also because the act of going over them as I type helps me commit it to memory. That's what I bring to seminars/lectures (I print it out so I can add more notes in class, which I later add to my doc). \n\nThen, during class, I write notes as the discussion moves along (keeping track of valid points in the discussion as well as my own personal observations/questions to explore later). After class, I type those notes up and save them on my computer. \n\nIt's a time consuming process, but it works with my learning style and locks it into my memory.\n\nEdit: I save the docs on my computer, each class has a folder, and each file is \"Week # Discussion\" or \"Week # Reading\"",
