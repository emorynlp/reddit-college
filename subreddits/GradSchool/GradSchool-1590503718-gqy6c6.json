I have been finding it increasingly difficult to work and feel motivated about my research. I keep using lazy \"work arounds\" to avoid having to read or code. I am not sure if I am showing signs of ADHD or if I just in the wrong field. I had these problems throughout my life but never to this extent. There are aspects of the project I enjoy and I do not want to let anyone down by quitting, but I feel like I will get \"found out\" and that I am just wasting my supervisors times as I do not belong in this level.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your advice and kind words! I have put together a timetable to try stick to some structure in my life. I have put regular breaks which are to be used for creative activity or exercise (some with a rule to be away from a screen completely). I hope it will help me to  keep on track. I have also reached out to a university mental health support app. I will continue to learn about impostor syndrome and the ideas you guys have mentioned. Thank you again and I hope this post has helped others feeling this way!

I was doing very similar things around year 3. Project I want to do around the house? Ehh.. maybe I\u2019ll just show up at the lab at noon. Soccer game I want to watch? Why don\u2019t I just watch that from 3-5pm. Drink too much on a weeknight? Welp, maybe taking 20 minutes to feed cells is enough productivity for one day. \n\n\nImportantly, while everyone has their own vices and distractions, I think this is a somewhat natural cycle, and it\u2019s one of the things that makes a PhD different than any other degree. At the end of the day, you\u2019re only going to finish if you put in the work, and you\u2019re only going to put in the work if you motivate yourself to do so. \n\n\nI started to come to that realization around the end of year 3 / beginning of year 4 when I realized there was no way I wanted to be a 6+ year PhD student (though absolutely no offense meant to those whose path takes that long!), so working backwards from a goal of finishing in ~5 years, I realized I had to get to work because my experiments weren\u2019t going to do themselves. \n\n\nThis all my long winded way of saying, don\u2019t worry about it. Your motivation will come when you start to feel urgency, and that urgency will make you independent. You\u2019ll realize that you don\u2019t need a professor (or anyone else) to tell you what to get done on a given day or in a given week, your productivity will pick up tremendously, you\u2019ll graduate, and then you\u2019ll take this \u201csoft\u201d skill with you for the rest of your life.", "author": "General_Beauregard", "created": 1590539817, "upvotes": 3}, "frxbhxf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gqy6c6/does_anyone_feel_they_are_becoming_lazy_during/frxbhxf/", "text": "I'm in a 5th year slump and you sound like me!
