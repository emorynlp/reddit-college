  "title:": "How to get into a research MS or PHd program",
  "text": "This question may have been asked before, but am I able to get into a research program without any formal research background. I have been a research and development automation internship since I was freshman, but there's no formal publications involved.  I also have a 3.04 and 3.8 GPA at two universities. How can I get involved in the research world having never done academic research before. I know I can get involved on my campus now, but I need to work in order to pay for being alive and the research on campus doesn't really pay.",

      "text": "You can get into an MS program without research experience. Master's is where most people get their first propoer research experience, and where profs will notice you (if they like your work) and invite you onto more projects. So by the time you're ready for PhD you should have good experience. \n\nAs for needing to work for a living, everyone needs to weigh what sacrifices (i.e., student loan debt) they are willing to make for a future they want. It's unfortunate, but you're not the only person needing to weigh these options. Personally I only got a partial tuition scholarship for my master's, so took out loans, but got a full tuition plus living expenses scholarship for my PhD.",
