Her soul arrived at the Pearly Gates, where St.Peter welcomed her. \u201cBefore you get settled in\u201d he said, \u201cWe have a little problem\u2026you see, we\u2019ve never had a PI make it this far before and we\u2019re not really sure what to do with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d said the woman, \u201ccan\u2019t you just let me in?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to,\u201d said St Peter, \u201cBut I have higher orders. We\u2019re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you\u2019d like to go for all eternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I think I\u2019d prefer heaven\u201d, said the woman. \u201cSorry, we have rules\u2026\u201d at which St. Peter put the PI into the downward bound elevator.\n\n\nAs the doors opened in Hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow PIs, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. They ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.\n\nThey played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. She met the Devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.\n\nBefore she knew it, it was time to leave. Everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. The elevator went back up to heaven where St. Peter was waiting for her. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to spend a day in heaven,\u201d he said.\n\nSo she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in Hell. At the day\u2019s end St. Peter returned. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve spent a day in hell and you\u2019ve spent a day in heaven\u201d. \u201cYou must choose between the two.\u201d\n\nThe woman thought for a second and replied: \u201cWell, heaven is certainly lovely, but I actually had a better time in hell. I choose Hell.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, St. Peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. When the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. She saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. The Devil approached and put his arm around her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d stuttered the PI, \u201cThe other day I was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. We ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. Now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.\u201d\n\nThe Devil simply looked at her and smiled, \u201cYesterday we were recruiting you, today you\u2019re staff.\u201d", "author": null, "created": 1582901968, "retrieved": 1632845198, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 818, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fj36w7i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/favx9j/pi_in_hell_appropriate_for_recruitment_season/fj36w7i/", "text": "I literally just had my interview with a PI that I'm about to work for as an RA.
