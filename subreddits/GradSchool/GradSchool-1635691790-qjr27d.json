  "title:": "Being pushed into doing thesis work. How to proceed?",
  "text": "Hi guys, I'll try to keep this short. I enrolled in grad school two semesters ago under my school's non-thesis curriculum. This route only requires one extra class and a special projects stipulation (I'll get back to this part later). Compared to the thesis route, the non-thesis option does not take any longer and is a lot less stressful. Actually, it might even be shorter. \n\nMy advisor and professor I work under (same person) initially kept saying things such as \"If you choose to do the thesis route\" whenever I first joined. However, these things slowly turned into \"For your thesis\" and I found myself doing research for him day and night, year-round. I am not sure when, but at some point I fell out of the normal non-thesis Master's route and ended up being pushed into doing thesis work. Scheduling for next semester is coming up and upon looking at my needed workload, I realized I can graduate next semester.\n\nThis is where the problem comes in. To graduate under the non-thesis option, I need to complete 3 hours of a special projects course. However, each time you register and complete a projects course, it is up to the professor's discretion on how many credits to award you with. I talked to my professor about my desire to graduate soon and reaffirmed how I am not enrolled in the thesis route. Needless to say, he was pretty livid but this is besides the point. Being that I only need 3 hours for the projects course, I would simply take it next semester. Normally, people only take this once as a semester's worth 3 credit hours. However, he told me that he will only award me one credit hour for each special projects course, meaning it will take me an extra year to continue with my non-thesis option. What should I do and how should I proceed?",
