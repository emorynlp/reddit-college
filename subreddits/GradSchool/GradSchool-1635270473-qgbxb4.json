  "text": "And boy does it feel good.  I was signed up to take two bridge courses this semester. Early on I wasn\u2019t doing too great in either course and figured I\u2019d really buckle down, study, and get the work done.  \nLast week I spent three days on a single problem in an assignment and made very little progress.  Learned that I had missed an important concept in the early part the course which resulted in not making progress. I was okay with that until I hit another assignment snag.  Realizing that the issue was probably related to things I missed in the first few weeks of class, I googled withdrawal dates for grad school.  Mulled over the decision with my spouse. Composed a withdrawal request and took the weekend off.  \n\nI am less stressed, but I also know now that when I sign up for this class again to pay special attention in the first three weeks of class. \n\nI am doing okay in the other class and will continue.",
