I hate it", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m on my last year of my MA of Economics. The past year I was a TA and really liked it. This year I was assigned as an RA. I explicitly stated in my application I would prefer to be a TA, because searching for data, having no clue when and if I\u2019ll find what I need, it maddening. I\u2019m not doing a PhD, so I don\u2019t really care that it\u2019s good research experience. \n\nAnyways\u2026 I\u2019m hunting for data. Can\u2019t find what I need. My professor\u2019s subscription to the database runs out by Friday. I have no clue what to do. I\u2019ve been neglecting my own classes trying to find this/ figure out why I can\u2019t, which is a whole another story of stress (time series will kill me!).\n\nDo I tell my professor I can\u2019t find what I need? How do you deal with not finding data for someone else? This feels so shameful. I have one job: assist finding data. They pay for my tuition, and I\u2019m worthless so far. I feel like a failure. I\u2019m a woman and have always gotten so worked up over making mistakes for fear of being thought stupid and this feels like a major blow. \n\n(P.S. trying to find release date data for earnings on datastream. IBES has the date data, I just can\u2019t find it on datastream.)", "author": "aka_hopper", "created": 1632855246, "retrieved": 1632951946, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heonlh2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxd4ed/how_to_be_a_good_research_assistant_i_hate_it/heonlh2/", "text": "I'm not in economics, but I know you can get access to a lot of databases through Google Dataset search: [https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)", "author": "drizdar", "created": 1632888825, "upvotes": 1}, "henizh1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxd4ed/how_to_be_a_good_research_assistant_i_hate_it/henizh1/", "text": "I'm in a completely different field, but it's completely normal to ask advisor for help. That's literally their job. Yes, your job is to help them find data but you're supposed to do it under their supervision. First of all you're a student and you're suppose to learn, and the advisor is supposed to teach.

My advice would be to outline what you HAVE done, i.e. what have you searched, keywords you used, etc. Then, send an email to the professor outlining what you have already tried, and ask them for a bit of assistance or advice on what to do next.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with asking for help and you are not a failure!", "author": "jpootz", "created": 1632858592, "upvotes": 5}}}
