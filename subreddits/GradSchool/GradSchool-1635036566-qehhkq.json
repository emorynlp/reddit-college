  "text": "I have to prepare a concise review for an in-class presentation based on the guidelines below that   \ndescribes the current state of knowledge of some aspect of a topic relating to our class, focusing on   \nindependent commentary about my views on the issue and how I view future   \ndirections. \n\nI am asked to address the science of my topic and give the professor a   \nflavor of what is interesting about the topic and what we are learning about it. I have to write for   \nan intelligent lay-person unfamiliar with the topic.\n\nMy outline for the presentation is due next week and I was wondering, for a 12 minute presentation, how should I structure the presentation (e.g. 2 mins on intro, etc.)?",
