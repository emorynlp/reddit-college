  "text": "Hey r/GradSchool! Quick question. \n\nI have my Master's degree in English Literature, but I am applying for my true passion, a Master's in Creative Writing. I've got my CV ready to go, but I am a bit worried about a few things. \n\n1.) I don't have any publications aside from my thesis (some papers are in the works, but nothing set in stone yet).\n\n2.) I am a nationally recognized competitive figure skater. Is that something I can include on a CV (awards, national standings, etc) to show dedication?\n\nMy only categories at this point for my CV are Education, Honors and Awards, Community Service, and Languages (fluent in two others besides English). \n\nThanks in advance for the input!",

Publications, classes, job  experience, awards, etc. All of it. \n\nEven writing experiences that are tangentially related to creative writing, such as a publishing internship or a technical writing class, could be good to include.",

Short story contests, etc. \n\nA creative writing CV lists works that have been published. Or accept it for publication, but not published yet (and you can list those as accepted).\n\nBut not works that you sent out and haven't been accepted yet\n\n>And am I correct in thinking that I should not include any extracurriculars that don't pertain directly to academia?\n\nYes. Typically you're going to list excurriculars related to either academia or writing. So if you belong to a writing club that is not at the university, you would still include that. Or say on your own you regularly tutor sixth graders in creative writing at the local elementary school. You could include that.",
