      "text": "I\u2019ve learned not to worry about asking seemingly dumb questions or too many questions, thus making me appear dumb. Even if my classmates think I\u2019m dumb for this (which I doubt) who tf cares?! As long as I get the answer I\u2019m looking for, I don\u2019t give a crap what people think about me. Better to ask and be sure then to ever guess or make your life harder!!",

      "text": "It's imposter syndrome. I promise everyone in academia (including profs) feels that way. When imposter syndrome hits me hard I try to remember what my supervisor told me that grad school is competitive and they have a great selection system which guarantees if you made it you're good enough to be there. It wasn't a mistake and you're not fooling anyone. All the experiences listed in your CV are proof that you deserve to be there. \n\nI'm more then confident that you're not asking dumb questions and your lab mates are more then happy to answer. I love it when first years reach out to me and ask me questions because I'm very passionate about helping others and I'm grateful that they felt like they can trust me to open up. If you're worried anything's a dumb question - think about a year from now when a new student reaches out and askes you some of the same questions? Will you be annoyed/think they are dumb?",
