I was a latch key kid and so I would arrive home around 330 and my mom at 530/6ish. And I would literally FLY around the house trying to do the thing she asked me to do AS SHE PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY! I would watch tv and eat snacks and who knows what else to distract me from the feeling of dread and ~guilt?~ that I knew would happen when I didn\u2019t do the thing I knew I was supposed to do. Fact: It\u2019s rather hard to magic up unfrozen chicken in the 45 seconds it takes for your mom to pull in the driveway and walk in the door. \n\nShame. The feeling was shame. I knew I was in for shame. \n\nIt was never anything huge. Start dinner. Litter box. Feed the cats. And yet.

It is hard.  \nI think the big revelation for me is that procrastination is a coping mechanism, not a character flaw. We feel overwhelmed with a task and don\u2019t know where to start, so playing a game helps avoid that fear of failure. We are afraid that our work will be judged inferior, so we delay submitting the work. The approaching deadline can help overcome these concerns and allow us to proceed in a flurry of work.  \nI believe I read this in The Motivation Myth by Jeff Haden. Haden says that motivation is the product of taking small steps toward a goal, rather than a prerequisite that we must wait for before we can proceed. This new perspective was helpful to me too.

Im right there with you. Been in school nearly constantly since graduating hs in 2010. Always been a top notch student. Started struggling a little bit in grad school, but always managed to get by. But now with COVID it's like ... honestly, I think the best way to say it is that I feel like I've lost my identity as an academic/scholar.I mean, I'm sitting here at my moms house learning about this shit while there's a billion other things going on around me and it just feels like the old world of academia that I used to be familiar and friendly with is so far away and out of reach from this computer chair in my moms office. I no longer feel desire, pressure, or even anxiety to study the way I used to, and when I do manage to somehow get something school-related done, there's no feeling of reward, relief or fuffilment afterwards. All I want to do is get lost in video games and not have to think - it's gotten pretty bad. Smoking weed makes it worse.\n\nMy professors have luckily been nothing but understanding and lenient, but Im honestly at a point where their understanding & leniency might not be enough to get me out of this ... burnout, depression, cabin fever, whatever this is? I'm nearly completed with my masters degree. I used to be someone who could meet all of those challenging requirements and deadlines and even find enjoyment in the stress and excitement from time to time. I could crank out a 10 page paper in a night. No big deal.\n\nNow, I've literally been trying to get this 10 page paper done for 4 weeks and I am still on the first page. It was due last week and I have an extension until tuesday.Im not really sure what to do at this point and am just kind of on coast for the time being.\n\nI hope things get better for you though, Im still optimistic for me.

I saw a counselor/therapist for a bit in grad school because it was getting in my way of being able to finish my degree, but I wasn't terribly receptive to their suggestions (having tried most of them on my own) which isn't the best way to get much out of therapy, and I never did get to the root of why I do it. \n\nFor me what ended up helping was breaking things down into little manageable items, and the two-minute rule: don't put off anything that can be done in two minutes. These strategies helped me increase my productivity a lot and helped me finish the last couple years.\n\nBut pushing through it also had negative repercussions on me in that I became unable to relax. Even now, out of grad school for most of a year and under no real obligations, I see any free time as time that can be used to be productive, which more than kind of sucks. \n\nGood luck, I hope you find the keys that are best for you!", "author": "Squeekens1", "created": 1621126566, "upvotes": 1}, "gy9mndv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nd1jj3/why_am_i_like_this/gy9mndv/", "text": "> I remember doing this as a kid. \n\nAre you me? \n\nBut it's possible to get better. You need to rewire yourself. Make \"business before pleasure\" a habit.\n\nThe following is the *general strategy* that helped me to fight procrastination (I learned it at a procrastination workshop I took while I was in undergrad):\n\nThink about small concrete goals - think about what will be the concrete end result of your actions once your goal is achieved. So instead of saying \"I need to read x papers\" say to yourself, \"I will download the first two papers from the reading list, skim them, and write notes. Once I am done I will have one summary paragraph written up for each paper.\" Check out S.M.A.R.T. goals.\n\n~~~~\n\nBut first, you need to get started, and to get started, *you need to put away your phone and get to your desk* (or whatever the very first step is for you.) \n\nYou may encounter some resistance, because right now your brain is associating that first step with something unpleasant, like a drop in pleasure and reward. This is only natural: at the moment you are engaged in a highly rewarding, addictive task (CandyCrush or whatever it is that you are doing) and you need to, (1) stop it, and (2) do something that maybe you associate with unpleasant feelings, like opening up a project that you haven't worked on for a while (this is my life, ahah). \nSo your brain is not happy with (1) and (2) and keeps you glued to that CandyCrush game. Well, you need to shortcircuit this loop somehow. For example, tell yourself \"I will just put the phone away and take a big breath\" or \"I will just sit on the chair and relax\" or something like that. Just think about getting on that desk chair, not about \"all the things you need to do.\" \n\nOk, now you are on the chair.\n\n- stay at the desk. Just relax.\n\n- no distractions, emails, browsing, social media, etc. Doing nothing is OK, just don't do something that is different from working.\n\n- OK, you are at the desk, doing nothing. If you want you can keep doing nothing and relax. Or you could do something. Think about something small that you could do. \n\nMaybe at this point you'll just get going. But sometimes we really don't want to do something! Some days, we all get stuck. If you need an extra push, try the following: \n\n- write a super-detailed list of all the steps you need for your small task. You want to write one paragraph? Well, you need to open that word doc first, re-read what you have written last time, etc. Write everything on the list. Now open that word doc. Great! One item off the list.\n\n- keep going down the list. It will be hard at the beginning, but then it'll get easier and easier. Soon you will get momentum and forget about the list.\n\nAnd then, with time and practice, as you will get *into the habit* of working... you will just get to the desk, sit down and start working in no time and you won't need all the prep! Getting to that point may seem hard now, and it takes time, but it's possible, I guarantee you, and then it's going to be easy.\n\nTo make all this work, and to avoid getting into that bad feedback loop, it's also important that you avoid very plesurable, addictive behaviors before work. Leave all that for the afternoon, *after* you have completed your daily work. To this end, something that has also helped me is [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com). I used it to avoid browsing.

And, the more important I know something is, the harder it is to do it. The biggest hurdle, at least for me, is starting. If you still haven\u2019t started your assignments, it might help to lean on a friend for a small hit of social pressure. If you have a friend in the class/research group, see if you can call/FaceTime/zoom them to talk about one of the things you need to do. You can tell them you\u2019re stuck or don\u2019t know where to start and see if they have 15-20 minutes to talk about your ideas.
