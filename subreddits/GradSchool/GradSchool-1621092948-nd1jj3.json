  "text": "Literally last day to submit work (late work I might add). \n\nFirst semester of 2.5 year grad school track. 10 years post undergrad. \n\nI took the day off of my job to finish my grad school work today. With over estimations, I have about 13 tasks/assignments to finish that seems to total to ~7 hours of work. Not even a crazy 18 hour caffeine fueled mania of work! Less than a day\u2019s worth of work! \n\nAnd I\u2019m dicking around in bed playing candy crush and trying to take a nap. What. Is. Wrong. With. Me?!?!\n\nI remember doing this as a kid. I was a latch key kid and so I would arrive home around 330 and my mom at 530/6ish. And I would literally FLY around the house trying to do the thing she asked me to do AS SHE PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY! I would watch tv and eat snacks and who knows what else to distract me from the feeling of dread and ~guilt?~ that I knew would happen when I didn\u2019t do the thing I knew I was supposed to do. Fact: It\u2019s rather hard to magic up unfrozen chicken in the 45 seconds it takes for your mom to pull in the driveway and walk in the door. \n\nShame. The feeling was shame. I knew I was in for shame. \n\nIt was never anything huge. Start dinner. Litter box. Feed the cats. And yet. I worked SO HARD to avoid doing the thing that would take moments and be so easy. \n\nAnd now here I am. The habit has grown exponentially and I\u2019m miserable. \n\nUgh...",

      "text": "This is something I\u2019ve worked on for years. It is hard.  \nI think the big revelation for me is that procrastination is a coping mechanism, not a character flaw. We feel overwhelmed with a task and don\u2019t know where to start, so playing a game helps avoid that fear of failure. We are afraid that our work will be judged inferior, so we delay submitting the work. The approaching deadline can help overcome these concerns and allow us to proceed in a flurry of work.  \nI believe I read this in The Motivation Myth by Jeff Haden. Haden says that motivation is the product of taking small steps toward a goal, rather than a prerequisite that we must wait for before we can proceed. This new perspective was helpful to me too. I don\u2019t have to wait until I \"feel like it\" to do something. I will \"feel like it\" after I take the next step, which, in turn, will help the next step, and so on.",

      "text": "Dude. Im right there with you. Been in school nearly constantly since graduating hs in 2010. Always been a top notch student. Started struggling a little bit in grad school, but always managed to get by. But now with COVID it's like ... honestly, I think the best way to say it is that I feel like I've lost my identity as an academic/scholar.I mean, I'm sitting here at my moms house learning about this shit while there's a billion other things going on around me and it just feels like the old world of academia that I used to be familiar and friendly with is so far away and out of reach from this computer chair in my moms office. I no longer feel desire, pressure, or even anxiety to study the way I used to, and when I do manage to somehow get something school-related done, there's no feeling of reward, relief or fuffilment afterwards. All I want to do is get lost in video games and not have to think - it's gotten pretty bad. Smoking weed makes it worse.\n\nMy professors have luckily been nothing but understanding and lenient, but Im honestly at a point where their understanding & leniency might not be enough to get me out of this ... burnout, depression, cabin fever, whatever this is? I'm nearly completed with my masters degree. I used to be someone who could meet all of those challenging requirements and deadlines and even find enjoyment in the stress and excitement from time to time. I could crank out a 10 page paper in a night. No big deal.\n\nNow, I've literally been trying to get this 10 page paper done for 4 weeks and I am still on the first page. It was due last week and I have an extension until tuesday.Im not really sure what to do at this point and am just kind of on coast for the time being.\n\nI hope things get better for you though, Im still optimistic for me. Feel free to message me if ya ever need anything. Good luck!",

I saw a counselor/therapist for a bit in grad school because it was getting in my way of being able to finish my degree, but I wasn't terribly receptive to their suggestions (having tried most of them on my own) which isn't the best way to get much out of therapy, and I never did get to the root of why I do it. \n\nFor me what ended up helping was breaking things down into little manageable items, and the two-minute rule: don't put off anything that can be done in two minutes. These strategies helped me increase my productivity a lot and helped me finish the last couple years.\n\nBut pushing through it also had negative repercussions on me in that I became unable to relax. Even now, out of grad school for most of a year and under no real obligations, I see any free time as time that can be used to be productive, which more than kind of sucks. \n\nGood luck, I hope you find the keys that are best for you!",

      "text": "> I remember doing this as a kid. \n\nAre you me? \n\nBut it's possible to get better. You need to rewire yourself. Make \"business before pleasure\" a habit.\n\nThe following is the *general strategy* that helped me to fight procrastination (I learned it at a procrastination workshop I took while I was in undergrad):\n\nThink about small concrete goals - think about what will be the concrete end result of your actions once your goal is achieved. So instead of saying \"I need to read x papers\" say to yourself, \"I will download the first two papers from the reading list, skim them, and write notes. Once I am done I will have one summary paragraph written up for each paper.\" Check out S.M.A.R.T. goals.\n\n~~~~\n\nBut first, you need to get started, and to get started, *you need to put away your phone and get to your desk* (or whatever the very first step is for you.) \n\nYou may encounter some resistance, because right now your brain is associating that first step with something unpleasant, like a drop in pleasure and reward. This is only natural: at the moment you are engaged in a highly rewarding, addictive task (CandyCrush or whatever it is that you are doing) and you need to, (1) stop it, and (2) do something that maybe you associate with unpleasant feelings, like opening up a project that you haven't worked on for a while (this is my life, ahah). \nSo your brain is not happy with (1) and (2) and keeps you glued to that CandyCrush game. Well, you need to shortcircuit this loop somehow. For example, tell yourself \"I will just put the phone away and take a big breath\" or \"I will just sit on the chair and relax\" or something like that. Just think about getting on that desk chair, not about \"all the things you need to do.\" \n\nOk, now you are on the chair.\n\n- stay at the desk. Just relax.\n\n- no distractions, emails, browsing, social media, etc. Doing nothing is OK, just don't do something that is different from working.\n\n- OK, you are at the desk, doing nothing. If you want you can keep doing nothing and relax. Or you could do something. Think about something small that you could do. \n\nMaybe at this point you'll just get going. But sometimes we really don't want to do something! Some days, we all get stuck. If you need an extra push, try the following: \n\n- write a super-detailed list of all the steps you need for your small task. You want to write one paragraph? Well, you need to open that word doc first, re-read what you have written last time, etc. Write everything on the list. Now open that word doc. Great! One item off the list.\n\n- keep going down the list. It will be hard at the beginning, but then it'll get easier and easier. Soon you will get momentum and forget about the list.\n\nAnd then, with time and practice, as you will get *into the habit* of working... you will just get to the desk, sit down and start working in no time and you won't need all the prep! Getting to that point may seem hard now, and it takes time, but it's possible, I guarantee you, and then it's going to be easy.\n\nTo make all this work, and to avoid getting into that bad feedback loop, it's also important that you avoid very plesurable, addictive behaviors before work. Leave all that for the afternoon, *after* you have completed your daily work. To this end, something that has also helped me is [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com). I used it to avoid browsing. It's like a promise you make to yourself.",

If you still haven\u2019t started your assignments, it might help to lean on a friend for a small hit of social pressure. If you have a friend in the class/research group, see if you can call/FaceTime/zoom them to talk about one of the things you need to do. You can tell them you\u2019re stuck or don\u2019t know where to start and see if they have 15-20 minutes to talk about your ideas. Once you get started talking about the task, you may find it much easier to continue down that path and keep working.",

I\u2019m late to everything and I get flustered and overwhelmed by planning. I also think it might be ADHD, and I understand your hesitation because it seems like the diagnosis is so common. I only made it through working 30 hrs a week during full time undergrad ten years ago by taking adderall I bought from friends. Although grad school has been much more manageable without having a job, I still have to take only the bare minimum of classes and I sometimes get late extensions (for other conditions as well). It\u2019s really hard struggling with this. During one paper I sat down for 10 hours and couldn\u2019t produce anything.

After I finished and went on to work on something that I really love outside of academia I realized why I was like that in grad school: I didn't like what I was doing. Sure, I studied the field for 12 years, wrote countless pages, got excited with a paper or another that I read, and even had a novel idea here and there, but it wasn't really my thing. I had convinced myself that I always loved the subject, that I always loved to be a researcher, that I needed to be a scholar. I truly believed it, without ever questioning whether that was really my passion. Turns out it was not. Nowadays that I'm doing what I really always wanted to do I find it so incredibly easier to meet deadlines and to push myself a lot more even if there's no real external pressure.\n\nBut that's just me. I found out too late that I was in the wrong game. If you find yourself always missing deadlines, or cutting very close, or dreading to do your grad school work, please take a step back and try to look at the big picture. It may be burnout, it may be a toxic environment, it may very well be that you simply have more pressing problems in your life. But it may as well be that you dislike what you do so much that you'd rather go through bouts of anxiety just to avoid doing it.",

Somehow I had in my mind that I needed to be a physicist. After my PhD I needed a job fast and got a programming gig just to have an income until I could find a post-doc that looked interesting - which wasn't easy to come by, as I was getting more and more uninterested in the field of my PhD. At the same time I was shining in the job as a programmer so decided I would stay put. Eventually found better positions in software development focused on numerical/math/scientific applications. What I learned as a physicist gave me a different perspective, of course. But grad school for me wasn't great even on its best days. Today I have fun even on the worst days.\n\nEdit: typo.",

I don\u2019t know how to bring it up to a PCP without seeming like I\u2019m looking for pills. \n\nI\u2019ve had intermittent experiences with therapy and it always seems like the most basic ~excuse~ and they don\u2019t want to start there. \n\nSo thank you internet stranger for validating out of the blue something that I\u2019ve been contemplating and might be right about.",

I told him that I would sit down to do a task and then get so overwhelmed that I wouldn't do it right that I would try to start 15 other things but never actually do any of those either so I got nothing done. So I brought the anxiety problem with him and his first question was if I had ever been tested for ADHD. I got tested and lo and behold, I have ADHD! So I would just bring up to your doctor how you feel with your school work and stuff.",

              "text": "Yeah, I have ADHD and I could have pretty much written this whole post.\n\nThe mechanisms behind ADHD aren't well understood yet, but ADHD is thought to be related to dopamine deficiency. Dopamine is the molecule that gives you feelings of motivation and reward for actions, which allows you to do the things you want and need to do and function normally. \n\nBut you know what a close relative to dopamine is? Adrenaline! Adrenaline is released when we're under stress -- when there's a deadline looming, or when mom is pulling into the driveway. All of a sudden, we have all the drive in the world because our brain is flooded with adrenaline.\n\nI was diagnosed during grad school myself (postdoc now), and I had difficulty bringing it up to my PCP as well. Instead I made an appointment directly with a psychiatrist who specialized in ADHD among other things and found it much easier to bring up/discuss with them.",
