That project may not even be publishable, but hopefully it\u2019ll be something that gives you the tools to publish faster when the lab is running again.",

I'm so glad to still be working from home and not constantly worrying if the ceiling is going to collapse on me. Because our ceiling tiles were collapsing all the time from getting so water logged.",
