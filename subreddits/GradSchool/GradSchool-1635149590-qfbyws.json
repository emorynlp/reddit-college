  "text": "So I have started my PhD five months ago, and my professor wants me to supervise this masters student, who is working on something entirely different than what I am working on or have background in, so I don't know much about his area to say the least. I don't know how to go about this? what is expected of me as a supervisor?\n\nthanks!",

      "text": "Sounds like your PhD supervisor is offloading their work to you. Not to be insensitive but you likely have as much experience and expertise as that MSc student and are in no way ready to supervise. \n\nNow, the issue is do you refuse the \"opportunity \" and irritate your clearly slacking supervisor or go ahead and try to muddle through and hope this person's degree goes well; not an enviable situation.\n\nAlso, this speaks volumes about your supervisor.  They should not have put you in that situation.",

      "text": "I completely agree with u/Ophidian69! It sounds like this professor is trying to unload their work on you and by doing so doing both you and this master's student a great disservice.\n\nWith that being said, this could be a misunderstanding; the professor could just be asking you to help them. But there isn't enough info here to say one way or the other.\n\nI would suggest meeting with this professor and seeing what exactly they are asking you to do. If they truly do want you to supervisor a master's student, I would strongly suggest you refuse. You can use what you have stated here as the reason why. But the reason I suggest not doing it is because you have enough on your plate and likely, frankly, are not ready and able to supervise anyone.",
