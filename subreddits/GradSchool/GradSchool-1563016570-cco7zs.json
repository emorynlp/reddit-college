  "text": "Update: per university protocol, I filled out a sexual harassment form. Will keep you all posted if something comes of it. \n\nSo, I am a 24F who just finished her masters. My program involves a third year teaching fellowship following the completion of the degree, so while I\u2019m technically no longer a student, I\u2019m still in the program and am now an employee of my school.\n\nThis summer, I\u2019ve been working at an academic summer camp on a different campus, and one of my graduate school professors (we\u2019ll call him John; he\u2019s a 67M) also lives here year-round; he just flies to the city where he teaches every week. An expensive and senseless commute, but anyway...I ran into him in town last week and he said if I had a day off we should get together for dinner. I immediately accepted; I\u2019ve had dinner alone with John twice before, as he always takes out the grad students one-on-one. As first-years, my female friends and I initially found his invitations strange, but we ultimately decided he was harmless. We\u2019d all been out with him alone and nothing strange had ever happened. He\u2019s a very talkative guy who usually spent the first twenty minutes of class asking us about our lives, so we decided he was just really friendly.\n\nSo, a few nights ago we had dinner. It was fine, same as usual: he asked a few questions about my summer but mostly talked about himself. He\u2019s always been this way\u2014a bit self-obsessed and so garrulous it\u2019s hard to get a word in during conversation. We mostly talked about the grad program and our respective summer travels abroad. Innocent conversation, nothing weird.\n\nWhen we left, we walked down the sidewalk together until we had to go in different directions. I thanked him for dinner, moved to turn around, and he surprised me by pulling me into a hug and giving me a long, loud kiss on the cheek. At first I thought it was kind of funny, maybe just a European affectation he decided to use since we\u2019d been talking about travel, but after a few minutes I began to feel kind of grossed out. I\u2019m not especially close to this professor. I had two classes with him and that\u2019s it. I tried to imagine the scenario with different people, with one of my other male professors or with me and one of my male students, and it seemed to me that what happened was wildly inappropriate. John has never done anything like that in the city where our university is, not to me or any of the girls in my cohort, so I feel like being far away made him bold. He knew no one else was around and he could get away with crossing some boundaries.\n\nAm I overthinking this? Was he just saying goodbye? I\u2019ve certainly had people kiss me on the cheek as a greeting, but they\u2019ve all been older females and it\u2019s always been just a quick peck, never a loud, wet smooch. And it\u2019s usually not embarrassing; there were people around, and as I walked away they definitely gave me weird looks. My friends in my cohort said John definitely crossed a line and that if I want to reach out to him and say what he did was not okay, that would be totally reasonable. My mom, who can sometimes have old fashioned attitudes about assault and harassment, was 100% on my side and said he was taking advantage of me. \n\nSo. I\u2019m not sure where to go from here. If my program were actually over, I\u2019d just let it go, but I\u2019m going to be teaching there another year and will be around this professor at department events. I\u2019ll definitely see him less than usual, but that\u2019s not the point. Our program is predominantly female, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if I ought to say something to somebody else in power. But then I\u2019d feel embarrassed\u2014it\u2019s not like he did anything overtly sexual. But at the same time, I\u2019ve been working through some childhood sexual abuse stuff this past year and am at a point where anyone even touching me is upsetting. Obviously John couldn\u2019t have known this, but I\u2019m worried that if I complain and say I was genuinely upset by this incident, that whoever handles the incident will want to know why I was so upset by what could\u2019ve just been an overly zealous goodbye.\n\nI have no idea what to do. I\u2019ve felt nauseated ever since it happened and the more I think about it, the madder I get. If anyone has any advice, please let me know.\n\nEdit: want to make it clear that before this incident, the professor had not ever hugged me before, so that wasn\u2019t something we ever did.\n\nAnother edit: I won\u2019t be back on campus until late August.",

      "text": "Ok, so when I started reading this, I initially thought that this was going to end with him kissing you on the mouth which would of made me blow TF up. Fortunately, it wasn't that bad. I think that what matters most in this situation is how this all made YOU feel. If this made you feel very awkward and nauseated (previous history excluded), then chances are that you and this professor weren't close enough for him to be this familiar with you. Granted, if I were in your situation, I probably would not have reported him, but that's 100% you and your prerogative, and I know for a fact that I'm someone with a longer fuse with these kinds of things that has a bad habit of letting things go when I shouldn't.  I personally would have asked around to see if he had a history of this kind of behavior and whether or not he has made other studies/faculty feel uncomfortable (which you did). I personally don't think you have anything to feel bad about. I also have no sympathy for professors that put their own students in these kinds of positions and try to use their power to make advances on students. At least when I dated a professor on my campus, he was in an entirely different department on a different floor of my research building. I'm a cancer guy and he was a metabolism buff in the cardiovascular center. I hate cardiology, and our paths never crossed ever. One time he asked me if I wanted to take a look at one of his publications, and I asked him if he was \"trying to kill me.\" Needless to say, it didn't last.",

      "text": "Wow.  As a teacher I've learned to become physically distant from my students even when they want to hug me.  At most, I just shake their hands precisely because another student's experiences can negatively inform what is a relatively innocent gesture.  I and most of my students come from cultures that are heavily biased towards emotion, affection, and physical contact, usually expressing itself in platonic hugs and cheek kisses as greetings. \n\nBut in the context of academia, your normal may not be my normal.  While I may not consider what he did to be sexual assault, if it made you uncomfortable, you certainly have the right to say something.  Perhaps this will be the impetus that will allow the professor to take corrective action and not cause colleagues, students, or friends discomfort.",

      "text": "A lot of comments on here have you going straight to Title IX coordinators and other university admin, but I respectfully disagree.\n\nUnless you think there is a reason that the program coordinator/graduate coordinator is not someone you can speak with, I would confide in the program director before taking more extreme steps.  Explain this situation made you uncomfortable and was unexpected.  If this is part of a pattern of behavior, the coordinator will know and will then report it through the proper legal channels.  If this is the first time anything like this has been reported, the coordinator will have a private chat with this professor and tell him it made you uncomfortable, and this prof will be on notice.\n\nNormally you are supposed to tell the person who made you uncomfortable before anyone else so there is no misunderstanding, but you're a recently graduated student so that adds a layer of vulnerability that normal coworkers don't have, so I fully support reporting this to someone in authority in the department.\n\nI would not, however, go charging to other university admin or legal services.  Follow standard protocol for a situation that made you feel uncomfortable in the workplace, you tell your supervisor/chain of command unless it's them doing it or you feel you can't trust them for some reason.\n\nNo one has the right to be grabby or kiss you without your consent, but I respectfully disagree that you should be going on campus guns blazing.  There are procedures you are supposed to follow for these situations.  The only reason I would go over the department is if this prof starts making the workplace miserable for you after you report this to the program coordinator.  In that case I would definitely take this to the next level.",

This was a common thing in academia until as late as 10 years ago.  Male professors would be kissing and huggy with other professors and former students.  I saw three posts about one older professor I had at my alma mater during the #metoo wave.  It was kind of eye opening as no one put it together until then the professor made everyone feel uncomfortable.  \n\nAnd that is what concerns me the most here, is this guy has to know on some level this is not acceptable anymore.  Not in academia, not in marriage and not in society as a whole.  It is just absolutely disrespectful to do.  \n\nSo you have everything right to be mad.  And you have every right to be mad without even needing to bring up your past.  Academia has no place for \"acceptable\" sexism anymore.  I would tell him that the personal affection makes you very uncomfortable and you would prefer in the future it does not happen.  No one is entitled to know your reasons for it.  You can share it, but only if you wish.  \n\n\nOne final thing to think about.  Would be kiss a male student like that do you think?  If not, then why?  Things that do not seem sexual like one on one meetings with students outside of school, kissing on the check ect become sexual if people only do them with some students of their preferred sexual orientation.\n\nEdit:  Also you may want to talk to some of your former classmates.  As was the case with the professor in my school, people are ashamed to talk about stuff like this so it stays quiet.  But once the cat is out of the bag, it usually is the case that it is not an isolated occurrence but a pattern of behavior.",

They are being found out but usually nothing happens to them because of politics. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a tough choice for you to make with what actions to take because you are still getting established/ starting out in your field. \n\nEveryone who has told you he was inappropriate was correct. If you\u2019re physically afraid at all I\u2019d recommend taking some public action against him. Most people shrug this stuff off and try to just finish what they\u2019ve got going and move on. This perpetuates the culture of creepy old male professors. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Stay strong and just do whatever feels right to you. Burning his career to the ground or being out for blood doesn\u2019t sound like your objective, but if I were you I would switch from defense to offense.",

It was in a professional setting, a man who had been a mentor for me and who misinterpreted what I thought was simply being friends and networking for romantic interest. In hindsight I wish I'd been more observant of what was going on, I just assumed we were platonic but we did do a lot of things that were akin to dates. Anyway, long story short he kissed me on the cheek  after walking me back to my car after dinner one night. I immediately felt weird and awful about it, and after talking with a male friend of mine through text I decided to send him a message and thank him for all of his help and to say that I think he got the wrong impression and that I have always valued his *friendship* and look on him as a mentor and that I hope that that relationship wasn't going to change.\n\nI'm pretty sure he was super embarrassed about it after I made it clear I wasn't interested in that kind of relationship. His behavior was inappropriate for sure, but I can also see how he misinterpreted things and got carried away. Things were awkward for a while after that, we didn't meet up any more. He did actually help me get a job eventually but we never had that close of a relationship again after that night.\n\nAnyway, I might suggest you reach out to him and let him know that the kiss made you uncomfortable and make it clear that you would prefer to keep things purely professional from now on. Give him a chance to take the easy way out and call it a misunderstanding; if he doesn't take it then you escalate as necessary. Also might be worth reaching out to your peers who have also gone out with him for platonic dinners and ask if anything like that has ever happened with them.",

I don't know what your future plans are, and don't want to give your advice that might actually make things worse for you. If someone reported this behaviour about a colleague to me, I would act, but I'm aware that not everyone in HE is prepared to do so. \n\nI'm sorry if this sounds like I am morally equivocating. I'm not. This should not have happened, and the person who did it should be told that. I don't want you to end up in an even more difficult situation though - if you know of senior colleagues at the University who you can trust, then I'd suggest you go and speak to then as they will know the best way of handling this locally to make sure you are heard.\n\nYou shouldn't be in this position. I'm really sorry. To give context I'm a Head of School at a UK University.",

      "text": "My first response seeing your post was \"Oh shit!\", and my feelings have not changed.\n\nLet's ignore the kiss for a second; you do not pull a subordinate with whom you have never had such contact before into a hug. That is very different to *offering* them a hug; it takes away their choice and puts their body right against yours. Then let's throw the \"wet\" kiss back in - this further invades the personal space and is also (IMO at least) slightly gross. A dry kiss on the cheek is one thing; dumping your saliva on someone else's face is weird.\n\nNow, if this is a professor who does not hug other students (male or female) or kiss other students (male or female) on the cheek, then there is *no reason* he should have done it to you. But he did, and that needs dealing with.\n\nI am uncertain what the appropriate reporting structure in your institution will be, but for guidance there will almost certainly be some sort of student support service/ombudsman who can advise you on what steps you could take in this kind of situation, and what the typical response/procedures following that would be. I suggest you speak with them, get an idea of what you could do, and then decide what you want to do. (If mandatory reporting is a thing at your institution you could leave out his name until you were sure what you wanted to do)",

Just say you felt uncomfortable about the kiss and that you\u2019d appreciate avoiding unnecessary physical contact. Tell him you are sure he meant no harm by it, but you that it made you uncomfortable. \n\nIf he profusely apologizes, then accept it and hopefully try to move on.\n\nIf he tried to stand up for himself blah blah was just a peck or whatever, then I would personally take action.\n\nThis would help me understand his character. And how I think I should proceed.\n\nI always give people the benefit of doubt. He\u2019s an old guy and in academia and you graduated and is european. None of these things make it ok to make you uncomfortable, but I think getting a better understanding of his intentions and character will make you more comfortable and less guilty with however you decide to proceed.\n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t come off the wrong way or as insensitive. I understand events like this are very stressful for individuals. I hope this at least gives you some ideas.",
