  "title:": "How to get a masters in Computer Science coming from non-computer science background?",
  "text": "I graduated summa cum laude from Ohio State University with a bachelors degree in Accounting from their Honors college in 2018. I worked for two years in M&A + Finance, and have spent the last year in a career transition to software engineering. I am currently working a job in IT and researching ways to meet the requirements to be admitted to the CS graduate program in spite of my non-CS bachelors. Is this graduate certificate offered by Umass Dartmouth something that will help fill the gaps + prove that I understand computer science fundamentals + data structures and algorithms? I feel that no Masters program will seriously consider me without the pre-reqs that they require. My local CC doesn't have most of the pre-reqs, and for others, I'd have to take a bunch of useless classes to be later able to take what I need. Additionally, online learning would better suit my lifestyle. The cost of 10k seems affordable.\n\nI am currently (and have been, for the past 1.5 years) studying on my own, working on personal projects, and have also completed a coding bootcamp. I study data structures and algorithms on my own. I have a job in IT with the promise of being brought on as a developer with time. That being said, I want to eventually be seriously considered for a graduate degree in Computer Science - and was wondering if this would be a good way to do it.",

      "text": "I have a BS in biochemistry and was accepted (with funding) into the MSCS program at my undergrad uni (ended up turning down the offer to do a PhD in comp bio) . Similarly to you, I worked in tech as a software engineer for a year before applying. I also took a data structures course during undergrad.\n\nBut yeah, I *definitely* did not have all the pre-reqs and still got in. So it's possible! I think it helped that I already had a track record where I was applying - not sure if I would have gotten in to a similarly ranked program elsewhere. Also, not sure if you're going for a research based or taught program, but I think taught programs tend to be a bit less selective, since you're literally paying to be there (as opposed to them paying you to do research). Good luck!",

(Whether or not you intend to apply there)\n\nAfter all, they are very familiar with the certificate program. They should also be able to answer questions about whether or not other schools would accept that certificate program in lieu of an undergraduate degree in computer science.",
