  "title:": "Quick Question regarding grading scale",
  "text": "Hi all! \nI am just wondering how different grading scale work when applying for grad school. I graduated from a small, private nursing school which does not have + or - for grading (93-100 A, 88-92 B so on). I remember back in high school there was grading scale bottom of transcript. Does that work same for grad school? I am really worried since having no + or - did affect my gpa pretty hard.\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "It probably did affect your GPA, because a B is 3.0 and an A is 4.0. If you made a 92, you would have gotten a 3.5 rather than a 3.0. \n\nI think it varies by school, but when they request your transcripts they look at the grading scale of your previous institution compared to theirs. If you made a B, and a B is 88-92 and that overlaps with what they would consider an A-, then they might convert your GPA at their institution based on your B being an A- there, so your converted GPA would be higher than what is on your transcript. \n\nI'm sure they don't just take it at face value because grading scales can differ widely by school.",
