  "text": "I work full time as a teacher as well as working on my Master\u2019s part-time in Developmental Psychology. As a teacher, I don\u2019t have a typical 9-5 job, and COVID really made my field much harder. \n\nAnd I rationally know that what I\u2019m about to say is stupid, but I just need to vent. \n\nThis is my second semester of this program and I contemplated increasing my course load from two to three. Yet I\u2019m already so exhausted and facing work difficulties. I know I shouldn\u2019t add another course next semester, but I feel as if I\u2019m failing by not getting through my degree fast enough. I\u2019ll be 30 soon, and I guess I feel this rush to have accomplished so much. \n\nI\u2019m so tired, and I also feel as if I shouldn\u2019t be because it\u2019s only my second semester, but I\u2019m almost embarrassed that I\u2019m not further along. \n\nUgh, my anxiety and depression are really just getting to me lately.",
