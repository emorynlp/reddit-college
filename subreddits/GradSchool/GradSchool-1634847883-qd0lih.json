  "text": "I work full time as a teacher as well as working on my Master\u2019s part-time in Developmental Psychology. As a teacher, I don\u2019t have a typical 9-5 job, and COVID really made my field much harder. \n\nAnd I rationally know that what I\u2019m about to say is stupid, but I just need to vent. \n\nThis is my second semester of this program and I contemplated increasing my course load from two to three. Yet I\u2019m already so exhausted and facing work difficulties. I know I shouldn\u2019t add another course next semester, but I feel as if I\u2019m failing by not getting through my degree fast enough. I\u2019ll be 30 soon, and I guess I feel this rush to have accomplished so much. \n\nI\u2019m so tired, and I also feel as if I shouldn\u2019t be because it\u2019s only my second semester, but I\u2019m almost embarrassed that I\u2019m not further along. \n\nUgh, my anxiety and depression are really just getting to me lately.",

      "text": "Please take your time and dont feel pressured to finish your degree by certain age. Your health (mental and physical) is more important than anything. Besides, if you take your time and dont completely exhaust yourself, yeah you will finish your degree a little later but get better grades and wont be depressed and burned out. The burn out is noticeable, in your work, in your hw, everywhere. \n\nIm an undergrad applying for grad school, and im 31. I know that time is ticking but id rather take my time than rush through it and hate my time in school.",
