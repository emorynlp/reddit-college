I opted for the second cuz 120 pages of one thing sounded intimidating, don't worry, people have let me know I'm dumb a lot since then.\n\nAnyway, I'm on a pretty tight deadline rn for somewhere in February of next year. I just sent in the content complete of the first of my four ideas, my readings folder has about 70ish pieces of which I maybe generously used half in the actual paper. If I want to finish on time (which I absolutely HAVE TO, can't afford to pay again) I need to be more efficient. \n\nThe area I've marked for improvement is the research rabbit hole, how do you know when to stop? Where's the line between time wasting and finding an amazingly apt articulation of the same problem you're tackling?", "author": "OsisofThulliver", "created": 1632484983, "retrieved": 1632952079, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"he3qb78": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puiat5/how_much_reading_is_too_much_reading/he3qb78/", "text": "First, you\u2019re not dumb for splitting your writing into two smaller pieces. I\u2019ve read a lot, and I mean A LOT of scholarly journals, books, etc. I\u2019ve read 300 page books that could have been 150 more times than I can count. I\u2019ve read 50 page journals that could have been 20. A lot of people in academia just fluff to fill space, including prestigious scholars at high ranking universities. There is often a tendency to hammer home a point to the point of redundancy. I\u2019d rather read two 60 page papers that are fluent and well done than one 120 page paper full of fluff. \n\nSecond, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really about doing too much reading for a subject as much as how you read them. If you have some journals you\u2019re reading which tackle the same subject, you can largely skim through most of them to find similarities and differences in approach and what that achieved in terms of results. If the same point is hammered in each of them, well, move on. You\u2019re likely not going to find much worth. \n\nLastly, you need to do as much reading as is necessary to A: show that you\u2019ve done enough research to have a solid understanding of what you\u2019re working on and B: fulfill any sort of requirement you\u2019re university sets. If B standard is not set, trust you\u2019re gut on A, and get a second opinion, perhaps from your advisor/supervisor or from classmates/colleagues. \n\nBasically, you\u2019re question is subjective to what you\u2019re doing and what you\u2019re hoping to achieve, and it\u2019s never a bad thing to ask for help.", "author": "itsajackel", "created": 1632498149, "upvotes": 1}}}
