This whole term this class has tried to make things more difficult by creating 'trick' questions that border on incorrect answers. I am an expert professionally in the course material, and am just taking this course to get through my concentration.\n\n1. Practice Exam Question Description: \"Subsequent Motorcycle Accidents (The Outcome of Interest)\"\n2. TA explanation of why we got a question wrong: \"The outcome of interest is motorcycle accidents  (not subsequent motorcycle accidents)\"\n3. Since the exam description and the explanation directly conflict, I proceed to email the TA because the group forum is closed today. In response to me asking if there is an error in the practice exam description, TA tells me no and that \"TAs are not allowed to answer questions via email.... I believe my previous response is correct\" and \"there is some ambiguity\"\n\nI work part time because this program is so expensive, and did not have time to post yesterday when the forum was open. The program is also priced as tho it is in person, but has gone predominantly online despite promises to hold certain class types in person (with only a few days notice before the courses were supposed to begin). Why am I in debt to an institution that doesn't support its students? I am basically just learning how to take an exam with terrible questions, not learning or reinforcing any of the material. Higher education is such elitist BS.", "author": "Routine_Dragonfruit", "created": 1632763782, "retrieved": 1632843906, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hehvapp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwm141/why_i_hate_grad_school_a_3_part_series/hehvapp/", "text": "I've never heard of TA's not being allowed to answer questions via email lol That makes no sense. I don't know what this university is like, but when I was a TA answering student emails was literally a part of the job. I would routinely get students asking about assignments, but only if the explanation required more than it was worth to type out in an email would I ask them to schedule a meeting to discuss it. It seems really odd that TA's are \"not allowed\" to answer questions via email. If your university is mostly online, then I find it even more perplexing that they said they cant answer questions via email. \n\nI also don't know what the assignment looked like, but if the assignment literally said \"Subsequent Motorcycle Accidents (The Outcome of Interest)\" then it looks like the fault of the person who developed the assignment for not being more clear.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1632764850, "upvotes": 8}}}
