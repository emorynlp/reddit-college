  "text": "I work in the field of equity and engineering. I\u2019m a white woman. I love working in equity and incorporating it into my research and helping move towards real change.\n\nBut I\u2019m am SO incredibly burnt out. I spend more of my time volunteering for committees and stuff than doing actual work on my research. I feel so incredibly guilty saying no, because I know I\u2019m the most privileged one volunteering most often in the space. \n\nI\u2019m responding to emails until 2am right now. Emails that are telling me I need to provide times to meet next week to create a DEI newsletter. \n\nI\u2019m so tired. And I\u2019m so stressed. I don\u2019t know how to say \u201cno\u201d without coming across as a bitch, especially because I\u2019m the one in the room with power because of who I am.\n\nBut it is so unsustainable. It makes me want to quit doing equity work all together. I\u2019m so torn, I\u2019m so tired, and I always feel guilty. Help.\n\nEdit: None of this work I\u2019m referring to is at the university level. It is national level work- national committees for a variety of organizations in my field I\u2019ve been involved in for a couple years now.",

      "text": "People are a complex blend of experiences, identities, baggage, and relationships so I don't want to assume why you're feeling what you are. If your guilt is driven by a feeling of \"I should do more, I am more privileged, thus I should suffer more\" then ask yourself why you feel the need to be the lone savior? That's not coherent, you're punishing yourself rather than lifting each other up, nor is it useful in building equitable, accessible, or anti racist institutions. Burned out people make for bad workers.\n\nThere are whole committees of people you work with, who, if they want to improve equity and are operating in good faith should understand one person doing a ton of work until 2AM isnt very equitable. Lean in on these people, part of community building is having people you can trust and rely on to help when things get tough. Unless you are genetically privileged to be one of those people to operate fine on 4 hours of sleep, you're hurting yourself, and won't be as effective at advancing your research goals or building more equitable academia. It takes a village, and neither your committee nor you can't expect to do this kinda thing on your own. \n\nAsk for help, be honest with the people you work with about what you need in terms of relaxing the demands, and just make sure everyone's expectations are on the same page. If they are in it to build equity and not just pad the resume and build a career in DEI (which is a real problem, lots of jaded careerists just saying the right lingo to the right people), then they'll understand.",

What you said makes sense in regards to that.\n\nI\u2019m running into an issue with one very demanding person who continues to put more pressure on me to do things because of my privilege. I get why. But it isn\u2019t working, like you said. I\u2019ll set up a meeting with her next week to chat about what you brought up (expectations, etc.). (I\u2019m not the only one overwhelmed by this person.) \n\nNeeded this, thanks!",

      "text": "Remember that a mentally healthy, passionate, consistent you is of more value than a burnt out you. If that means you need to scale back a bit on the extra DEI things then do it. Be kick ass at your research and the (fewer) extras that you take on. From a practical stand point a gracious way to say no may be to suggest others who could help out instead of you. You're absolutely allowed to just say no though. \n\nThis is more my two cents and maybe bad advice, idk, but have you examined why you feel so compelled to do all this work in relation to your own privilege? Guilt or shame? Anger? Desire to lift others up?  Compassion or empathy? In my experience, if there is any ounce of trying to do this out of some need for penitence you will burn out quicker. Come to terms with the privilege you do have and humbly wield it for what is good, don't run from it. Easier said than done because it sure is a lot to unpack. This may not apply to you, so I may be writing this more for me than you, but I think it's important to think about.",

              "text": "Honestly, your response here is very self-telling. First, privilege is not something you can fully measure, and it's concerning that it's become this way. Take gender and race, these result in privileges that aren't fully comparable. One person could be more likely to be killed while walking around late at night while another person could be more likely to be killed during a traffic stop. The point of intersectionality is not to measure which is worse, but to say that both are bad and we are stronger together advocating for both people to be safer.\n\nAs for \"helping\"...\n\nI'm lgbtq and cis-het people trying to do dei work for us is a nightmare. So many people don't listen to our community's needs. They read one Twitter thread or listen to one vocal activist and assume that everyone in the community wants that. Take pronouns. At my grad school, our old DEI coordinator (a white cis-het woman) made everyone say pronouns each week in her DEI class. Many of us actually in the community, including me, believe that practice is unsafe. We don't think that people should have to choose between lying and outing themselves to people who might not be sympathetic or understanding. In queer spaces, we collectively understand that outing someone else is a big no-no. In a majority cis-het space, if I'm not fully out, I run a big risk coming out to the whole group because many of them don't understand that.\n\nLook around and ask yourself: do my fellow students in those communities I am trying to serve support my work? Am I ever condescending towards them, or am I listening to them? If I am amplifying a voice, and someone else from that community expresses concern, what is my reaction? Am I willing to share the stage, so to speak, with people from those communities? Who comes to my events? Am I being the \"white savior? What does my ultimate goal look like?\n\nIf your goal in these activities is actually self-serving, then of course you'll burn out. It's clearly not having the effect you desire for yourself.",
