I've gotten very healthy dynamics with some of my grad school professors and others where the feedback I get kind of is always downturned. \n\nEver since Covid a lot of internships have closed because of social restrictions. One of my professors offered me a space for an opportunity to combine another clinical practice while doing my internship. However, this would be revised with my clinical internship chief. \n\nI wrote a letter of intention, sent the request towards it. I was mindful, there was the possibility of either receiving a confirmation to do the practice as well as a refusal for it. \n\nWhat I didn't saw coming and it felt weirdly off, disrespectful was that one of the reasons is that \"I get easily overwhelmed\". Is this professional? How often do professors \"know you that well\"?", "author": "BlissMeli", "created": 1631147909, "retrieved": 1632952751, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc54eok": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkmyxu/has_a_professor_closed_an_opportunity_for_you/hc54eok/", "text": "I think it\u2019s insensitive for your professor to phrase it that way.

Then the Chief told you that what your professor told them was the reason that they passed on you? If so, it sounds perfectly on the up-and-up, and honestly kind of nice for the Chief to give you some feedback.\n\nI also don't think it's fair to say the professor \"closed\" the opportunity for you. I mean, they opened it for you in the first place. And if their judgment of you is that you get easily overwhelmed, well it's up to you to give a different impression, and for the Chief to interpret that and make a decision about whether you get this opportunity.
