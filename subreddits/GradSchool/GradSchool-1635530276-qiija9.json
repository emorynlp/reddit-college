  "text": "Well.. I really didn\u2019t think anything could make me quit. I\u2019m in my first semester of my MSW. I started the semester with a debilitating chronic pain disease, so I knew it was going to be hard. It\u2019s been pretty well managed all that being said. I have good doctors and all that. Of course, grad school is super stressful. Throughout the semester, I was really struggling with my anxiety to the point that I would have to leave the classroom to breathe. This is not typical for me, so I figured it was post-pandemic weirdness. I am getting migraines, light sensitivity, still I figured it was just grad school stress. I\u2019m still pushing through. My brain fog is getting worse and so is my recall.. this can be a pain symptom and with all the anxiety I figure it makes sense. I\u2019m actually doing okay in my classes as of right now. But I just found out I have a relatively large cyst/tumor in my brain that\u2019s causing these symptoms. I say cyst/tumor because they\u2019re not sure yet what it is. The messed up thing is that I\u2019m not sure what to do about school. I won\u2019t get any money back if I withdraw now, but I have so many appointments coming up and I\u2019m completely fear stricken. I can\u2019t feel/move the left side of my body well. My other disease is disabling of my right hand and arm. It is so hard to leave what I worked so hard for. People in my life keep saying \u201cwell if you leave now, are you ever going to go back, or is this it?\u201d as if I have a choice. I want to have a choice, try to finish these classes, but I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll remember them if I do. I guess I\u2019m just venting. Jfc I never in a million years thought this would happen to me\n\n*edited for clarity",

      "text": "I think you have a lot of options here. Talking to profs and trying to make it through the semester; taking incompletes and finishing at a slower pace; taking an official leave of absence for your medical issues; getting formal accomodations for missing class, taking tests, or turning in assignments later due to disability. Your university probably has a whole division to deal with emergency situations like this (and perhaps even $ assistance - I got $2,000 from my school after a bad back injury, from our grad emergency hardship fund). Definitely reach out and start asking questions of your prof/advisor - they can help get you in touch with the people who can help you navigate this. \nSo sorry You are going through this, but now that you are actually in graduate school, there are a lot of options for taking time off, and you probably won\u2019t have to reapply\u2026 Take advantage of all the resources you can, and I hope you feel better",

I\u2019ve talked to one prof and I have more meetings coming up next week, things are gradually sorting themselves out. This really gave me a bit of breathing room I didn\u2019t even think was out there. Great point about incompletes.. I was still thinking of them in the undergrad sense but I suppose in grad school people care less about them",
