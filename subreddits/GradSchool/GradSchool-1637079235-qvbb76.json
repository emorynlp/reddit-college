  "text": "Hey all, I am applying to Master of Marketing Research programs. There are about 5 in the US. Has anyone has any experience in these programs or comparing the different schools and how you chose the best one? They all seem quite similar online.\n\nUGA, Southern Illinois Edwardsville, U Texas Arlington, Michigan State.\n\nI am in contact with all of the schools and the best option seems to be UGA or Southern Illinois. However, they are almost so seemingly similar it's hard to tell which is the best option. Thanks for any insight!",
