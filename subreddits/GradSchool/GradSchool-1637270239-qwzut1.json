  "text": "Let me clarify. I'm applying to University in the US for a master's in CS that's course or project based. It's clear that companies don't care about the brand/rank of a uni and what matters is your performance during the coding interviews (though higher ranked colleges have better career fairs and it's easier to get an interview). I've also been told that the mscs programs in top unis are too intense. Now given that the uni doesn't really matter I'd like to go an uni that'd make life more pleasant. So do you which unis offer a good study-life balance and have a good student life for mscs/mcs.",
