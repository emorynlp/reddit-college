  "text": "Hey Everyone,\n\nSome backstory - early in August, I was awarded one of the most coveted fellowships in my Faculty (essentially pays for all tuition and stipend for my whole PhD).  Today, I received a phone call that this was done in error, and the award was actually meant for someone else, and that they will be removing the award from my file today.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they accidentally removed my currently active award as well (smaller 1-year award), so now I have zero funds (and tuition is due today).  I told my department that they removed my currently active award as well and they told me that it would take at least a week to sort things out on their end... which means I also won't be able to pay rent.  For context, the awards office, the tuition office, and my department are all separate entities at my university, which means I don't automatically get an extension on my tuition and that I have to apply for an extension.\n\nNot only was this a huge blow to my finances, but it also just shattered my confidence as I thought that I really earned that fellowship... which might also negatively hurt a lot of my award/scholarship applications since I have to now contact those award committees to inform them that I need to remove the award from my CV.\n\nI'm just a little lost - and I feel like I have no footing to argue from... it's not like I can complain to my department to give me the award back, and I already told them I need the money from my existing award ASAP.  I'm disappointed, angry, sad, and overall I just feel defeated.  I think I just wanted to rant - anyway, thank you for reading this.",

This was despite her checking before she applied, and the assurances that it was ok. So it was rescinded. Since that was the funding her PI was relying on to fund her, and he was an ahole in general, he dropped her from the lab, would not even keep her on unpaid to finish her paper.\n\nSo this sort of thing never ends.",

I asked why were using Sequel 2012 test 70-462 as it was officially retired by microsoft.  \n\nThe comment I received was that the faculty also brought this up to administration however our administrators felt that by the time they were notified it was too late to update because many of the students had already purchased the course materials. \n\nSo essentially we were notified the first day that we would be paying $2.4k to learn outdated material and should we choose to drop the course we\u2019d only be reimbursed up to 50% of the cost of the course.\n\nIts not our fuck up but somehow it makes sense that we should pay for it.",

I was due for a $7500 scholarship from the same source & was concerned that the $5k would make it so I wouldn't get my owed $7.5k, but it would only apply to my last term of undergrad -- which, of course, they only applied *the full year later*. So, they removed the $5k one and waited a year to apply the $7.5k one, and ultimately I ended up with $1000 or so refunded on my last term due to the number of scholarships which applied at that time. \n\nBUT in the meantime, I still had to scrounge up $5k I didn't have partway through. If they had fixed it in time I would have used FAFSA for the term they had messed up, but I couldn't apply FAFSA to the amount of money they wanted at the start of my senior year. Ugh!",

Not to sound like a Karen, but this is the only way to get things done in these admin offices in universities. It\u2019s ridiculous how separated they are from each other despite having to work so close with each other. Don\u2019t call. Don\u2019t email. Walk in and tell them you are not paying your tuition and that the awards office should pay any late penalties that you may get. You were not expected to pay from your own money and, more importantly, you don\u2019t have the money to do so. \n\nI had a situation a year or so ago where the admissions department said that I had graduated when all I did was transition from being a masters student to being a PhD. In this transition, they were supposed to change my expected graduation date to match that of my PhD. They didn\u2019t though. I got emails about my students loans needing to be due and that my interest had compounded because my old expected graduation date had passed. In short, if this was not fixed, I would have had an additional $2000 in interest to pay that I wasn\u2019t expecting. I went to the admissions office, showed them their mistake and made them get into contact with the federal loan services to reverse the interest compounding.\n\nThis is a messed up situation in all ways but you need to realize that you did nothing wrong and should not be forced to pay for the mistakes of others. Go to that office and get angry. Don\u2019t be nice. Don\u2019t be sympathetic. They made a mistake and need to fix it. They shouldn\u2019t be free from repercussions while you are here bearing the brunt of their mistake.",

When the people we trust, admire, and look to for guidance (or at the very least have to answer to) aggregiously mishandle a situation that not only impacts our academic and professional opportunities, but our entire perception of our abilities as an individual, of course we feel lost. That lostness trickles down from the top. You have every right to feel angry, upset, dissapointed, and confused. When our world gets turned on its head, we see more clearly what we do and don't have any control over in our lives, and that can be very disorienting to process.\n\nAt the same time, the sun will always rise again. Although you can't regain this stolen opportunity, your education and career path will continue. You were still the same person you've always been when the fellowship was awarded, and you are still the same person now having lost it. Winning or losing the award doesn't actually define anything about who you are, what you're capable of, and what you will do in the future. There may be very real financial and emotional ramifications from this, but  those people don't get to define your identity-- you define that for yourself. You know worth and you know what you're capable of; just try to be kind to yourself while you untangle your sense of self from their fuck-up. You have so much more to offer than this one small moment could ever predict. \u2764",

I hope that the logistics get sorted out quickly so you can pay your rent and tuition, but I did want to make one comment on the confidence aspect: I can totally understand how this would be a blow to your confidence, but keep in mind that you don't need to earn the most coveted fellowship in your faculty to be a perfectly competent grad student. It's totally understandable that this would take the wind out of your sails in the moment, but try not to let it define you as a professional.",

At ours there are multiple relief funds at the college, student org, and misc dept level for this kind of situation. Even if you can't find something listed online it's out there.

If they're sure they'll win, you can ask to only pay if they do. If they tell you you're shit out of luck, you likely are. \n\nB) If you'll have to pay the lawyer regardless of outcome, you may be able to get the costs reimbursed by your government (called Legal Aid).",
