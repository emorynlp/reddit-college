Today, I received a phone call that this was done in error, and the award was actually meant for someone else, and that they will be removing the award from my file today.\n\nTo add insult to injury, they accidentally removed my currently active award as well (smaller 1-year award), so now I have zero funds (and tuition is due today).  I told my department that they removed my currently active award as well and they told me that it would take at least a week to sort things out on their end... which means I also won't be able to pay rent.  For context, the awards office, the tuition office, and my department are all separate entities at my university, which means I don't automatically get an extension on my tuition and that I have to apply for an extension.\n\nNot only was this a huge blow to my finances, but it also just shattered my confidence as I thought that I really earned that fellowship... which might also negatively hurt a lot of my award/scholarship applications since I have to now contact those award committees to inform them that I need to remove the award from my CV.\n\nI'm just a little lost - and I feel like I have no footing to argue from... it's not like I can complain to my department to give me the award back, and I already told them I need the money from my existing award ASAP.  I'm disappointed, angry, sad, and overall I just feel defeated.  I think I just wanted to rant - anyway, thank you for reading this.", "author": "CluelessLabManager", "created": 1631040735, "retrieved": 1632844702, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 720, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdkczir": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pjtc6m/i_was_awarded_a_fellowship_in_error/hdkczir/", "text": "Friend who is a postdoc won a grant.
