I have my masters degree and work full time as a professional engineer, but I still have that itch to go back and get the PhD. I feel as though I stopped short by not getting the PhD. I genuinely love to learn and hate the feeling of not being academically challenged anymore. I would rather not have to go in person to a campus and like the idea of chipping away at the PhD on my own time.", "author": "cireyes1", "created": 1631681367, "retrieved": 1632844556, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "comments": {"hcy5joe": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pojcd3/online_mechanical_engineering_phd_programs_abet/hcy5joe/", "text": "My brother just recently finished his PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Iowa State, working mostly online.
