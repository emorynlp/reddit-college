  "text": "College senior planning out what I want to do in the future. I am a psychology major, so like I really need graduate school if I want to get anywhere. Except, I was an idiot and didn't built up relationships with any of my professors so now I have no one to ask to write me a letter of rec. Anyways, I am in between whether I want to get my MPH or MSW.  I feel like I could really benefit from gaining more experience, but at the same time everyone around me is telling me to go straight into grad school.  Plus, I'm so unsure with what I want to do in the future. Looking for any kind of advice...Thanks",

      "text": "Having any kind of workplace experience within your field will give you professional context for better understanding what you learn in graduate school. So taking a year or two to gain some experience would be a good thing. And even just being in an office of a mental health service as an administrative assistant would show to graduate school a dedication to working in the field.\n\nHowever, a lot of people who go into the workplace with that intention never make it back to graduate school. Life ends up getting in the way with the many obligations that one starts to accrue outside of college.\n\nThat being said, if you made A's in your junior and senior level psychology classes, you can still ask for a recommendation letter from a professors even if you didn't build a personal relationship with them. \n\nSend them an email, explain that you're going to graduate school, and send them copies of the papers you wrote for their class so that they can look again at your work. Also, give them a copy of your resume as that may have other information they find useful. Professor's often write recommendation letters in this circumstance, as they are very happy to find out that one of their students, even if they didn't know them, wants to pursue graduate work in their field.\n\nYou need to do it soon if you're going to apply for graduate school next year. Give them a couple months to write the letter. Be sure to also waive your right to see the letter, as graduate programs tend to view such letter more reliable than the ones where students didn't waive their rights. And if they agreed to do it, follow up a month before the letters need to be submitted. Just ask if they need any more information.",

      "text": "Hi, \n\nI graduated 4 years ago with my BA and went into the workforce. I gained experience, work ethic and realized what I did and didn\u2019t want to study. Now I\u2019m in graduate school while I work and so far it has been working out. \n\nOnly go straight into graduate school if the career you chose requires your graduate degree. Don\u2019t go simply cause you don\u2019t know what to do. What happens if you randomly enroll in a MSW program and hate it? \n\nI would gain some experience, do more research, maybe even take some cheap online courses in a field you might be interested in.",
