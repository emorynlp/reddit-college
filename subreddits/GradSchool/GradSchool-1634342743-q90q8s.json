  "text": "Hi, I graduated a year ago with a bachelors in computer science, and have been working for the past year as a SWE. Can\u2019t really complain about the job all too much, the pay was worth the stress of school and I\u2019m glad I finally made it out. \n\nI\u2019ve been exploring where I should go with my career and I realized that I don\u2019t wanna go into management or anything, and I don\u2019t wanna just write code and build apps. I\u2019ve been watching tutorials and doing small projects on my own to learn about electronics, circuits and other hardware and exploring the space industry (with the recent success of spaceX and blue origin) as well as robotics and other stuff.\n\nMy question is, should I apply for to grad school to continue in a similar subject like computer engineering, or even electrical engineering, or would getting another bachelors degree in say computer engineering be better?",
