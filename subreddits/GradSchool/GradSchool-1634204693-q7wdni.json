      "text": "I got my undergrad degree in biomedical engineering and had a few internships, but the jobs didn't sound so interesting to me. I went on to get a master's in mathematics and now live comfortably as a software engineer for a large bank. It seems like most of my peers went to low-paying jobs at hospitals for roles such as \"research coordinator\", very few got actual engineering-related positions, and many others remained unemployed 1-2 years before going back to school. I must note that my undergrad institution is really really shitty and obscure, though. From a reputable program I'm sure the job prospects out of a 4 year degree are much better and with a willingness to relocate that helps have more options.",
