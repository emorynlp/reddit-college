  "text": "I'm starting the fourth year of my PhD, and I have a chronic illness that often manifests as a brain fog. One piece of advice I have for other people who are dealing with similar circumstances: Take thorough notes on *everything*. Not just on how you're doing your experiments but even your manuscript writing, papers you may someday want to check out and why, and really any thoughts you've had about anything related to your research or career because you never know when it will slip away. Write notes like you're writing to your collaborator (or even a mentee) and you want them to fully understand your reasoning and goals. Anything you can do to keep your thoughts straight in your brain will help you in the long run.\n\nAnyone else have any ways of dealing with brain fog during grad school?",

      "text": "I'm not in grad school (one day!) but lurk here. \n\nDo you have any advice to reading book chapters specifically? For papers I usually just make a note about what they were about, but for book chapters where I need to actually know in more detail I'm struggling to read at a pace that is ideal. \n\nIt took me 1.5-2 hours today to read a short chapter on a topic I'm already semi-familisr with because I was making extensive notes. If I don't make notes, and just read, I tend to zone out or find that, after I've read a book, I can't recall arguments or find that later I can't recall where I need to go find something to cite it or etc. \n\nI've been back and forth on this a lot, and I'm thinking I'm doing to go back to a less note-oriented approach, but... Idk, this feeling that I'm spinning my wheels is frustrating.",

      "text": "I found a medication that busts it completely!\n\nI'd tried every drug on-schedule for years and none of them had any positive effect whatsoever, but then one of my friends in university was dabbling with some different supplements, I agreed to try some, and it worked. My doctor agreed to give me an off-label prescription. There have already been trials showing it works for my condition, so hopefully it'll move to on-label soon. \n\nIf you have really debilitating fog, I think it's worthwhile discussing it with your doctor. Maybe you have a condition you weren't aware of, or maybe there's a different medication you can try. Electrolytes, hydration, exercise are good at what they do, but if you have ADHD and you need medication for ADHD, pure lifestyle changes probably won't kick that.",

And then I read about the Russian olympic team using rhodiola for their athletes.\n\nI got some the next day (can\u2019t remember brand, if it was mixed, etc, as this was in 2003)\n\nAnyways, took some when I got home. Decided I\u2019d better work while I could that night, as I had about 10 minutes in me. \n\n4 hours later, I move away from my desk after completing 4-5 hours of focused hard work like I\u2019d always done. It felt surprising because the fog and exhaustion had been lifted.\n\nSo I highly recommend taking rhodiola. It did absolute wonders for me.\n\nI hope you have as good luck as I had.",

      "text": "I experienced heavy brain fog during my later grad period due to medication for gender transitioning. I was told by my advisor to \"Leave school and solve your problems.\" When I didn't, my advisor constructed more problems. Ultimately, I switched medications, but also left my graduate program behind as my advisor was a toxic dump of narcissism. The ensuing homelessness also contributed to \"brain fog\" as priorities readjust. I'm so scarred from that period that I don't think I'd ever be able to return to a graduate program and succeed. I concentrate now on things that are less abstract and more tangible, which helps.\n\nThat being said: exercise. Regular, uncompromising exercise was the only thing that kept my head above water. My device was running. I got pretty good at it. My fueul was anger and frustration and it provided some space for constructive thinking. Every hour I could spend running was an hour I wasn't thinking about how to end my life. Eventually, I ran away from that program. Here I am, still breathing. Walking does wonders too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAristotle had it right: a motile conversation works wonders for discourse, even if it's only with your own person.",

LOL.... tbh i think it's mainly due from my non-existent sleep schedule (a whole other story), but i write down a lot of things as well!\n\nas a stem grad student, \n\n* i'm pretty good at writing things by hand/laptop nearly verbatim now -- in one ear and out the other hand, i'll go process it later. the actual writing itself is helpful for me too, when i see where i took time to write extra notes, etc, i can remember what else i was thinking at the time.\n* sooo many calendars. i have a google and 2 different written versions (one that i keep with me), and a to-do app on my phone, all basically the same thing with some modifications but just multiple reminders for me in multiple places. the act of doing the writing is also very helpful!\n* i keep pen/paper or notebook handy all the time. sticky notes are really helpful!\n* i never assume i will remember something lol. when a thought passes by, instantly get it down!\n* i find actual pen/paper to be more helpful than typing things out. the physical act and physical manifestation of what i need to do stuck to me more than just typing things.\n* date everything!\n* consistency/habits also really helpful -- doing things in the same order/way all the time could help me figure out how to troubleshoot when things went wrong.",

But I had really low blood-brain perfusion at the time. When not as severe, I'm forgetful (mostly of names/dates/appts), have trouble thinking of words, will forget my meds or if I've even taken them and double up by accident.\n\nI use a calendar app, set alarms, and use my note app (with checkboxes!) for EVERYTHING.\n\n A weekly med organizer for my pills and vitamins helps, but I still use an alarm to remind me to take my meds every day lol.",

The result is that everything I do and think during class is completely searchable; even if I don't remember the details, I can look up a word or two and have an easy-to-read summary of both the information and what I thought when I first learned it. Also means I don't have to carry anything other than my laptop when I go off to study. \n\nOf course this takes a lot of time and energy, but I've found that taking the time when I can makes my life sooooo much better on days when I am less ok.",

Use this time to find and organize the notes that you've taken on stuff throughout the week/month - I don't know about other chronically ill folks, but my brain fog lifts and falls at the most random of times, so I tend to leave a trail of notes behind me that I may or may not find again. Setting aside deliberate time to find, go back through, and put those notes in their proper places really helps. Saturday around noon is when I usually keep my self-appointments, since I use Sunday for prepping the next week.\n\nOn top of that, keep redundant notes but try to keep a predictable system. I write my to do lists on Trello, in a discord accountability server, and sometimes in my journal when I remember it exists. My meeting and research notes exist in either my Notion or a dedicated notebook that I keep in my bag or on my desk at all times. When systems cross, I end up losing notes for weeks or months because it isn't where it's supposed to be",
