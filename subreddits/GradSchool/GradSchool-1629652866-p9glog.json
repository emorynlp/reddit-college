One piece of advice I have for other people who are dealing with similar circumstances: Take thorough notes on *everything*. Not just on how you're doing your experiments but even your manuscript writing, papers you may someday want to check out and why, and really any thoughts you've had about anything related to your research or career because you never know when it will slip away. Write notes like you're writing to your collaborator (or even a mentee) and you want them to fully understand your reasoning and goals. Anything you can do to keep your thoughts straight in your brain will help you in the long run.\n\nAnyone else have any ways of dealing with brain fog during grad school?", "author": "catcherofthecatbutts", "created": 1629652866, "retrieved": 1632845382, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 501, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"ha1frbe": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p9glog/hot_tip_for_those_doing_grad_school_with_brain_fog/ha1frbe/", "text": "I'm not in grad school (one day!) but lurk here. \n\nDo you have any advice to reading book chapters specifically? For papers I usually just make a note about what they were about, but for book chapters where I need to actually know in more detail I'm struggling to read at a pace that is ideal. \n\nIt took me 1.5-2 hours today to read a short chapter on a topic I'm already semi-familisr with because I was making extensive notes. If I don't make notes, and just read, I tend to zone out or find that, after I've read a book, I can't recall arguments or find that later I can't recall where I need to go find something to cite it or etc. \n\nI've been back and forth on this a lot, and I'm thinking I'm doing to go back to a less note-oriented approach, but...

My doctor agreed to give me an off-label prescription. There have already been trials showing it works for my condition, so hopefully it'll move to on-label soon. \n\nIf you have really debilitating fog, I think it's worthwhile discussing it with your doctor. Maybe you have a condition you weren't aware of, or maybe there's a different medication you can try. Electrolytes, hydration, exercise are good at what they do, but if you have ADHD and you need medication for ADHD, pure lifestyle changes probably won't kick that.", "author": "officially_anxious", "created": 1629718229, "upvotes": 2}, "ha0hg8n": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p9glog/hot_tip_for_those_doing_grad_school_with_brain_fog/ha0hg8n/", "text": "I was full Lyme disease in grad school, but had no idea of that fact or why my pain levels were high.

I was told by my advisor to \"Leave school and solve your problems.\" When I didn't, my advisor constructed more problems. Ultimately, I switched medications, but also left my graduate program behind as my advisor was a toxic dump of narcissism. The ensuing homelessness also contributed to \"brain fog\" as priorities readjust. I'm so scarred from that period that I don't think I'd ever be able to return to a graduate program and succeed. I concentrate now on things that are less abstract and more tangible, which helps.\n\nThat being said: exercise. Regular, uncompromising exercise was the only thing that kept my head above water. My device was running. I got pretty good at it. My fueul was anger and frustration and it provided some space for constructive thinking. Every hour I could spend running was an hour I wasn't thinking about how to end my life. Eventually, I ran away from that program. Here I am, still breathing.
