I worked a few years between my BSc and masters, and again for several years between my masters and starting my PhD. That time, and the healthier work ethic I gained in my professional job, helped me to gain a lot of perspective about my previous motivations and study habits in each program. I realized a few things: 1) that I depended completely on the stress that comes with leaving work to the last minute to motivate me to do assignments, and 2) that my procrastination caused me to feel guilt in my free time and either not enjoy other activities as much or not do them altogether (even if all I did was continue to procrastinate during the time I would have been doing the activity). \n\nI decided I didn\u2019t want to live that way for my PhD. It just seemed that I caused myself unneeded stress. I decided I would try to treat my school work like another job - scheduled times slots where I work on tasks. Some of those time slots will be more productive than others, and sometimes the time slot will end without me finishing or I\u2019ll finish before it ends. Either way, I \u201cshow up\u201d each time and try my best regardless of my mood or energy to knock some work out (even if all I have to show for it is a paragraph I end up deleting later on.) I\u2019m slowly training my brain to do school work without the adrenaline that comes with a looming deadline. It\u2019s definitely been a challenge to break old habits.

I think a big contributor to the issue is that we collectively assume work will take the minimum possible amount of time and set our collaborative and personal expectations accordingly.\n\nI would cherish the good mornings and let yourself procrastinate in that case, and similarly appreciate the days you feel good and rewarded while actually working.

Some super stressful deadline will pass, a study will hit a lull, I'll finish a large project, and as that relief settles in I lose all motivation to work. I don't consciously think it, but in retrospect I believe my logic is, \"I've made a little space for myself and can afford to slack off\".\n\nSaid another way I find it much easier to justify procrastination when I'm in good spirits.\n\nOn the one hand it's annoying that I'm seemingly losing the ability to maintain discipline regardless of my mood. I don't know if it's burnout, having a better idea of how far I can push my luck after years in grad school, manic self-sabotage, or something else entirely. But it feels out of my control and I *loathe* that.\n\nOn the other hand, I do appreciate those moments because normally my free time is contaminated with work stress that makes truly unwinding next-to-impossible. I can't seem to control it, so if my mind decides it's able to chill for a bit and not obsessively think about work... well life is short and I take those opportunities when I can get them. \n\nPS - I'm doing the same thing right now. Yesterday went well: a study I've been working on for over a year finally began collecting data and nothing went (too) wrong.
