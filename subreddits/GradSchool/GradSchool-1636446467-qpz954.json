  "title:": "How do you perceive failure in research?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nThis is my 3rd year into PhD and for the past couple of years, I have found myself struggling intensely with feelings of being 'not good enough' and feeling like I will suck at something important and will end up disappointing people (professors and colleagues) who I look up to- basically crippling self-doubt and an intense fear of failure. It was very important for me to be a hard worker who is good at what she does- given how much importance I attach to my work and how much my self-worth is linked to my performance.\n\nSome time into the program, I felt myself burning out and not much later did I realize that 'hustling hard constantly' is not the only way to succeed and also that we do not succeed always. Initially I would find it hard to take any criticism and rejection, despite knowing how it was not about me as a person, but just stuff I need to learn about research and life in general.\n\nThese experiences made me curious about whether other people in research have similar experiences. With this inspiration, I was able to start a study regarding **'how do people involved in research perceive failure'.** So far, I have collected some data and it has been a very enriching and cathartic experience being able to interview and get to know people with similar experiences.\n\nIf you could relate to what I am talking about or if you find it interesting, please consider taking a survey for my study here: [https://iima.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_dbNQixHmTw3TZwq](https://iima.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dbNQixHmTw3TZwq). At the end of the survey, you will receive an option to participate in an interview. Please do consent if you find it interesting wish to support my research.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can drop me a comment/message. I will get back to you.",
