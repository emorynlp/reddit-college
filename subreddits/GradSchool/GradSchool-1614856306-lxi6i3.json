  "title:": "Some advice for dealing with those weeks when you're tired and unfocused",
  "text": "TL;DR Take control and keep a list of low energy, monotonous, tasks. When you have a bad week, make a conscious decision to do one or two items (or however many you want, keep it a low number though) on that list per day, and then spend the rest of the day *resting*.\n\nThis started as a post venting about Zoom fatigue, but we don't need more negativity so I figured I would instead give some unsolicited advice on how I deal with those days/weeks were I have Zoom fatigue or am just generally tired and unfocused.\n\nThere are three key points for me. The first is very simple: Recognize that your body is telling you that you need to rest! You are running on low-power mode and need to charge your batteries.\n\nSecond, I take back some feeling of control and make a conscious decision that I'm going to be less productive than usual, rather than just letting the day(s) slip out of my hands while I try, and fail, to get my usual work done. That way, I'm technically not failing at being productive, I'm succeeding at being less productive!\n\nThe third key is to keep a list of low energy tasks. Most people probably already have one, either physical or in their head. These are basically the tasks you keep saying you'll get to, but never do because they are either super boring or very low priority. For example, clearing your inbox, organizing your project folders, organizing your lab notes, etc. Things you can do mindlessly while listening to audiobooks are great for this list.\n\nWhen you have an off day (or week), pick a couple of items (not too many) on that list and do them. Congratulations, you just made some progress in your work AND you succeeded at being less productive! Now get some rest and try again tomorrow! :)",

I started doing scheduled work which has been great over all, but it also means I really need a range of different energy tasks to do because just because I\u2019m making a commitment to work at certain times doesn\u2019t mean I can force high energy tasks every time. I try to have some tasks I can even do from bed. \n\nI actually plan to build some of these into my schedule on a proactive basis. For example, I have almost no commitments Thursday but I really can\u2019t put in 8 super focused hours in a 9 hour window, so I might just set aside time that day every week for exactly this kind of stuff. I\u2019ll probably benefit from having a specific time to do this stuff anyway since it needs to be done eventually.",

I improved dramatically after restarting doing these things. \n\nWe need to eat well.",
