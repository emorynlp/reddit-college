  "text": "So I am a first year PhD student in chemistry. I am assigned to TA 4 labs this semester; each lab has about 20 students, mostly freshman taking general chemistry. In each lab, I have a co-TA who shares the responsibilities of grading (lab reports, exams, pre-labs, etc) and we split those duties 50/50.\n\nI am born and raised in the United States (Philadelphia, if my username does not make it obvious), but my other TA's are all international (2 are from South America, 1 from Vietnam, and 1 from Sri Lanka)\n\nMost students are American, and tend to avoid the other TA to talk to me. Most only attend my office hours and come to me with questions. They email about attendance without acknowledging the other TA. I have even observed them telling another Co-TA that they did not wish to speak with them and wanted to wait for me.\n\nI know there are international students in this subreddit, so I want to hear your perspective. How would you feel if this were happening... or has this happened? Do you appreciate that someone who speaks English more fluently takes care of such issues, or do you feel disrespected because you know the subject just as well as I do? Would love some input on this",

      "text": "Ask your fellow TAs, not us: \"Hey I've noticed that the students seem to mostly come to me for advice and I want to make sure I'm not stepping on your toes. I think some students may have a false perception that international TAs are less qualified - have you experienced any issues while teaching?\" \n\nOr something like that. It's not like your fellow TAs won't have noticed. You can also push back on students: \"Why don't you ask ____ about that, they know more than I do about xyz!\"",
