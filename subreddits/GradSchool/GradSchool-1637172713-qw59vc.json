  "text": "I\u2019m in my second Master\u2019s first semester and I\u2019m feeling I really don\u2019t belong here. My masters is in One Health, with the hopes of pursuing a PhD in the same field. I\u2019m very much a lab rat, I love doing research and going into the field but when it comes to talking in class, participating, having discussion I\u2019m useless. \n\nI have this online class that is having discussions with my classmates and no matter how much I read about the topics I always seem to find myself without words to contribute. This class is a concentration class and even though I have a good grade I feel I know nothing. I always feel this way in class where I have to be outspoken. My ADHD has my mind having all these thoughts racing at the same time and I can\u2019t grasp one and elaborate on it. And when ai grasp one all I can come up with are very general stuff. And to add to it that I am very introverted and have a lot of social anxiety which doesn\u2019t help. \nI\u2019m even thinking of switching to something more technical if I cant find a field inside of One Health that people like me can fit in. \nI\u2019m also taking a Biostatistics class and even with my record of getting bad grades in math classes I am thriving in this one, I even like it. \nIs my introverted, not outspoken, racy mind, always lacking words self not going to be able to reach a PhD level?",

      "text": "This is how I feel too. Very introverted, could never really find the words to speak up in class discussions. But I can write well if given the time to think about things more so I think that saved me. I just finished a PhD in anthropology this year and was even able to do ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, focus groups etc. despite my intense social anxiety. Just want to give you some hope that it can be done.",
