  "title:": "Why is the UK system so focused on essay writing?",
  "text": "I've written essays  during all my time as undergraduate (studying IR); now for an MA in security - where the modules I'm taking are on 1) how institutions within the government work and report to each other, 2) open source intelligence - all our assignments are still essays. Why not be assessed by doing reports and other forms of research and producing something which can give us new skills (and perhaps also more practical for going into work). I feel like essays have become like a repetitive job ultimately to produce something nobody really cares much about. Perhaps it's just me who sees it this way.",
