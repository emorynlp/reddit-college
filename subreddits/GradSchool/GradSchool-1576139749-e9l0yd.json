  "text": "To all of you that are aware that you're living a miserable life in academia and affraid of quitting due to the judgment of society: quit. No diploma is worth your mental health! My family supported me in my decision after I explained to them how miserable I was and being really open about the whole thing in academia. We're on this loop of \"what if this is the best opportunity I can get?\" and end up having and living miserable lives in the years that are supposed to be the best (young, full of energy etc). Don't be affraid. No diploma is worth your mental health. Sending much support to all of you there!",

Ridiculous. This kind of mentality of yours is the reason why so many people feel depressed in doing something they don't like. Are you a grad student or a scientist already? Hopefully not, as people aspiring to be a scientist can't deny the innumerous amount of papers and research proving depression in work places and all the other mental issues studied out there.
