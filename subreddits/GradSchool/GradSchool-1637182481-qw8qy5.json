  "text": "I\u2019m currently struggling to balance in my head how I thought this would go, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise me, but I\u2019m graduating from my program in the coming spring and all I\u2019ve been hearing from folks in my field has been to expect to be open to move anywhere for work after graduation. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about having a partner, but I would feel more free to live wherever and take risks without thinking about anyone else, rather than thinking about settling in one place, and so forth.\n\nHow do folks who have spouses/partners/families balance these sorts of things? Is it unrealistic/being picky to want to work in a certain region because my partner and I both agree that we\u2019d prefer to live there? At this point, I haven\u2019t had to ask someone to move for me or had to consider someone else\u2019s desire to live somewhere when thinking about the future.",
