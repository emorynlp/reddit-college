  "text": "I\u2019m currently struggling to balance in my head how I thought this would go, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise me, but I\u2019m graduating from my program in the coming spring and all I\u2019ve been hearing from folks in my field has been to expect to be open to move anywhere for work after graduation. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about having a partner, but I would feel more free to live wherever and take risks without thinking about anyone else, rather than thinking about settling in one place, and so forth.\n\nHow do folks who have spouses/partners/families balance these sorts of things? Is it unrealistic/being picky to want to work in a certain region because my partner and I both agree that we\u2019d prefer to live there? At this point, I haven\u2019t had to ask someone to move for me or had to consider someone else\u2019s desire to live somewhere when thinking about the future.",

Not to say it was bad,  it worked out but not being able to apply to jobs anywhere in the US.  \nNow I am the one with the leading career and considering that over the years we established a community of friends etc.  The decision making process is a bit different.",

      "text": "Its a give and take for us. I dragged my wife to a nowhere place so I could get a PhD. She has been able to work remote the whole time, but she is at the point where she would like to get an MBA and is outgrowing her current company. Means we have to move so I couldn't take the easy job offered to me at the government lab here. But it's worked out, I got a job and negotiated to be in one of the offices where my wife wants to go to school and could have a career afterwards. We both like the city so we're pretty excited for the move next summer. I would say go be picky, just understand it's going to be harder. Maybe significantly so. \n\nLikely, the location won't be totally perfect for both of you at the same time. There will be some give and take, but you have to make sure it's not one-sided. Sometimes you will have to sacrifice for a season. Sometimes they will. But if you ask them to, always have a plan to give it back. If you both watch each other's back that way, that's a good relationship. I'd rather have my person than my dream location any day of the week.",

But it\u2019s definitely what I think about - it\u2019s a good reminder that the reason I went to professional school for more stability because that\u2019s what I wanted to bring to  my life (and our relationship) in the first place.
