He assigned me to read review papers just so I can get background on the work his group does. Since these papers are quite long, I was wondering how do you guys read a review paper. Do you print it out and write footnotes? (These PDFs are around 200 pages in total, so may have to buy a tablet instead of printing all of them out)", "author": "EpicGusher", "created": 1630643960, "retrieved": 1632845096, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hbi3os9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgy6al/how_do_you_read_review_papers/hbi3os9/", "text": "Depends on your note-taking style and what you are looking to do after. \n\nI organize everything in zotero which then allows me to open them in drawboard so I can highlight and annotate. I do have a surface pro, so I can use a pen, but it wouldn't be bad with a regular computer. Zotero has a pdf editor now, but I prefer drawboard.\n\nProblem with this is it can hide interconnection between papers, so if I'm writing my own review I'll actually keep notes in a spreadsheet with each paper as a new row and columns for bits that I care about (specific outcomes or methods, findings, criticisms, whatever is relevant to you). This lets me scan much quicker and see connections better. \n\nAlso, holy shit, 200 page reviews?
