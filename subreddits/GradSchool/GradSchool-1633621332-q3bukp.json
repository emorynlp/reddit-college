  "title:": "Problem with my Advisor",
  "text": "Hi, I started my Phd in last year right after I finished my bachelor. \nMy current advisor is a very nice man and he pays me good, but we never meet for any report or he don't assign any project or task to me. My research interests are different from him and he can't give me any good advices.\n\nI am completely isolated from my Prof and lab mates in sense of research topics. \n\nI didn't choose this lab and advisor at the beginning, the professor I choosed suddenly got cancer and he suggested me this lab.\n\nI spent one year here and at least 4year to go. In this year I wasn't even close to publishing a paper and I just used my time to learn more and run any experiments I'm interested. \n\nMy question is should I consider changing my lab and professor to a more active one? Or should I ask my current professor to change his style and give me some supervision? Or should I change myself and try work on same thing that others are doing in my lab and forget about my interest?\n\nSorry for long a post, Thank you all for reading and any responses.",
