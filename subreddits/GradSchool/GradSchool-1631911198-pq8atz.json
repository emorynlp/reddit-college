  "title:": "Sub-Sections for Publications on CV",
  "text": "So I've been fortunate to have a few different articles accepted for publication; they're all in my field, but about different topics and sort of represent a couple of different research trajectories that I'm interested in that are related but sort of distinct. I know the typical advice is just to include publications on your CV, list them in reverse chronological order, etc. But might it be advisable to actually break up publications into the distinct research tracks that they belong to? That way any future publications in those areas can be seen in direct conjunction with the others, instead of separated by other publications in-between?\n\nI feel like this makes sense, but I've also never seen it done, so I'm not entirely sure if it's the right thing to pursue. If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them!",
