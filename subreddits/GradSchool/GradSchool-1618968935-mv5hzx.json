Doom scrolling through the news doesn\u2019t really help anyone. Once you\u2019ve seen enough news (or Twitter feeds or whatever) to know what the issues are, use that to *do something*. This is a win-win: *you* will feel better, less guilty, you will have some sense of control or impact on these big overwhelming issues. And your community will benefit as well, because you will be taking on a (small) part of the important work that needs to be done.\n\nAt the same time, I assume you don\u2019t want to quit school to be a full time activist. So be really honest with yourself- what\u2019s most important to you? What feels right and in line with your values for balancing school and important social issues? Then you can be very clear about how much time and energy you want to devote to each. \n\nThis is what I do and I just think it\u2019s really the best way. You clearly care, which is good. Pretty much any human who truly understands what\u2019s going on must care. But maybe you don\u2019t see that there\u2019s things *you* can do that can actually have an impact. Your actions can make a change. Like no, you individually are not going to end racist policing. But you could be a small (but essential) part of making change across the country... any protest of millions of people is made up of a bunch of \u201cjust one person\u201ds. You could also be a really big part in making small or hyper-local change. \n\nSo yes, I care. But for me, it\u2019s not a distraction. For the most part these thoughts don\u2019t hurt me or truly \u201cdistract\u201d me, even though I truly do care. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been able to move my worries into real action. I\u2019ve used these thoughts/feelings to re-evaluate my priorities. And I know that I\u2019m (for the most part) acting in line with my values and priorities. That\u2019s because I do spend time working with others to make change. For me it makes it easy to focus on my work when I need to do that, because I know I will also spend time focusing on social issues, particularly in productive ways, and I feel like I\u2019m doing enough. \n\nTLDR: **Don\u2019t detach!** Lean into your feelings and concerns. Really listen to them and allow them to inform your actions. Funnel your social issues focus into something that is productive for you and your community. \n\nAnyways that ended up long but that\u2019s my advice!

I'm finding it a little less difficult now that Trump is out of office, but I do still often find the news extremely distracting and/or stressful to the point where it's harder for me to get things done. \n\nMy only advice (besides attempting to acknowledge the difficult truth that you're probably gaining literally nothing from 90% of your news consumption) is to try to have a slate of less intellectually-demanding and/or less distractable tasks ready for distracting days. For example, if I'm working on fabrication in the lab, it would probably take a declaration of war or a presidential resignation to change the rate at which I get that stuff done. Whereas if I'm working on theory stuff, I have to stay as far as possible from my phone, lest I be distracted by an anonymously-sourced Politico story claiming that Joe Manchin eats PB&J sandwiches with the peanut butter side down.
