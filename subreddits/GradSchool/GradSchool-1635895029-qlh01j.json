  "text": "Hi, so I am applying to grad school and I need 3 letters of rec and I emailed asking teachers from my undergrad that I knew the best during my time there. So far one wrote me a great letter but two others have not responded to my email at all and it has been a couple weeks. The deadline would be in a month and I understand they may be busy so in a week or so if they still do not respond I was planning on sending a follow up email but not sure what to say without sounding pushy or desperate. Any advice would be much appreciated :)",

As a current grad student, I had a *hell* of a time scheduling a proposal meeting with faculty who had agreed to participate (months in advance) because professors are soooo fucking busy. If they haven\u2019t confirmed, you need confirmation ASAP because odds are their schedules are booked out for months and they may not have any available time to write for you now.",
