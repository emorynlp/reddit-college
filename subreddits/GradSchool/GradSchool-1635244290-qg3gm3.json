  "text": "I just finished up my Master's degree, and am applying to PhD programs right now.  During this year between degrees, I've been doing some freelance editing.  I've noticed that a lot of people want to pay to have their grad school admission essays proofread and, from what I understand, that's generally considered okay as long as they're not paying to have the essay written for them.  As someone who wants to go into academia (lol), would it be a conflict of interest for me to proofread these kinds of essays for money?  I'd obviously avoid applicants going for programs in my own subject area.\n\nIf it matters, I'm American, but my Master's is from a European university and I'm only applying to European institutions for my PhD.  Not sure if the standards for this differ between countries.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m in the humanities, if that makes a difference.",
