Others say it help them to work first due to making them more responsable. Quoting apollo405 :  the longer you (a) don't have to do homework and (b) make a lot more money than you do now, the motivation to go back and finish will exponentially decrease. \n\nI want to know the current new perspectives, my first 3 links are before covid. Sorry if there are newer and I suck at googling.\n\nI want to work as a Data scientist, machine learning, but my mayor is mechatronics, more mechanics than anything. \n\nSome even told me experience is better than a master.

The real issue in data science is being able to understand a problem. We don\u2019t need people who can pick the best model for Kagel so they get the best match.. but people who can look at a real world problem, look at the data, and figure out which variables to use, and which model/techniques to use, knowing the training data will always be at least a little different than the test data. \n\nI think at least some real world experience helps here. Now if you can\u2019t get a job that gives you exposure to these types of problems, sure go to school straight away.. in my opinion a lot of field is better to take grad school slow and do it while working.", "author": "runslow0148", "created": 1632484607, "upvotes": 2}, "he2qn2i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pua3x4/why_grad_school_and_not_work_directly/he2qn2i/", "text": "I did Bachelor, Master and PhD (German system) one after another.  \nI now decided that Academia is not for me and wished that I had left earlier. The job I'm working literally just requests that I have *any* degree in computer science, so in theory even the Master was time wasted.\n\nOne of my bosses also said when I joined \"Once you start working no one actually cares about your exact degrees, they just become fun stories to tell\".  \n\nSeeing how I'm now in my early thirties and basically work an entry level job I sometimes wish that I looked earlier in alternative routes for my career. I was focused on becoming an academic only to realize after three degrees that I don't like the lifestyle, so going earlier into working a similar job sounds very attractive. That said, I love my job and of course would have ended up somewhere else, but that's kind of a deep \"what if\" scenario where anyways no one can tell you if the situation world have been better or worse. I'm happy where I am but if I would have to do everything over again I probably would at least seek out more info, maybe apply to a few jobs to see what my actual realistic options are.

An entry level job will likely land you a job doing low-level repetitive tasks until you work your way up. As an example for my field (molecular biology), I could\u2019ve gotten a job after my BSc as a lab technician. The job would\u2019ve been something like carrying out bench protocols all day, keeping notes, maybe some data analysis? But that\u2019s mostly it. As a grad student, my supervisor has been great getting me involved in side projects, so I\u2019ve got several papers that I\u2019ll be coauthor on, data analysis experience for multiple different labs, an industry contract, and overall tons of experience processing and plotting data.   \n\nIn my opinion, all that is worth way more than just being a set of hands.
