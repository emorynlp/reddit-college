Others say it help them to work first due to making them more responsable. Quoting apollo405 :  the longer you (a) don't have to do homework and (b) make a lot more money than you do now, the motivation to go back and finish will exponentially decrease. \n\nI want to know the current new perspectives, my first 3 links are before covid. Sorry if there are newer and I suck at googling.\n\nI want to work as a Data scientist, machine learning, but my mayor is mechatronics, more mechanics than anything. \n\nSome even told me experience is better than a master. Tell me what you believe.",

      "text": "So I work as a data scientist and am going to grad school. \nI think the answer to your question, really depends on your field, however for data science (lots of degrees can work here, but assuming your looking at one related) in my opinion having some experience is essential. The real issue in data science is being able to understand a problem. We don\u2019t need people who can pick the best model for Kagel so they get the best match.. but people who can look at a real world problem, look at the data, and figure out which variables to use, and which model/techniques to use, knowing the training data will always be at least a little different than the test data. \n\nI think at least some real world experience helps here. Now if you can\u2019t get a job that gives you exposure to these types of problems, sure go to school straight away.. in my opinion a lot of field is better to take grad school slow and do it while working.",

Similar to if you have experience and decide to go back to school full time.. you should learn faster.\n\nBut yes I think both are important.. but I think you\u2019ll get more value from graduate studies of you have real world experience.",

      "text": "I did Bachelor, Master and PhD (German system) one after another.  \nI now decided that Academia is not for me and wished that I had left earlier. The job I'm working literally just requests that I have *any* degree in computer science, so in theory even the Master was time wasted.\n\nOne of my bosses also said when I joined \"Once you start working no one actually cares about your exact degrees, they just become fun stories to tell\".  \n\nSeeing how I'm now in my early thirties and basically work an entry level job I sometimes wish that I looked earlier in alternative routes for my career. I was focused on becoming an academic only to realize after three degrees that I don't like the lifestyle, so going earlier into working a similar job sounds very attractive. That said, I love my job and of course would have ended up somewhere else, but that's kind of a deep \"what if\" scenario where anyways no one can tell you if the situation world have been better or worse. I'm happy where I am but if I would have to do everything over again I probably would at least seek out more info, maybe apply to a few jobs to see what my actual realistic options are. And it's likely I wouldn't do the PhD then.",

Hell, the difference between a good PhD and a bad or mediocre one is often very obvious too.\n\nIn my experience (and what do I know), a good PhD seems to correlate strongly with your ability to problem solve well and discuss it at a high level, medium level, and low level efficiently, depending on context.\n\nIt also seems that there are significant glass ceilings without a PhD, at least in my field.\n\nIt\u2019s possible this is just an intelligence thing, where most people in my field in the US that are very intelligent push on toward a PhD at a much higher rate.\n\nJust some observations.",

              "text": "Absolutely.  \nE.g. in Germany if you only have a Bachelor in Biology there's few jobs you can apply for and for a lot of them you'll compete with those who instead did vocational training as lab assistant. So a Master (because no PhD without Master) is a no-brainer. There's basically no jobs you can otherwise get. A PhD on the other hand is only useful in a few subfields in Biology that transfer directly to industry (e.g. wetlab work).\n\nFor computer science the degree matters a lot less. There's lots of opportunities for Bachelor level.\n\nI also don't a lot of Biology PhDs here that found a non-postdoc job after their PhD without having to do an additional degree, training or long certification. Germany loves official paper work but it very much contributes to my opinion that most of us should have stopped after the Master and get that additional education then to start into our actual career four to five years earlier.  \nI think PhDs are just seen as black box where you don't know what you get by a lot of companies, so as long as they find people who have any type of official training they prefer hiring those, even when they have a lower degree.\n\nFor myself my Master in CS would have been a perfect launching point into industry, my Bachelor in Biology... Maybe because I specialised in Bioinformatics so I probably could have tried to say \"it's basically CS\". Not for any Biology-related position, though.",

Now I\u2019m super happy I waited because I\u2019m in a great program moving into a field that\u2019s super high in demand (bioinformatics).   \n\nI find that the whole \u201cexperience is better than school\u201d thing is total bs. An entry level job will likely land you a job doing low-level repetitive tasks until you work your way up. As an example for my field (molecular biology), I could\u2019ve gotten a job after my BSc as a lab technician. The job would\u2019ve been something like carrying out bench protocols all day, keeping notes, maybe some data analysis? But that\u2019s mostly it. As a grad student, my supervisor has been great getting me involved in side projects, so I\u2019ve got several papers that I\u2019ll be coauthor on, data analysis experience for multiple different labs, an industry contract, and overall tons of experience processing and plotting data.   \n\nIn my opinion, all that is worth way more than just being a set of hands.

I did a Master in Computer Science that offered a specialisation in Bioinformatics but looking back it was too \"pure CS\" heavy (especially since I came from a Bachelor with specialization in Bioinfo). I also lost interest in the field during that degree although the positive was that since it was just a specialisation I had a bit of freedom to switch up classes, which you may not have with a pure Bioinfo degree, depending on how flexible the program is, obviously.",
