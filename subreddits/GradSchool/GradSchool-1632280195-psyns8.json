This is the framework I look at it.\n\n1. RA Stipend - This is the base funding you get (commonly comes with tuition support, etc.).  Around 34k/year or so at my institution (different institutions have different pricing).   If you get a big fellowship then you'll probably make a little bit more, but not really.  This is usually where the tuition waiver money comes from.  \n2. Scholarships/Fellowships - Some of them can be full coverage (can replace your original stipend), but smaller ones are just pure cash (I got 2.5k and 5k scholarships that helped a lot)\n3. Funding Agency Work - My funding agency wanted me to work for them full-time for a summer.  I had them pay for my housing, my full-time salary (2x our hourly wage for RA-ship), and... well... everything.  Expensed it through the university admin office.  I made an extra 8k or so that summer.\n4. Part-time job - Realistically you don't have the time.  But my old roommate worked as a bouncer at a local bar and got some extra beer money from it (and some fun memories).\n5. Teaching Positions - Teaching a first-year seminar class can sometimes give you extra cash (some re-adjust your RA stipend to hit the 34k but other students have luck and it's money on top of their stipend).\n6. Others - There are other opportunities like participating in human studies (Transportation Engineering at our university has a driving simulator where test subject (current study is offering 100 dollars for 4x 1 hour long appointments across a month) get paid cash.\n\nI got the RA stipend, small scholarships/fellowships, and funding agency work.  I'm definitely more fortunate than some of my colleagues and friends who don't get these opportunities.
