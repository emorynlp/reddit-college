I lasted about a year and a half, and dropping out threw me into a deeper depression than doing the PhD itself. Was I a bad fit with the institution? With my supervisors? I'll always wonder. \n\nBut, after some time away and doing a 'normal' job, I knew I still wanted to finish a PhD. So I went to a different institution, and started again from scratch. I tried to avoid the mistakes I made first time around, but of course I still made mistakes, everyone does. I persevered, and in the end, I passed with no corrections.\n \nDon't give up! You've got this!\n\nAnd to those who, like me, are thinking of starting again, go for it - grow and learn from your mistakes, and keep moving forward! You CAN do it!\n\nEdit: Typos etc.", "author": "mkfrndsinfluenceppl", "created": 1605869237, "retrieved": 1632953588, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 479, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gd106u0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jxmx93/i_dont_know_who_needs_to_hear_this_but_i_just/gd106u0/", "text": "I\u2019m nearing the end of my final research study and I really needed to ok hear this.

Congratulations!\n\nI also had a failed attempt at a PhD, went to work in a job, and am on my second attempt. This time around is so much better, in part because I have the mistakes of the last round to learn from. In my case the biggest \u201cmistake\u201d was untreated addiction (I\u2019m 8 years sober now), but part of what I can carry forward now is just how critically important mental health and self care are during the slog of a PhD. Even though I really needed to quit and take care of myself, it was such a blow to my self esteem at the time and I was so embarrassed for a while (not anymore though). I really appreciate you sharing this! I think if I\u2019d read this during the time when I still felt embarrassed about quitting, it may have made me feel better and more hopeful.
