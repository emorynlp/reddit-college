  "text": "My first attempt at a PhD went horribly. I lasted about a year and a half, and dropping out threw me into a deeper depression than doing the PhD itself. Was I a bad fit with the institution? With my supervisors? I'll always wonder. \n\nBut, after some time away and doing a 'normal' job, I knew I still wanted to finish a PhD. So I went to a different institution, and started again from scratch. I tried to avoid the mistakes I made first time around, but of course I still made mistakes, everyone does. I persevered, and in the end, I passed with no corrections.\n \nDon't give up! You've got this!\n\nAnd to those who, like me, are thinking of starting again, go for it - grow and learn from your mistakes, and keep moving forward! You CAN do it!\n\nEdit: Typos etc.",

This time around is so much better, in part because I have the mistakes of the last round to learn from. In my case the biggest \u201cmistake\u201d was untreated addiction (I\u2019m 8 years sober now), but part of what I can carry forward now is just how critically important mental health and self care are during the slog of a PhD. Even though I really needed to quit and take care of myself, it was such a blow to my self esteem at the time and I was so embarrassed for a while (not anymore though). I really appreciate you sharing this! I think if I\u2019d read this during the time when I still felt embarrassed about quitting, it may have made me feel better and more hopeful. So please keep sharing! \n\nAnd congratulations again, doctor!",

I've had phases of trying too hard, which might be why (burnout)....or it could be because I've not really had a break from academia in general..or covid and working from home etc. I just don't feel engaged. \n\nEssentially,I'm trying to understand if my heart is in the right place...or whether it is because of  external factors . I feel trapped though, I really think I might want to do this PhD, but not right now maybe? But the fact that I've seen multiple posts like this one, spoke to multiple people etc reassures me I can still return, even with funding.\n\nWhat about you...whats your story pal? Even though you left, I'm highly sure you can re-enter a program, it is very common. How long were you in the program before you left?",

I fell so far behind in work/teaching that I didn't feel good about taking them a second time and decided to call it quits and master out. \n\nI don't think I would go into that type of program again maybe and if I do go back it would be for a more specific field (health analytics, data science , etc.. vs applied math) but I'm a little worried that if I did want to go back to get a PhD it would be difficult with how things ended in my previous one. \n\nThis is assuming I do want to go back, as of now I am enjoying how my life is going at my current job and how things are in general, just something that has been on my mind lately.",

Honestly shit happens, so don't be too hard on yourself (if you are anyway!). \n\npretty sure that, even after 2 years into a program and dropping out, you can honestlyr go back. An important question (if you're considering it anyway) is : *why* were you struggling? And also, if it's even worth it. \n\nI highly doubt you're stupid. Was it mental health? Family priorities? etc. I'm guessing you thought about this one, and that's why it's been on your mind. Secondly, you are happy with life. I highly doubt A PhD would boost you financially unless you want to do a PhD for personal reasons.\n\nHappy to continuing chatting  pal if you're comfortable ofcourse.\n\nBest of luck with everything!",

I am fairly certain I would both perform and feel better if covid wasn\u2019t keeping us at home.
