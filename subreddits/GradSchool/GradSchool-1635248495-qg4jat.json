      "text": "I just recently got a new laptop for grad school as well. I imagine I have pretty similar horsepower requirements to yours, i.e., some light data science.\n\nI ended up with a newer MacBook Air. It turned out to be about the best deal on the market that I could actually get. Refurbished, the newest mode of MacBook ran me $850. I was looking at some refurbished think pads and HPs, but at the same price point the MacBook with the M1 chips has way better performance, and it was actually in stock. Everything else I was looking at was like buy it now, it\u2019ll arrive in 2-3 months. I was on a short timeframe though, so that may work for you.",

You\u2019ll probably get Office365 for free with your university email and using OneNote with the Surface Pro has been essential for taking and organizing class notes, research, TA stuff, etc. It\u2019s light and taking handwritten notes or inserting a pdf into OneNote and being able to annotate to your hearts content has been incredibly useful.",

      "text": "Congratulations! I went with a MacBook Pro for myself when I started grad school. I love it and I couldn\u2019t go back because the apple device connectivity is just awesome. With the new one coming out right now you could probably get a deal on the \u201colder\u201d versions lol. It would still probably be fairly expensive. I had a Microsoft surface book before my MB pro, and it was a cool idea but the quality of the build made me go back to apple. However, I\u2019ve heard great things about the MS surface collection. Maybe look into the surface (I just wouldn\u2019t recommend the surface book). There are also plenty of more inexpensive ($200-600) laptops if you aren\u2019t concerned with super longevity. You can always backup your stuff and transfer your data after grad school.\n\nAlso keep in mind if you are going to use any software that requires a certain operating system. I know some statistics programs really only like Microsoft computers (although there is a workaround for that), and some other programs may have the same requirements. \nHappy laptop hunting!",
