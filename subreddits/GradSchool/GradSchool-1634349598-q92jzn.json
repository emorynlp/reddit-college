  "text": "Hello everyone, I'm researching about Msc in Finance program offered by various universities. I believe my profile is competitive for target universities but what's keeping me from applying is I don't think I will be able to score 680+ on gmat. GPA- 3.62 ish, 8 months of work experience ( General management ), volunteer experience of 6 months. Anyways, I have put down a list of few reach universities for the program. Would appreciate any help if it's worth to applying to that universities or it's a no go. Oh, btw I'm overrepresented applicant. Post grad goal is to break into IB/ Valuation. I have read their curriculum, it's mostly same for every school. Also, NYC Or Boston?\n\nNYC\n \nFordham\nRochester ( think they closed Manhattan campus but talking about the other one)\nBaruch\n\nBoston\nNortheastern \nBentley\n\nThank you.",
