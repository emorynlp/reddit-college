  "title:": "Had a little break down in front of my PI today",
  "text": "I just started my MSc program in late August and had been working as a tech for my PI previously. I had been the project manager for an agricultural research project over the summer and we are currently harvesting everything now, full on into the semester. I'm not being paid for this work anymore, as I am working as a TA. But, I am taking research credits and was promised a co-authorship on the paper (hopefully, my PI stays true to their word). Mind you, this is not the project I am conducting for my MSc thesis.\n\nI've been working 60+ hours a week on this damn project for the last three weeks. By the time I get home at 9:00PM after working since 6:00AM, I am so beat, I cannot even read a paper. Working weekends, getting minimal sleep. I am struggling to keep up on course work and my TA duties. \n\nAnyways, I hit my breaking point today and pulled my PI aside to have a private chat. I started to cry a little, which is something I was trying so hard to avoid, but it happened. I am pretty intent on keeping my composure in front of them... I told them I needed a day off - badly. I was relieved with their response, they told me to take the day off tomorrow and they would lead the project. I received a text later with them telling me to take the whole weekend off and that they are very proud of my work. I am so happy, I can't believe I have a Friday and a weekend to catch up on sleep and course work! Just wanted to share my excitement with others who get it.",

      "text": "Wow I'm glad this ended positively but it really just shows how terrible academic culture can be and we need to not normalize this but self-advocate for better work-life balances!! I hope you can set better boundaries after your break and do a normal 9-5 and stop working on weekends you're not even being paid...",
