Barring them is simply xenophobic.  \n\n\nThere is a petition going around right now to go against this bill -- if you are willing to sign it, please do. It takes 30 seconds.  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIu1jbAfB5qFGkV3I7rpEAo0kwsUb8CpzZ_6Nu-CoKeul4PQ/viewform", "author": "masjoven", "created": 1591032801, "retrieved": 1632953321, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"fsptgsg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/guox53/to_my_fellow_graduate_students_in_the_us_a_bill/fsptgsg/", "text": "I'm not even American, and yet I think this may be a great development for STEM PhD students of the future. This should just be a first step.\n\nTO BE CLEAR: Yes, these students are every bit as talented as American students. Yes, they contribute a shit ton of research work. And to the economy overall.\n\nBut universities and supervisors don't take on [more and more](http://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Importance-of-International-Students.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-20171.pdf) students from non-Western countries out of the goodness of their hearts. They love doing so, because many can be 'nudged' to work very long hours for very little money. Not only during their PhD, but also as post-docs afterwards - yay! Additionally, quitting is not an economically viable option for most, and supervisors know this.\n\nWhere companies outsource to low wage countries, universities just bring in the more cost-effective labour they need. After all, a PhD in STEM is at max 30% educational and 70% work like any other. Working conditions for PhDs have always been subpar, but that's exactly why we shouldn't allow universities to continuously put downward pressure on them. A steady inflow of cheap(-ish) labour makes it far too easy for them. When corporations do this, they get exposed and everyone talks about (just think of Amazon and their warehouses).

It is not 'feel-good' legislation and it is not a precursor to anything; there is nothing beyond this. \n\nThis cannot be allowed to happen. I'm dismayed at what I've seen in the most recent reddit threads about this. Do you ever talk to your Chinese colleagues? You know that China does not allow dual citizenship, right? I know many people who plan to give up their Chinese citizenship as soon as they have the option to. Poorer people don't have the option of coming to the US for undergrad, but see grad school as a path to US citizenship and \"the American dream\". \n\nI am an American PhD student in Canada. Canada already has all of the strong Iranian students. Don't make US schools weaker by giving up most of the Chinese students too.
