  "title:": "Talking to professor about poor assignment grades?",
  "text": "I am a MSc student taking courses at the start of my degree. I am taking one course with a professor I have known since I was an undergrad, and who is well respected in the field. On the last few assignments I have performed poorly, I could have easily scored 85+ but achieved 70s due to silly/careless errors. I am currently working two jobs (my stipend is quite small and I am about to start paying off my student loans) and have had a hard time managing the workload. However, I know school is my top priority and have decided to quit one job and reduce my hours at the other - I\u2019m already feeling better about life, sleeping better, and am way less strung out. I wanted to approach my professor and sort of explain myself/apologize for my lack of effort in the class and show them I am taking the steps to do better - I feel that my poor grades make it seem like I am being disrespectful by not giving the class the attention it deserves and I don\u2019t want to give off the impression of someone that doesn\u2019t care. \n\nAny advice for this situation? The midterm for the class is this week and I expect to do well, and on the next assignment as well due the day before. Would an email be good in this situation, or better to do it face to face after my next class? For context, the class has about 7-8 students at the masters and PhD level combined. Thanks in advance, guys.",

If you have in-person contact with them, I would suggest just very quickly being like \"hey, I recognize I've dropped the ball and I'm working on doing better\". But I wouldn't send an email just to say this because I'm sure we all know how quickly email inboxes get clogged up.\nBest luck with your studies!",
