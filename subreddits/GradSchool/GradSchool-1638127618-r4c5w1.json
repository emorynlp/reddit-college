  "text": "I've a CS undergrad,who wasn't really into CS until now. I feel like I hated the subject coz I didn't really try. And now that I do, its FUN. I definitely do wanna work in CS and wanna pursue masters. However im not sure if I should go for project based or course based? I've heard project based is hard abd considering im just starting on my learning journey, I feel intimidated by the idea of doing a masters project, all on my own. Should I pick course based? Will that be okay? What to pick?",
