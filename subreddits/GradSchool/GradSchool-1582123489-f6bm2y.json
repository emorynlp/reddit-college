Out of state tuition has to be covered by the department or PI (and many do, thankfully, mine did for the first year till I was able to apply for residency)\n\nA single room in a shared house or apartment with roommates will run you probably 600-1100 (lots of variation, they've built a lot of luxury apartments catering to the rich international undergrads...), a one bedroom apartment 1400-1600.",

Though this is hardly comfortable living and is certainly worse than other schools like Caltech (slightly higher stipend, rent is a couple hundred less per month).",

They love getting those out of state fees when they are undergrad tho. They are just so ridiculous, they don\u2019t deserve anyone\u2019s time.

TA salaries are negotiated as a constant  across the entire UC system regardless of cost of living or amount of affordable grad student. The contract by the union was signed in 2018 barely passing by 59% across all UC\u2019s. At UC Santa Cruz students voted ~83% against the current contract, so UCSC grads are striking for a cost of living adjustment that wouldn\u2019t be a change in salary per se more of a stipend attached to the status of a student than to a TA.\n\nA link (have to copy and paste the link, it\u2019s not hyperlinking) to Data behind the strike: mck8dg.shinyapps.io/UCSC_COLA_Data\n\nA link to the main strike page : [strike info](https://payusmoreucsc.com)",
