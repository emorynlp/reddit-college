Please if you have ten minutes help us out and fill out this survey: https://bostonu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0lETnYnj2vTrQTY \n\nWe are 100 responses short, data is due next week, and we are so stressed lol. You don\u2019t have to put too much thought into it or anything, we literally just need data to look at. \n\nEdit: you can take it even if you\u2019ve never used twitch! \n\nThank you!!!!",
