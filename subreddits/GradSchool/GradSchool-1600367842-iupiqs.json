You name it, it happened to me. Emotional, mental and verbal abuse from a supervisor? Yes. Sexual harassment from faculty and other graduate students? Yes. Sexual discrimination from supervisors because I was female? Yes. \n\nI isolated myself. I felt defeated. I was convinced that my ideas were not cut out for research. I was convinced that I would finish my PhD and leave the toxic environment behind and work in a commercial/industry lab and hate everyday of my life doing it (I worked in the industry in the past and I couldn't stand it for the short time I was there). In my eyes, I was a loser who just wouldn't make it and shouldn't bother trying. \n\nBut then I published the pre-print of my first thesis chapter and everything changed. While it still has to get through peer-review, the response to my pre-print has overwhelmed me. I sent the DOI to a non-scientific friend a few hours after it went live and my friend replied saying \"That's cool. I didn't know you knew so many people around the world!\".  I was confused what they meant...knowing people around the world? It was just a link to the pre-print. My friend then sent me a screenshot. My paper had been retweeted by scientists with huge followings on twitter, it had likes, people were discussing it. \n\nIt has been less than a week and over 400 people have downloaded my preprint. Four. Hundred. People. I have begun receiving emails requesting further detail on my work, requests for me to write methods papers providing more technical detail on the protocols I used for reputable journals. Seeing this response from the scientific community has given me the strength I need to keep fighting for my dream job as a researcher despite what social barriers I have to fight through on my way.", "author": "minutemaidpeach", "created": 1600367842, "retrieved": 1632953245, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 712, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g5ozwil": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/iupiqs/the_scientific_community_response_to_my_first/g5ozwil/", "text": "Just want to say thanks for taking the time to share this here.
