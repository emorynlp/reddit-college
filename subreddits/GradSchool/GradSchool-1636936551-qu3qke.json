Also, friendships are a little difficult as not everyone lives on campus like most undergrad. Content wise- not as much focus on grades and more so on learning. More project based, than tests for me personally.",

I.E. here\u2019s the syllabus, maybe a little bit of lecturing and let\u2019s talk next week. The answers don\u2019t feel as clear cut either. My program is fully online, but I assume Grad School feels like that regardless.",

More? \n\n\nYou may find that your research on grad school will be easier if you search for info on your specific degree. Getting an MFA is a very different experience and culture from an MBA, which is different from an MA, etc. \n\n\nMaking friends can be difficult, as people are busy and tend to keep to themselves. I got into my program and thought I would immediately bond with my cohort mates but this tended to not be the case. I have a social life in my new town now, but I mainly hang out with people from my summer job, most of whom are not grad students. \n\nIf you are looking into a fully funded program, see what kinds of work you will be doing. Is this work that will be useful to you as work experience? Is it something you are interested in doing? Will you be teaching undergraduates? Working as a research assistant? All of that will affect what your work-life balance looks like. \n\nGenerally, your classes will be in the evenings, and they\u2019ll meet once a week and be three hours long. Homework and papers become less about grades and more about seriously engaging with coursework so you can have a conversation with your professor and show them that you are interested in what you are teaching.",

      "text": "PhD in Clinical Psych\n\nEveryone adapts to grad school differently. For me, the first year was *cake*. I had almost no problem at all, I was actually surprised because I expected it to be hell. I was just so excited to get back to school (I had a ~2yr gap between undergrad and grad). Maybe it was because my undergrad education was pretty damn rigorous and time-consuming, but the first year of grad school just came so smooth for me. In contrast, some of my cohort-mates *really* struggled and were overwhelmed.\n\nFlash forward to my 4th/5th year, and I'm now overwhelmed and stressed and burned out; others are more resilient. I'm still hitting my milestones and doing what I need to do, but I'm nowhere near smooth-sailing like I was. \n\nSo all that to say, it may be tough or it may be easy, and it may not stay that way (for better or worse).",
