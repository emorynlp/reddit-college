  "text": "part of me wants to take a gap year and get experience first, but part of me is ready to move away from where i live and move into the next chapter of getting my education. i will be graduating with a degree in public relations & marketing :) i want to go to grad school to give me a leg up when i do enter the job sector, but i\u2019m also super burnt out. \n\nalso, the applications are terribly scary to me. i feel like i don\u2019t know how to answer the questions every time i sit down and begin an essay. \n\nhow were your experiences when you applied and when you began grad school? anything you\u2019d do again/do differently/never do at all?",

      "text": "A gap year is a great idea because it lets you build some savings and also have some experience to fall back on if grad school goes sideways later. If later you're trying to decide if you'll drop out of grad school, you'll have a least that one work experience to compare it to and inform your next steps.\n\nFor applications, just write SOMETHING and write a lot. Then you can refine your drafts or start fresh a few times with a more informed idea about what felt good to write about.\n\nJust start early and stay in touch with your recommenders. Don't let them wonder where you are in the process, just tell them. If you're writing too many emails then they can tell you and set that boundary. \n\nYou might want to also check out /r/gradadmissions",

Don't let yourself be your biggest critic. One step in front of the other and you will get to the end of the admission process.",

Because you'll be able to tie it to real world experience.\n\nSo if you're leaning towards taking a year off, that could be a good thing.",

      "text": "If your feeling burnt out, I know it may sound counter intuitive, but don\u2019t take a gap year. I only say this as someone who would have never gone back if I had. Regarding how daunting applications are, truly just try your best, and submit before the deadline. I applied to three programs and fully thought I wouldn\u2019t get into any of them, but I was accepted to all three. Stay calm, don\u2019t have any expectations, and reach out to program coordinators if your feeling stuck on application material. You got this!",

      "text": "I can\u2019t help with the first part other than to say I was only going to take a year off before grad school.  I ended up waiting 8\u2026\u2026\n\nApplications aren\u2019t too bad.  Most will have you do a letter of intent.  The advice here is to be honest and demonstrate you\u2019ve researched their program.  I\u2019m getting an MHA, and specifically mentioned how the well-rounded curriculum would prepare me to step into a healthcare executive role.  Don\u2019t try to type what you think they want to read; type what you feel.  \n\nI got into every school I applied to and naturally selected the one that didn\u2019t require an application fee.  It wasn\u2019t too bad of a process.  \n\nBeginning grad school was daunting because I\u2019m in an accelerated online program.  It took a couple of weeks to get settled.  I\u2019m about to graduate with a 4.0 so that should tell you how easy it is to adjust.  Your professors are looking for you to take a position and defend it.  This isn\u2019t about just memorizing facts.  Present unique but relevant perspectives.",
