  "text": "I\u2019m applying to masters of science in epidemiology programs. I have a ~3.7 undergrad and post-bacc gpa (strong upward trend), great letter of recs, public health work and volunteer experience. \n\nI took the GRE with minimal preparation and got a score of V166, Q155.\n\nI\u2019m not inclined to study for it and take it again. However, is it a good score for epi programs? Would it hurt my application if I submitted it for programs where it is optional? Or is it low and I should not submit since it\u2019s not adding value to my app?\n\nI know epi is a quantitative field and my quant score is low. Any advice would be appreciated! \n\nTIA",
