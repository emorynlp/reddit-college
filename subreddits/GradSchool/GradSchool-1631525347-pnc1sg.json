For my other applications, I am required to submit a clearly thought-out research proposal that aligns with the research interests of the department I'm applying to.\n\nFor the US, a complete research proposal is not a requirement. In my SOP, would I benefit more from expressing well-defined research interests (similar to the non-US schools above) or broader interests? I understand there are more taught modules for US programs and the course is longer, so there is greater potential for my interests to change/evolve, especially the narrower/more defined they initially are. Whereas if they are too broad, they might not demonstrate enough interest/knowledge.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out the right balance here.\n\nFor some context: I'm from the UK and my background is in social and political sciences. I graduated with an MSc three years ago and have been working in research and advocacy since. My research interests mainly concern conflict, political violence, globalisation, and identity formation. Geographically, I'm interested in the Arab World, South, Southeast, and East Asia, and the diaspora. I will most likely be applying to either Anthropology or Sociology programs.\n\nIn my non-US applications, I have a proposal that specifies the three exact countries I would study but this only works because of the detail I give regarding my research aims and justifications. So, this wouldn't be appropriate for US applications, would it?\n\nBasically! How specific/detailed should I be? Is it okay to be broad about geography and specific about the concepts I'm interested in?\n\nSorry for making this so long - just wanted to give as much info as possible.", "author": "evasive_muse", "created": 1631525347, "retrieved": 1632844603, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcxp70y": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnc1sg/how_broad_or_specific_should_my_research/hcxp70y/", "text": "My \u201cproposal\u201d to my potential advisors was: I propose I can work with with what you have funding for.
