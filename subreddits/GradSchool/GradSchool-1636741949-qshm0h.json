  "text": "If this post is not okay for this sub, I understand. I am in the ADHDacademics sub, but it seems dead.\n\nBut at this point, I feel like, due to my ADHD and depression combined with lack of a good advisor, I have failed to finish my Master's degree. I finished my coursework in two years and have been stuck on my thesis writing ever since. I'm now working full time and live almost two hours from campus. My advisor retired, but is still trying to finish off what students he has left. But he is difficult to get any help from. I find it impossible to do this on my own without any direction, and unfortunately due to the advisor I chose, that is where I find myself. So, what that means, is I have made very little progress since leaving campus \\~four years ago. Every time I reach out to my advisor, it takes weeks for him to get back to me and then I make a tiny bit of progress and then get lost again and basically ignore it until it is time to register again. I literally don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing to get this done. \n\nTo give an idea, my school publishes a thesis template, schedule, and extremely detailed instructions on defending. My advisor never told me this! I recently happened to be searching through the school website and came across it on my own. That moment was like a light had been switched on and I was able to make a small amount of progress, filling in the template (and seeing how the schedule says this should be done in semester 2). I would never expect an advisor to baby me or hold my hand through thesis writing, but making me aware of these things IS what I would expect from an advisor.\n\nEach semester I awkwardly email the department to add me to the graduate study course and pay my tuition on one credit hour. And tell them THIS is the semester I will be finished. And then start the cycle again.\n\nI feel like I can't keep emailing my advisor and telling him I am stuck. I understand that it is not his responsibility to MAKE me work on this. I know that a big part of this is executive dysfunction. But I honestly do not know what to do.  This is as much of a rant as anything. I don't know what kind of advice I am expecting. Has anyone else been in a situation like this? Should I just quit or somehow bs my way through this? At this point, I wish there was a way to graduate without a thesis, but my school does not offer that option.",

Yes technically your advisor traditionally fills all these rolls, but it's entirely acceptable ask for support from others in your department.",
