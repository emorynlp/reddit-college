  "text": "I realise that I have imposter syndrome after I joined grad school. I tried to change my mindset, but sometimes it got out of control. \n\nToday, I got the good news that my poster presentation received an award at a conference. My first response is not happiness, but doubting myself if I got the award because my supervisor is one of the keymen in the conference committee. I know that I should not think like that, but my imposter syndrome whispers to me to not enjoy my achievement. \n\nHow can I deal with imposter syndrome?  I don't want to feel like myself not worth my position all the time.",

You\u2019ll look back and wonder why you worried at all and let these negative thoughts live in your mind, rent-free.\n\nCongrats on getting an award for your poster presentation because you did the damn thing!",

      "text": "Gonna start just copy/pasting this ever my time someone says they have imposter syndrome \n\n\u2014\n\nBro you are at a level of expertise that only 1% of people in the world will ever reach on any topic, and are among an incalculably small percentage of the world that is an expert on your given topic. For the vast majority of your life going forward, you will be able to walk into any building, any room, occupied by any people, and talk about your focus and confidently say that you are the smartest person in the room regarding that topic. And if they question you you\u2019ll have a piece of paper to prove it. \n\nForever.\n\u2014\n\nImposter syndrome is funny because it\u2019s one of those things that you can\u2019t disprove. Like any \u201cevidence\u201d against being an imposter can just magically be a part of the impostering. But after a certain point, if you are tricking experts into thinking you are a peer by presenting research that is so good  they buy into it, then you\u2019re not really an imposter. \n\nI think it should also be said that for your situation, even if the award was given just because of your supervisor was the keyman, that means despite being familiar with your work already he saw all this new and exciting research and yours still stood out. \n\nDon\u2019t make excuses. The simplest answer is that you are among the best, that\u2019s how you got here, that\u2019s how you continue to be here, that\u2019s how you\u2019ve done so well. And the simplest answer is often the right one in these types of situations.\n\nCongrats on the award btw, you earned it :)",

You lack the expertise and experience to know whether or not you're qualified to be an economist.  In the meantime, you listen to your mentors and people you trust to have that expertise and experience to tell you whether or not you're qualified.  And I'm telling you you're qualified, so stop that self-doubting crap and let's talk about your next research project.\"\n\nHe was a salty old codger, but he was right.  OP, you won't have the necessary expertise or experience to accurately judge your own progress for many more years.  Trust the feedback of your senior colleagues.  Seems like they're telling you that you're on the right track.",
