  "title:": "After studying for years, I\u2019ve quit the workforce and finally discovered my PURPOSE",
  "text": "The couple of years has been challenging for pretty much everybody, but it\u2019s also served grounds for reassessment of one\u2019s life and discovery of what truly matters. This has been so widespread that it\u2019s even lead to millions of workers quitting their jobs, ie The Great Resignation.\n\nThings like more flexible hours, better pay, career advancement have always been important\u2026 it\u2019s just now that people are pushing for it much more.
