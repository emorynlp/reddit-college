Not sure how many schools are in your field or what your goals are or your frame of reference for what schools are likely your \u201ceasy schools to get into\u201d vs \u201chard schools to get into.\u201d\n\nHigh vs low rank depends highly on that frame of reference.",

      "text": "I disagree. Basically there is the top top tier that\u2019s like the first 5. Then the top tier that\u2019s like 6-15. These are renowned universities that have stellar technicals. Berkeley is typically in this group. It\u2019s not Harvard. But no one getting a PhD from Harvard or Princeton is any better. It\u2019s the same books. Then like 15-30 is a bit of drop off in terms of the quality of the professors. Then 30-100 is the lowest tier.",

              "text": "You know this is probably not going to go over well. But in general, my opinion is that world rankings are perhaps inaccurate in how they predict performance after grad school and perhaps have more to do with politics than people realize. It\u2019s been my experience that PhDs from US universities tend to out perform other countries. Now that\u2019s just my experience. I think US PhDs tend to be longer and more research focused so the people that make it out tend to be better prepared for experimental research. Perhaps that\u2019s less true for theorists. But in my field that is my experience.",
