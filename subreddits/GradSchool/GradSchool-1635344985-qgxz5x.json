  "text": "Hi! This may seem silly but I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s expected for us to be dressed somewhat professionally when on campus? I haven\u2019t been on campus yet this year since I have been in all online courses and am just wondering what people even wear lol. I\u2019m in a public health MHS program if that helps give context :)",

What is expected varies with the work culture you are in, there's no general rule. For example, nobody cared at my previous uni and I could show up daily in leggings and a hoodie trying to survive grad school but where I am now I noticed people dress nicer and so do I",

You have to look the part\u2026unfortunately. Once you\u2019re on top of your field, you can dress how ever you like and people will think of you as edgy and a trendsetter \ud83e\udd23\n\nIf you\u2019re just studying though plain athleisure wear is the Way to go!
