  "text": "I started my degree and got given a staff email address - I complained just about every week that I feel I am missing out on researcher events and important meetings. I just felt there had to be more to a PhD than sitting in my bedroom reading papers.\n\nFast forward around 18 months another PhD student who I have spoke to once mentioned whilst I was complaining to my supervisor in the lab about never receiving anything asked if it was just the one email address it happened with or both.\n\nNaturally I was confused when they told me the one I was using was a staff email and not a student one. I didn't realize we got two.\n\nI put my matriculation number in and reset the password for the email address because I had never used it or set one to begin with only to find 500+ missed messages.\n\nDamn do I feel stupid and annoyed at the same time\n\nEdit: Since people seem to sorta like this the fist email ended \"it is important you use this email address, please respond to make sure everything is working ok\"... \n\nIts fair to say I never responded",

      "text": "This kind of shit happened to me when I was given a staff email towards the end of my degree when I did a summer teaching assistantship. I needed to have access to a shared email and Outlook calendar for a short time period while we launched a new graduate student space, but to do that I had to have my own account. Seemed like no problem. \n\nI didn't get any email over the summer at my staff email and once the fall term started and I didn't need to access the shared email, I stopped logging into Outlook. Everything seemed fine, but now and then someone would say they emailed me but I wouldn't get it. I never gave anyone my staff email, so it never occurred to me to check it. \n\nFast forward to late November and I finally log in to Outlook. I don't even remember why, but there were tons of emails, including messages from the Business Office who I was really pissed off at because they were taking forever to reimburse me for conference travel. Oops. Turns out that if you start typing a name into Outlook, it will bring up other Outlook emails as well as previous contacts. So pretty much everyone was typing my name and using the Outlook address because that's what popped up first.",

In my uni, turns out, we also have a student email and an employee \"account\" which is like an email address that can't send or receive emails. Anyways, at the beginning of the contract they sent you a *physical* mail with instructions of how to set up your employee account. (yay going back to the holy roman empire!) Of course, by the time I realized that account exists and is needed for using uni licenses to software and crap, this was a few years into the game. I still have no clue whether I got such a letter eons ago or not haha, I don't trust the useless-but-well-meaning idiot I was at the start of grad school. But I could get in contact with the department that organizes it and got an alternative employee account.\n\nSo nothing disastrous, but I was definitely flabbergasted the first time a colleague assumed I knew what this account was hahhahah",

I never received any notification or instructions... it was just created and no one told me. While my grad secretary and advisor were still emailing my personal account because we had already been in correspondence, everyone else who needed to reach me only had access to the student email address that I didn't even know about it.\n\nI missed about 600 emails over those few months, most of which weren't very important and just listservs (thankfully).  BUT I won a decently big scholarship at the beginning of July that I never found out about until mid-August because the school sent the notification to the address that I had no knowledge of.

I refuse to work in academia as a TA or RA for less than the average National pay for the highest degree achieved.  Since UNIs push stats like \u201cearn this much on average nationally with this degree\u201d I feel they should lead the pack in paying that.  Example: APS has the national average or a BS in Physics ranging $46k-$58k, then to work as a physics TA or RA one needs the BS degree and should be paid appropriately.\n\nThe fact that if you try to bring this logic to them they literally laugh you out the door tells me everything I need to know about working for a prof making around 6figures and delegating a good portion of their duties to the grad students.

              "text": "Something similar happened with me. I have it set up on my phone to notify when an email comes, and one day somehow it got logged out. I never manually checked in the web browser (I do now!) and due to the usual pressure of work, I didn't even notice that there weren't any email notifications for about two months. I thought that there aren't any mails, until a colleague called me about a meeting. I was like \"what meeting?\" \"Dude didn't you get the mail?\" \"Uh, no? Let me check.\" And bam, last synced date on email app is almost two months ago, and it is not refreshing. Logged in browser to see hundreds of emails unread (we get spammed by any seminar or lectures going to happen, as well as new courses being floated, time tables being changed, etc etc, which are relevant to bachelor and masters students). Guess I was pretty stupid. Long story short, I didn't even think of manually going to the email app and refreshing to check for new mails. I just assumed that I wasn't getting any.",

      "text": "I can relate to the pain. My undergrad didn\u2019t give us student emails, so I didn\u2019t realize that was a thing I needed to be aware of for grad school. I got the acceptance to grad school in my person email and a couple other emails as well, but I felt like I was missing a lot of information about funding and TA assignments. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the week before classes started (as I was driving across the country to go to school) that I found out I had a student email and it had been filling from February to August with important and helpful information. \n\nI have to keep reminding myself that I\u2019ve never done grad school before, so it\u2019s okay if not everything goes perfectly.",
