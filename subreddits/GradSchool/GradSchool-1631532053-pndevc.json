Seemed like no problem. \n\nI didn't get any email over the summer at my staff email and once the fall term started and I didn't need to access the shared email, I stopped logging into Outlook. Everything seemed fine, but now and then someone would say they emailed me but I wouldn't get it. I never gave anyone my staff email, so it never occurred to me to check it. \n\nFast forward to late November and I finally log in to Outlook. I don't even remember why, but there were tons of emails, including messages from the Business Office who I was really pissed off at because they were taking forever to reimburse me for conference travel.
