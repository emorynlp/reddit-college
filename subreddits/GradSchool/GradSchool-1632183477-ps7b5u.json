I'd say look into the rules in your state to make sure you don't have that \"3 years of guarunteed income remaining\" rule, and also try to get prequalified for a mortgage before you start looking too seriously.", "author": "drizdar", "created": 1632227920, "upvotes": 2}, "hdo7op1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps7b5u/has_anyone_here_bought_a_house_when_going_to_grad/hdo7op1/", "text": "I bought before grad school, but the actual purchase was while I was still full-time employed and was a permanent remote worker (which helped with getting a mortgage). I was also moving to a city I knew I\u2019d want to stick around in for at least a few years even if I hated school and dropped out, and it was also a city where the cost of rent makes buying economically rational even if you\u2019re only staying for 2-3 years. \n\nHappy with the decision so far.", "author": "SockaSockaSock", "created": 1632191782, "upvotes": 1}}}
