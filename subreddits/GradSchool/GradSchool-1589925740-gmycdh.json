  "text": "I\u2019ve been mulling changing labs for the last six months or so. She treats her grad students very badly. I was super nervous to begin the change of lab process. But I pulled the bandaid off on Monday and I\u2019ve never felt so free lol. I\u2019m happy again. I\u2019m excited about science. I feel like going to land on my feet and be successful, which is something I lost in the two years in my previous lab.",
