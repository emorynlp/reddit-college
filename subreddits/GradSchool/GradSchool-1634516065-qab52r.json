  "text": "People doing PhD (I guess master's don't spend that much time in the lab?) -- how much do you socialize with your lab mates? I don't ever hang out with mine after work, will occasionally small talk in the lab but that's about it. But lately I discovered some of them socialize a lot after work and feel kinda excluded. What's the normal level of socializing in the lab? Should I try to be friends with lab mates even though I don't feel like there's a vibe?",

And most of the people I worked with in and out of school are on the same boat. \n\nif you are new to the lab, they might take a bit to include you, or they might not at all. Because you work together, doesn't mean you have to be friends and socialize together. it really boils down to how you want the interaction. And don't read into this too much.",

There is a fairly large group of grad students within our department that will get lunch every Thursday and sometimes will go out or host a party on a Friday/Saturday night. I attend anything I'm invited to and I even hosted a labor day BBQ at my place. My lab mates come to some of these events but not all. I'm pretty lucky that I've fallen into this group within my department.\n\n\nEven if you don't vibe with your lab mates it doesn't hurt to socialize with them occasionally outside of work. This might actually help you all vibe more. It never hurts to ask if they want to grab a drink or do something.",

      "text": "In my first lab we were pretty social, although a few groups naturally emerged with people who had more in common. We had semi regular meets for dinner and BBQs. The supervisor often joined too and he really encouraged us to be social together.\n\nIn my second lab, there was almost zero socialising outside work. Not sure how much of it was different lab culture or us having basically nothing in common. I invited everyone round for dinner once and it was nice but none of us really clicked as friends, even though we all got on fine.\n\nSo those are my experiences. Currently I'm close with one lab mate but don't really have the energy or space or interest to befriend anyone else. Life is hectic and I'm at a point where creating and maintaining friendships is really hard work, bad as that may sound. I likely wouldn't try to properly befriend any new lab additions beyond being friendly at work.",

When they do show up we spend a lot of time chatting while doing experiments, so I feel like we get some lot of quality time together despite not socializing outside of work much.\n\nWhy not suggest an activity to your labmates? That way they know you're interested in hanging out outside of the lab.",
