I only just started in May, but I'm starting to get comfortable in the lab and with my research. Just when I thought I was starting to get over my imposter syndrome, my PI asked me to meet with a student from another lab who could help me with data collection on a new structure I made.\nThis guy looked at my structure and then asked me if I know the structure for MIL-101 (my research is in Metal-Organic frameworks, or MOFs). When I said no, he said, and I quote:\n\"Really? It's a very famous structure. You must not be a good MOF researcher if you don't know what MIL-101 looks like. Your PI would be able to draw it in his sleep.\"\nI swear, grad students can be some of the most infuriating people.
