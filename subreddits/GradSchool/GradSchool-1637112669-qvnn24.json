  "text": "hi everyone, so i am in my second semester of grad school and have recently begun working on my research. For my school, we get the cores done while scoping out who we want to do research with. Anyways, I recently found a project that I think is super cool and want to be a part of. I meet with my PI every week and they give me things to work on. Unfortunately I feel like every time we meet, I end up getting absolutely roasted and torn apart regardless of how i feel about my work. I am also taking 11 hours of cores this semester so I haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019ve been able to commit to giving them the outcome they want. They asked me a question today about a metric i used to analyze data and I was told I \u201cdidn\u2019t even get that half right\u201d. They are from a different country so I have been told from my family/friends they them being blunt is a culture thing but I am a people pleaser so every meeting just makes me want to cry (and i do  once i leave..haha yikes). Im coming from a bit of a different field so I understand i have a lot to learn, and they say that it will be a learning curve but i just feel more stressed than excited to learn. I know I can do it but I dont feel confident that I can prove it to them anymore.\n\nAnyways I dont know if Im just here to complain or just to see if anyone has been there and made it through it but Ive thought about trying for biweekly meetings as a sort of \u201ccheckpoint\u201d but I honestly don\u2019t feel like I have time to fit that into my schedule. Any ideas or \u201cI\u2019ve been there\u201ds are welcome :)",

      "text": "Speaking as a 5th year with a PI who sounds very similar to what you've described, it is not worth it. I used to be excited to learn but the constant criticism and my PI highlighting my lack of knowledge really killed my spirit. If you still have the option, I highly reccomend you find a PI who is kind, understanding, patient, etc. It will be worth much, much more than an interesting research project. A less interesting research topic + good PI always beats an interesting research topic + shitty PI, in my opinion.",

      "text": "My PI is pretty blunt too. I have had meetings where I didn't produce what they want and have heard them audibly sigh during our meeting. I've apologized before for less than satisfactory work, but they never acknowledge the apology, so I've stopped. \n\nIt took time and I'm still going through it but I have tried to focus less on producing lots of work and focus on producing quality work. I used to count my progress with the number of slides in the PowerPoint I use for research updates but now I put in only the figures I find relevant, even if it means that amounts to less than 10 slides. If I don't do a figure or it's getting close to 3 or 4 am, I just stop because I've realized it's probably going to be shitty anyway. I've also started paying closer attention to the comments my advisors make and try to incorporate them in my work. I think they've noticed this and sometimes they will make a comment about my figures only for me to remind them that I have done that and they seem pleased by it. \n\nIn our research meetings it always seem like I'm doing shitty or not getting anywhere because I'm a master procrastinator and do the bare minimum every week (especially when I have classes too). In our lab meetings though, my advisors speak highly of me (and of course the others in my lab), and overall seem happy with the progress I have made. I read one of their reference letters recently for an application I submitted this summer and was blown away by how kind and encouraging my advisor was when speaking on my research ability and he even said I worked hard (which is not something I consider of myself, even). He noticed that in addition to my research, I maintained good grades, continued TAships, work positions, and sought out workshops and conferences even when I wasn't asked. \n\nIt might take some time to convince your advisor but if they are good advisors they will notice your work, research, and work ethic improving and will give you credit for it. You've just started so it might seem hard but as you continue to build a rapport with your advisor, I think it will be easier to have research discussions and bring more thoughtful comments to the table which they will appreciate. Focus more on producing good work than trying to convince them or reassure them of anything. They will take note eventually.\n\nEdit: I don't mean to say you should stick it out with this PI no matter what. Talk to any current students they have to see if they have received any positive reinforcement (which is important). If the PI seems to be continuously belittling or demanding, they may not be a good PI in general. Don't settle with a shit PI because the project is good because you will end up hating it. If you and your PI don't mesh then you won't have a good grad experience. You shouldn't have to suffer through your project. Different PIs have different supervisory styles and it's so important that you can gel with the one your PhD advisor has.\n\nEdit2: I see you don't have weekly meetings with your PI. For me, this is incredibly helpful since if I do mess something up, I'm not doing it for X number of weeks before my PI tells me it's wrong. Maybe this will help you. I am also taking 10 hours of classes (although 3 are for research and 1 is a seminar, so it's not the same as 10 full class hours), and always had a weekly meeting. If I had to postpone, I told my advisors and they were always cool with it. This might help your advisor see that you are actively working on research and can help guide your doubts. Working with them on a weekly or biweekly basis may also help you realize if you like the PI or not, which is important (See first edit).",
