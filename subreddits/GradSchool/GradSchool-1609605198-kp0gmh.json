  "title:": "Grad school is hard, but don\u2019t sacrifice the things that make you whole",
  "text": "Trying to set a positive mindset for 2021 for grad students here. While I think grad school is hard, it\u2019s not all that impossible as some people may make it out to be. If you do your readings on time, set time aside for your assignments, prepare for quizzes incrementally (instead of cramming things on the last day), its not as difficult as most people say it is to do well in grad school.\nLearning something new is always hard at first, but putting in effort pays dividends if you commit to it persistently. Also, that first bad grade you receive will not be the end of life. Don\u2019t sacrifice your morning walks for it. Don\u2019t skip a meal. Meditate regularly if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing before grad school, don\u2019t give up the little things that keep you sane. Take things one day at a time. And be proud of what you have achieved, even if its a small improvement in your academics. \nBest of luck y\u2019all for the coming semester, we\u2019re all in this together!",

Even if I wasn't thrilled about the assignment, I forced myself to do it as early as I could because after completing it on time I could breathe and calmly move on to the next thing. Many of my peers waited until the last day and were incredibly stressed (to the point that they would make ME worried I missed something) and would say things like \"I'm a procrastinator, that's who I am.\" Break that cycle. I promise you, it will make your life so much easier.",

She basically treated us as if we were shitty researchers if we had hobbies, personal lives, or literally anything we did in our days besides research. (One person in our lab mentioned working from 7AM to 7PM *daily* on research, and our advisor said, \u201cThat\u2019s still not enough time.) We got INTO IT arguing many times before I simply REFUSED to buy into her philosophy. She would say that I didn\u2019t have the drive to be a good researcher, and I would say that it was unrealistic of her to expect her students to succeed working 24/7 with no downtime. \n\nI would love to say that I had an exceptionally out-of-touch advisor, but I have seen all sorts of toxicity from advisors; mine was only one form that the toxicity could take. Academia is truly a cutthroat place at times. It CAN be navigated, but it means that you have to be iron in your will to do it the way that feels best for you. Compromise, collaborate, and participate as needed, but don\u2019t be afraid to draw boundaries for yourself.",

I still played video games when I had extra time, I still watched a couple shows with my husband, but I still spent hours and hours on homework.

I'm trying to build a routine and goals and hope to be able to do that some day, even though it sounds impossible.

Only doing a bit of work is a perfectly acceptable life goal.  Unromantic, in my opinion, but to each their own!  But if you\u2019re in a highly complex field you\u2019re just not going to get very good doing that. \n\nAnd, again real talk, the people that are *passionate* about what they do \u2014 they do it because they love it, not because it\u2019s a job \u2014 they don\u2019t want to work with 9-5ers.  They\u2019re not fun as colleagues.  They\u2019re not passionate and they don\u2019t feel reliable when there\u2019s a ton to do.   \nJob-wise this means: If there\u2019a *huge* demand in field (e.g. programming) a 9-5er can get a good job.  They won\u2019t get a super-sexy job probably, because the hyper-passionate people that put in twice as much effort and heart have those jobs and they don\u2019t want to work with 9-5ers.  *But* there are plenty of solid places with solid work that weren\u2019t sexy enough to get the hyper-passionately.  And many of them will have 9-5-ish culture.   \u2014- That\u2019s if demand outstrips top talent.  In the sciences, alas, that\u2019s often not the case.  It is going to be *much* harder to find work if you\u2019re not top talent \u2014 and, no surprise, top talent are the people that live and breathe their discipline (and *want* to!).\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a balanced life \u2014 even if you\u2019re a live-and-breather.  Have a sport, have friends.  In fact. Both will make you better at your science \u2014 they functionally give you more time!\n\nBut if you want a 9-5 job don\u2019t pick work that involves catching up to centuries of the best minds building on each other.  Unless you\u2019re okay pivoting career-wise.  (I\u2019m all for learning for the sake of learning, of course!)",

You have not stumbled upon the magic solution to a 1% or less tenure track likelihood\u2014and even if you had, it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cjust have nebulous passion that you put above everything else and look down on anyone who recognizes the need for balance in life to drive productivity and creativity.\u201d \n\nConstantly attempting to misunderstand my point so that you can maintain some illusion of superiority isn\u2019t admirable.

My breakfasts are really quick and easy too (like yogurt, a banana, and orange juice), so I don't have to spend time cooking really at all during the weekday (I haven't eaten lunch in years). I spoil myself a bit on weekends with making nice breakfasts occasionally, but usually I try to be as efficient and healthy as possible everywhere. I run on six hours of sleep a night, which also contributes a ton of time every day.\n\nAlso, my hobbies aren't things that I can do every day (except for running). So like, once or twice a week I'll go rock climbing, I'll go train MMA twice a week, I play DnD once a week, etc.",
