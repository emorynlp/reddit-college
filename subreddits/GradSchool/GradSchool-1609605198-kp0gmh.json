While I think grad school is hard, it\u2019s not all that impossible as some people may make it out to be. If you do your readings on time, set time aside for your assignments, prepare for quizzes incrementally (instead of cramming things on the last day), its not as difficult as most people say it is to do well in grad school.\nLearning something new is always hard at first, but putting in effort pays dividends if you commit to it persistently. Also, that first bad grade you receive will not be the end of life. Don\u2019t sacrifice your morning walks for it. Don\u2019t skip a meal. Meditate regularly if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing before grad school, don\u2019t give up the little things that keep you sane. Take things one day at a time. And be proud of what you have achieved, even if its a small improvement in your academics. \nBest of luck y\u2019all for the coming semester, we\u2019re all in this together!", "author": "MyGREPrep", "created": 1609605198, "retrieved": 1632845330, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 545, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ghyr4qa": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kp0gmh/grad_school_is_hard_but_dont_sacrifice_the_things/ghyr4qa/", "text": "I cannot emphasize enough that doing your assignments in a timely manner will well and truly save you stress.

Many of my peers waited until the last day and were incredibly stressed (to the point that they would make ME worried I missed something) and would say things like \"I'm a procrastinator, that's who I am.\" Break that cycle.

My advisor was one of the toxic ones. She basically treated us as if we were shitty researchers if we had hobbies, personal lives, or literally anything we did in our days besides research. (One person in our lab mentioned working from 7AM to 7PM *daily* on research, and our advisor said, \u201cThat\u2019s still not enough time.) We got INTO IT arguing many times before I simply REFUSED to buy into her philosophy. She would say that I didn\u2019t have the drive to be a good researcher, and I would say that it was unrealistic of her to expect her students to succeed working 24/7 with no downtime. \n\nI would love to say that I had an exceptionally out-of-touch advisor, but I have seen all sorts of toxicity from advisors; mine was only one form that the toxicity could take. Academia is truly a cutthroat place at times. It CAN be navigated, but it means that you have to be iron in your will to do it the way that feels best for you.

I still played video games when I had extra time, I still watched a couple shows with my husband, but I still spent hours and hours on homework. Even with all that, my friends were honestly concerned about my mental state because my short term memory for anything not grad school was crumbling.
