Naive, wide eyed me just tried to get along but she kept me out of the group at the lab, to her credit, she was very charismatic so ... It became too hard for me to stay and try to figure things out while most people tried to stay away from the drama or she actively pushed them away from me. Whoever I got close to, even the older lab tech she used to ignore, she would befriend to push me further into isolation. \n\nAnyways, that was best thing that has happened to me. I left academia because the competitiveness for publishing and being first author for a MS in biology was not for me and my mental health was suffering. I decided I just wanted to make money and live a chill life. I became a dentist instead, now I work 4 days a week and recently signed a contract to work 3 days a week making 100k usd. On my days off I work out and get massages. I'm so much happier now and looking back, it was all because of her.\n\nLastly. I found her Instagram all these years later. She got fat, she dropped out of her PhD and now works as a lab tech in a lab I know pays out 30k usd a year. Her apartment looks shitty and run down. \n\nI wish her well because if she was amazing, really helpful to me, and helped me get my MS, I would be working as a lab tech or on a PhD hating life.
