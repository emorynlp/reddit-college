  "title:": "Any advice for supervising an undergrad doing a senior thesis?",
  "text": "I just got asked by an undergrad in my lab to supervise their senior thesis and want to make it as good of an experience as possible. My senior thesis still remains my favorite project I've done so far, and was a large part of why I continued on to grad school.\n\nAny advice on how to supervise a student on this? I already have the project design picked out and they'd be helping me build and test a stimuli set designed to elicit a specific effect (psych), so more of what I want to make sure I can do is help them gain the background knowledge to understand why we're studying the thing we're studying the way we're studying it, and also the how-research-works part of it.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I would suggest just be the advisor you would want to have! Encourage weekly or bi weekly meetings outside of the lab, sitting down and answering some of the gritty writing questions or formatting stuff. Give them connections to opportunities and resources, check in frequently, just be available!",
