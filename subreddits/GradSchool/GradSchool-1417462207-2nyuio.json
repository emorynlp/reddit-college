I like my advisor, he is helpful and nice and has high expectations, but nothing that is physically impossible to do.  I work 50+ hours a week, but you know what, because I enjoy the projects that I work on, and think that the science matters, it's not that big of a deal.  \n\nI live on my grad student stipend.  No, I don't have money coming out of my ears, but I have a decent apartment in a decent part of town, walking distance from school, and live with a roommate.  I'm not broke, I'm not taking out any loans, I don't eat a diet consisting of ramen noodles.  My fiance and I put almost a thousand dollars into savings each month to prepare for our wedding.  I have a social life, hang out with other grad students on a weekly basis, have fun and drink and watch football and whatnot.  \n\nI take a few days of vacation a year, nothing extravagant, but around the holidays I take a few days off and go see my family.  \n\nResearch is research, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes whole weeks are wasted in one experiment.  But I knew how research was getting in, and I deal with it.  My thesis committee is a helpful group of individuals who want me to succeed.  My advisor is well connected I have good job projects upon the completion of my degree.  My TAing takes up time, but overall I enjoy it, because I like teaching.  Most of my students aren't idiot grade-grubbers, and I even like some of them. \n\nThe reason I am writing this is not to belittle or make fun of the other opinions on this subreddit.  I just see so much negativity and depression on this subreddit, and people that come here that are not yet in grad school see it all the time.  There are people out there that enjoy, or for who it is at the very least, not a completely negative experience.  \n\ntl;dr  Grad school can be enjoyable if you know what you're getting into and have the desire to do it.

Screw the students education... take their money whilst getting more monies from the NSF!!!\n\nI don't even know why I wrote this.  I paid nothing for my undergradate degree (actually made money).  And now, I make a stipend going to graduate school.  But I still feel like its all BS.  They teach virtually no application in classes anymore... and then we use nothing learned from classes to do work in the lab.  The educational system needs to be reformatted.  I would say its broken.\n\nThat being said, I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HAPPY WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE AT GRAD SCHOOL!!!!!
