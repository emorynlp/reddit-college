  "text": "I'm a semester in to an advertising grad program, and I have this haunting feeling that I'm putting aside my passions that I've always wanted to pursue, like writing, singing, making art, to have an art adjacent career, which feels maybe \"safer\" for the long term. Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever be able to make money off of these passions, but I really want to have time to fully pursue them, at least as hobbies. As I work full time and am also in school I'm pretty burnt out and all my creative energy goes to projects that aren't solely for me.\n\nI'd also add that I got into this field to communicate culture shifting, social justice oriented ideas, but it all feels very cheap to me because it comes on the back on selling products. I'm sure there's a path to be found in this industry that feels true to me, but I'm just like, why? Do I need to be in school for this? Analysis and strategic thinking comes naturally to me. Like, I could be good at this, and could feel happiness but... I can't turn off the part of me that is like girl, wtf are you doing (I was sitting in class the other night and all my brain was saying was I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE I DON'T CARE).\n\nI earnestly believe I have bottled up personal creative dreams for my whole life because I've been taught they aren't practical and I could never make money off of them. I'm considering dropping out of school, getting a job that pays the bills, and having all the free time to focus on art and cultural experiences.\n\nBut it's all very scary. From this post you would think I've made up my mind. But I'm extremely conflicted. Actually I was talking to my therapist about this and she said \"I think you're retramatizing yourself by being in school.\" WOAH! My parents are teachers and everyone else in my family has a masters degree and all my life I've gotten so much love and approval by putting my whole heart and creative energies into school, and now that my creative inner artist has had a taste of daylight it's freaking out and being like \"You suppressed me forever to do school and now I'm angry because you're doing school again but what about me?\" I put myself through so much pain in high school and undergrad to excel in school, and now my therapist basically told me I'm in an abusive relationship with school. Because what do traumatized people do? They retraumatize themselves, because they think they can handle that known pain in favor of the pain of the unknown (which you know, might not even be painful at all, maybe the unknown holds thrilling joy! But it's scary. What if what if what if!). And yet! Just last night I had a class where the creative juices were flowing and I was like this is fun I can do this! But, like every abusive relationship, there are points of love and care that keep the abused coming back.\n\nAll that said, I still don't know what I'm going to do. Will I take a risk, quit, and explore art? Or will I keep going, convince myself it's worth it? Like I said, even though this post clearly says GIRL YOU GOTTA GET OUT, I have no idea what I'm actually gonna do. Cuz yk, the practicality! The potential regret! The judgement from family and friends! Dear God, give me a sign.",

      "text": "What about approaching advertising as a malleable toolset, rather than hollow profession? By this I mean, consumer goods are far from the only thing which needs to be \"sold\" so people - at some point or another, for some reason or another.  Maybe you could direct your background creative juices to processing the material/lessons in such a way that it/they can be adapted/applied to advertising to/selling people on, information, ideas, behaviors, and/or beliefs.  \n\nFor at least 6 or 7 years now, me-myself have had a couple background threads work on methods/strategies for effectively commuicating to people the validity of whatever truth it is they don't want to hear, feel me?\n\nSeems like it has the potential to scratch your creative fulfillment itch - and simultaneously provide some context under which you might successfully internalize the idea that there is plenty of 'good' out there that needs to get done - and what you are learning is actually how you might be able to be good at doing good - and get paid.    --The extent to which it is the good you are gettin paid to do,  is likely related to job seeking in the private vs non-profit sector.   \n\nIf you think about it like this you are actually taking a very strategic route to a life of doing shit that makes you feel good inside, without the self-imposed poverty of most academics =)    Get it",

You might be able to make a lateral shift depending on what your department is like.",
