I have made a long journey since starting college where my gpa was atrocious for my first 2.5 years due to mental health struggles, but I am proud to say at the end of this semester my gpa will be vastly improved (will be around a 3.1). I was told I should apply to an Ivy League or a UC school because of this publication as I am a co-author with my professor. No one else is listed on the paper and I was told by peers that are already in graduate school that this is typically very impressive for an undergraduate and would possibly give me a shot at a prestigious chemistry PhD program at an ivy or one of the UC\u2019s. Should I even bother applying based on my gpa? It is pretty obvious on my transcript that I have excelled in my upper level classes, but I\u2019ve never been confident about myself even with this publication I just received.\n\n\nEdit: I know my 3.1 is not stellar, I just know had I have overcome my struggles before college I wouldn\u2019t be in this position of having such low confidence about applying to a prestigious chemistry grad program.", "author": "Apocalyptic2020", "created": 1631737312, "retrieved": 1632844425, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "comments": {"hdguvgg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/poy4sz/should_i_even_bother_applying_to_ivy_leagues/hdguvgg/", "text": "I agree it depends.
