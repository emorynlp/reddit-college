  "text": "I\u2019m so frustrated with myself. I thought my dissertation was nearly done, but I haven\u2019t looked at in 3 weeks. It\u2019s a huge mess. Not sure which stats tables are correct and which are from my old model. Idk why I did that, but #ADHDsucks. \n\nI keep getting in the cycle where I tell my advisor I\u2019ll send it, and then, I feel tons of shame for my lack of progress\u2026 and then don\u2019t send it. I\u2019m working 55-60 hours per week, so I\u2019m exhausted and don\u2019t have much energy to write at night. \n\nI believe I\u2019m a good peds clinician, but this kind of research sucks for me. I know I need to \u201cjust get over it.\u201d But the task feels so overwhelming. \n\nI hope one day I can help grad students with adhd plan this mess out because dissertations require so much executive functioning, and it\u2019s just assumed people know what tf they\u2019re doing.  I have the stats skills but not the executive functioning skills. \n\nDoes anyone have practical tips? I know breaking things up is good\u2026 I\u2019m just not sure how to do that effectively. I\u2019ve gone my whole life procrastinating and getting that last minute adrenaline rush\u2026 and that obviously won\u2019t work here.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a clinical psych doc student, and my area of research right now is adult ADHD in educational settings. I\u2019m by no means an expert, nor am I working on my dissertation in any tangible way yet. But I\u2019m a facilitator for an EF skills group for undergrads with ADHD, so I might have some advice that helps?? Apologies if you already know all this stuff. \n\nObviously you\u2019ve made it far enough to reach the dissertation stage, so you\u2019ve used some at least partially effective coping skills. But what does your organizational system look like? Using a calendar and a highly specific task list in conjunction and looking at them 2-3 times a day seems to be the sweet spot for folks with ADHD. \n\nIf you\u2019re on stimulants, do you know when your peak effectiveness hours are? If you\u2019re not on stimulants, when do you feel most focused naturally? If possible, work on the effortful stuff then and only then. The rest of the time you may find it significantly harder.  \n\nRanking tasks by importance alone, amount of effort, or urgency+importance is pretty helpful. As is using the snowball method to get started. That might look like spending 15 minutes jotting down all the thoughts rattling around in your head about your dissertation. Things to change, ideas to look into, data to double check, whatever. Then commit to writing down every single \u201cI should really do that\u201d thought you have around your dissertation moving forward. Getting it on paper is the first step to holding yourself accountable. \n\nThen go back and group everything you wrote down. Add anything new that pops into your mind while you do it. The groups could be pretty much anything that works for you. Phases of the project, to be done vs things to keep in mind, levels of urgency or importance, etc. Then it\u2019s up to you to plan out how to tackle those groups based on how you choose to categorize everything. Just decide how much time you think a task or phase of work will take and then double or triple it. Once you get in the swing of things, you\u2019ll get better at more accurately estimating your time on tasks.\n\nAlso consider establishing an accountability buddy. I\u2019ve found that it works better if it\u2019s not a friend who lets me off the hook when I fuck up. My advisor is actually very helpful in that respect, but there are other grad students in my department who connect with folks in other programs to have some joint accountability without the urge to commiserate over specific shared classes and the like.\n\nEstablishing a routine is also good if you can do work in the same space with the same set of circumstances every time. That\u2019s not always feasible right now, but even if you can establish at least two environmental cues that you come to associate with being productive, those can help you focus a bit when you\u2019re having a rough time. My personal go-to is the Homework Hypnotics album on Apple Music and lighting a gingerbread scented candle (all year round). Even when I\u2019m not feeling it, getting those two things going can help me feel a little more amenable to working. \n\nHopefully this helps at least a little bit. If I think of any other practical tips that might apply, I\u2019ll add them to this.",

When it goes off I check what I\u2019m doing, and refocus if needed. \n\nI also try to schedule my work from home so that I can have full days on the dissertation without having to do my paid work.\n\nEdit: Oh, and if you\u2019re not seeing a therapist, do so!

I get so bogged down by not knowing the product will be perfect I am frozen at the start. My coping mechanism for that is to just set a \u201cstart by\u201d date and sticking to it. I prioritize my starts and for me this is enough because once I start something I usually can finish the task.",
