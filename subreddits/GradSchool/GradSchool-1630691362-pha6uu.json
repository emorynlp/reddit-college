She is not a mentor and she just showed her true colours. It also shows her letter would have been garbage anyways with that type of mentality. Good thing you are getting out of there.\n\nFor the letter, just ask another professor you are close with or a previous internship supervisor. If they ask why your advisor can't do it or refuse to do it because you are not one of their direct students, just explain the situation. This type of attitude is not well seen at all and they should be understanding and provide you with a good letter.\n\nFYI, I have been in your situation multiple times both in industrial and academic contexts and *I can* *assure you* a mentor will support you no matter what you decide if you deem it best for you. Her attitude is not normal and you are correct to be surprised by the response she gave you. You deserve better and I hope you find a real mentor during grad school!

More just that 3 people are willing to recommend you.\n\nMine were 'confidential' (i.e. could not see them on my app), but asked to see them near graduating.

Still, for myself, I simply just looked elsewhere and found other professors that I took courses previously to write the LoR for me when I was switching my Ph.D. program from one school to the other school. \n\nIf I understand you correctly, you probably want your current advisor's letter because you have worked with her, and she can vouch for your research experience, right? And I think you definitely made the right choice of asking her for one, but if she flat out denies your request, I would think that even if she were to write you one, it wouldn't be a perfect one... Maybe the better choice is to highlight your research experience from your personal perspective on your personal statement, and try to ask other professors you have taken courses with that could vouch for your work ethic and how well you did on your courses. Then if someone asks why you didn't get the letter from your advisor, you could simply just say that she rejected it and you had no choice. \n\nAlthough there is a saying that not getting the LoR from your previous advisor may not necessarily bode well (which I think could be true to some degree depending on how everything turned out), but I wasn't asked by my new advisor and school regarding why I didn't get the LoR from the previous advisor.\n\nI hope this could be somewhat helpful, good luck", "author": "siber222000", "created": 1630691879, "upvotes": 27}}}
