Stayed up till 4:30 AM, slept an hour, showered, gave defense unpracticed at 9, to wide applause and compliments.\n\nCommittee is making me implement their edits before they sign paperwork, I straight up said NO to half of the additional analyses they tried to add. Just submitted revisions to my last chapter 5 minutes ago, and responded to most suggestions with \"Interesting. We should revisit this idea in the manuscript, not the dissertation.\"\n\nFor context, I've been in my PhD for six years, and have had a hard time saying \"NO\" to my co-advisors, which prolonged my stay. My original advisor died, I got divorced, was given fake/flawed data by my sponsor agency (which I alerted them to), and my funding ran out in Dec, my original defense was postponed due to the govt shutdown, and I have a postdoc lined up at a different school. I'm not an asshole, but I've been through a lot.\n\nDGAF level=ninja.\n\nIf my committee makes me do another round of edits, I think I'm just going to drop out and become a TEDx speaker.",

Tell your mind it's just another iteration of something you've done successfully before - you know how to do it, so you can do it again. Tomorrow, you don't have two days left to finish your revisions, tomorrow is just a day you're going to spend revising. \n\nEveryone's different and what I use to trick my brain may not trick yours.
