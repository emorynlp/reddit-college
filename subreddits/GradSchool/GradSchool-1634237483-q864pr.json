  "text": "Humanities PhD, just got my MA and working on qualifying this year. Most of my good friends are not in academia and to be quite honest I\u2019m jealous. I want a normal, 9-5 job. \n\nI don\u2019t regret getting here, it was meant to be and the only path rlly open for me at the time in my life. But now, I really want to consider dropping out. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t love the research. I love teaching. I want to look for high school teaching jobs internationally and change my trajectory. \n\nIt\u2019s just scary when all the grad students around me love it and want to be here. I have no one to seriously discuss this with that has been through it.",

      "text": "I was in a very similar situation: was getting a humanities PhD, loved teaching, got an MA over the course of my doctoral program, but was not loving the research (and loved the field even less). Most of my fellow grad students were having a great time and were shocked that I was not. \n\nHere are a few things I'd recommend considering. \n\n- Recognize that teaching high school is not a regular 9-5 job. It is (usually) a 50+ hour/week job that pays at or below median wage (and even where it's above median wage, it's below the median wage for people with a master's degree). Of course if it's what you care about it can be worth it (and it's certainly worthwhile, much-needed work), but don't think of it as an escape into a low-pressure career.\n\n- Most humanities fields by now have generated fairly robust discussions about alternatives to academia (often shortened to \"alt-ac\"). I just googled \"alt-ac [my old field]\" and found a whole google page's worth of results of people in that field talking about paths to non-academic jobs with or without a PhD. You may also be able to find resources within your university to help you think about making this transition into non-academic work. I highly recommend exploring this space and giving an honest try to finding an alt-ac career path you can imagine that involves staying on and finishing your PhD, just so that you have a way to imagine a future for yourself other than staying in academia or dropping out immediately. That's the one thing I regret not doing when I was making my decision to drop out. \n\n- Do what it takes to convince yourself that whatever course you take isn't a failure. After I left with my MA, I spent years feeling as though I had let myself down and that I had somehow missed the mark. Regardless of whether other grad students are having a good time, and regardless of what you thought you wanted when you entered the program, you making the right choice for yourself is not a mistake.",
