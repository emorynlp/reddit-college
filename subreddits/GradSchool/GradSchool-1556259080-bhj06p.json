My\nPhD defense is at 9:15am-12:30pm. Lecture and examination. \n\nHelllpppp! How do I sleep ???\n\nEDIT: Took a melatonin supplement at 2:15. Manage to get about 4 hours. Time is now 7:20 and starting my morning return. I'll come for another edit if there's good news later!\n\nEDIT 2: I PASSED! Two of the four examiners complimented me on the fact that my dissertation looks like it had been proofread more than once. About 70% of the questions were speculative, asking \"what I would do next\" which is apparently code for \"we think your studies are just fine!\". Around 30% of the questions were clarifying details and testing my knowledge. If I didn't know the answer, I was honest but referred to where I would look to find the answer. Overall it was great. Examiners weren't easy but they were very reasonable. Overall great learning experience. And now I am Dr! It is possible to finish! Now to celebrate with my department and family.", "author": "concentriccarl", "created": 1556259080, "retrieved": 1632846418, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"elxa8i6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/bhj06p/defending_my_phd_in_7_hours/elxa8i6/", "text": "Congratulations on passing!!!! :) You must be so proud of all you've accomplished!", "author": "kintakara", "created": 1556386798, "upvotes": 1}, "elvwu5i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/bhj06p/defending_my_phd_in_7_hours/elvwu5i/", "text": "Congrats Dr.!", "author": "anothertimelord", "created": 1556332437, "upvotes": 1}, "elv8axn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/bhj06p/defending_my_phd_in_7_hours/elv8axn/", "text": "Congratulations, Dr.!
