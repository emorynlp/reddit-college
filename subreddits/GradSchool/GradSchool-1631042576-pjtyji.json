How do you do it?", "text": "I got offered a full time job and I reaaaaaally want to take it. It is 40 hours a week compared to the 29 I have been doing. \n\nProblem is I have 3 classes that I am taking, and I'm scared I may not be able to handle it. I am eager to leave my current job since it sucks, but I don't want to make any rash decisions...\n\nDo you work and go to school fulltime?\n\nEdit: should add, that classes are at night. Additionally,  I am finishing up my research at the end of the month and won't start full time until November, so the tail end of the semester. \n\nIt is an environmental science program.\n\nEdut: Decided not to take it for several reasons.

However I am in my 2nd semester of non-thesis MS program. I am also engaged and have a 3 yo step daughter. My secret is:\n\n1. One class is online, the other two are night classes on W/R.\n2. I had my job give me W/R off.\n3. Wednesday is for house chores and errands.\n4. Thursday is for homework for the two in person classes.\n5. Online class gets worked on during the other days before or after work.\n6. Consistent sleep schedule, no all-nighters.\n\nA few notes, facts, and suggestions:\n1. I wouldn't do this if I was PhD, or in last semester of thesis option.\n2. I have no social life, and also quit drinking.\n3. The fiance is supportive and accepts the temporary lack of personal time.\n4. Priorities have shifted. When I was in undergrad, my priority list was: Undergrad, Job, Family, Personal. After acquiring my main goal (B.S.), it has shifted to Family, Job, Grad school, personal.\n5. For me personally, undergrad was the \"must complete\". It was the pie. The masters is just the cherry on top.\n\nGood luck! It's hard, it's exhausting.
