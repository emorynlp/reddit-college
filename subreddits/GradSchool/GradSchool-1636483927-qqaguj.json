  "text": "I am currently in my first year of a Master's in Interior design. Last year, I had to take a year's worth of bridge classes to catch me up in the design field since my background is in Psychology and Sociology. I also have a good deal of experience in community engagement, development at non-profits, and some social media management. I am taking 3 classes (9 credits, full time) and am working 20 hours a week as a Research Assistant in a different department, related to my undergrad degree. \n\nI have 2 young children and I feel that I have taken on too much with full time classes and working 20 hrs a week. Technically, I am booked for 47 hrs a week with my job and expected coursework outside of class. I am exhausted and have stopped seeing the point of all this. I'm working to pay for school/to avoid debt, but then I feel like I'm not getting much out of my classes since I am only doing what I have to to get by. What I would most like to do is come home after working, spend time with my family, and not have to think about assignments or work anymore. On top of all this, I've been dealing with some mental health issues as I'm in therapy for childhood trauma. I have 3 semesters left of my program, but the thought of dealing with this amount of stress and zero motivation for the next year and a half makes me feel sick. At the same time, I know that I've made decent connections in my program and with my RAship and if I get through this, I'll have a chance at some interesting jobs. I'm a bit worried about ruining connections by leaving or regretting it since I'll essentially be giving up the design field. A big part of me doesn't care and I worry that I didn't think it through enough before starting this program, but I'm worried that I'm only thinking that way because I'm struggling so much right now. \n\nWhat do I do? Do I power through or cut my losses now and find a lower stress job/situation? Is it reasonable to think I could get a different job right now?",

      "text": "we can't tell you what to do but most of the time when people take a leave of absence from a grad program, they don't come back.\n\nIf you think this is too much and you might be able to find another job you're happy with, without finishing the degree, start applying for those jobs and see if you get any bites. I would personally test the waters there before dropping anything.\n\nAlternatively, if the main issue is having too much on your plate now but you do think you'd have a better/more lucrative/enjoyable career by sticking with your program, I'd like to put forth the idea that going into debt isn't the worst thing ever. After dropping out of my PhD and doing the math, I realized I would have been better off going into debt for an intensive 1-year MS up to 100k over spending 3 years getting paid in my PhD because I would have been able to get back into the job market and earn a much higher wage sooner. I didn't do the math before a PhD because spending that much on a degree sounded insane. Your mental health is important too and if you can take out loans, come out of this healthy, and find a better paying career by finishing this in debt, maybe consider dropping the side job and taking out a loan? Definitely do the math on potential earnings first though.",
