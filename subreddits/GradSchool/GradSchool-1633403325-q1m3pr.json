  "title:": "Strange assignment from my advisors?",
  "text": "My advisor assigned me to present on a paper that my other advisor severely dislikes. As in, it is the antithesis of what we are trying to prove. They want me to present it to them so that I can have the experience of \"being ripped apart in a safe environment,\" meaning they will regularly chime in to \"prove me wrong\" about the research (which, to me, is bizarre). They also want me to figure out exactly \\*why\\* they don't like this paper and discuss. This is the first time they have requested for me to present a paper, or even taken a vested interest in my development as a scientist (I have just started my second year of this PhD program). \n\nThe paper is a recent publication on the anatomy of the organism we study. I \\*think\\* I know what their problem with it is, but I'm not 100% confident. I was also sent a few \"supplementary\" papers to compare with the main one.  I'm extremely nervous. The presentation is this Friday and I haven't started working on it yet. Does anyone have any advice about how best to present and discuss this research?",

      "text": "I actually don't think this is that strange. I think it's a pretty good idea to practice arguing a case with a person who disagrees in a safe environment. As long as this other faculty member is trying to help you learn how to speak in public and argue effectively and not just an exercise in tearing down a grad student. \n\nI think the best way to prepare would be to read the paper thoroughly and be able to go over the logic of their argument, what they found, and what implications there may be without relying too much on notes. And I also find it helpful to have something to drink because my mouth can sometimes get dry when I talk too much. If you're like me, a bottle of water or some coffee can help you slow down a bit and not talk so fast.",

      "text": "It does sound somewhat insane and it's certainly not for everyone, but this general kind of \"being set up to fail in a safe environment\" was beneficial for me. It got me over my stage fright and imposter syndrome at an early stage in my training, which has enabled me to be more proactive and assertive when communicating with more senior researchers.",

Once you get to presenting and defending your own work people\u2019s criticisms can hit a lot harder, so this is great practice at keeping a level head.",

      "text": "That's actually good practice. \n\nStart with whether their findings are in line with the literature, whether their variables/controls are correct, etc. and then determine whether their conclusions/study implications are accurate. Critically review it, and then if you find logical gaps/overstatement/inconsistencies, see whether you can defend or point out these gaps in your presentation. Presenting the limitations as discussion points is a good practice and might reduce being \"ripped apart\".",

      "text": "This is what my qual exam was like, lol.\nBeing able to analyze a paper critically is a useful skill, and might help you think about any areas in your research that could be lacking - methodology, clarity in presentation etc. \n\nI would try to create your own thoughts about the paper, rather than trying so hard to figure what your advisors think is wrong with it. Maybe you reach the same conclusion, maybe you don't, but the exercise is more useful than the outcome.\n\nAnd finally, try to keep in mind that your advisors are trying to help you with this, rather than put you down. It's hard when they ask questions and you are in a position to \"defend\" and it can get overwhelming. And if you need a bit of reassurance at the end, I'd ask for it as well. Feedback should be things you need to improve on, yes, but also stuff you did well that you want to carry forward with you. \n\nGood luck with this! You can do it!",

Your advisors sound like morons, but don't tell them I said that.\n\nMy advice is to try to stay engaged with the content of the paper. It sounds like they want to make it about you, but you should make it about the material. Study the paper and decide what you think about it.\n\nOh, if you can, practice talking about the paper with a peer first.",

      "text": "I think they might have presented it a little weird, but it makes sense to me. From what I understand, you're supposed to defend the article's argument, whether or not you agree? They're trying to get you to understand the authors' argument fully instead of just trying to tell you why they disagree with it, probably in hopes that you'll develop your own opinions about it. Plus it gives you practice for defending ideas, but without your own proposal or thesis defense on the line or without an audience of people you don't know watching.",
