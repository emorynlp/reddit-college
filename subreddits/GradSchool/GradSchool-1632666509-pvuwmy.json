Second semester in my MPA program - the content can be a little dry but honestly I do enjoy learning what I'm learning and it's all incredibly helpful for my career and current job. You hear how it's so much harder to learn as an older adult, but I'm 31 - am I really already hitting a wall learning-wise?\n\nI will say I have a full-time job and am taking 3 classes (but only have in-person class 2 evenings a week), all while having just bought a house in a newish town with my husband, 3yo and 6 month old. I also started my school career late in life and went back in 2017 and have gotten my associate in arts, bachelor in social work, and went straight into the MPA program two weeks after graduating with my BSW.\n\nI know I'm a little burnt out but my program is only going to take about a calendar year and then I'm done. I am super happy, LOVE my job, love my family and our lives, and I genuinely enjoy learning. I usually excel at school, but lately I am SO behind on readings and am always turning things in right before they're due and I just realized I completely missed two discussion board posts in one class because we transferred to a new system (Canvas from Blackboard) and our professor is using the navigation weird. I guess I just didn't search deep enough and she didn't tell us in class to get them done.\n\nI do have time to get things done - my husband takes the kids out of the house to give me quiet/alone time and is completely supportive - but I just can't bring myself to do any of the tasks I should be doing to get ahead. What's going on here, am I burnt out? I have ADD but am unmedicated - should I get medicated again? Am I just too old to be doing this shit anymore? I honestly feel fucking dumb, and this is new for me.\n\nTell me your stories of being super over it and then *how you triumphed* because I definitely don't want to put off this degree any further. My kids have never known a mom not in school. Once I'm done I am done and I am SO LOOKING FORWARD to free nights and weekends to actually be around the people I love and just fuck off.", "author": "An0therEternity", "created": 1632666509, "retrieved": 1632952012, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"heo18pn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvuwmy/ugh_am_i_just_getting_too_old_for_this/heo18pn/", "text": "I really appreciate you posting this. It makes me feel a lot better. I work full time and do online school and gosh class can be super boring some times. I don't have kids but what I'm doing is just not making school my number one priority. That is I really don't care what my grades are as long as I pass - which is hard to look at sometimes as a person who had always done well in undergrad etc.\n\nAt the end of the day I'm going to prioritize other aspect of my life above school and that's ok", "author": "Imperator42", "created": 1632877633, "upvotes": 1}, "hegujd1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvuwmy/ugh_am_i_just_getting_too_old_for_this/hegujd1/", "text": "I feel like you're burying the lede here, if I had to guess, unmedicated ADHD is playing just as much of, if not more than a role as your age in how hard you have to try. I'm 26, I have ADHD and I'm medicated and I know a lot of neurotypical people in their 30s and 40s who seem to have a much easier time than me.

The response of \"I just need more motivation!\" is also a common thing I've seen them say that doesn't seem very helpful. Like, they feel good briefly when they find motivation, but then they have the same struggle next week and seem to be constantly seeking better motivation strategies -- which says the motivation isn't a long-term solution.\n\nIt's way harder to power through this phase when you're tired from working hard all the time and emotionally supporting everyone and yourself. That's probably why you were managing ok before but now that you're tired from you're struggling. If you've found medication works in the past, then 100% you should get on that ASAP.\n\nMaybe it's burnout, but I'm not sure that label is useful for you because your ADD means you have a totally atypical threshold for attention and effort. The usual methods for assessing and addressing burnout are designed with neurotypical people in mind. So it makes more sense to address your ADD first, see if that helps, then consider burnout.\n\nAnd no, at 31, you shouldn't be too old!
