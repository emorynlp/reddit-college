  "text": "Hi. I\u2019m getting confused and overwhelmed on my financial situation. I have been very lucky to rely on my parents for all of my life but now that I\u2019m going to grad school I\u2019m on my own and will obviously need to take out loans. I\u2019ve already applied for financial aid for the school I\u2019m attending but how exactly do I go about taking loans out for my living next year? I have a good bit saved but definitely not enough.",
