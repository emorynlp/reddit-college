The pandemic induced many obstacles for me. Working from home, feeling isolated from colleagues, friends, and family while I was wrapping up my degree, and losing a loved one threw a wrench in a lot of my plans. My advisor has helped me a lot to clear a new path to defend my PhD this week in December.\n\nThis year has been challenging and it was hard to keep my head up and work through this beast of a dissertation. What helped motivate me was thinking about why I came to Grad School. I read my personal statement from years ago and I wanted to make that version of myself proud. After all, he was still me, but years and years of Grad School weighed me down. Lifting myself up was hard despite everyone telling me I could do it. I honestly can\u2019t believe I was able to do this, but it happened. I am so proud of myself for successfully defending my dissertation and hearing that I only needed to do about 4 hours of edits to submit my dissertation to the graduate school, which was just accepted and approved moments ago.\n\nI feel happy, relieved, and thankful. It\u2019s hard to describe, but I also feel like I\u2019ve emerged from a fog and like I\u2019m crashing (but in a good way?). Grad school was definitely a challenge and a part of me wonders why this process is so debilitating and at times archaic. But in reflecting today, feeling like I had ownership over my ideas throughout this process (I had a wonderful advisor) and being able to share them with the world successfully has left me feeling confident to be an independent researcher, teacher, mentor, and person. \n\nThis subreddit has been helpful over the years in validating my experiences and expressing my thoughts and feelings along the way. Thank you. To all of you wrapping up your degrees this year, I\u2019m wishing you all the best. Take care of yourselves!
