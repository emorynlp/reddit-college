Unfortunately because of mental health and other personal issues, my undergrad GPA was only 2.94 / 4.00. I finished my last 3 semesters with about a 3.3 GPA though, if that counts for anything. I'm looking to apply to KCL for an MSc in Urban Informatics. I know my undergraduate GPA is pretty low. What are my chances of getting into KCL for this specific program? Do UK universities have a more holistic approach when evaluating candidates, or is it strictly based on academics?\n\nProgram - [https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/urban-informatics-msc](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/courses/urban-informatics-msc)", "author": "DJCYBC", "created": 1631284492, "retrieved": 1632844670, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {}}
