The options A) planning to return to campus for hybrid classes, B) planning on not coming to campus and taking all online classes, C) not returning to the university for the fall. \n\nHow I am supposed to answer that as an ABD student who is not in classes, not TAing classes, planning on working from home but maybe also in the lab when I need supplies, or library when I need books, and might even be out of state at my research site If they ever let us travel. \n\nFor my fellow grad students still in classes, they haven\u2019t been told if they are online or in person yet and don\u2019t really have a choice in what classes they can take. Plus most have to TA, and recitations are currently required to be in person, even if all their grad seminars will be online (our department is working hard to move all recitations online thankfully, despite resistance from the university).\n\nOn top of all of that, they are planning on letting 30,000 students come back to campus from all over in a bit over a month, but won\u2019t let graduate students leave the state for research they have funding to do, some time sensitive. And when we (and our advisors) ask if there is a plan or time line are either ignored or told it will be figured out at some point, but that currently figuring out fall on campus is the priority.  \n\nI get that undergrads make up 2/3 of the student body, but graduate student are the other third and our needs can\u2019t all just be lumped in with the undergrads. \n\nIs anyone else\u2019s university handling this better for grad students?", "author": "archaeob", "created": 1592986522, "retrieved": 1632846321, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 311, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fvx73ob": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hex6e6/my_universitys_roadmap_to_reopening_is_completely/fvx73ob/", "text": "General uni policy is aimed at undergrads on my campus.

I personally haven't been negatively affected at all, but my partner has been indirectly affected. While he's still allowed to use his lab, there are other labs that he needs to use with specialised equipment that only the lab techs can run, and those folks aren't currently allowed back to work. So effectively my partner hasn't been able to get half of his testing done for around 4 months now with no real end date in sight. And for anyone doing field work, it's basically all been scrapped until further notice.\n\nI don't really think that the uni is that heavily to blame, because at the end of the day they have to follow social distancing rules and regs. But it would definitely be nice to see a little more support for the students who have been affected through scholarship extensions, leniency in milestones, that sort of thing.", "author": "fiorescuro", "created": 1593050417, "upvotes": 1}, "fvwf84b": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hex6e6/my_universitys_roadmap_to_reopening_is_completely/fvwf84b/", "text": "My university has said they're prioritizing undergraduates coming back to campus, and that all graduate classes will be online for the fall. Their logic is that, at least for my specific program, many of us will be on internship so we'll be out and about, interacting with folks at our site, and will then be more likely to bring the virus back to campus. I guess?\n\nWhat annoys me is that my program is small and the classes I'm registered for in the fall have max 10-12 students. That would seem easy to hold in person while still social distancing. But no, the university is taking over our spaces because they need more room to social distance the underclassmen. \n\nSeveral folks in my program are already raising a stink, saying they won't pay full tuition for this, etc. Good luck to them - I don't think their complaints will change anything. Best option is to take the semester off and return in the spring if things are back on-campus, I guess. Personally I don't have the luxury of doing that. I am in debt and need to graduate ASAP so I can get a full-time job in my field ASAP, so I'll be suffering through online classes this fall.", "author": "tequilamockingbird16", "created": 1593038217, "upvotes": 2}, "fvwcxla": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hex6e6/my_universitys_roadmap_to_reopening_is_completely/fvwcxla/", "text": "The mass emails from my university are totally different than the ones from my department.
