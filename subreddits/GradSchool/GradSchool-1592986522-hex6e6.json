  "text": "Today we got sent a mandatory survey about our plans for the fall. The options A) planning to return to campus for hybrid classes, B) planning on not coming to campus and taking all online classes, C) not returning to the university for the fall. \n\nHow I am supposed to answer that as an ABD student who is not in classes, not TAing classes, planning on working from home but maybe also in the lab when I need supplies, or library when I need books, and might even be out of state at my research site If they ever let us travel. \n\nFor my fellow grad students still in classes, they haven\u2019t been told if they are online or in person yet and don\u2019t really have a choice in what classes they can take. Plus most have to TA, and recitations are currently required to be in person, even if all their grad seminars will be online (our department is working hard to move all recitations online thankfully, despite resistance from the university).\n\nOn top of all of that, they are planning on letting 30,000 students come back to campus from all over in a bit over a month, but won\u2019t let graduate students leave the state for research they have funding to do, some time sensitive. And when we (and our advisors) ask if there is a plan or time line are either ignored or told it will be figured out at some point, but that currently figuring out fall on campus is the priority.  \n\nI get that undergrads make up 2/3 of the student body, but graduate student are the other third and our needs can\u2019t all just be lumped in with the undergrads. \n\nIs anyone else\u2019s university handling this better for grad students?",

      "text": "My university is handling it pretty well for most PhD students, but certain policies have made it really hard for others. I personally haven't been negatively affected at all, but my partner has been indirectly affected. While he's still allowed to use his lab, there are other labs that he needs to use with specialised equipment that only the lab techs can run, and those folks aren't currently allowed back to work. So effectively my partner hasn't been able to get half of his testing done for around 4 months now with no real end date in sight. And for anyone doing field work, it's basically all been scrapped until further notice.\n\nI don't really think that the uni is that heavily to blame, because at the end of the day they have to follow social distancing rules and regs. But it would definitely be nice to see a little more support for the students who have been affected through scholarship extensions, leniency in milestones, that sort of thing.",

      "text": "My university has said they're prioritizing undergraduates coming back to campus, and that all graduate classes will be online for the fall. Their logic is that, at least for my specific program, many of us will be on internship so we'll be out and about, interacting with folks at our site, and will then be more likely to bring the virus back to campus. I guess?\n\nWhat annoys me is that my program is small and the classes I'm registered for in the fall have max 10-12 students. That would seem easy to hold in person while still social distancing. But no, the university is taking over our spaces because they need more room to social distance the underclassmen. \n\nSeveral folks in my program are already raising a stink, saying they won't pay full tuition for this, etc. Good luck to them - I don't think their complaints will change anything. Best option is to take the semester off and return in the spring if things are back on-campus, I guess. Personally I don't have the luxury of doing that. I am in debt and need to graduate ASAP so I can get a full-time job in my field ASAP, so I'll be suffering through online classes this fall.",

Stay at home.\u201d Our TAs are instructors of record, and we\u2019ll have to request F2F instruction if we want that. As for seminars, the expectation is that we go online unless a professor requests F2F for particular courses. I\u2019m bummed about how much of my MA will be spent online but happy with the support the department is giving us.",

I was given the choice if I wanted to stay here or go back -- luckily I was already setup for a long term stay, so I stayed. While I can't actually access the lab at the moment, and I have no idea yet when I will, the grad students back at my home lab are in a similar position. \n\nDepending on how things are in the fall, I may end up forced to go back to the states with no more lab time, but I am /very/ glad I wasn't forced to scrap the trip back in March.\n\nMost of the focus has been on helping grad students make the switch to online TA-ing (I think about half of our students TA any given term). I know the faculty/staff are getting a lot more info about lab re-opening than we are, and my group seems to be passing along the status as soon as they know things, but I can imagine that adds confusion in other situations.",

Grad students always get the short end of the stick. We are treated as students and as staff whenever it is convenient and as neither when it\u2019s not. Oh but wait! They\u2019re letting students apply for dorms past their normative period! That\u2019s literally the only positive things that the school has done for us.",

You can travel further and to much harder hit areas within my state no problem.

It\u2019s more the info for fall reopening for grad students as well as research travel that they have really failed us on.",

              "text": "Yeah I suppose the problem with interstate and international travel plans (which is what you\u2019re having problems with) is that it\u2019s not your university\u2019s decision. Individual states can close their borders and deny entry/exit. They could close it without notice while you\u2019re on the other side. So it\u2019s all pretty complicated, and they\u2019re not going to want to approve interstate travel (whether you\u2019re close to the border or not is irrelevant) and the release of funds when it\u2019s still so risky. If something happened to you or your plans then it\u2019d be their problem, so it\u2019s fair that they won\u2019t give advice yet.\n\nIt sucks, but there isn\u2019t much we can expect our universities to do or say because it\u2019s 100% going to change before we can even put that advice into practice.\n\nEdit: And I have seen what happened to students who were already overseas (even undergraduates, on course-required exchange). It was not pretty. They were abandoned, with no real way to get home, nowhere to live, and the university was too busy to help a lot of them in any concrete fashion. But also, there's not much they *could* do. *Your* site might only be 100m away, but whatever rules apply to you will also apply to the person travelling to the other side of the country. And if you're on the other side of any border, it won't matter how close it is if that suddenly becomes a hard border. The border 3 hours away from me is a hard border and if I crossed it, I would not be able to return. No exception for residents.",

I know we have blanket extensions for all in their final year, but for everyone else it\u2019s still a little uncertain how requests will be handled. Which is perfectly reasonable because those requests are at least a year away by definition.\n\nOver the last 5 months I\u2019ve lost an estimated 4 months of research time, estimated by my PI. It really sucks, especially when I\u2019m on a strict 3 year time limit, and that loss is going to hit me hard. But I\u2019m not in my final year and I have time to figure out how to work around this. It\u2019s not absolutely urgent for my university to respond **right this second**. I can survive until December even. They can\u2019t give answers until they have answers, and that\u2019s a horribly complicated job.",
