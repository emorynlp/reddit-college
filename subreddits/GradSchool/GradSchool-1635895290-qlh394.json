  "text": "I don't know if this is something that is a common experience but I just want to make sure that I'm not crazy. (Sorry if this becomes ranty).\n\nI'm in my first year of a Masters in Music and have to take a course that is almost entirely unrelated to my field. That on its own has been bothering but I've never taken a class that has such an unreasonably high workload. This means ~200 pages of reading a week on top of regular writing assignments (unrelated to the reading) and regular group projects. Initially my strategy was to skim the readings but she sprung it on the class this week that she expected us to be taking detailed reading notes and that she will now be collecting and grading all of them (not mentioned in the syllabus). I've had to stop a lot of the work I have been doing personally and on my instrument to stay afloat in this class. Again, none of this work or the readings are remotely relevant to my field.\n\nI talked with my main professor (also my advisor) about this and he seemed to be mad that this class was even required and he mentioned how its always a problem. \n\nIs this normal? It feels like it shouldn't be but maybe I'm crazy. \n\n\ntl;dr: I have to take a class unrelated to my field that has ludicrous amounts of busywork. Is this normal?",

      "text": "This sounds extremely abnormal to me. I had a master's before I started my PhD program, and in neither program were there \"required courses\". There were a required number of credits from different types of courses. For example, we would need 9 credit hours worth of methods classes but it was not required that we take a specific methods class in particular. I've also never heard of an instructor grading someone's notes. All of my professors were way too busy, so it sounds like this professor doesn't have nearly enough to do and thinks they are teaching high school. \n\nI'm not a musician, but I don't imagine you get a job based on how well you do in a course. I imagine  you get a job based on how well you can play. If this class is irrelevant to your degree and is not directly related to your career goals, I'd think about doing the bare minimum necessary to maintain good academic standing and focus your attention on the courses that are important.",
