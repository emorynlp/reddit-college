  "title:": "How different is extra semesters for grad school compared to undergrad?",
  "text": "I\u2019m thinking about grad school and just want to get an idea if I can manage it along with a full time job. So a regular masters should take 2 years right? Is that including taking summer classes, or is that not a thing for grad schools? I notice a lot of masters/phd graduates go a couple years extra; is that because they decided to take less classes per semester because isn\u2019t it usually less course load than undergrads? So they\u2019d basically be doing 5 credits/semester which confuses me because that sounds amazing, or is it not like that. I get $8000/year tuition reimbursement for my new job next year, and I was wondering if I could just minimize the year\u2019s cost of tuition to basically cover all of that, then I could cruise through a masters in 3-4 years at basically no cost. Would that affect the way I would learn (basically at 0.5x speed but with double the time to work on thesis/project)?",

My  program director actually recommended stretching it out another semester \ud83d\ude05 My program does have summer classes as well. There's no harm in contacting the program director of the degree you're interested in and talking options with them either :)",

              "text": "She actually recommended it to us as a blanket recommendation on like a preview day for people still on the fence! She said it was too he able to take more time with the subject and absorb things better instead of barreling through it and not remembering anything. We're a capstone program so we don't have any big thesis or anything to complete which is probably part of it too. I took her advice and took three classes a semester for two years and this year I have to do four with a couple off-semester classes to complete it within my desired 3 wars. Not too bad but three vs four classes is significantly easier.",

      "text": "The answer depends on the program (Master's are typically 30 to 60 credit hours), the speed at which you can progress (prerequisite order versus course offerings), and your own capabilities as a student (with other responsibilities). My first graduate degree I took 2 classes in the summer so I could take 1 less during the fall and spring semesters; it was more expensive, but I was much more capable of success.",
