It ended up coming to the point where I could switch advisors and projects and essentially start over or Master out. \nI ended up choosing to master out and I was really bummed. Additionally since this happened so quickly and I had everything and all the requirements to graduate I went from several more years to graduate to graduating in a couple weeks. Since it happened so quickly I was unable to have a job lined up. \n\nSo for the past 6 months I've been doordashing full time to make ends meat while I apply. I couldn't even land an interview for anything worth my time. I can't explain how demoralizing it felt to have my Masters degree in engineering and dropping off someone's chipotle order for a $3 tip.\n After iterating my resume several times to get past the resume robots and recruiters. I finally got an interview with Intel, then a second presentation interview and then 4 more panel interviews... Today i got the offer and the salary is what I would have expected had I finished my PhD. So needless to say I am estatic. Intel is my dream job and I really feel justified that I made the right call to leave with my Masters. The job i got was a PhD preferred, Masters OK kinda job. \n\nIdk why I'm posting this exactly, really excited, but also wanted to share a perspective about how hard it was abruptly leaving a PhD especially during the pandemic.", "author": "CharcuterieCheese", "created": 1625166160, "retrieved": 1632845826, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 401, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"h3shc83": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/obsotb/phdmastering_outjob_huntoffer/h3shc83/", "text": "Congrats!

Glad you got Intel! Not sure what you were applying for but I want to point something out. I have some friends that graduated after me in CS/Engineering and the sad thing I noticed was how selective they were in applying for companies. They would only apply for top companies and be bummed that they weren\u2019t getting interviews. To any students reading this, you most likely won\u2019t land your dream job out of college. Take what you can get (keeping in mind what you are worth of course) and plan on the dream job 3-5 years after graduation. No offense to OP, but it\u2019s better to take a job for 1 year at a low end low paying company for relevant experience than it is to door dash. I have never been great with words so I probably sound like a bigot but people with tech degrees all think they are going straight to Apple or Amazon the day they graduate. Some do.
