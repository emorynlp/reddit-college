My exam was scheduled at 2:00pm. I was all set for  the check in process, but for some reason I was having an issue with the ports (I have no idea what that means). It took over an hour to contact support and get that issue remedied. After that, it took another hour to find an available proctor because I was already supposed to be an hour into my exam. I was finally matched with a proctor and as I was showing him my environment setup, the power in my house surged and so did my laptop. I stared out the window for a good minute because of how done I was. With a deep sigh, I contacted support for ProctorU and ETS and they accommodated me and my problems. I now have an appointment set for Saturday at a testing center.
