  "text": "The worst things imaginable happened while attempting to just get checked in for the at home GRE. My exam was scheduled at 2:00pm. I was all set for  the check in process, but for some reason I was having an issue with the ports (I have no idea what that means). It took over an hour to contact support and get that issue remedied. After that, it took another hour to find an available proctor because I was already supposed to be an hour into my exam. I was finally matched with a proctor and as I was showing him my environment setup, the power in my house surged and so did my laptop. I stared out the window for a good minute because of how done I was. With a deep sigh, I contacted support for ProctorU and ETS and they accommodated me and my problems. I now have an appointment set for Saturday at a testing center. All I know is something or someone didn\u2019t want me to test today.",

The proctors were unprepared and extremely unprofessional. One proctor had a significant amount of background noise and refused to mute their microphone when I complained. I actually gave up half way through because they had interrupted my test so much. When I complained to the GRE they were like - we aren\u2019t responsible for proctor U and your score is your score - they essentially were like this isn\u2019t our problem - I had to beg them to give me a credit to retake it. It was the most stressful and awful testing experience of my life. \n\nThe GRE is such bullshit. It\u2019s even worse in a pandemic.",
