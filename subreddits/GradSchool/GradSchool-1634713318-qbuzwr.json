  "text": "Just got an Apple Watch and decided to set up heart rate notifications and all the associated health stuff. \n\nWell it wasn\u2019t until the other day when I got a notification that my heart was beating >110bpm for over 5 minutes. What\u2019s more is that it says my resting bpm is in the 100s too. \n\nI suspect my brain simply tuned all this out and I\u2019m actually on quite a dire state of anxiety since my resting bpm is 60\u201370.",

      "text": "I have a little bit of SVT which just basically means my heart randomly decides to spike up and then immediately shift back down to normal rates, and I  realized that I can see those blips even when I'm sleeping. Because my Fitbit tracks my heart rate when asleep. \n\nIsn't it cool to think that in the future wearable health devices could be sending data to doctors all the time. And we could catch certain issues sooner because of it?",
