TLDR: At a certain point, my motivations needed to change in order to reach the next level.\n\nIn 2009 I graduated high school and my generation was the first to receive a diploma within my family's history. I was the youngest and therefore the last to graduate and none of my immediate or extended family continued their education. I wanted to be different from them. I wanted to do something with my life besides work a blue-collar job before I died (<-- the mentality of an 18 y.o.). I enlisted in the Army National Guard as a MP to pay for college... in 2009... a few years after the Iraq War but just one year before the ISIS insurgency.  \n\nLuckily, I never deployed but at the time, at 18, I knew it was just a matter of time. Every 4-6 months for the first two years of college my unit was put on stand-by for pre-mobilization in anticipation of receiving orders. This effectively made the military a part time job, drilling every other weekend instead of once a month. The military push and the academic pull kept me in an anxiety induced state of motivation. The military push made me feel that I had to accomplish all of my dreams right now because there might not be time later and within a few months I might be deployed. The academic pull forced me to envision highly ambitious long-term goals to work toward. You can probably see the deadly cycle those two perpetuated and I nearly killed myself within the first two years of college. (no, seriously. If you're a first gen student or soldier, you should be talking to a counselor monthly. Even if you don't think you need it, just go bitch at them for an hour.)\n\n *I could still hear my cousins laughing at me when I told them I had enlisted and was going to college*. Much of my motivation was to spite my extended family, lost childhood friends, and to prove history wrong; that a kid from a trailer park could do anything he set his mind to. I imagine many first gen students have similar motivations. My alarm would go off and my anxiety immediately kicked into high gear, heart rate about 120 as my feet hit the floor. I would spend no less than 10 hours a day studying, attending class, and/or working out. It drove me to learn a lot and to be in the best shape of my life but it was a double edged sword. The pressure I put on myself made it impossible to relax and I would flop on exams. My heart rate would shoot past 160 as a sat down for an exam. I was getting C averages throughout the semesters and D's on finals. This continued through my sophomore year and because of where my motivation stemmed, was making me feel like a fraud, a failure, that I had delusions of grandeur, and that I was no better than anyone else in my family.\n\nIn hind-sight, the main problem was the learning curve. I was a first generation scholar and soldier who had to map out these new, and often times, conflicting worlds pretty much by myself (as I am sure you all can appreciate). I was[the only one](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-544-94448-0) in my college-friend group without doctors as parents and who wasn't either home schooled or had attended private school. After the first two years however, the deployment scares lessened, I had a decent handle on both worlds, and my grades began to improve (unfortunately, the damage to my GPA was already done). The first two years cultivating that motivation and work ethic had suddenly launched me forward. The last two years of undergrad went by smoothly and were some of the best years of my life. Upon graduating with a BS in chemistry, my motivations were still rooted in spite though. Which, imo, is okay for someone in their early 20's, [Spite Works!](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/spite-is-good-spite-works.html)\n\nAfter taking 2 years off to recoup, to build up a cash reserve, and having been rejected by 7/8 schools, I began a doctoral program at a significantly lower ranked school. (It was ranked, like, 98th in the country at the time but was an R1 research facility at least.) I began grad school in a similar manner to my undergrad years: a lot to prove and willing to sacrifice my entire being. I needed to know that my undergrad GPA suffered because of the military, not bc I was a fraud. I needed to know that I could hang with the best of them. I needed to know that my family, lost childhood friends, and my history were wrong and could shut the fuck up. This motivation made me very competitive which led to a lot of success the first two years. Although, my overall tone was a bit too loud for some, and I understand that. Once the general exams were done and I had taken all my classes... there was nothing to be competing over. I learned, painfully, that lab work can not be compared or measured. It is a self paced endeavor driven by curiosity and a push to learn more about your field. The motivation that had gotten me through the military, through college, and that had made me the man I had become, was no longer effective. In reality, that motivation was working against me. It was isolating me and maneuvering me into a depression. [Ego is the enemy](https://dailystoic.com/ego-is-the-enemy-summary/) after all. \n\nSpite works until you peak. This is something that can't be found (or at least I have not found it) in motivational talks, within motivational books, or in daily quotes. Those motivational things are not tailored to someone at this level. They are tailored to people who are at the beginning of their journey and may not have not found their [Fuck Yeah!](https://www.alexisrockley.com/find-your-f-ckyeah) yet. I found a path I was willing to sacrifice everything to pursue and it was time to sacrifice the spite I had been holding onto. I went for a run every single morning during my third year, in search of finding a new motivation to draw from (over 500 miles that year!) which essentially came down to one question: *What version of myself do I want to be?* This helped me create a model of actual qualities and traits, that I have written down, and that I have been striving to cultivate since. Its super cheesy, yea, but its how my motivation has manifested itself thus far. \n\nI defended my dissertation in the second week of May this year. It involved a lot of political drama because my PI is not well liked by the department. He was denied tenure and there was a personal vendetta against him. It became very political because the department came under scrutiny by the college for their tenure process. So my senior committee member did not want my PI to graduate a PhD student in under 5 years because it reflects poorly on their tenure decision. This culminated with that committee member nit-picking every mistake within my dissertation (fair enough, perfection is sort of expected at this level) and telling me, at my defense, that I would be a failure because of those mistakes. He still gave approval for both the defense and dissertation, so I try to think of it as a training point, but I cant help to think that the more things change, the more they stay the same. \n\nThe hard work and sacrifice was well worth it. As an undergraduate, the friends I made had witnessed my struggle and helped me get through. They are the reason I met my now wife and why the latter years of college were so great. Those friends are the same ones that grew up with doctors as parents, who were home schooled, and that I modeled myself off of. Unbeknownst to me, one of them recommended me to their boss for my ideal research position. Their boss then then contacted my PI for a letter of rec. After a short interview I was hired and will start later this year. Its the first professional step I have ever taken that arrived without me clawing, killing, and begging for it. I nearly turned it down thinking it was a trap.
