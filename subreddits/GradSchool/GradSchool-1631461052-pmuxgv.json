I just came off a stint of no work and no school (graduated in May, and my part-time job was a very easy help desk position at my college). I went nearly four months with very little to do, other than applying to jobs with a degree I didn't like (hence why I'm going to grad school) and doing some bootcamp work.\n\nNow, as of about two weeks ago, I started a full-time job, three graduate classes, AND prepratory bootcamps for a different graduate program I applied for (much more rigorous than the one I'm currently in, which I'm doing for experience/adding programming classes to my repetoire to make me a bit more marketable).\n\nNeedless to say, it's a bit overwhelming after coming out of a four month stint of nothing, which was after four years of a frankly pretty easy undergraduate college experience. Does anyone have any advice on self-management tips, as well as tips on how to get used to going from only free time to barely any of it? I know this is how the real world works and I don't plan on quitting any of this but it's definitely a wakeup slap in the face, and I could use some advice.", "author": "PrometheanSigma", "created": 1631461052, "retrieved": 1632844613, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcqkxau": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmuxgv/started_a_fulltime_job_and_a_graduate_program_at/hcqkxau/", "text": "Major time management.

Divide your working hours and your studying time. Have monthly goals. Then break those down into actionable steps. I have a timeline for my research and I always check at the start/end of the month to make sure I am on track. Over time, the time management gets easier with a routine.
