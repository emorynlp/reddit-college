In that case, park your ass in the study lounge/common area/ hallway of where ever your classmates congregate.\n\nStep 3: Make some friends. No joke. No one wants to see a friend drop out, but you need to be a genuine friend. So make some friends in the program, and then ask for their help while you're parked in the study-room.\n\nStep 4: Go to therapy. You are catastrophizing. You cannot be behind on tests. You take tests. You can only be behind on studying for them; and if you feel that way... it's because you're expecting more from what you have done and projecting failure. This is nonsense; you're only a month in. Go to THERAPY.\n\nStep 5: Profit?????????",

Half the reason you pay for grad school is to be around and make connections with these smart people. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid to just straight up badger professors with your stupidest questions. You're basically paying them to teach you, it's their obligation. Once i started doing this grad school got a lot easier for me.",

Have you done more than nothing? Reading a syllabus counts. \n\nNow, grad school is hard. The classes are well above any undergraduate courses, at least in my experience, and I think many students don\u2019t realize this will be the case when they start. But you\u2019re definitely blowing things out of proportion. First, recognize that this should be your full time job, so spend your day doing the reading, assignments, etc. Second, reach out for help if you are struggling. Talk to your professors outside of class if you feel like you can\u2019t keep up. They don\u2019t want to see you fail, so if you ask for help they will respond. \n\nYou are a student, so you\u2019re not expected to do this alone, but you are expected to take some initiative and seek help when you need it.",
