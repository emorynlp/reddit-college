I feel like our classes are half useless fluff and half very intense data analytics technical skills where zero guidance is available. \n\nIt\u2019s to the point where the professor has to take 30 minutes every class to figure out how to do some stuff herself and usually still can\u2019t, that type of zero guidance. She\u2019s admitted herself that she\u2019s not really qualified in these skills.\n\nOur program director who is also a professor repeatedly tells us GPA doesn\u2019t matter at all and bare minimum passing is fine. I\u2019m really burnt out from undergrad high-achieving and am frustrated with having to half-assedly teach myself all the technical skills while not really learning anything. \n\nIs it true that gpa doesn\u2019t matter in grad school? It\u2019d sure make my life a lot easier to just get A\u2019s in the fluff and C\u2019s in the technical classes to maintain the required 3.0 to graduate\u2026", "author": "Unconquered-", "created": 1632806701, "retrieved": 1632843920, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hel63xb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwzfqf/how_much_does_grad_school_gpa_matter/hel63xb/", "text": "So I have a family friend that is a healthcare administrator and is very high up in their field.\n\nI had a semester or two of really bad grades in undergrad but was bringing my gpa back up.

Even when I worked with a bach degree, GPA didn\u2019t come up. I see no reason for it to come up with a masters. I still recommend a 3.0+ though because you didn\u2019t come all the way to a master\u2019s just to start doing poorly.
