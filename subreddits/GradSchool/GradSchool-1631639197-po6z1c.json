Have completely checked out and moving on. Spent an enormous amount of time on a project that I continually tried to explain wasn\u2019t working and wouldn\u2019t have any actual outcome because there just wasn\u2019t any association in the data, but he refused to accept that and attributed it to a work ethic problem. The first 3 versions of my thesis were returned without any edits and no specific guidance of what we wanted besides extremely vague bullshit. Finally, I received an actual edited version, which he claimed was close to being there. I make the suggested changes and have framed and structured the paper almost identically to previous publications from our lab. \n\nThis version gets returned, now with him shutting on things identical to other papers from our lab. And the cherry on top is that there is several instances of hIM CORRECTING SOMETHING HE HAD PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OR COMMENTED ON.

Sometimes you can chalk it up to the fact they like sometimes different now than previously and sometimes...it is like a box of crazy where you don't know where they are at. Getting through it is a skill and sometimes worshiping the ground they walk on while talking is the only way forward.
