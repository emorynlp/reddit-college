  "text": "I'm writing my dissertation and kinda on the job market. Was planning to apply this cycle and next cycle if I don't get any bites. But it's likely that there will be no job postings this year, because of the chaos of COVID-19, and this is going to just completely destroy the job market for a few years. I know that it's hard to get a TT academic job. But I always thought I'd like get a chance to interview somewhere. It's really heartbreaking to think that I may not. Hard to write the dissertation in a situation like this.",

It's clear that there'll be a low of schools reducing expenditures (salaries, number of grad students), shrinking endowments, and lower rates of international students in undergrad (forecasted right now; these are the bread and butter of a lot of US schools), while simultaneously getting more professional degree applications since that's generally what happens in economic downturns.  \n\nAdditionally, faculty near retirement might have been overexposed in some investments and may likely delay retirement which is probably the most certain factor (in my opinion). Given the nature of past recessions, it's likely the market will take a while to clear---all those looking and offering jobs match---for quite a while. I don't know the answer but I've seen 5--6 years thrown around with this year's market and next's years market sure to be terrible/overcrowded with few positions.",
