It's clear that there'll be a low of schools reducing expenditures (salaries, number of grad students), shrinking endowments, and lower rates of international students in undergrad (forecasted right now; these are the bread and butter of a lot of US schools), while simultaneously getting more professional degree applications since that's generally what happens in economic downturns.  \n\nAdditionally, faculty near retirement might have been overexposed in some investments and may likely delay retirement which is probably the most certain factor (in my opinion).
