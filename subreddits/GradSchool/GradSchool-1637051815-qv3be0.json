It is very rare. But when it does happen, you'll be thankful that you saved a copy under a different draft designation 10 hours before.",

And so you have to go back to the previous saved version.\n\nTo prevent that, one should also frequently say a writing project under a different draft designation, so there are different versions of the file to fall back on.",

Usually after I've done a bunch of work that I wouldn't want to lose, I'll save the file. And then save it again with a new draft number designation.\n\nThis has also helped me a few times where I've done a bunch of revising, and then decided I didn't like all the changes, so I could look at a previous version.\n\n>But then, an entire drive could fail, so you really should have one of them on a different device entirely.\n\nYep. I have cloud-based storage syncing for that. I use Sugar Sync, as it allows you to have any folder on your computer automatically backed up.\n\n>Then again, your entire house could burn down\n\nDid you know that people used to keep a copy of their dissertation in the fridge back in the typewriter days? Same with writers working on novels. Just in case that happened? lol",
