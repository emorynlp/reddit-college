  "text": "Honestly it's been a few months into my research and I feel overwhelmed to not understand the whole thing, I don't know what to do with all the small parts that I had been trying out and what my problem statement is going to look like. \n\nNow a days I am having dreams of having to tell my supervisor that I don't know anything.",

      "text": "You don't need to solve the whole problem. You need a general understanding of the overall goal and then to find the sub-problem or corner of the problem where you think you can make marginal progress. \n\nIf the problems were solvable by single people, then fields would just be \"that guy who solved field Y\" rather than hundreds if not thousands of researchers around the world contributing to journals and conferences.\n\nSo don't get stressed, you arent expected to understand it all. Early in your PhD, you're basically just exploring and trying to find that one corner or tiny sub-problem where you think you're interested in contributing to for a bit. Classes help, another way to get started is reading papers and maybe even trying to replicate simple tests/experiments. As you are more and more exposed, you'll understand it more and start seeing the gaps where you can contribute.",
