  "text": "I'm currently in grad school but my mind keeps going back into this. How tf does Takashi have his own research room? What the hell is San Fransokyo Institute of Technology's (SFIT?) endowment such that each member virtually has all the tools they need with no sweat on funding?\n\nIs Callaghan a god at grant writing? Or is SFIT just somehow putting billions of dollars into one singular research lab with 4 students?\n\nAm I alone on this? I've been thinking about this about every other week for my entire graduate career. \n\nEither way, I want in.\n\nIn my mind that research lab is the dream, the dream all PI's should strive to create and graduate students dream to be in. A research lab where everybody feels kinda like a super hero.",
