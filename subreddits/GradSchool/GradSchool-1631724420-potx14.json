  "title:": "TA'ing a masters course and struggling",
  "text": "I'm in my second year (of a 3 year phd in Europe) currently TA'ing a master's course, problem is I'm also taking it at the same time. This happened because I basically had to agree to set down all my teaching by a certain date and i'd already turned down several courses for various reasons. I didn't even know the actual material when I signed up, and when I got access it was way beyond the level that I thought it was. I'm devoting a lot of time to learning and understand the material and doing the assignments prior to the students, but I have to lead q/a sessions with 30 students and I just don't have the level of insight required to properly help them, because although I get the material enough to do the assignments (barely), I'm just learning it myself too. I am also doing research at the same time (I can't stop whilst teaching) and I'm so tired from doing both that my mental and physical health is diminishing and I just can't be a good TA. I don't really know what to do at this point, besides dropping the TA role, but the problem is they are really short of TAs and I would be majorly screwing over the professor and other TA by leaving. But, it's clearly affecting me, because I'm not sleeping enough and I already feel exhausted and can't think straight. Any advice?",

      "text": "Is the workload you're being given too much? If so you can probably talk to the professor teaching the class about lightening up the work load a little on your end. Most TAs are TAs for a class because it's something they already know how to do. Having to learn along with the other students basically makes you a student for that class too. Try talking to the professor about it being overwhelming and express that you are feeling like you aren't knowledgeable enough on the material to be leading weekly discussions on it.",

      "text": "Masters students are essentially your peers. I\u2019d be level with them that you\u2019re learning the material with them. And treat the Q/A sessions more like a study group than a lecture. Structuring the session around group work could help shift the burden of teaching off of you. And reasoning through problems with your peers can be a very effective way to learn anyway",

          "text": "I did this once, I had to teach a graduate class which was also a new course, so I hadn't even taken it. I told my students that the only advantage I had over them was that I started studying about 3 weeks before they did. They were very understanding. We are all in the same boat, being all of us grad students. Perhaps you should focus more on helpful tips you can give them and not so much on the material. After all, being a grad student mostly means that you're studying by yourself, with no teachers, stuff that hasn't even been researched before. If the class is small enough perhaps you could suggest a \"study group\" approach to address the material, in which you could act as \"moderator\". People don't care much about their teachers, they just want to pass their exams to earn their credits.  Focus on teaching them the material they need to pass the exams, including solving exercises strategies, books and papers not included in the syllabus, cool things that they can find online which might be helpful (of course you have to check them beforehand to make sure they are adequate), etc.",
