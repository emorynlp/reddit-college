  "title:": "Thinking of picking up a used iPad for PDF annotation. Do you foresee any problems for my workflow?",
  "text": "I use Linux on a laptop for 100% of my research and writing (and everything else) right now but I need a better setup for the singular task of working with PDFs (articles and sometimes photocopies).\n\nI'd be getting it for this one purpose and it doesn't need to do anything else. I need it to be an uncomplicated workflow but within the constraints of how I allow devices/software to integrate with my life, which Apple tends to want to make near-impossible in my past experience.\n\nI would have it disconnected from the Apple account except for software updates. And I'd ideally use something like Signal to get PDFs on and off the device quickly.\n\nCan apps like Notability or GoodNotes export locally without an Apple account logged in? Can Signal pick up and send locally stored files easily? Can Signal on iPad just be synced with the account attached to my phone number?\n\nI'm asking because I've had serious problems in the past with how Apple allows (or rather, doesn't) things like accessing/manipulating the file system, the interoperability of different apps, and the impact of whether or not the user is connected to an Apple account. I realise I have some unique constraints but I'm hoping someone will be able to quickly throw up a red flag if they know from experience that my intended workflow here is going to be a problem with those constraints.\n\nThanks!",

And trying to use Tresorit on an iPhone is exactly my previous experience with how bad Apple is at letting their users interact with the file system in the most elementary ways.",

Not good for the use I have in mind.\n\n> The only thing you'd need an Apple account for is to download the app.\n\nHaha, yep, that's pretty much the plan.\n\nI'm glad I just heard from another user that the default PDF viewer can annotate and save them directly to the file. So I may not even need something like Notability and whatever they may want/need me to sign up and log in to...\n\n> Perhaps even something as basic as emailing annotated PDFs to yourself...\n\nYeh, it wouldn't be a bad option to be honest. But I already use Signal to move files on and off my phone and it's a really friction-less way to do it. I'm expecting it to just work the same on an iPad but don't want to invest without confirming.\n\n> Sorry, I wish there was better advice I could give!\n\nHaha, no, thanks for the ideas!",

I didn't know that it just had default software that could handle annotations.\n\nSo, when you save the PDFs + annotations directly to the device, those files are readily accessible to other apps that handle files?\n\nWhich iPad do you have? What, if any, considerations are there for which model I try to source for this usage?\n\n> ... you could probably figure out how to set up a NAS at home or an OwnCloud.\n\nAppreciate the suggestion but it would be overkill for this one use case. We just don't really need cloud storage generally. I mentioned I use Tresorit but I use it as an archive - stuff goes on there that never really gets touched; we don't work from it regularly.",

The file structure and file explorer are quite robust and honestly more intuitive than on macOS on desktop.\n\nI have a second gen iPad Air I think. Any of the iPads from the last two or three years now I think accept input from the pencil, which is the biggest consideration I think. I upgraded to the air in hopes of future proofing a bit, plus it has a nicer laminated display that the base iPad doesn\u2019t have that\u2019s supposed to reduce glare and eye fatigue. I also just was able to get a great deal on a refurbished one from Apple so that helped.",
