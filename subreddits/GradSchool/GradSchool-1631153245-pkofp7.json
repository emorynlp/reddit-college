I had a chat with the potential advisor and he was thrilled and said for me to apply. He seemed very passionate and excited to have someone reach out. Accepted students receive full funding for 5 years btw.\n\nHowever.....despite this university being R1, it's not very highly ranked, and my application + work experience could place me into a top school. I've heard too many horror stories on here of like \"If you didn't do PhD at a top 50 school they won't even look at you when you graduate...welcome to post doc hell\". This school is probably like 200-250 in terms of national ranking, but the PhD is in a highly quantitative/in demand field (it's not like a humanities or social science PhD).\n\n\nShould I keep searching for other programs with higher rank or just stick with this?\n\nThe research I'm looking for is very interdisciplinary and hard to find. Some people do similar research but in an entirely different department. And in general, I just haven't really clicked with the research as well as I did with this place.", "author": "DarthHelmet123", "created": 1631153245, "retrieved": 1632952741, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "comments": {"hc7kmek": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkofp7/how_important_is_research_interest_vs_school/hc7kmek/", "text": "Is that the ranking for the school, or the ranking for the program?
