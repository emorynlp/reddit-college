  "text": "I\u2019m supposed to be starting a new rotation tomorrow and I reached out to the PI to get more details on my project and see who I will be working with last week so I could prep. She told me who I would be working with, and said she would send us an email later that week. Well the PI never sent the email. I emailed the grad student  to ask when I should come into lab and they had no idea I was even rotating, much less getting me set up with a project this week. \n\nShould I email the PI to see what going on? I don\u2019t want to overstep, but also I need to know if I am starting tomorrow or not.",
