  "text": "Hey -\n\nI've got a couple days a week where I'm in the lab, and have a long list of tasks to get done. There's always the basic tasks, plus every day might have some extra recurring tasks added on depending on what's needed. \n\nWhat I'd like is instead of writing out a huge list every day, if there was an app that had the capability to load my daily tasks quickly. I was wondering if any of my fellow lab rats had a good suggestion!\n\nThanks!!",
