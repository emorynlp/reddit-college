  "text": "Im a first-year MA student on an assistantship. I decided that I needed to take a step back to focus on my mental health. This resulted in me dropping most of my courses except for a direct study under my advisor. This was really a hard decision for me to make. I will still have my assistantship (TA- grader) next spring but I feel that my peers will know more since they had a full load in their first semester. \n\nWill I be ok later? I feel like I will be incompetent when it comes to class discussions, etc",

      "text": "Taking a step back to cater to your mental health is very VERY important! You are not incompetent. You are trying your best with what you have right now and that is progress. I know it sucks to feel like you are behind, but this whole career game is NOT a race and it is NOT the only thing that defines you. You are more than your career. Your career is just a part of you, but it\u2019s not ALL of you. You needed to take a break for your well-being and that is okay. Your mental health is the most important in my opinion than anything else. If your mental health isn\u2019t up to par, your whole perspective of life goes downhill. So I\u2019m glad that you took the time to rejuvenate and taken that break. \n\nTo answer your question though, just because others have taken xyz classes, does not mean that you are going to be behind and that does not mean that they know more than you do. Sure, they might have more credits than you, but taking a class does not mean that they know the concepts. It\u2019s just an assumption that they have been exposed to the concepts and maybe they have understood it too and maybe applied it. Who knows \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs clich\u00e8 as they may sound, you know your self best. And after trial and error, only you have the say to continue or to step back and take a break. \n\nYou can always learn the materials that you feel like you are missing. So in my opinion, keep going and keep trying!",
