  "text": "Hi!\n\nI am currently looking into taking a Master's in Computer Science/Interaction Design. Also, I have already applied to one of our local unis here, and passed. I'm from SEA, by the way.\n\nHowever, I also suddenly thought of studying abroad (thinking of maybe, a neighboring country? Or Canada? Or Europe?) It's because first: they may offer face-to-face classes, which do I prefer, second: technological advancement, third: I've always liked to travel and lastly: the opportunity to work abroad.\n\nBut of course, it comes with cons: the expenses (which I am unsure of), and perhaps more (esp. now, there might be a lot of requirements and restrictions, because of the pandemic).\n\nHope you guys can give me some advice regarding this. Thank you so much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. - if ever I pursue a diploma/certificate instead, would it still help me land a job easily? Or is there a difference if I'm going for a Master's? Thanks again!",

      "text": "I'm also from SEA and we're probably from the same country. First of all, you have to really sit down and think about why you want to study abroad, especially since you will have to answer this question in your statement of purpose / scholarship application, etc. I cannot tell you how many peers I had who assumed they could take up anything and their foreign degree would somehow open up every door in terms of job opportunities/changing citizenships. I've known quite a number of people who paid millions for their \"study abroad experience\"... Only to come back home with no more job prospects than they had before.\n\nSince you already have a degree in mind, it's time to research what the ROI of your degree will be wherever you plan to work. Is it a saturated field? What kind of jobs can you get? What can a foreign education offer that a local education can't, especially when the degree is already offered in your home country? Will it really be easier to work abroad with that degree?\n\nNext is financials. How much are you willing to spend for your \"dream\"? I have a good friend who borrowed a lot of money from all her relatives just to go to a reputable school, promising to pay them back because she assumed her school name alone would somehow carry her to a cushy job. It didn't. She got a cash cow degree. She paid a lot, essentially, for bragging rights, but has nothing to show for it. If money is an issue, then as early now, research, research, research scholarships and start applying for them. Don't start scrambling to find funding when you get accepted. Again, I know too many people who \"didn't expect to get in\" and ended up realizing too late that studying abroad would be so expensive.\n\nPer your questions:\n\n>(thinking of maybe, a neighboring country? Or Canada? Or Europe?)\n\nYou need to narrow this down. The price differences alone are already substantial between these regions. Don't just think \"anywhere but here is better\" -- because that's certainly not true. \n\n>they may offer face-to-face classes, which do I prefer\n\nIf you are chasing face-to-face classes then I would wait as the situation can still change day-by-day. Going abroad just to take online class isn't worth it, imo.\n\n>third: I've always liked to travel\n\nThen why spend millions taking up a degree when you can pay a quarter of that to go there for an extended vacation? You really will have to justify the cost of that degree and saying \"well I've always wanted to visit _____\" unfortunately won't cut it.\n\n>lastly: the opportunity to work abroad\n\nIn many countries, for you to turn your student visa into a worker's visa, you have to get hired by a local company willing to sponsor you. Usually companies do this when they can't find local talent. With thousands of international students competing for these sponsorships, how confident are you that you can get picked over other applicants?\n\n>if ever I pursue a diploma/certificate instead, would it still help me land a job easily?\n\nThis is highly dependent on the field.\n\nI'm sorry I sound harsh but studying abroad is a decision that shouldn't be done on a whim or taken lightly but I know too many people who did it and made costly, poor decisions because they got starry-eyed. What I recommend doing first is researching your desired course thoroughly and seeing what you can do with that degree, whether it's in demand in other countries, etc. Then develop a list of universities that offer your desired course. Do the math and calculate all the living expenses and that'll ultimately determine whether the degree is worth it. Remember that getting a foreign education is ultimately a luxury -- these millions can be spent on other things , like an apartment or a car or medical bills or 5 trips around the world. If you're going to pursue one, ensure that it's a decision that'll pay off, because too many people only factor in the potential rewards but not the risks.",

          "text": "Hi, thanks for the lengthy (but of course, really helpful) response!\n\nWell, I'm about to take Computer Science, which is of course, related to technology. I'm afraid that the lessons or coursework that'll be given here will be outdated, compared to overseas. But yes, of course! I will be doing more research, on the schools or courses I'd apply to.\n\nBut, I'm really pessimistic that face-to-face classes will be implemented here, though. If we are from the same country, you definitely know what is currently happening to our (shitty) government right now.\n\nFor the travel part, yeah, might be because of leisure, partly. But, isn't it a reason to be somehow motivated? For acquiring work overseas, I'm somehow confident on landing on one? Since IT is and will be always in demand.\n\nNah, it's okay! I really liked your perspective, though. Also, if I can ask (?), are you studying Master's here? Or overseas? \n\nAgain, thank you so much!",

              "text": ">I'm afraid that the lessons or coursework that'll be given here will be outdated, compared to overseas. \n\nBest to compare the syllabi first before making that claim, because many Filipino profs, especially those teaching at a masteral level, take their master's abroad. The argument I would choose instead would be that master's degrees in the PH solely prepare you to go into academia rather than industry, and unfortunately there are many egocentric professors who use master's degrees as an excuse to power trip. The culture of postgraduate studies in the PH is brutal, even cruel.\n\n>But, I'm really pessimistic that face-to-face classes will be implemented here\n\nEven in highly vaccinated countries in Europe right now, though, large classes are Zoom only and only small classes get to meet in person. \n\n>Since IT is and will be always in demand.\n\nThis is too much of a blanket statement. You say you want to take up Computer Science but for example what technical skills will you gain from this course that you don't already have? How will you measure up against a Data Analytics or Management of Information Systems graduate? Will IT companies really hire you for your master's degree over someone with more work experience? If your bachelor's was already IT-related, then how will this open doors if you were already in IT to begin with?\n\n>Also, if I can ask (?), are you studying Master's here? Or overseas?\n\nI did my Master's abroad and am currently doing a PhD.",

                  "text": "Ah yes, of course. I'm reviewing the curricula (?) offered by the schools/universities I'm looking at. For the 'power-tripping' issue, I have to partially agree, some do definitely 'take advantage' of their students, but there still are a few professors who I think, are considerate enough.\n\nAlso, I know about that one, not all schools in EU right now are doing F2F.\n\nFor me, taking a Master's helps you develop skills in terms of R&D, especially when you're in the IT sector. But yeah, that statement of yours is something I should ponder on.\n\nI see, I see! Good luck on your PhD!",
