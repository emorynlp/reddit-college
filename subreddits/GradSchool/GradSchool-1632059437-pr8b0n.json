It's because first: they may offer face-to-face classes, which do I prefer, second: technological advancement, third: I've always liked to travel and lastly: the opportunity to work abroad.\n\nBut of course, it comes with cons: the expenses (which I am unsure of), and perhaps more (esp. now, there might be a lot of requirements and restrictions, because of the pandemic).\n\nHope you guys can give me some advice regarding this. Thank you so much!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. - if ever I pursue a diploma/certificate instead, would it still help me land a job easily? Or is there a difference if I'm going for a Master's?

First of all, you have to really sit down and think about why you want to study abroad, especially since you will have to answer this question in your statement of purpose / scholarship application, etc. I cannot tell you how many peers I had who assumed they could take up anything and their foreign degree would somehow open up every door in terms of job opportunities/changing citizenships. I've known quite a number of people who paid millions for their \"study abroad experience\"... Only to come back home with no more job prospects than they had before.\n\nSince you already have a degree in mind, it's time to research what the ROI of your degree will be wherever you plan to work. Is it a saturated field? What kind of jobs can you get? What can a foreign education offer that a local education can't, especially when the degree is already offered in your home country? Will it really be easier to work abroad with that degree?\n\nNext is financials. How much are you willing to spend for your \"dream\"? I have a good friend who borrowed a lot of money from all her relatives just to go to a reputable school, promising to pay them back because she assumed her school name alone would somehow carry her to a cushy job. It didn't. She got a cash cow degree. She paid a lot, essentially, for bragging rights, but has nothing to show for it. If money is an issue, then as early now, research, research, research scholarships and start applying for them. Don't start scrambling to find funding when you get accepted. Again, I know too many people who \"didn't expect to get in\" and ended up realizing too late that studying abroad would be so expensive.\n\nPer your questions:\n\n>(thinking of maybe, a neighboring country? Or Canada? Or Europe?)\n\nYou need to narrow this down. The price differences alone are already substantial between these regions. Don't just think \"anywhere but here is better\" -- because that's certainly not true. \n\n>they may offer face-to-face classes, which do I prefer\n\nIf you are chasing face-to-face classes then I would wait as the situation can still change day-by-day. Going abroad just to take online class isn't worth it, imo.\n\n>third: I've always liked to travel\n\nThen why spend millions taking up a degree when you can pay a quarter of that to go there for an extended vacation? You really will have to justify the cost of that degree and saying \"well I've always wanted to visit _____\" unfortunately won't cut it.\n\n>lastly: the opportunity to work abroad\n\nIn many countries, for you to turn your student visa into a worker's visa, you have to get hired by a local company willing to sponsor you. Usually companies do this when they can't find local talent. With thousands of international students competing for these sponsorships, how confident are you that you can get picked over other applicants?\n\n>if ever I pursue a diploma/certificate instead, would it still help me land a job easily?\n\nThis is highly dependent on the field.\n\nI'm sorry I sound harsh but studying abroad is a decision that shouldn't be done on a whim or taken lightly but I know too many people who did it and made costly, poor decisions because they got starry-eyed. What I recommend doing first is researching your desired course thoroughly and seeing what you can do with that degree, whether it's in demand in other countries, etc. Then develop a list of universities that offer your desired course. Do the math and calculate all the living expenses and that'll ultimately determine whether the degree is worth it. Remember that getting a foreign education is ultimately a luxury -- these millions can be spent on other things , like an apartment or a car or medical bills or 5 trips around the world. If you're going to pursue one, ensure that it's a decision that'll pay off, because too many people only factor in the potential rewards but not the risks.", "author": "66th_jedi", "created": 1632106419, "upvotes": 2}}}
