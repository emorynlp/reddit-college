I\u2019m a first year PhD student at a prestigious program, in anthropology. She was in my roommates cohort (2nd year) but was essentially in mine since she had had to take time off last year. She was in two of my three classes. She had a desk three feet away from me. She and I were in a three person project together. We found out yesterday. I drank with my friends in the program until I Irish-goodbyed at my own apartment. \n\nGrad school is hard. We all cared about her, we believed in her ability to succeed, she was a brilliant young woman. She was doing things to get better, going to therapy, taking medication, communicating her needs to her advisors. But it wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nWe all struggle, but please, if you feel like this, tell someone. We all are going to feel the loss. No one wants to say goodbye like this. I don\u2019t really have the words, but it needs to be talked about. \n\nI\u2019m thankful that I took the advice of many other grad students and found a therapist early. And that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve put on my to-do list for today.", "author": "diana_of_rome", "created": 1575576150, "retrieved": 1632845210, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 770, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fnyy9f0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/e6mo6y/my_cohort_member_just_committed_suicide/fnyy9f0/", "text": "It's sad to hear.

There should definitely be a greater effort on behalf of educational institutions to provide free mental health resources and therapists to grad students.

He started in January and he died in April. He had just started field work, which he was loving. Then he was dead. I have no idea what happened, just that his roommate found him in their shared apartment. He was 23. I went to his funeral and met his family for the first time. They were lovely people and shared all these stories about what a fun-loving guy he was. I didn't really know him very well because he had only been in the lab for a few months and I was so wrapped up in my own work. All I knew was that he got his caffeine from Pepsi, rather than coffee. \n\nI found out after his death that he was on antidepressants and medication for ADHD. To this day, I don't know if his death was accidental or on purpose. My advisor seemed to think it was a drug overdose - I don't know why he thinks this and maybe he had more information that I did about the situation, but I think it has more to do with him not wanting to feel any responsibility for it.\n\nI will always wonder if being more inclusive to him when he joined the lab would have changed things. I don't know that I actively excluded him, but again, I was busy and not particularly interested in helping out another new student at that point. However, had he reached out to me, I absolutely would have engaged. \n\nI think a lot of established students are wary of incoming students and burnt out on teaching techniques and sharing lab space, but that doesn't mean anyone wants you to die.
