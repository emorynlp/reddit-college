  "text": "I joined the lab a couple weeks into covid and basically didn't do anything my first summer. I then TA'd and took a class in the fall semester. I had to rewrite and learn an entire aim of my proposal in a month in a half prior to my quals, which I passed in the spring. I've also been the graduate student advisor for an undergrad program for the last 2 years and TA'd this semester.\n\nBasically I've had about 5 months in the lab, essentially TAing over the summer and double TAing this semester, so I have like 2 experiments and cloning.\n\nThe only thing I have going for me is an off-thesis programing paper I basically when I couldn't leave my home, which is big for a 3rd year in my program, but I'm supposed to be a bench scientist.\n\nFuckin terrified",
