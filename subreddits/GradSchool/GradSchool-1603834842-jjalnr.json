Once the confounding variable was discovered we quickly replaced their typical reward with said Teddy Grahams. Unsurprisingly, performance improved. The research team then went out for drinks to celebrate identifying the problem, became incredibly drunk, and began loudly debating whether or not the mice would reject certain individual Teddy Grahams based on their shape. Much to our inebriated dismay, we realized further testing was required. In the name of reducing further confounding variables, we tested if the mice preferred the 'arms-up' (\\o/) form of crackers vs the 'arms-down' variety. After a maddening additional two weeks of research, we determined both the experimental and control groups greatly preferred the 'arms-up' variety for reasons unclear to the author, as she's not a mouse.
