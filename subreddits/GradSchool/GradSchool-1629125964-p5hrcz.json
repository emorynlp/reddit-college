Well, my amazing, thoughtful friends pulled through and sent me food all week through various delivery services. Those deliveries saved me from not eating at times and provided me with the only happy moments I had during my week of hell. So, send your friends food, it will make their day brighter and will help them when they\u2019re doing super hard grad school things.
