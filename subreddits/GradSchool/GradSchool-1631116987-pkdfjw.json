I just transferred to the PhD program, so I am being paid as a GSR as of this month. The first week my advisors know I took off because I was visiting family, but I didn't want to take too much time off so I agreed to meet this week. \n\nI completely underestimated the amount of family and friends I will have to visit/host or go visit in this span and barely have had time to do much research. We have a grant application due and I've barely started on it. Meanwhile my advisors told me before I left that they will likely be working through the labour day weekend. \n\nI want to ask to postpone our meeting (I have done this before, but I was a Master's student back then and didn't feel too bad since it wasn't on their dime and I was taking classes), but I feel so guilty for not doing as much work as they thought I would do. I don't usually feel like I need to work myself to the bone but I just feel like I'm not doing anything and they're paying me so I feel even worse.", "author": "Anti-Itch", "created": 1631116987, "retrieved": 1632844712, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc51gv4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkdfjw/being_back_home_and_feeling_guilty_for_not_working/hc51gv4/", "text": "Is the meeting tomorrow?", "author": "BoostMobileAlt", "created": 1631156515, "upvotes": 1}}}
