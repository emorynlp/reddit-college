Honestly, I find that any project that I find interesting as long as it pertains to knowledge is something that I could easily & quickly devote myself to. As I\u2019m in my masters now and struggling by jumping all over the board with potential thesis ideas, I\u2019m concerned this will be a problem if I wanted to do PhD. Seems like people and potential advisors want you to be solely interested in their specific niche. However, I\u2019m personally in the mind set that having a variety of skills in my field will allow me to be a better researcher.\n\nI realize that my projects (thesis/dissertation) would be rather specific, but as far as being able to at least express to people that \u201coh hey ya I have interest in this and that too\u201d I wish that seemed more common.", "author": "iredditalready13", "created": 1632607843, "retrieved": 1632952027, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"heaxi7d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvgpje/interests_are_too_broad/heaxi7d/", "text": "Take a break and work.

At least in my experience, that's all that decent advisors demand. Sure, there are definitely advisors that are really territorial and want your full attention on their work and discourage you from having your own collaborations or pursuing parallel training in your field, but they typically are not so great advisors. \n\nAlso, there's variability between fields or even departments within the same field regarding the culture around collaboration and having your fingers in multiple pies.
