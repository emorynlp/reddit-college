  "text": "I feel i have spent my entire life being a student. Now, I am a grad student/researcher. But i sometimes wonder how can i define myself other than this identity. Do you folks think it is important to have an identity/role other than a student? I guess my wonder is, how do i know if i am doing this because i truly love it, or am i doing this simply because I\u2019ve never tried anything else. Have do you know if academy is the best or the only path for you?",

      "text": "Of course it\u2019s important to find identities that aren\u2019t tied to research and studying. Otherwise, you don\u2019t have an outlet when your graduate studies aren\u2019t going as hoped, or when you complete your degrees. Part of me also wants to stay a student so I can delay full adulthood. From pretty much kindergarten, I received a lot of validation from filling the role of a dutiful student, and life without a syllabus and grades feels foreign.",

      "text": "Being a student/researcher is one of the least important and least influential parts of my identity. It's something I do and enjoy, but in terms of how I see myself as a person, I don't think it's even in the top 5. Being from the South, being gay, being religious, my love of food and cultures, political ideology, all play a much greater role in how I conceive of myself as a person than me being a student and a researcher. \n\nAs a human being, I think it is *essential* to have an identity outside of your employment. People should work to live, not live to work, and at some point you're no longer going to be working. Lots of people have identity crises when they base how they view themselves too strongly around their profession, and then end up retiring and having nothing to do all day. It's much easier to explore the world, make friends, and pursue your other interests now than when you are 60-70 years old and may not be physically able to do that anymore.",

      "text": "I am quite fond of my identity as a student/researcher as that is basically a summary of my personality. But if you're not that type of person, that's great too. I just came here to maybe suggest looking for a hobby that would bring you away from the studenr/researcher mindset. I picked up crochet during my masters, so maybe something like that could help you build up what you want your identity to be, by adding \"crafter\" or \"performer\" or something like that.",

      "text": "Science is life, so often being identified as a researcher is something satisfying. However, I have other identities that could define me: salamander breeder, digital artist, autistic. The idea of identity never impacts me greatly, I prefer to be distant and unseen most times. If others saw me as something other than researcher (w/ the exception being autistic), I'd be equally satisfied.\n\nTry more things if you feel unsatisfied, it'll help find a new niche that is separate from your career... if that's what you want.",

Being a grad student/researcher is just what you're doing at the moment, later on you might do something else.\n\nStudying isn't life and it isn't your personality. That way burnout and madness lie.",
