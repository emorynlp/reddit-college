Some context: I just graduated with my BSW this May after pushing through most of my undergrad. I was excited to finish school but was extremely burnt out from just \"going through the motions\" of school/life during my undergrad. I am *still* extremely burnt out from a social work-related job that I had quit back in *January*. During the summer I was considering deferring for a year and taking time to focus on myself because I was dealing with some mental health struggles after breaking up with my mentally abusive boyfriend of two years. I also wanted to defer because I wasn't sure if I *truly* wanted to pursue a career in social work. Despite my doubts and struggles, I decided it was just \"jitters\" and that I could push through (just as I had done the last three years of undergrad).\n\nA month into the program and I was having more doubts about whether social work was right for me and my mental health struggles only increased. I talked to people in the field, family, and friends, but ultimately, I \"spoke\" to myself. For once in my life, I have decided to trust my intuition and take a *break.*I'm not quite sure where life will take me, but I'm very excited. I feel happier, less stressed, and have just felt better overall after making my decision. I usually have everything planned out and try to stick to my plans regardless of whether it's still what I want. During undergrad, even when I was burnt out and having doubts about my next steps in social work, I didn't take a second to stop and ask myself, \"Is this what I *really* want?\", and I wish I had.\n\nAnyway, I'm just posting this because I want to tell people that it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask yourself if this is what you really want. No, I'm not suggesting that you quit your programs, I'm just saying that it's okay if you decide to take a break and/or quit your programs. :) Thank you all for listening!", "author": "babygarden", "created": 1632863216, "retrieved": 1632951941, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "comments": {"heqdlqp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxfy8a/decided_to_take_a_leave_of_absence_loa_from_school/heqdlqp/", "text": "Thank you.

I just graduated undergrad this may and that whole year was just hard. I feel burnout now, but it\u2019s just from constantly being told no.
