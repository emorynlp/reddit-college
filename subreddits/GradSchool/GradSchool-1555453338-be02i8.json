          "text": "Nothing like a grad college deadline to light the fire under your ass... that mostly did it for me. I created a Gantt chart for myself and was still doing experiments for the first 2-3 weeks and would write during incubation periods and at home before bed. Then when I started missing my gantt deadlines, I realized that schedule wouldn\u2019t be enough so I started writing from home 8-12 hours a day with breaks of course and my advisor turned edits around quickly but it would take me a couple days to address them all. It was not a fun time but I had to do it to meet the deadlines. Things that helped: sleeping enough, taking breaks, knowing when to call it a day when my writing became incoherent, using diction to have my paragraphs read back to me and creating a \u201cwriting environment\u201d with a special treat: my daily latte. My writing environment included using an oil diffuser or lighting a candle and playing rainy mood to help my brain enter work mode. Hope this answers your question!",

Daycare, supportive husband, time management and losing sleep as necessary to meet deadlines and complete assignments.

Also living in a low cost of living area was super helpful in allowing me to afford daycare and then aftercare.",
