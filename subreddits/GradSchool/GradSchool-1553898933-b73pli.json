  "text": "...that what we are doing is *really hard*. Grad school is really really hard. \n\nWhen you look at the others around you and feel like you are so much less, remember that you\u2019re running in a really elite circle of very driven people. When you are tempted to compare, remember that just by being there you have accomplished so much. Chances are, they feel the same way. And remember that you belong, because you\u2019ve worked hard and are learning alongside all these peers you are comparing yourself to.\n\nSpecial shout out to the grad students working a job or two on the side, and grad student parents. I see you.",
