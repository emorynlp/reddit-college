I've had a few hours of volunteer contact tracing but with school I've only done it a bit, and again that can be done with a 3hr training course. I've been trying to get a GA/GTA/GRA assistantship. Everything I apply for it's \"thank you but there's someone with more experience\" or \"you were so close to getting it but someone else was more experienced\". I'm not sure if I excel at interviews but I'm nice, honest, and friendly which seems to work. I graduated undergrad in 3 yrs, 1.5 of which were during COVID-19. I did volunteer in a research lab for a year but it was shut down due to COVID-19. I spent the year of 2020 and this past summer trying to find any/all positions in biology or public health or health or science related. I applied for a contact tracing position, did all the training and was told I wasn't chosen. In the meantime I volunteered as a tutor and I've worked in a bookstore, bills don't just go away.... I've applied to research positions to a CNA to a receptionist in a health department. Everytime it's a no and I can't help but feel I'm wasting my time and more money in school.  I've been limited to a certain area because of school and haven't had much luck with my bio degree or being a grad student. I'm worried I'm going to graduate and have this be my life, constant rejections. My biggest fear aside from rejection is I'll be the person with a master's working in a minimum wage job or something I could've done with a HS diploma. This feeling comes after being rejected from a volunteer position...\"there's just been so many volunteers we can't offer you a position\". It sucks because I even showed up to their training even though they forgot and there was minimal training, I stayed to learn. It really sucked because I felt my degree and education left should have been to volunteer but I guess not.", "author": "altaawesome", "created": 1632786854, "retrieved": 1632951976, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hel09i3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwttqd/feeling_like_i_want_to_quit_pity_post/hel09i3/", "text": "The fastest way to get rejected is to reject yourself by pulling out of the race.\n\nDecide if you want it, and then follow that decision.
