This is something I struggled with and had to get past so I'm not going to pretend it isn't a problem...because it is, and its something you need to address.  As to those saying \"well if you are a lab worker makes sense you wouldn't work if you are not in a lab\" I'd say no to that, people generally don't get PhDs to be lab workers all their lives, generally they at somepoint want to have some leadership role and it is hard when you are doing lab work in grad school to learn those skills like grant writing or contracts or patents or other skills that are part of the career path.  Now is a good chance to dig into that.\n\nBeing able to work independently is basically the most important skill you should (and basically have to) leave your PhD with.  People get really focused on getting publications or particular experiences or connections and that is all important too, but if you don't learn how to self-motivate you are going to fall flat on your face in an actual work environment away from the weekly check-ins and the feeling of basically being watched by your advisor.\n\nThere is nothing different between a home work environment and an actual work environment where you are senior enough in your position to not feel like you are being watched.  So if you envision a future of being a PI or a manager in industry and you can't work at home then you have an issue you are going to need to address. I get as a grad student you feel like you are being watched and that if you sat in your cubicle or at your lab bench surfing the internet instead of working people would notice and think less of you.  But if you end up leaning on that as s your sole source of motivation to work, you are shooting yourself in the foot and need to work past that.  You need to do some soul searching and figure out what you actually want to be doing with your life and make sure that that is your motivation, not that someone might see you not working.  What motivates you to \"do\" things when you aren't being watched.\n\nIf you lose all motivation to work when you are at home then to be honest your motivation is most likely just that you want to be seen by others as working.  Then its not really suprising that when put in an environment where you aren't being watched by others you lose all motivation to work. Here is the thing though, if you want to be a PI, or a senior scientist, or a manager in industry or other positions that would require a PhD (presumably what you are going for if you are getting a PhD)...those positions FEEL like you are working from home because you are the boss, no one is hovering over you.  If you don't learn that self-motivation ability now, when you have some safety-net in the form of training grants and a lab that supports you, you are going to drowned when given a position where you are expected to just to it all yourself.\n\nSo how do you make that transition?\n\nRemind yourself why you wanted to get a PhD in the first place, presumably it was at some point a self-motivated thing...you were excited by X and you wanted to learn more about that.  Take a few days, maybe step back a bit and try to rekindle that....think about what you really want to be doing and then recognize now you have some time to be doing that.  Come up with your  own schedule, one where you get to work on the things you've been meaning to look into and expand.  Divide your days 50% the things you want to read up on and 50% the things you need to be working on for your job.  That already is better than doing nothing but web surfing.  Use your own motivation to help motivate you to do the other work as well. Do the work you want to do, mix in some of the \"busy work\". Of course there will also be work you have to do that you don't necessarily want to do, that will always be true out in the working world as well....that is more about just building up willpower which is another skill that is more important than a publication record.  You will need to learn how to work when no one is watching if you want to grow beyond just a lab worker, now is your time to practice those skills.", "author": "Grevious47", "created": 1586143193, "upvotes": -4}, "fmjya1r": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fvgyo9/working_from_home_isnt_workingat_all/fmjya1r/", "text": "I am the complete opposite.

Since you're in a place where you can shift between work and rest anway, might as well build that into your routine than try to fight against it.\n\nHere's what I've found to be an effective process.\n\n1) Night before, select tasks you wish to do. If there are clearly descrete chunks (read an article/chapter, outline a section, ect) do that. If they're   a larger number of shorter tasks (enter data) then select a number to accomplish. Ideally you want to have tasks that take the amount of time you comfortable tolerate. A popular one is 25 minutes, but I find that 1-2 hours is good for me. For this, I usually try to do anywhere from 3-5 tasks a day\n\n2) Day of, get yourself situated. Having a clear goal and an end in sight really helps with the willpower issue, but you'll still need a bit of discipline to get started. I've found that if you like what you're doing and planned well, the need for discipline only lasts as long as it takes to get warmed up. If you still need to push yourself after 5-10 minutes, then you probably aren't being clear on what your task is and should focus on clearly defining it.\n\n3) Once you're done, take a break. You can time it out if you like, but usually I find that I'll start to get antsy after a while. Don't resist your anxiety- its only telling you that its time to get back to work. Thank it for it's service and get back to its\n\n4) Once you're done, reflect on your day- what went well? What didn't? Ehat needs to be done tomorrow? Use that feedback to do step 1 again\n\n5) Deliberately put down the work. Once you're done with your tasks, you're done. Use step 4 as the ritual substitute for leaving your lab. Leave your concerns in your notebook and take the rest of the night off\n\nAnyway, like other people said, don't worry about it too much. Just do the things you can. I doubt anyone's gonna be too upset if your productivity drops a bit during a pandemic.
