  "text": "Just wondering if anybody else out there has narcolepsy and if anyone has tips for how to manage it as a grad student. I haven\u2019t been officially diagnosed yet, but I have a sleep study scheduled in a couple weeks, and if this isn\u2019t narcolepsy, then I have a brain tumor or some thing. The onset was about halfway through the spring semester last year, and it\u2019s just hitting me so hard right now. I barely function as a human being, and I don\u2019t know how to juggle getting my work done for classes, doing my clinical work, and also doing things like getting the dishes done, because I am napping for about two or three hours at least during the day, I\u2019ve had to expand my commute by half an hour so that if I have to pull off to the side and sleep I won\u2019t be late to class. Hopefully once I\u2019m diagnosed I can start trying to get medicated which should help, but that\u2019s probably a few months off still",
