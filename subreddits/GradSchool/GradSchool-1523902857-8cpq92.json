Here they are in no particular order:\n\n***1) Don't worry about things you can't control.***\n\nIf there isn't anything you can do about something, try not to let it occupy your thoughts. If it's a situation that's come about because of a mistake you've made, well, you can learn from it, and you can't control the past either. Usually this type of worrying happens when you are waiting for some sort of outcome in the near future. Once you've figured out all the possible outcomes, have a next course of action planned for each. Once an outcome is reached, it makes it much easier to accept if you already have a plan for what to do next. \n\n***2) Define what success means to you, don't let others do it for you.***\n\nThis starts with setting [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals which you'd like to achieve. These must be goals which are truly your own, they don't have to follow what \"most\" people do. Maybe you are fine with finishing your Master's in three years while most in your program only take two. That's fine! We are all different, we don't have to all follow the same norms. \n\n***3) Comparing yourself to others is usually not a valuable exercise.***\n\nEverybody has different sets of goals, and different ideas of what success means to them. Remember point 2, only you can define what success means to you. When you're feeling down, you will always think of the people who have achieved your version of success to a greater degree than you, and when you're feeling great, you may think of all the people who haven't achieved your version of success to the degree that you have. To them, your version of success may be completely different from theirs. They got an industry job, because they couldn't find that tenure track position they really wanted. It is useful to get a general sense of what you should be doing in a new environment, but other than that, I don't find it useful. \n\n***4) High productivity doesn't mean spending long hours at the office.***\n\n\"Man, GradStudent spends 10 hours a day at the office every day!\" - we all know this person. Maybe they are okay with it, it is a part of their goals and their version of success. We all want to be productive, but for most of us spending that much time at the office/lab is not going to be the most efficient way to get the maximum amount of stuff done each week. When you're at your office, you should be as dedicated to your work as possible. Try to make your office a space where only work gets done. If you wanna take half an hour off to clear your head, go down to the lounge or library. This helps with the \"I could always be working\" thoughts which you get at home. Set goals for getting stuff done based on tasks, and not hours of the day. \"I'm gunna spend 3 hours doing figures\" vs. \"I am going to finalize figures 4, 5 and 6\". The latter is much more rewarding. Be effective with your time, and if you're just not feeling it that day then, don't force it, tomorrow will be better probably. \n\n***5) Nothing ever goes perfectly to plan.***\n\nIt just doesn't. There are too many unknowns to account for. When things go south, think about your overall goals, and how much they will be affected by whatever happened. Most of the time, it won't stop you from achieving them, and then see point 1. \n\nIt took me a while to really accept these things, but I have become much less stressed just remembering these things and reading them over every day.
