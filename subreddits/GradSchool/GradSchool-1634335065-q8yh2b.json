  "title:": "Submitted to a journal in the humanities a few weeks ago, haven't received confirmation of submission. Should I inquire, or will I seem like a pest?",
  "text": "I'm trying to get an article published for the first time. This particular journal doesn't take submissions through ScholarOne or any other web clients, and others who have submitted there say they received a confirmation within a few days. They take submissions via email, so I'm wondering if mine was lost in their inbox.\n\nI would rather wait until it's close to the end of the review period before bugging the journal about my paper. But I don't want three months to go by before I find out they haven't even read it. What's the normal, professional thing to do?",
