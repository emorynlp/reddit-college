  "text": "Hi, I have a 7.1/10 GPA. It is first class. I studied in a tier 1 university of India (NIRF ranking<50).  I am planning to pursue PhD from abroad (Probably from USA). So I think a 3.2 GPA can be balanced with my internships, projects and paper publication. Is it true that in 4 GPA scale my GPA will be equal to 3.2?",

      "text": "GPA only consider your grades. Anything else that you mention (internships, projects, paper publications) does not matter when it comes to evaluating your GPA, but will help with your admission.  If you got a WES evaluation and that's what came out of it, then it is what it is. Makes sense to me considering you got 7.1/10. Anything above 3.5/4 is hard to get.  Some universities require a WES evaluation if your degree is foreign or was obtained in a non-English speaking university so the evaluation you got is what I would call the ''industry-standard'' conversion. If you are not happy with the results, I guess you could contact them and ask for the details of the conversion, but not sure if that's going to do anything",
