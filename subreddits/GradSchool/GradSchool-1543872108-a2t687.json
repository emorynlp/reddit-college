I am interested in going into clinical psychology myself which I know to be the most competitive but also most generalized.\nI have been an LCSW for a couple of years, finished my MSW in 2014 with a 3.7 GPA. I have worked in a clinical community-based MH setting (severe-persistent mental illness) for just over 4 years. I have been directing and supervising in my agency for almost 2 years.\n\nI am so torn because my wife and I are both 28 and looking for a housing in Southern California and also interested in having kids in 2-3 years. She also wants to possibly do a PT grad school program so I don\u2019t know how it\u2019d be possible with a mortgage, especially if we had kids. A PsyD doesn\u2019t seem worth it and I am genuinely interested in contributing to the field of knowledge and teaching in a university or college, so a PhD is pretty important.. It\u2019s just a combination of timing, money, and duration.\n\nWould appreciate any advice..",

It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s going to be outdated and replaced in the next several decades. I have definitely practiced and dealt with tons of bureaucratic bullshit in the few years I have been in the field so I am somewhat used to it...
