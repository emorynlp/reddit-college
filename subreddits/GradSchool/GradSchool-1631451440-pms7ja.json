  "text": "Yes, here\u2019s another \u201cI want to drop out\u201d post, sorry to add to them. \n\nI\u2019m a history PhD candidate at a good, R1 university, I already have my Master\u2019s from another institution, and I\u2019m taking my comps exams in about a month. But I don\u2019t know if this is what I want to do anymore, I don\u2019t enjoy it, I\u2019ve lost all motivation, and frankly I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a job waiting for me at the end of this (that would specifically need a PhD) with how the job market is right now. It\u2019s all just feeling like I\u2019m wasting my time and others\u2019 time too. I\u2019m just done. \n\nA part of me wants to push forward with comps, though I\u2019m not at all guaranteed to pass, but what\u2019s the point if I\u2019m still going to want to quit anyway?\n\nShould I try to finish out this semester (including teaching responsibilities and my course load)? Or should I just cut my losses now?\n\nAnd how do I even start this conversation with my advisor? She\u2019s been amazing, honestly, but I just don\u2019t have the passion or desire for this anymore, especially since this pandemic.",

You are paying real money for a program to prep you on a career path.  If that career path does not compel you to spring out of bed in the Am, thrilled with excitement for the day ahead, then you\u2019re on the wrong path.",

      "text": "First, I'm not in History but in a discipline where academic jobs are only a little better. Plus, I served a decade as the graduate dean and 11 years as department head. Anyway....\n\nMy thoughts are first, that if you aren't enjoying learning, reading, and research it is a good reason to leave. This is academic life, publish or perish, do (funded) research, etc. If you are \"lucky\" enough to get a TT position you'll still hate it.  Personally, I'd anticipate that you'd background your research in favor of teaching and service. I truly and completely appreciate that orientation (as I even held it for a while as immediate gratification is more comforting than the gratification, way down the road, of earning tenure, promotion, etc.).\n\nBut, research is what it takes to earn tenure (and these days, even a job) in the tenure track. If that is not something you enjoy doing, or at least at which you are good, indeed you should rethink what you are doing. Perhaps you should orient yourself towards a \"teaching school\" (which I don't mean as a downgrade at all; it is where I sent my kids for undergrad as I know they are better educated). As a historian perhaps you should look at what it takes to work with state or national museums, historic sites, etc. Typically these jobs require an ability to do some research, but also a good facility when explaining things to the publics in an engaging manner. \n\nOK, I have no idea what skills and abilities you may have. If the ones mentioned above are of interest, you may or may not want to complete the PhD, but still may give you a way to orient yourself into a career you desire.",

I thrived in my master\u2019s program and the writing sample I submitted for my PhD had great feedback. But this past year or so, all the passion and enjoyment I had in the work has just drained out of me.\n\nIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m so close to comps and my advisor says I\u2019m ready, though I don\u2019t feel I am (but can\u2019t imagine how to fix that either). The advice I\u2019ve gotten from others is that I\u2019ll feel better about it all once comps are over. Except I don\u2019t think I will.\n\nI do enjoy teaching and I\u2019m good at it. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m mentally able to continue with the program without it affecting my health. \n\nI suppose my question is more, how do I gracefully leave? Should I push forward and at least finish out comps and the semester or just call it now? How do I even start this conversation with my advisor?",

              "text": "Hi.\n\nI personally think leaving gracefully is mostly an issue of interpersonal relations instead of an academic question. Have good conversation with your DGS and research/program advisor. While, to be blunt, I know some lab supervisors who won't think that anyone who  doesn't want to become a professor is worthless, I also find that rare (in all my time, I've only known two who feel that way). I've always wanted my students to succeed in whatever it is that they choose to do-- if in academia, that is wonderful, but still I am in contact with, supportive of, and PROUD of those who sought careers in business, government, high school teaching, etc. I just want my students to do well.\n\nSince you enjoy teaching, you might talk to somebody (your DGS, your advisor, or even somebody else on campus or at a nearby \"teaching college,\" community college,  or even high school district. THERE IS NOTHING TO TO BE LOST in doing so, and they may give you useful advice about how to become a competitive candidate, and if honest, may also give you a realistic assessment as to what life really is like in those careers.  Don't believe stereotypes; life as a professor at an R-1, live as a community college prof, or as a high school teacher is nothing like the public image each has. Talk with those holding those jobs.",

As much as they want you to succeed in their program, they likely want even more that you succeed in life. Sometimes it turns out that the two are not a match on closer examination. Talking with two faculty who are invested in you will give you two different perspectives. That way you'll get a more representative idea.",

Find out how much time your university gives for deferment or a break. If you get hopefully 3 years then go and try new things and in 3 years you'll know if it's worth returning or if you're refreshed enough to return or even want to. I'm in a similar position but I want to work at a university to help teachers so I'll need my PhD but I think it's best I get a lecturer job compared to a professor research job given my preference is really teaching first. We have to find what's best for us. Best wishes!",
