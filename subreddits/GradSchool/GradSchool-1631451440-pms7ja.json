But I don\u2019t know if this is what I want to do anymore, I don\u2019t enjoy it, I\u2019ve lost all motivation, and frankly I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a job waiting for me at the end of this (that would specifically need a PhD) with how the job market is right now. It\u2019s all just feeling like I\u2019m wasting my time and others\u2019 time too. I\u2019m just done. \n\nA part of me wants to push forward with comps, though I\u2019m not at all guaranteed to pass, but what\u2019s the point if I\u2019m still going to want to quit anyway?\n\nShould I try to finish out this semester (including teaching responsibilities and my course load)? Or should I just cut my losses now?\n\nAnd how do I even start this conversation with my advisor? She\u2019s been amazing, honestly, but I just don\u2019t have the passion or desire for this anymore, especially since this pandemic.", "author": "palli9", "created": 1631451440, "retrieved": 1632844615, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "comments": {"hcnntod": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pms7ja/seriously_considering_dropping_out_and_would/hcnntod/", "text": "I can relate.

Plus, I served a decade as the graduate dean and 11 years as department head. Anyway....\n\nMy thoughts are first, that if you aren't enjoying learning, reading, and research it is a good reason to leave. This is academic life, publish or perish, do (funded) research, etc. If you are \"lucky\" enough to get a TT position you'll still hate it.  Personally, I'd anticipate that you'd background your research in favor of teaching and service. I truly and completely appreciate that orientation (as I even held it for a while as immediate gratification is more comforting than the gratification, way down the road, of earning tenure, promotion, etc.).\n\nBut, research is what it takes to earn tenure (and these days, even a job) in the tenure track. If that is not something you enjoy doing, or at least at which you are good, indeed you should rethink what you are doing. Perhaps you should orient yourself towards a \"teaching school\" (which I don't mean as a downgrade at all; it is where I sent my kids for undergrad as I know they are better educated). As a historian perhaps you should look at what it takes to work with state or national museums, historic sites, etc. Typically these jobs require an ability to do some research, but also a good facility when explaining things to the publics in an engaging manner. \n\nOK, I have no idea what skills and abilities you may have. If the ones mentioned above are of interest, you may or may not want to complete the PhD, but still may give you a way to orient yourself into a career you desire.", "author": "urbanaprof", "created": 1631462019, "upvotes": 1}, "hckc5uc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pms7ja/seriously_considering_dropping_out_and_would/hckc5uc/", "text": "Probably most people consider dropping out at some point.

It's your future so just tell your advisor you need a break for your mental health. Find out how much time your university gives for deferment or a break. If you get hopefully 3 years then go and try new things and in 3 years you'll know if it's worth returning or if you're refreshed enough to return or even want to. I'm in a similar position but I want to work at a university to help teachers so I'll need my PhD but I think it's best I get a lecturer job compared to a professor research job given my preference is really teaching first. We have to find what's best for us. Best wishes!", "author": "MAE2021JM", "created": 1631453029, "upvotes": 8}}}
