  "text": "I am applying to earn my M.A in school counseling. I have two letters of recommendation already requested. One being from a supervisor at an elementary school I work at and the other one being from a professor in child development. I need one more, and I am debating on who to ask. Either my previous manager at Trader Joe\u2019s, who I believe can speak to my character and work ethic. The other one being a school counselor at the high school I attended and have been in contact with (somewhat). However I do not know how much she would be able to say. Any thoughts? Applying is so scary to me and imposter syndrome is a VERY real thing.",

With that said, I echo the sentiments of the first commenter who said to go with the school counselor.",
