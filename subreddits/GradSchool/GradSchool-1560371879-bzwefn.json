It's a computer science paper for a distributed systems algorithm, but written as if it's a fictional Greek legislative system. I've been told that the editor/reviewers refused to publish it initially, and wanted him to write it like a normal CS paper. He basically said \"nah, I'm good.\" Then 8 years later the journal finally said \"Okay okay, we'll publish it as is.\"  After people complained that they didn't understand the paper, \"perhaps because the original presentation was Greek to many readers\", Lamport wrote [Paxos Made Simple](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf).",

      "text": "Just going to leave this here\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6288200/ \n\nFUK\u00a0encodes fucokinase, the only enzyme capable of converting L-fucose to fucose-1-phosphate, which will ultimately be used for synthesizing GDP-fucose, the donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases. Although it is essential for fucose salvage, this pathway is thought to make only a minor contribution to the total amount of GDP-fucose. A second pathway, the major\u00a0de novopathway, involves conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Here we describe two unrelated individuals who have pathogenic variants in\u00a0FUK\u00a0and who presented with severe developmental delays, encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and hypotonia. The first individual was compound heterozygous for c.667T>C (p.Ser223Pro) and c.2047C>T (p.Arg683Cys), and the second individual was homozygous for c.2980A>C (p.Lys994Gln). Skin fibroblasts from the first individual confirmed the variants as loss of function and showed significant decreases in total GDP-[3H] fucose and [3H] fucose-1-phosphate. There was also a decrease in the incorporation of [5,6-3H]-fucose into fucosylated glycoproteins. Lys994 has previously been shown to be an important site for ubiquitin conjugation. Here, we show that loss-of-function variants in\u00a0FUKcause a congenital glycosylation disorder characterized by a defective fucose-salvage pathway.",

He asked John Eck if he could submit a paper with an interesting title since all the papers that had been submitted up to that point in time were pretty boring and bland titles. So of course, Dr. Eck being, well himself, decided to take that as a challenge and make a funny title for the article. Among the heaps of ideas, he decided on this one for no particular reason, but for the fact that it was hilarious to him. \n\nIt wasn't until the issue was published that Dr. Weisburd realized what Dr. Eck had submitted for a title. Once Dr. Weisburd found out, it was safe to say it was the last time he asked Dr. Eck for any interesting titles.",
