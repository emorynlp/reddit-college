  "title:": "I really need help picking a master's program or advice on what to do after graduation.",
  "text": "I think I really need some advice here, Im having a mini-crisis facing the end of my degree and thoughts of what comes next. I'm in my fourth year of a microbiology and immunology degree, I have zero research experience (partially due to covid), I'm not in honours, I have a very mediocre GPA (about a 3-3.3), am not close with any profs due to covid and being online. I want to do a master's program because I don't want to go into research but I feel stuck. I just want a job thats not sitting at a desk or in a lab all day, but I love science and my degree. Based on local job sites a Microbiology degree is practically garbage in my province unless you want to research. Im scared because applications for some programs are approaching and I don't even know what I want. I feel like I haven't set myself up to get into any program at all or find a job after graduation.\n\nI have been looking into biomedical engineering, biomedical communications, genetics, and biotechnology. No clue what you actually do day to day with any of these or if I can even get into any of these programs.\n\nI don't even know what kind of advice im asking for, I just don't know what to do. What science master's program can I do to get an enjoyable science-related job that isn't research or desk work? And how difficult is it to get into these kinds of programs? \n\nPlan B is to take another year to do honours think and get some research experience. At the same time I absolutely hate the idea of pushing it another year. I'm 21 now so If I take another year and a master's I will be 24 near 25 before I even graduate. I want to pay back my loans and start living with my own money and feel like a stable adult. I don't want to feel stuck and unsure until I'm 25.",

Grad school will not give you clarity, and could be an expensive mistake if you do it because you do not know what else to do or because you are enforcing artificial timeliness for yourself.. You should find a job, work, and reevaluate in a few years.",

I know timelines are dumb but it is important for my own mental well-being to stay on track. I'm going to pick a program and stick with it, I just need help picking one I think. \n\nThank you for the advice though, I just dont think thats an option for me or a last resort one at least.",

              "text": "Getting a grad degree to \"stay on track\" is, sorry, ridiculous. You are going to take on five to six figures more debt when you do not even know what you want to do. Masters degrees are cash cows for many universities. Way too many people do them without a plan or passion, and frankly, they end up worse for it.\nYou should invest the time in figuring out what jobs people can get with the degree you chose to get... \nWhen you are in a hole, don't keep digging deeper.",

                  "text": "Thank you I will think about that. That's exactly what I'm worried I may do, dig myself deeper. I'm hoping I will stumble into a program that I like that sets everything up for me but your right that's not a good idea and probably unlikely to happen on it's own.\n\nI'm just worried in no time I will be 25 and start wanting to look at future things like a house or a pet but find myself in an unstable position, still living like I am now. Idk I just want to have stable finances.\n\nI do want to mention I'm not from the US so my debt isn't crazy high. I just have 30k in debt right now after 4 years and have only recently started working while in school. For a master's It shouldn't go up more than 10-20k. But if I take a break from full-time school interests will start and I can't afford an apartment and pay off any of the loans with my current pay.",
