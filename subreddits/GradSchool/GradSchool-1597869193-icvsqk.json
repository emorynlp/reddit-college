After doing so, it turns out that of the two reviewers, one wanted to publish it while the other didn't.  So they got a third reviewer who decided not to publish it.  The end.",

Two of the reviewers were *blatantly* against me, and it was due mostly to paradigmatic differences than actual criticism of the quality of the work. Not uncommon in sociology.

              "text": "For my paper, it was reviewed a couple of times and the reviewers were lukewarm, mostly on the novelty rather than the methods. Other journals rejected it without review. Including the journal in which it eventually appeared - it\u2019s one of the journals with a lot of academic associate editors and I knew the one who handled my paper, so I sent an excruciatingly polite email pointing out why I thought they\u2019d made a mistake. I offered to revise and resubmit if they thought it was a good idea, and everything went smoothly afterwards (I was a post-doc at the time). \n\nI\u2019m now an associate editor at that journal. Here\u2019s how decision-making works: on submission, the editorial team read your paper. This can be several rounds of reading by different people, but eventually a decision is reached (either at the weekly editorial meeting or by a specialist associate editor, depending on journal) about whether to send the paper out for review. If it\u2019s rejected without review (RWOR; 70-80% of submissions at most journals), the journal sends out a pro forma rejection notice with very little info on how the decision was reached. Sounds like that\u2019s what you got. \n\nThe reason the RWOR letter is short and vague is that a large proportion of authors wind up quibbling if you put in a couple of lines explaining the decision. You can see why people might consider a couple of sentences dismissive or superficial consideration of a paper. However, that\u2019s the point - the editors don\u2019t think the paper will do well at extensive review and/or isn\u2019t a good fit for the journal, so they don\u2019t want to go through a full review (time-consuming, expensive, limited reviewer resources). So the RWOR notices are brusque to avoid the tedious back and forth with authors of no-hope papers who argue *ad nauseam*.\n\nSo what do you do when you get an RWOR? Consider two things (after you calm down!). First, ask if the venue was right: does that journal publish things in your exact specialty, catering to your audience? Second, ask if your current draft really pulls out the essential point of your work: be honest and brutal; is this something that anyone apart from you and three other labs in the world will care about? What\u2019s the more general interest message? Why should the person down the hall care? Are those things articulated in your narrative, or is that left as an exercise to the reader? \n\nTip: if the latter, your paper isn\u2019t going to do well. Exposition is tedious in fiction, but absolutely necessary in technical writing. Tell people what it is and why they care.",
