  "title:": "Is there any actual advantage of being in academia?",
  "text": "Sometimes I think about it and it seems like it's basically a lose-lose choice any way you look at it unless you work in very specific fields.\n\nMost of the time you're tragically underpaid, you're overworked and constantly stressed, you often have to get involved in things outside your scope (like teaching), you have to face competition, you have a hard time settling down and making life plans because you basically never know how long your contract is gonna last and you may have to bounce around different places for a while, you have a poor career outlook - because let's face it, a tenure track position is a pipe dream for most of us - and if you're not in the right place at the right time it might even end up weighing your CV down because some employees could see you as someone who just wouldn't bother looking for a \"real job\" and therefore went into academia to fuck around and waste time. I mean being a full time professor is probably great, especially if you're someone \"big\", but it's also not wise to work in academia and have that as a goal because it's gonna be exceedingly rare and you'll most likely be in for a huge disappointment.\n\nThe two advantages that I see mentioned are that you get to do research on what you like and do it at your own pace. But unless you work in something very niche you could probably also do it outside academia, and for better pay and work conditions. \n\nAnd yet people do it. Sometimes I really wonder what motivates us because I can't wrap my head around it rationally.",

If someone feels sacrificing everything you listed is worth it for the pursuit of pure research without any agenda and perhaps aiming for that pipe dream of a tenured job, they'd aim for that academic job.\nIf you're lucky enough to have industry which is very closely related to your field of research, I don't see a reason to not take that route. I feel in the end part of academia is a pyramid scheme, and most people are going to lose rather than win.",

The other 95% might have difficult life. Multiple post docs, unsuccessful grant applications, taking an undesirable job, lots of teaching, etc. \n\nIn industry, the 95% have a much better life. If you\u2019re in the 80th percentile of biologists or engineers in industry you\u2019ll have a great life. 25th percentile, you\u2019ll be fine as an engineer but might struggle a bit as a biologist. \nI think my advice after two grad degrees and then leaving academia is to be very honest about whether you\u2019re in the top of your peer group. If yes, go for it! If not, recognize you might have an easier life elsewhere and decide what kind of life you want!",

Some of my projects have industrial collaborators and the focus is solely on the \"product\" and not on the interesting science questions that have popped up along the way - of course this makes sense, but it's not hard to see why people might prefer academia because of that alone.\n\nIn addition, academia gives you something you'll never have in industry, as long as your program and advisor are good - the opportunity to fail with minimal consequences. This is probably field-specific, but taking 5+ years in a PhD program without producing anything and then wrapping everything up with a nice Nature/Science paper is not uncommon, but good luck working in industry going for 5 years without producing anything!",

These include going into a paid position in industry and/or starting my own company to profit from some of the ideas I have developed along the way.  I am not sad about that choice: I live comfortably and get to do the things I love.  But it important to be aware that is the choice you are making if you pick a career in research or teaching.",

You don't have as much leeway to pursue your own research interests as you might think as you really have to follow whatever is dictated by your grant and grant reviewers (study sections) have specific interests that you have to appeal to. If you're not incorporating the latest techniques/advances in your subfield, they'll dock you for a \"lack of innovation\" and you won't receive funding. Research also doesn't happen \"at your own pace\" because there's tons of externalities that determine when results should occur. You need to publish at a regular rate to get tenure, show funding orgs progress reports, get results for conferences, prelim data for grant applications, etc etc.",

On one hand I\u2019m biased to believe that any career involved in understanding [one of the most complex things in existence] will require a PhD. On the other the financial opportunity cost for the PhD alone (against someone in industry) is well over $1/4 Million. That\u2019s not counting a postdoc - which may or may not be required. Then you can start to get into the examination of the roles, with industry offering stable hours, overtime pay, great health insurance, great 401K and the ability to meaningfully save for retirement, the ability to family plan, and the ability to let loose on the weekends/ take vacations and not have to constantly feel guilty about not coming into lab every. single. day.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of how exploitative academia is and largely view the PhD as a necessary evil. Apart from the ability to control exactly what you work on (which isn\u2019t entirely true as it still needs to get funded), why wouldn\u2019t you go into industry??",
