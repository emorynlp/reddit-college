  "title:": "The aftermath of quitting my PhD",
  "text": "A few months ago, I ended up leaving my Ph.D. program with my Masters degree (biochemistry) after failing my first round qualifying exam. I realized that I was ruining my mental health, hated being in the lab, and didn't enjoy the academic setting. So, in May, I decided to leave the PhD program and get a non-thesis based Masters instead. I left without a backup plan and wanted to share what happened after leaving. \n\nWeek 1 after leaving: forms, forms, forms, phone calls, emails. It took about a week to deal with the academic forms and administrative stuff to leave the PhD program and join the Masters program. If you decide to leave, I would highly recommend figuring out all of the forms before you officially leave so you don't have to deal with them later on. Once all of those were accepted and approved, I was officially done with the program. \n\nMonth 1-2 after leaving: I applied for about 50 different jobs in the area that I was interested in ranging from a lab technician to a research associate (all entry-level, but I had a Masters so I wanted to be on the research side). I received rejection after rejection (Indeed feels like a black hole from your resume). Luckily, I had some friends in my PhD department that had connections to a startup who emailed me for an interview. I also started getting emails from my applications from LinkedIn and Indeed, so it was time to start the interview process.\n\nMonth 3: I prioritized the biotech startup and decided to interview with them first. I had three rounds; phone screen, Zoom interview, and a two-hour in-person research presentation and interview. After my references were contacted, I received an email about a job offer for the Research Associate position at the startup. I have accepted that and will start next month. \n\nOverall, leaving my PhD program was the best thing I ever did. My anxiety is gone, my depression is manageable, and I'm not dreading going into lab every day anymore. If you are miserable in your PhD program, especially if you want to transition to industry afterward, there are more options than suffering through. If you've made it here, thank you for reading, I wanted to share a PhD dropout success story. My DMs are open if anyone wants to talk further about my experience.",

      "text": "Thanks for sharing. I was working fulltime, doing a PHD part time in an academic medical center. The nominal (verbal) support was there to do both, but after completing all my course work, and had an entire committee implode after working on my literature review for a year, I took a year off from the PhD part.   \nI looked around, and no one wanted to be my advisor, and the only real advisor options in my field were on the previously doomed committee. So I began job hunting, and found my fit.   \nI officially sent in notice (email) to the program director that I was not only leaving the program (he had tried to get me to stay a number of times), but I was also leaving the institution.   \nI filled out no forms, and as far as I know, the school prob just thinks I'm on hiatus (again).   \nMy new job is a 30% pay raise (without needing a PhD, they just need my expertise). \n\nI'm tremendously happy and feel like the burden of part-time PhD students is far overlooked.",

For industry, I have plenty of friends that left with their bachelors, started as an intern or lab tech at a biotech company, and then worked their way up as high as they could in the company. They\u2019re doing completely fine, but the most likely won\u2019t reach the positions that someone with a masters or PhD would. From what I noticed, there is more of a ceiling with a bachelors.",

Best decision I made regarding academics. My masters felt wrong from day 1 and for the first year my mental health declined, physical health evaporated and social life was non-existent. I resented every second I was in class and just did not like the material at all.\n\nLeaving and gaining work experience and balancing out my life was quite literally a life saver and I'm glad my experience isn't unique. \n\nFor anyone reading,  making the decision to leave or withdraw is scary until it's done. Then, not so scary. It works out.",

And while there have been ups and downs, I can say that I\u2019m definitely much happier and creative than I was during my PhD years, more confident in my skillset and perspective, and feel invigorated by true collaborative work in a way that I never experienced in grad school. \n\nThat being said, I do miss aspects of my dissertation work. I listened to a podcast that touched on aspects that I had been trying to address in my research and my heart fluttered a bit. But the reality is that I don\u2019t come from wealth, and the choice to continue was seriously jeopardizing any sort of future financial stability I might hope for. We all know that success in academia is a gamble even with all the right credentials, and frankly I couldn\u2019t afford that gamble any more (which fed into the depression/anxiety/pressure that I felt around my PhD\u2026 further hurting my odds at dealing a solid hand for the academic job market).\n\n\u2014-(explicit rant begins)\u2014\n\nI once had a (white, male, non-first-gen, able-bodied) successful professor tell me that people in our field \u201cget paid in cool\u201d. Until we get paid in MONEY we will never have any sort of equity in academia. BOY do professors hate when you explain this when explaining why you\u2019re leaving. I guess I\u2019m just a money guzzling monster \ud83d\udc79 for wanting to experience financial stability for the first time in my life\u2026 but as Megan Thee Stallion once said \u201crich bitch pussy only cum for a check\u201d \ud83e\udd11\n\n\u2014-(explicit rant ends)\u2014",

          "text": "I abosultey loved my undergrad labs. I started out in a physical chemistry lab and then transitioned to a molecular biology one in undergrad. I really feel that my love for lab came from undergrad. When I came to the end of undergrad, I wanted to stay in school\u2026 I was really afraid to join the \u201creal world\u201d so I decided to go to grad school. Looking back, I\u2019m glad I did it because it let me know what I didn\u2019t want to do. I essentially was paid to get my masters in the end and it really helped to jump start my career in industry that\u2019s for sure. \n\nMy research in undergrad only kept some of the cell culture techbiques, everything else I learned in grad school. Really, the research doesn\u2019t matter nearly as much as picking the right PI. It\u2019s also important to know that if you really hate it, you can leave. Only you are able to dictate how your graduate journey goes and you\u2019re allowed to leave if you want to. I stayed longer than I should have in my opinion, but in the end it was clear to me and my PIs that a PhD simply isn\u2019t for me. \n\nGeneral advice would be to get a group of friends that are further along in the program. Ask them absolutely everything you can, and most importantly, ask them to help you study for any department exams. They just did them and will be your best study tool. \n\nAnother thing that I noticed is that department members are ruthless. Be as personable as you can be and make as many friends as you can. The entire department was sad I left, which means I didn\u2019t burn any bridges when I was there. Try to keep those relationships no matter what happens because they are so so so important for the next steps of your career. \n\nI hope that helps a bit! Let me know if you have more questions :)",
