I realized that I was ruining my mental health, hated being in the lab, and didn't enjoy the academic setting. So, in May, I decided to leave the PhD program and get a non-thesis based Masters instead. I left without a backup plan and wanted to share what happened after leaving. \n\nWeek 1 after leaving: forms, forms, forms, phone calls, emails. It took about a week to deal with the academic forms and administrative stuff to leave the PhD program and join the Masters program. If you decide to leave, I would highly recommend figuring out all of the forms before you officially leave so you don't have to deal with them later on. Once all of those were accepted and approved, I was officially done with the program. \n\nMonth 1-2 after leaving: I applied for about 50 different jobs in the area that I was interested in ranging from a lab technician to a research associate (all entry-level, but I had a Masters so I wanted to be on the research side). I received rejection after rejection (Indeed feels like a black hole from your resume). Luckily, I had some friends in my PhD department that had connections to a startup who emailed me for an interview. I also started getting emails from my applications from LinkedIn and Indeed, so it was time to start the interview process.\n\nMonth 3: I prioritized the biotech startup and decided to interview with them first. I had three rounds; phone screen, Zoom interview, and a two-hour in-person research presentation and interview. After my references were contacted, I received an email about a job offer for the Research Associate position at the startup. I have accepted that and will start next month. \n\nOverall, leaving my PhD program was the best thing I ever did. My anxiety is gone, my depression is manageable, and I'm not dreading going into lab every day anymore. If you are miserable in your PhD program, especially if you want to transition to industry afterward, there are more options than suffering through. If you've made it here, thank you for reading, I wanted to share a PhD dropout success story. My DMs are open if anyone wants to talk further about my experience.", "author": "lep187", "created": 1627409345, "retrieved": 1632845273, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 620, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h6tvtnr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oss0rd/the_aftermath_of_quitting_my_phd/h6tvtnr/", "text": "Thanks for sharing. I was working fulltime, doing a PHD part time in an academic medical center. The nominal (verbal) support was there to do both, but after completing all my course work, and had an entire committee implode after working on my literature review for a year, I took a year off from the PhD part.   \nI looked around, and no one wanted to be my advisor, and the only real advisor options in my field were on the previously doomed committee. So I began job hunting, and found my fit.   \nI officially sent in notice (email) to the program director that I was not only leaving the program (he had tried to get me to stay a number of times), but I was also leaving the institution.   \nI filled out no forms, and as far as I know, the school prob just thinks I'm on hiatus (again).   \nMy new job is a 30% pay raise (without needing a PhD, they just need my expertise). \n\nI'm tremendously happy and feel like the burden of part-time PhD students is far overlooked.", "author": "tmaddog19", "created": 1627480094, "upvotes": 1}, "h6tpb0h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/oss0rd/the_aftermath_of_quitting_my_phd/h6tpb0h/", "text": "I'm a Biochemistry undergrad: do you think I'd have a better chance getting into Biochemistry with just my undergrad vs a masters?

I listened to a podcast that touched on aspects that I had been trying to address in my research and my heart fluttered a bit.
