At certain times of year there are enough of those posts that it makes me want to take /r/gradschool out of my Reddit feed for a few months.\n\nI would love to see a ban on a few over-asked categories of post:\n\n* \"What are my chances?\" posts. Nobody is going to ask that question and get a good answer, because there is no good answer. (I actually thought there was a ban on that question, but looking at the sidebar rules now I don't see one.)\n\n* \"What can I do to improve my chances?\" \"Can I get in without research experience?\" and similar definitely belong over at /r/gradadmissions and not here.\n\n* \"Is xxxx a good school for yyyy?\" is also something I would love to see go away. They will get much better answers in a field-specific subreddit, not at /r/gradschool where the vast majority of people scrolling past their question in annoyance know nothing about their field.\n\n* \"How do you think COVID-19 will affect...?\" We. Don't. Know. Please. Stop. Asking. As a broke grad student I cannot afford a crystal ball to gaze into to give you that answer. \n\n* I would also suggest a \"should I go to grad school?\" mega-thread to try to corral a much of that in one place as possible. I don't think that one should be banned because it seems relevant and they might be able to get good answers here, but sometimes there's too many people asking and a mega-thread might help reduce the annoyance it causes. A mega-thread will also keep the answers they get all in one place, giving anyone who goes there to ask that question more answers to read than they'd get if they made a separate post.\n\nWith those categories of over-asked question (and maybe a few others I've overlooked) eliminated or contained, we could continue to allow other questions from people considering going to grad school that do belong in this subreddit. As an example, questions about how to pick a good advisor seem very appropriate here, since many of us have chosen well or chosen badly and might be able to offer useful insights that they might not get from /r/gradadmissions .", "author": "tentkeys", "created": 1588568746, "upvotes": 22}, "fpeujip": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gcw1vy/can_we_funnel_grad_admission_releated_questions/fpeujip/", "text": "Can the flair/tag options at least be beefed up and perhaps be required, so at least people can have an easier time finding the content they want?", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1588555237, "upvotes": 6}, "fpemtwk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gcw1vy/can_we_funnel_grad_admission_releated_questions/fpemtwk/", "text": "One thing the Python subreddit did was to force tags to be added to posts, with various helpful tags.\n\nThe `Python Help` tag was actually a trap, which triggered the automod to delete the post and message the user that the actual python help sub was the better place to ask questions.", "author": "oscarwhiskeyoscar", "created": 1588550602, "upvotes": 47}, "fpe9rge": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gcw1vy/can_we_funnel_grad_admission_releated_questions/fpe9rge/", "text": "The worst posts are those asking about CR/NCR (aka pass/fail) on here", "author": "AnonMLstudent", "created": 1588543202, "upvotes": 2}, "fpe6zpc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gcw1vy/can_we_funnel_grad_admission_releated_questions/fpe6zpc/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1588541607, "upvotes": 119}, "fpe5te0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gcw1vy/can_we_funnel_grad_admission_releated_questions/fpe5te0/", "text": "I agree, I don\u2019t mind seeing them here but r/gradadmissions will be much more useful in answering their questions.
