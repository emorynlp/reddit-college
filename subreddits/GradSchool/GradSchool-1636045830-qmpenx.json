  "text": "I emailed some professors 9 weeks before the application deadline, hoping they could write me letters of recommendation. They did not respond, so I sent a follow-up email after four days. Still no response, and the deadline is now two months out. Should I send ANOTHER follow-up email? Or should I ask other professors/mentors at this point?",

Your e-mails may be getting buried or something of that nature.\n\nIf you can't or they for some reason say no, then you gotta go somewhere else as you don't want to miss the deadline. It is a business after all.\n\nGood luck!",
