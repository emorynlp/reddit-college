  "text": "I feel so dumb :( I\u2019m taking an online grad school class and am hoping to apply for my masters, so was taking the class because the subject is good to know for my job and to test the waters and see if I am ok with online classes. We had an assignment due Sunday night and it took way longer than expected because my computer was so slow. Like parts of the assignment that should have taken 2 hours max took me 12. I thought I would have plenty of time to finish but it took so long that I turned it in almost an hour after the midnight deadline. At the time I was so stressed that I didn\u2019t send any emails or anything (literally up until the deadline I kept thinking I could still make it and the computer got slower and slower) and didn\u2019t want to turn it in with almost nothing done so I submitted late. I didn\u2019t feel I had a good excuse so I didn\u2019t send any emails or anything but now I realize I absolutely should have just sent an email to explain. The term ends tomorrow and I still don\u2019t have a grade back for it (it doesn\u2019t say 0, but also just hadn\u2019t been returned). \n\nShould I even bother sending an email at this point (5 days later)? I\u2019m not expecting them to waive the late penalty or anything but it finally hit me today that it looks so bad I didn\u2019t even send an email when I submitted saying something like \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I submitted late, I ran into computer trouble and hope you will still accept it.\u201d If I was actually enrolled I wouldn\u2019t be so worried but I\u2019m freaked out as I will need to submit my grade when I apply to schools this month. I\u2019ve gotten a 100% on my other assignments and all but one of my quizzes \ud83d\ude1e",
