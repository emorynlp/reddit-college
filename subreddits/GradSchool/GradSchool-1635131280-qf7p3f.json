  "text": "Getting a  PhD is my ultimate goal, but I find the idea of applying to one very stressful. While my grades/scores are quite good, and I have substantial work experience I\u2019m my field, I never did any undergraduate research. As such I don\u2019t think any good PhD program will take me seriously. I\u2019m very tempted to hedge my bets and get a masters first, so I have a couple more years to get research experience. Is not feeling worthy of a PhD yet a good reason to get a masters first instead? I just don\u2019t wanna sell myself short.",

      "text": "This is how I feel except instead of good grades and scores I have really good research and work experience. I\u2019m applying to both PhD programs and masters programs. Depending on your budget for applications, it may be worth for you to apply to PhD programs you\u2019re interested in and a couple masters programs as a back-up so to say, if you get into a phd; great, if not then it answers your question. Most professors I\u2019ve talked to say that a masters is a waste of time if you know you want a PhD. Of course if you can\u2019t get into a PhD and would like to keep going academically in a mean time, a masters would be the ideal way to do. My grades and test scores make me feel like I\u2019m not good enough so I completely get where you\u2019re coming from. Applying is stressful but what helped me the most was speaking with faculty I\u2019m interested in working with and getting validation for the research I\u2019d like to pursue and asking any questions I may have. Good luck friend, regardless of whether you apply to phd programs or not, you\u2019re enough!",

If I could substantially increase the number of options I have for where to go by getting a masters degree first, then I am very tempted to do that. I\u2019m not planning on going into academia after, and I\u2019m in a fairly well paid field (ML), so the financial strain of a masters isn\u2019t as much of an issue. And this field has a reputation for being discriminatory in terms of which programs it hires from. Industrial ML research labs are notoriously picky. So it seems worth it to me.\n\nBut I will  certainly consider it. My current plan is to apply only to places which I\u2019d wanna go to, places which don\u2019t feel like \u2018settling for what I can get\u2019, for both masters and PhD. So the safety plan will be to get a masters there, and apply for PhD latter, instead of getting PhD at place I\u2019m not so excited about",
