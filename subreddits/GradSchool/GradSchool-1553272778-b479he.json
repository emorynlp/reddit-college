My committee is very tough, and I have an extra committee member, so the between the stress of scheduling and anticipating some pretty difficult questions, there was a lot of pressure on the \"big\" day. A week ago, if you had asked me how I'd feel on my defense date, I would have told you I'd be a nervous wreck. Everyone kept asking me if I was nervous, told me that I must be freaking out, etc. Lots of other people told me I'd be ultimately disappointed when it's all over. After lurking in this subreddit for many years, I had seen the full spectrum of defense day rundowns, and was prepared to feel sad, disappointed, extreme anxiety, make mistakes in my presentation, etc. I am a very high anxiety person so I was dreading how I'd feel the week of my defense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day before, I had a TON of anxiety trying to prepare everything, tweaking analyses, making sure I had tons of supplemental slides ready to field any tough questions. But the day of, I woke up with so much joy and excitement, and just a light, focusing, touch of nerves. Overall, it was one of the most fun days of my entire life. When I got up on stage, I looked out on a full house of all of my favorite people, and realized each person was there to support me. No seminar is perfect but I think I got close. Here's what I think I did right:  \n\n\n1. Splurged on the right outfit. My whole outfit was brand new (though affordable). I know the default is to wear a suit, but I just don't feel like myself in pants, and while I have a skirt suit I love, it just didn't feel right. So I rocked a conservative dress I felt \"boss\" in and it was definitely the right choice for me. I would recommend a dark color, since I didn't have to be stressed about sweat stains from the stage lights. If you get a light color, bring a backup in case you spill something. I also brought a backup for panty hose in case I got a run. I felt confident and sexy the whole day.\n2. Scheduled my defense for the afternoon. I know scheduling is tough, but I didn't want the stress of trying to get on campus at 10 AM feeling ready to go. It was much easier for full time working friends and lab friends to take the afternoon off to make it to my defense, and I had a really luxurious morning of pampering and a nice, relaxed lunch before it was \"go time\". Plus, champagne and cake seemed more appropriate at 4 pm versus noon.\n3. I invited a TON of people, most individually. For faculty, I wrote a nice email thanking them for their contribution to my dissertation successes and asking them to join for the seminar and celebration afterwards. For friends and neighboring lab members, I made sure to invite everyone in person. This removed any anxiety I had over having a mostly-empty auditorium, and the audience was stacked with kind and encouraging people.\n4. I took the time to 100% fully enjoy the seminar. This was the first time I was able to give a 1 hr seminar, after a lot of stressful 15 or 20 minute short talks. After getting through the first couple slides, I started to realize I wasn't nervous anymore, I was having a TON OF FUN! After that, the seminar ended up being my best one ever. It went a little longer than I was aiming for (just over an hour, I was hoping to end at 45 minutes to leave time for more questions) but the slower pacing made it so much easier to say what I wanted to say.\n5. I brought a pen for each of my committee members, and brough the associated forms in a plastic container where they were safe from damage. The minutes before and after my defense were crazy, it would be so easy for something bad to happen to the forms, and a couple of my committee members didn't have a black pen. \n6. I defended at the RIGHT time for me. 6 years is a long time, though around average for my program. For the last couple years, I felt increasingly ashamed that it was taking me so long to finish my papers and to put together my dissertation and defend. But if I had defended last year, while I may have passed, I wouldn't have felt proud of the final product like I do now. In the last year I have really increased my confidence, honed some skills, and brought the story together into a body of work I stand behind. I think this is the main reason everything went so well, because I felt 100% confident that my dissertation was strong and was a significant contribution to the community. This left a lot less room for failure. I am also still very excited about the work, and maybe if I defended a year from now, I would have had less enthusiasm.\n7. Planning a lot of festivities around my defense really made it feel special. We splurged for some nice meals at restaurants I wouldn't normally splurge for, had an awesome party after the defense that lasted for hours (thanks to my PI and labmates), and I am planning another larger party for this weekend. Originally I felt guilty spending money on a party or on dinners when I am about to be temporarily unemployed, but it has definitely been worth it so far. It created an atmosphere of excitement, and it feels great to treat the people who have done so much for me over the years, even if it's just treating them to a lunch out or some beer and champagne on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, everyone told me to expect to feel disappointed after the party was over. If anything, I feel even better now! Each day since my defense I wake up feeling happy and confident in myself. I had so much self doubt over so many years, about my work and my capabilities. But I really feel like I knocked this one out of the park, after so many setbacks and so much struggle. I know this post makes it seem like my graduate path has been easy, but it was not. There were so many late nights and long hours. So many failed experiments. So much learning and failing at new things. It has been a team effort the whole time and I am honored and unbelievably grateful to have been given so many opportunities to learn, fail, and ultimately succeed. Each day this week I have come into lab an hour later than normal, chosing to spend each morning instead on thanking those who helped me, making gifts for those who supported me, and being grateful for everything I've been given. This has magnified my joy 100 fold.  \n\n\nThank you r/GradSchool. There have been many nights, scrolling through here at 3 am, too anxious to sleep, wondering if I could do this or not.
