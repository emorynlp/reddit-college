  "text": "I can't find the original tweet, but it's circulated on the internet for some time now, where someone says that the best advice they got in grad school was knowing which balls were glass and which were rubber. Meaning if you 'drop the ball', drop a rubber one. \n\nSo as we enter finals week I wanted to give this little reminder than sometimes you drop the ball on a class, a final project, or a test but its OKAY!! \n\nI would also argue that your mental and physical health are the glassiest balls in the bunch, so that comes before everything else :) stay safe out there all and good luck with any finals, be they now or in May/June",
