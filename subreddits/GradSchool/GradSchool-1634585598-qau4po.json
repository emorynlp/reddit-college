  "text": " Hi everyone I'm looking for some advice. I'm currently a sophomore trying to decide on what to major in. I'm trying to decide between IR and Economics. I was also thinking of getting a MA in IR after a BA in Economics because I wish to be well-rounded. I want to work for the federal government \u2013 not sure exactly what \u2013 but I don't want to study IR as an undergrad because I feel that I would get burned out and not want to study IR at the grad school level. Also, looking at some of the grad school requirements, the admissions specifically look for evidence in quantitative coursework with classes in Economics, Calculus, etc. Since economics encompasses a lot of the quantitative reasoning requirements and is often related to IR, wouldn't it be a good idea to get a BA in Econ and then a MA in IR? Also, my school does not offer minors, and I will not double major. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks,",
