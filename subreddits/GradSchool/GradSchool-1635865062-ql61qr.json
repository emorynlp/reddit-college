  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m having a difficult year of TAing because the prof that I work for is not clear about their expectations. For some context, I TA for an intro to anthropology course and I\u2019ve been doing this for many years. Usually profs for this course organize their themes each week very clearly, and during the lectures they outline the key concepts relating them to the articles assigned. Most of these students are first years and new to anthropology, so this approach is needed. This prof is new in my department and they barely do any teaching during the online lecture. They assign a lot of reading, and they\u2019ve really departed from the typical themes that this course teaches (it seems to all be based on what interests them and what is connected to their own research). A lot of these readings are complex and I\u2019m having a really hard time figuring out how to teach them to students without having to lecture them myself. I can sense that they are frustrated, students have commented about the density of the course readings and the pace of the lectures. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if you have any tips on how I can help them so that they can still feel good about the course and do well on the exam. Because so many of them struggle with the reading, should I literally screen share the readings during tutorial and go over them collectively? I\u2019m so used to profs filling in a lot of context during lecture but with this person even I am confused sometimes with why they assign certain readings.",
