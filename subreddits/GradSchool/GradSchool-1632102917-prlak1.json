It was to the point where my colleagues would notice and ask if I was ok. My advisor changed my project twice despite my protests and I had to essentially start over both times, one of which I had spent 2 semesters on. The reason for this was never given. None of my advisor's students have graduated and some have been here for 4-5 years.\n\nAfter more than a year of this, gaslighting everyday, general incompetency, unwanted comments and demands to know about my personal life, and a recent incident that was triggered by myself talking about how I was planning on taking a 5 day trip to visit friends (despite the fact that I regularly work weekends and working remotely was something I accounted for), I decided to leave the lab because it was taking a toll mentally.\n\nThe problem is that I have nowhere else to go. None of the other advisors are taking students. While I can technically still sign up for classes, I'd be a \"free agent\" with no advisor. I know a few people outside of this institution that might take me in if they have space, but that's a long shot. \n\nI still adore my project. I'm at the point that I can do the rest myself with minimal input from professors. But without an advisor I'm kind of screwed.", "author": "Kiwi55", "created": 1632102917, "retrieved": 1632952176, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hdkxngi": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prlak1/quitting_my_lab_not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/hdkxngi/", "text": "Get together, record/ report everything, go to the media (schools love this one), watch him scramble and beg to save his tenure.", "author": "soslightlysalty", "created": 1632139563, "upvotes": 2}, "hdkd7da": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prlak1/quitting_my_lab_not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/hdkd7da/", "text": "Something similar happened to me.
