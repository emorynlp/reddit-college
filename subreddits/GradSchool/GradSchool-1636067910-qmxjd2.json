If you want to go a little deeper, crawl into the citations and see who they reference the most.\n\nAlternatively: look up the top X schools in your subdiscipline. Go to their department websites and look for an \"areas of research\" page.",

Which research topics are important/relevant and closely related to your research \n2. Which PI\u2019s have fund to support your PhD\n3. What are the recent trends in closely related areas\n4. Which university to choose\n\nFinally, after you found some PI info then go to their google scholar and find other related works/collaborators.\n\nAnother way: search research keywords in google or top journal/conferences of your area and then read the papers, find the cited papers as well, find the collaborators work/papers as well, that way you will get some idea about the trend/relevant works in your field.",
