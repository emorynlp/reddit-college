Assuming, of course, you *are* good at science and logic.  If you\u2019re not, these doors of opportunity are much smaller.\n\nNot sure how many in-field industrial jobs there are.  Could be a million, could be zero.\n\nIf you want more direct answers to your field, I\u2019d edit your question and include your PhD field in the question.\n\nGood luck!",
