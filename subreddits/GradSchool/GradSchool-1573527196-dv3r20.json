I\u2019m currently a PhD student, about a month away from my defense. By many measures, I\u2019ve been successful in grad school. I have six manuscripts, and I\u2019ve sequenced quite literally tens of thousands of DNA samples. But today, my advisor told me that I\u2019ve disappointed her so much that she\u2019s stepping down as my advisor. My last experiment (for manuscript #7) failed for reasons outside my control (imo, it failed because of decisions she made, but regardless, it\u2019s science. Projects fail all the time). But in her eyes, it was a personal failure of mine. I already have a post-doc lined up for January. I feel so betrayed and let down. I\u2019ll have to find a new advisor and committee and hopefully they will approve my work and let me defend. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll still be ok and I won\u2019t lose the post-doc, but it hurts the most that my advisor thinks I\u2019m a failure. I\u2019ve dedicated almost every waking hour of the past 5 years to her and the lab. I\u2019ve worked so hard. \n\nI know exactly when and where and why my relationship with my advisor started to break down. A little over a year ago, I was a victim of a home invasion and physical and sexual assault. The person then stalked and harassed me for months. Long story short, the police and court system were no help at all. When I told my advisor, she gave me an awkward pat on the back and said \u201cYou\u2019re strong, I know you\u2019ll be ok\u201d. I was most definitely not ok. I had daily panic attacks and I never felt safe in my own home, much less going out into the world. I especially did not feel safe on campus where my assailant walked around freely. I moved twice to try to regain some semblance of safety and sanity. I definitely experienced PTSD symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and so many hours lost to disassociative episodes. I never really felt like I could open up to my advisor again and we frequently clashed. Since my lab work was done, I mostly stayed home to write. However, she constantly requested that I come to campus for seminars and (imo dumb things like) doing the lab\u2019s dishes. Coming to campus was really, really  hard for me. But I still managed to write 6 papers. But because this last experiment failed, she\u2019s so disappointed in me that she won\u2019t even be my advisor for hopefully my last few weeks of grad school. It also feels like sabotage because I already have my next job lined up. I feel so heartbroken.", "author": "echtesteirerin", "created": 1573527196, "retrieved": 1632954471, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 280, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"f7g831z": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/dv3r20/i_want_someone_to_hear_my_story/f7g831z/", "text": "I started to think that academia is very much like a cult controlled by crazy people.

Depending in the size of your department/uni, the process might be a bit different or you might have to jump through multiple hoops.\n\nFirst look up the grad student handbook of your department,  grad school and university to make sure you fulfill all requirements. \n\nTake all supporting documents of your work and meet with your program coordinator.  In most cases,  the program director will sort out a path for you.  If you don't get a satisfactory result from this meeting,  talk with your department chair and coordinator from grad school. The more people in administration know about this,  the more immune you'll be in case your advisor comes back at you.\n\nBest option will be to choose a person from your current comittee as your thesis chair and update the forms.
