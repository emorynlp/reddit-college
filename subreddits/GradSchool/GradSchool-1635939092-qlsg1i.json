  "text": "I am a junior undergrad student of Physics. I have always seen myself doing research but I haven't found a field of interest yet. I am thinking of taking up a coding job after graduation since I haven't figured out my interest and hoping it will give me time to figure out stuff. Will doing courses online while I am working help me find my interests and can I apply for masters or PhD later? Also how else can I explore different fields while keeping my job? Is it possible to do research projects with professors along with my job?",

      "text": "Why are you majoring in physics? If you can answer that beyond \"I was good at it\" then you have a good starting point. Ask professors who research something related to why you're doing your major to see if you can work in their lab.\n\nI find that courses especially online courses are often not representative of the actual field (at least in bio-related stuff). If you can actually do something relative to physics in your coding or talk to professors and physics researchers about what they actually do it would help you figure it out.",

      "text": "i did research on a variety of fields during undergrad and did not have a specific research field in mind either (electronics + material science double major). signal processing, integrated circuit design, biomedical instrumentation, polymers; have related projects on all of them but completed my grad project on semiconductors, and finally had something i loved to work on. i would say that this stuff was a bit of trial and error, at least for me. not only do you figure yourself out, but learn a lot along the way. with your physics background, i imagine you have a lot of research areas you can get into. working with professors would be your best bet, especially in physics.",
