Can't speak for everyone but this literally kicked my butt into gear and hopefully it's useful to others.\n\n1). Establish a workplace in the home that is dedicated ONLY to work related activities.  If that's a desk, put only work/school related materials on it and remove any other distracting items.  If it's a desk, keep only books that are pertinent to the work that is being done.  Desks have this magnanimous way of attracting non-necessary distractions that can prevent focus.\n\n2).  Establish an online workplace that has no other distractions.  One of my friends is a professor and has 3 screens on his desk.  2 of them are work related and the third has youtube on it.  He shuts off the youtube screen when he's doing work (the screen stays on his workdesk, however).  It only goes on for breaks...which leads me to #3.\n\n3).  Schedule your work routine.  Pretend there's still a set schedule for work and make it happen.  Many of us that are stuck at home have a \"home\" routine and b/c we're in this environment tend to revert to whatever routine that is.  Get up, get coffee, take a shower, get dressed, just as if the workplace routine outside of the home was to be followed, whatever that is.  Then, get to work in the designated workspace from #1.  \n\n4).  Schedule breaks.  If the normal work routine contained breaks every 2 hours, follow this routine.  Stand up, walk around, potty break, walk around the backyard, or go outside and take a few deep breaths of fresh air, modify if on stricter quarantine.  Refill the coffee.  Take 5-10 minutes to break and then *get back to work*.  People are creatures of habit.  For lunch, do the same.  I was used to a 30 minute lunch break, so that's what I took.  Resist the urge to watch Netflix and couch it up for lunch.  If eating out was the usual lunch break, try to order door-dash or something similar.  If that's not available in the area, finding other alternatives such as microwavable meals, or something more instant, helps retain the familiarity of the non-quarantine work routine.\n\n5). Stop work when the number of usual working hours is up.  It's SUPER easy to feel unproductive and, especially for grad students who are overworked, under sleeping, and overstressed, to want to keep trying to work b/c we don't feel we accomplished enough for the day.  However, if we're not being all that productive in the first place, we need to stop working when we would've stopped working at the uni, or workplace, or outside of the home environment.  If the non-quarantine routine included working at home, then stop and move on to #6 before going back to work.\n\n6).  Follow the post-work routine as closely as possible.  If it involved extracurricular activities such as going to the gym, taking the dog for a walk, vegging out for a movie, bingewatching youtube, allow this to happen within the confines of the quarantine.  If the neighborhood is closed down and walking the dog isn't an option but there's a backyard, walk the dog around the backyard.  Yes, I've done this.  We walked around in circles for 15 minutes, alternating directions.  Pretty soon the dog figured out what was happening and made it into a game, anticipating my next move and what direction I was going to go.  If the gym isn't accessible, find a good video program to follow and try to mimic the workout routine as closely as possible.\n\n7).  Follow the pre-quarantine night time routine.  If it was dinner, shower, then bed, follow this routine.  Not, dinner, shower, then surf the web for hours stressing out over the outbreak.  This does nothing but cause insomnia and waste precious reserves.  If part of the usual night-time routine involved doing additional research before bed, allow this to happen, while recognizing it's still important to limit the amount of additional research.  Which leads me to #8.\n\n8).  RELAX the best possible under the circumstances before going to bed.  Listen to relaxing music or meditations 30 minutes before bed.  DO NOT watch the news, listen to NRP, read COVID-19 related items or research the latest ongoings before bed.  Drink plenty of healthy fluids and eat as healthy as possible.  Under stress, I tend to consume insane amounts of coffee (hence the prior coffee references) and would have an IV of pure coffee inserted if viably sustainable.  I tend to forget my body actually needs water.  Stress does profound things to the body which weakens the immune system and can compromise thinking clearly.  We are all under profound amounts of stress as grad students anyway, and adding the COVID-19 crap to this isn't doing us any favors.  So, making a conscious decision to take extra care to RELAX and treat the body with extra care will go a very long way.  \n\nAnyhow, anyone else have anything to add, please do.  These are just a few fundamentals I found super helpful.

I\u2019ve a few others to add.\n\n1. If, like me, your post-work routine was frequently veg out on the couch and surf the web, stop (as noted above). Now is a time to find other things to do in the evening - you should have time for all the hobbies (at least the indoors ones) you used to be too busy for, as long as you\u2019re not spending that time on social media.  Since you\u2019re no longer commuting (which took up at least an hour and a half of every day for me), that\u2019s time you can spend learning to cook, reading books, painting, etc. \n\n2. Make a to-do list for every day.  It\u2019s helped me a lot because I know that between when I start (which is usually like 9) and 5, I have to finish all the things on the list.  Helps me to focus and stay on track. \n\n3. Wear real pants. Can\u2019t stress this enough. Especially if you don\u2019t have a dedicated office space, this may be the only thing that indicates you\u2019re \u2018at work\u2019.", "author": "MsOctober", "created": 1585141036, "upvotes": 15}, "flg46o5": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/folh2o/to_everyone_stuck_at_home_and_not_motivated_to/flg46o5/", "text": "1.

Tip: many sites like twitter and Facebook you can set up keyword filters, so they don't show you and content with the word covid or lockdown or something.
