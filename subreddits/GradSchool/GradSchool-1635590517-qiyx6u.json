Depression manifests in different ways to different people, so if you think you might be depressed, I'd encourage you to speak to a therapist who would be better able to give you a clearer answer. \n\nWhether it is depression or not, try not to forget self care. It's okay to take a day or two to focus only on yourself  and do something nice for yourself. Mental health challenges or not, everyone needs a mental health day, imo, to recharge.",

I\u2019d definitely recommend making an appointment with a counsellor! \n\nIn the meantime, you can also try to look at what what your schedule is like  - do you give yourself some time to do activities that you enjoy frequently, or only when you start to feel like things are getting tough? Are you getting enough sleep, downtime, nutrition, exercise, sunlight, emotional/social connection?",

Something as simple as not getting enough sunlight or eating too much red meat can make people more prone to depression. Stress, poor work/life balance, and nutrient deficiency is enough to drag anyone down.",

      "text": "I'd say, like others have suggested, that what you're experiencing is probably burnout.\n\nBurnout can be a response to general stress/being overwhelmed, but it also can be related to/exacerbated by other conditions or disorders. Other people mentioned anxiety and depression for example, I've also heard autistic people can experience a lot of burnout, but usually for pretty different reasons than allistics. I personally feel the burnout that I experience is usually triggered by my ADHD. \n\nIt's very cyclical for me as well, since it takes so much extra effort/concentration for me (relative to non-ADHD people) to maintain the expected level of productivity, I often only manage to keep up until big assignments and deadlines converge. Even if I meet those deadlines, all the extra effort I had to put in for those bigger assignments, on top of how much more I already need to give, ends up exhausting me so much I usually lose what feels like basically all my capacity to work for like the next week. Currently in that low point and recovery is difficult when the workload hasn't actually lightened up enough to catch a breath. So I definitely empathize.\n\nI also recommend seeking counseling and stress management resources (my university offers seminars through health services for example) to help prevent or manage burnout. And if you think it might be caused by more than just being stressed it's definitely worth talking to a doctor as well. Best of luck",

Burnout is real, and the middle of the semester is perhaps the most uncertain and defeating time. November you can get a second wind. Taking care of yourself is perhaps more difficult than anything your courses or research can throw at you, but if you figure out what you need to function everything else will be easy.",
