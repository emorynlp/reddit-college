The application has a high acceptance rate and would be certain funding up to 3 years. The hook is you have to find a company to cooperate with and that during a pandemic.\n\nAfter contacting about 10 companies I found one that was interested in my project, as well as willing to engage in a research project and develop a new product.\n\nWe made out an appointment for a video meeting and I invited my professor and another professor loosely attached to the project that would also cooperate.\n\nCome the meeting, the company has 5 guys participating but neither my main professor nor the other one show up. In the end, I a PhD student and the secretary of our faculty are alone with the Ceo and 4 engineers. During the meeting they are quite friendly and it goes on for 2 hours.\n\nAfter that they ghosted me and my calls and finally, after two months declined, saying they have too many projects already.\n\nMain professor said she had an emergency in the laboratory. But now my contract has run out and I am facing unemployment. I have been dropped, right? They are just chickening out of telling me straight away.\n\nOn top of that, while not even appearing to the negotiation, the professor expects me to keep working while I am unemployed, helping with the exams. I have a patent for a device, that was to be developped into a product with that company. \n\nAnd as of 4 months ago, I have to share authorship for a new research paper with a new master. The problem is, the guy is bad in english and he fucked up the data analysis of his experiments so terribly it's unbelievable. I had to redo everything on top of writing the paper. And in exchange he gets second First Author.\n\n**EDIT:** Regarding the paper: Since I am not officially aligned with the University anymore, do I have to make that guy First Author and Corresponding Author?  I do not trust him or my professor anymore.", "author": "Le_German_Face", "created": 1632310709, "retrieved": 1632952131, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {"hdugq1v": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pt5on1/have_i_been_dropped_by_my_professor/hdugq1v/", "text": "Please don't work for free.", "author": "sybr-munin", "created": 1632319795, "upvotes": 7}, "hdtzehq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pt5on1/have_i_been_dropped_by_my_professor/hdtzehq/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1632310721, "upvotes": -27}}}
