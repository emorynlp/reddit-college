  "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am a first year masters student, and I want to quit. Not because I don't think I can do well or am capable, but because I don't like the program or location from what I've experienced. For background, I moved with my SO for grad school. We moved from a dream city that we really loved to this new city because this particular masters was fully funded with stipend which I don't think is very common. We figured free masters >>> paying 20k for a masters. The city we moved from is only several hours away and I did get accepted to a masters program there, but it would've been like 20k total for the degree instead of free. \n\nNow, it isn't just that we don't like this new city. We've visited here before, and it was fine (nothing special), and I just thought that we'd be ok living here for 2 years. Well... it's been several months since we've moved and we both are just not happy. It's small, there is nothing to do, and we just don't really vibe with the city here.\n\nOn top of this, it has generally been a shit show at this school - even in my department/program specifically. For example:\n\n-The department is extremely disorganized. I found out what I am TAing the day before my section (syllabus, schedule, content). My tuition/healthcare waiver wasn't processed until way later and I was unable to use insurance when I needed to because of the balance on my account. Even though we were supposed to do this a month ago, I literally just set up my payment system for my stipend yesterday, and I don't know if I'll get paid now this month.\n\n-The teaching here has been subpar. I'm totally fine with self teaching, I don't need my hand held, and I've taken many hard weed-out classes previously. However, some of my classes are unnecessarily convoluted for no reason and one of my classes has had the course structure change on a weekly basis (literally just got another email about another change in course structure).\n\n-I have an applied emphasis in my degree, but I'm required to take mostly theoretical coursework. I want to go into industry, so this does not interest me to have most of it be theoretical.\n\n-There are class shortages and over enrollments (my department is most guilty of this and the university just published numbers on this). I want to take certain classes (less theoretical or in other departments) and because of the course shortage/over enrollment, I'm unable to and it also might make me take longer to complete my masters.\n\n-The internet fucking sucks. Goes in and out all the time (even when hardwired). A couple of days ago, I was trying to get some work done/study, and I spent about 2 hours refreshing my page because it would be connected, then not connected very couple of minutes. I've never had a single day since living here where the internet doesn't go out.\n\nSo this is just a taste of some of the frustrations I've had so far, and on top of that it's in a place we don't particularly care for. Would it be stupid to leave a free masters degree? I know that I'm lucky to be in this situation, but jfc this has been such an awful experience so far. I feel like I'm not far into it, so at the end of this term would be the best time to quit if I wanted to. Any advice?\n\nThanks!",
