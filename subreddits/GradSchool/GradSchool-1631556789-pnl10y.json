  "title:": "Your opinion on small universities like Millikin University in Decatur, IL",
  "text": "Hi all! I am considering to apply for faculty positions in physics, also at smaller universities. A few days ago, I saw a job posting by Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. Up until then, I didn\u2018t even know that there\u2018s something like a university in Decatur. I\u2018d like to ask you for your general opinion on such schools. I like Central Illinois and I am considering staying here, but I have some doubts about such a small university as the one in Decatur.\n\n- What kind of people are studying there? Are they all people who failed to get into bigger schools like UIUC (which is nearby in Champaign-Urbana) or what should I expect? I am a foreigner and not super familiar with the US college system, so I mean this question in a serious way and I don\u2018t want to judge the people there.\n\n- Can I expect to be able to do any research or will I be teaching only? Maybe there are some people who went to Millikin or similar universities and have some experience.\n\n- There are only 3 professors in the entire department. I kid you not. One permanent, one adjunct, and one visiting professor. How can people even study physics there? This is their website: https://millikin.edu/physics\n\n- Any other comments, remarks or experiences for such small departments at small universities?\n\nI would appreciate any kind of advice or opinion from the Reddit community. Thanks a lot!",

      "text": "Lots of schools in the US are, from what I understand, quite different from foreign universities. The bigger, more well-known schools are probably more what you are familiar with (UIUC, Ohio State, etc). Like the other comment said, you can probably expect to focus mainly on teaching at a school like this, especially if there is no grad program in your department. \n\nThe students that go to smaller schools like this are often from the same region the school is in, and they often choose smaller schools because they like the atmosphere or the small class sizes. Some might go to schools like this after not getting into a bigger one, but they often decide on one of these schools without that step.\n\nI went to a fairly small undergrad myself, and the benefit is getting to know professors really well. There was not many people in our department, so it felt like everyone was very invested in the students they had doing well. But the drawbacks are often a lack of access to research opportunity, and lots of times there are fewer classes offered than at big universities as well.",

      "text": "You're asking an overly general question for a single example, and it's likely people won't be able to answer based just on that. \n\nBy and large, it seems like you're maybe just a bit unfamiliar with the landscape of institutions in the US. \n\nMilikin looks like a pretty common small private undergraduate university: around 2000 undergrads (respectably sized for a small school), around $100 million endowment. \n\nGenerally, I'd file it under a \"Small Liberal Arts College\" or SLAC. Within such schools, there's a huge range of sizes (500-600 students up to 3000-4000 students), scholarly activity (places like Reed and Middlebury at the top expect major grants and regular publishing for tenure) and competitiveness. That said, given it's affiliation with the Presbyterian church, it also might be a small religious school. \n\nTop SLACs accept absolutely top caliber students on a national stage, and can be located in unusual places (see, for example, Grinnell College in Iowa with over a $2 billion endowment). \n\nMillikin seems more likely to be a regional SLAC, drawing students from the surrounding states. SLACs are more likely to be teaching focused (higher teaching load, less research) with an emphasis on pedagogy and high student contact. That said, it looks like their faculty are research active in physics, and it looks like they do send students to graduate school and offer relatively standard set of physics courses and major paths (https://millikin.edu/academics/cas/physics/areas-study/physics), with an emphasis on materials and engineering, such that it draws from the chemistry department (physical chem) as part of the course offerings.",

          "text": "Thanks a lot for your extremely detailed and helpful response! I agree with your observation that I am still quite unfamiliar with the US college landscape, but I am glad that people like you take the time to help me with my questions and concerns. Your response brings Millikin University into a more positive light than I had expected, which is quite interesting. I also had noticed the affilition with the church before, and that\u2018s actually a fact that makes be a bit uncertain. If you have any experience of how much the church really influences such a university and what the advantages/disadvantages are, I would appreciate your insights on that. I am not a religious person, but I am definitely not against it. I have seen institutions that explicitly ask for practising Christians in their job postings, but this doesn\u2018t seem to be the case for Millikin University, so I assume that it might be more moderate in terms of the religion?",

I am certainly okay with an affiliation with a religious institution, but I don\u2018t want to see too much influence on my own work or having people around me who try to convince me that I should join their church.
