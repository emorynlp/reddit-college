There are a lot of jobs at the bench\u2014in academia, as a technician, or in industry as a lower level scientist. The money is obviously way better in industry (I had friends making 60000-80000 a year). However, you hit a ceiling in research without some kind of advanced degree. In the end, most people end up going back.\n\nAs a side note, I feel like this would be true of geology and chemistry as well. You hit a ceiling with regards to pay and expertise without some kind of graduate degree.",

I'd been heavily focused on structural geology and petrology before then. \n\nAfter I graduated, I worked as a geologist for a mining company for a bit. Then I got a research assistant job in an environmental microbiology lab and I LOVED it. I could have stayed in either position, but I was depressed and hated my mining job (the pay was great), and was underpaid as a research assistant and job security was non-existent. \n\nSo I went to grad school.",
