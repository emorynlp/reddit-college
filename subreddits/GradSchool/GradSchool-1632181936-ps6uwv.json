This was my first big assignment in grad school and my professor gave me a 0% on it. I\u2019m meeting with her to discuss this but I just think it\u2019s ridiculous. I obviously stated a few things she had asked for and at least should have received partial credit. A little background about her is that everyone in my program says not to take her. Unfortunately, I had to but what she does is assign us assignments without going over them. I guess she expects us to know what to do and I would assume this is how grad school is but according to my other professors/classes, they sit down with us and actually go over the assignments. My professor automatically gets bothered if we ask a question or tell her we\u2019re confused, her answer is \u201cwell the information is there, i don\u2019t know what to tell you.\u201d My motivation went down after seeing my grade in her class. You\u2019d assume I don\u2019t understand the material but my tests are all A\u2019s and my discussions are getting As or Bs so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on. Any tips? I\u2019m a new graduate student and it\u2019s only my 4th week in the program.", "author": "nerfititi91", "created": 1632181936, "retrieved": 1632844115, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"hdsgarh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ps6uwv/i_got_a_0_out_of_30_on_my_research_critique/hdsgarh/", "text": "The score was to get your attention.
