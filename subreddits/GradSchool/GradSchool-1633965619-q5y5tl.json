  "title:": "No passion for any job, any degree",
  "text": "I\u2019ve always heard that I should work backwards and pick a degree that would work towards a particular career path that I want/enjoy, but the issue is that I literally do not like the idea of any job and by extension, any degree (a master\u2019s, which I have to do because Asian parents). \n\nI have basic hobbies - art and writing - but even these, I\u2019m not super passionate about, I only do them from time to time when I\u2019m hit with inspiration  and professionally, the idea of sitting and editing bits of work doesn\u2019t really excite me either. Just doing a quick search of these jobs also tells me that you apparently need a LOT of experience, which I don\u2019t have. I\u2019m not an outgoing/extroverted person, so automatically any job that requires being outside a lot, interacting with many people, management etc are out of the question. \n\nI have my bachelors degree in a science and absolutely nothing about science interests me. The idea of working in any science field - lab work, biotech, health policy etc - is really unappealing to me. As bad as I\u2019m making myself seem, it gets worse lol, I also severely dislike practical work which is why areas especially in lab work and engineering really put me off. \n\nChoosing my masters degree has been a pain because I genuinely do not know which path to take. A biotech job might be more smooth sailing (and I have the correct qualifications for it) but the idea of going into anything biotech related is horrible. Being the closest thing to a hobby that I have, I could do a masters in English, but then that would probably just end in academia, editing, journalism or unemployment.\n\nUPDATE: damn I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get so much advice and support, thank you so much to everyone! I\u2019ve had a look through all of your replies and I think I\u2019m going to have to find some way of postponing my masters. It really isn\u2019t worth the money or time right now. Still there\u2019s the struggle of whether or not it really matters if I did or didn\u2019t do the degree if the end result is the same: job that I hate. I\u2019m not going to try and find a job that I love (quite frankly don\u2019t think that exists) but I guess if it pays for my lifestyle, then whatever - although that goes back to doing my masters, because then I can probably get a better paid job as well.",

              "text": "If it helps, I'm full East Asian and my middle sister pursued a journalism career. My parents were not about it at first but she's doing just fine for herself and they eventually changed their minds. It took her a few years to get out on her own, but she's now financially independent, runs her own media company, and loves what she researches and writes about. The first \\~5 years she primarily freelanced. \n\nWhen she started, she was amazed that anyone even cared about the things she wrote, lol. Her writing was decent but has definitely improved over time (it's a skill, which means it can be practiced and improved upon). Maybe you'll decide it's not the right fit for you but the only way to guarantee failure is to not try :)\n\nRe: the master's, could you choose something practical that can apply to any path you might try in the future?",

There's no shame in having a job that pays the bills while you build your writing career, but also be wary of both the financial and mental/emotional/physical costs of getting a master of science degree. I am a first-year and absolutely would not recommend it to someone who isn't already passionate about the field.",

      "text": "To be honest with you, if this is where you are at right now I think it would be a bad idea to go to graduate school. Not only would you be taking the place of someone who actually wants to be there, but it doesn't sound like it would help you in the long run since you don't know what you want to do, and there's a chance you'd end up burning out and failing anyway. \n\nA master's degree in any field is no cakewalk, and a master's in a STEM field would be an absolute nightmare for someone who actually hates the field. \n\nI think you're ruling yourself out from too many opportunities. Being an introvert doesn't mean that you can't do jobs that require interpersonal interaction. If you go to graduate school, you may be *required* to teach if you want funding. Unless there is an RA position lined up for you, many departments allocate funded positions based on need/availability so if you don't want a TA position, then you have to fund yourself. As an introvert myself, teaching classes was a really important development period for me and I ended up enjoying the experience. If you had asked me if I wanted to teach before I started my program, I would have said \"hell no\". \n\nIf you are going to rule yourself out of career opportunities because you're introverted, then I'm not sure how bright your long term career prospects will be anyway. Unless you want to be a chemist in a state drug lab performing repetitive tasks by yourself for 8-10 hours a day, collaboration is a huge part of both academia and industry. \n\nA Master's in English won't get you into academia. You could teach high school or, like you said, work as an editor, but you'd need a PhD to go into academia and the job market for English PhD's is *extremely* competitive.",

I agree, if it were up to me I would probably give myself a gap year or something to figure things out, but I actually can\u2019t go up against my parents lest disownment lol.\n\nI actually forgot to mention that I actually have a secured space on a masters degree (in STEM, as you said will be a nightmare) but I have a short space of time where I can drop out and choose something else. I\u2019m now stuck between dropping an objectively good degree in a decent university which might get me a decently paid job that I absolutely hate, for an off chance that next year I MIGHT get accepted for a masters in another unrelated field that I will probably like a little more but that will also get me into a job that I will likely hate. So a bit of a stalemate. \n\nLuckily, I\u2019m able to fund my studies through loans and personal savings, I have had teachings jobs before and I hated them - probably because I\u2019m naturally so quiet and non-assertive my kids weren\u2019t disciplined at all lol. \n\nI would say I\u2019m open to try anything, but I\u2019m so stuck on my path for education because deep down I\u2019m just passionate about anything.....",

At the very least, grad school might be an opportunity to try to assert some degree of independence and show you some potential paths for your future. I also don't think you have to be *passionate* about anything to have a good career. A job can just be a job to fund your lifestyle. If you like to travel, it's fine to just have a job to pay for your travels. People should work to live, not live to work, imo. \n\nIf it means you will be disowned, then obviously you should make sure that you are stable and secure even if it means going to a grad program if you don't want to. When you do go, I would think about contacting their mental health services and scheduling an appointment to talk to someone because they deal with much more than mental illness. They can maybe point you to some strategies or resources that can help you find something you are interested in. Career services and your adviser would be good for that too. \n\nAlso maybe keep an eye out for nontraditional uses of whatever degree you choose. I had a professor who has a PhD in microbiology, but they ended up hating working in a lab and became a science writer. They're involved in science education and talking about science, without actually having to *do* science. Career paths like that exist all over the place.",

You'll discover after school that the concept of people excitedly engaging in their work everyday is kind of a farse. Hopefully you get a career that doesn't make you UNHAPPY, but no shame in having a career that is just okay and you enjoy the money, the people you work with and are happy to have hobbies. In the realm of jobs with reasonably high pay and reasonable work life balance, become a project or product manager. If your aspirations are a bit more creative, become a UI or UX designer.\n\nCollege does a big thing about making it seem like your major or career goal is WHO you are, and thats not true.

I think you should consider that the decisions you are making right now will impact you for at least the next few years - like others have said, why dig yourself into a deep hole of hating your work? I started my PhD stoked for science and the grind of academia was still something I ended up hating to the point of depression/not even wanting to wake up because of my responsibilities. Grad school is a long grind, you don't have to love what you do but you still have to motivate yourself enough to do it.\n\nThat being said, I didn't enjoy my academic experience but now that I am out and have a job I must say that getting compensated for the work you do can do wonders for what you find tolerable or even enjoyable. If you're passionate about writing and art, do your best to figure out what the job market looks like with your degree and weigh out the pros/cons of the field to see if the pay/stability is within your tolerances. You're an adult now and I understand the pressure of an overbearing asian family culture but it's your life - not your parents. So make sure that you are moving towards a direction that will ultimately make you happy.\n\nAlternatively, get a secure job and do your passion projects on the side for more stability\n\n\\[edit\\] One last thing, your job does not have to define you as a person. It does not have to be your passion, you just need to tolerate/enjoy it enough to finish the work assigned to you long term. Academia isn't necessarily what industry will be like and you can do what you like outside of work. I was super anxious about the transition between academia and industry because of this assumption but thankfully my current job has way better work/life balance and clear cut expectations than academia ever had. I literally get my work done during business hours, turn my laptop off and don't even think about work tasks unless I'm getting paid. This is a huge mental shift from the 24/7 grind of academia.",

I'm working a job that I never would have picked at the end of undergrad, and I like it enough to do it. I got a PhD in chemistry and changed my mind like 3 times over what career I thought I wanted. Pick a degree with job options. Increasingly you don't need to have a degree to write or draw for money...!!   \n\n- Go see a therapist. A lot of this \"I don't have a passion for anything\" may have to do with your repressed/depressed mind rejecting a lot of things. Especially with an overbearing asian family. Prioritize finding a therapist that understands asian cultural values. Do it in secret if you have to, since your parents probably don't support therapy.   \n\n- try to be brave and claim some independence. I know, it seems impossible. My parents were also the controlling asian type. I clashed with them over the race of my boyfriend and it was reeaaally rough for a few years - I barely contacted them and every time we got together it was yelling and tears. But we're in a much better place, and they actually see me as an independent person now! It's hard, but \"cut and run\" is perhaps the only way to gain the freedom to mature yourself.   \n\nBest of luck!",

If that doesn\u2019t work, think smaller. If you had to do something, whether it be education or work and you HAD to pick something to occupy your time right now (because you do), what would it be? There must be *something*. Do you want to get fit, learn another language, improve your abilities in xyz? Don\u2019t put any pressure on yourself to figure it all out right now because it\u2019s impossible. You\u2019re in a stage of your life where you\u2019re probably still figuring out who you are (lots of students with overbearing parental expectations experience this) and what you care about. Take this time to explore and work towards some small goals. You\u2019ll figure the rest out in time.",

There are so many career paths it\u2019s crazy. What I\u2019m doing now is working as a cna taking a break from school. I think for me I\u2019m going to go into a path of medicine.

There are many of us working this dream job who are completely miserable and wish we could have stuck with something that didn't follow us home, so don't rule out having an easy going job just for the sake of finding that one true passion. \n\nAs for your situation, I know the pressure of Asian parents intimately, and can only say that they ultimately want what is best for you, even if they're wrong about what that looks like. Mine changed their tiger mom tune when they saw their friends' kids dropping dead from stress and suicide. It won't be easy (and I know how it sounds) but try to talk to your parents - explain that their expectations are making you unhappy, that you need some time and space to really figure out what you want to do. Stick to it long enough and they will reconsider once they see how serious you are about your feelings. \n\nI would also try to find a therapist so that they can help you figure this out together. TBH you sound like you may have depression, but even if you don't it's still helpful to have someone to talk things through with.",
