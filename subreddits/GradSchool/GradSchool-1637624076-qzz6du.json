  "text": "All of my pens ran out of ink around the same time from the many notes I've been taking and I didn't want to have to keep buying plastic cartridges, so I bought a fountain pen and a bottle of ink. This is seriously the best grad school supply decision I have ever made and I can't believe this didn't occur to me during undergrad so wanted to share with you all.",

No pressure writing went a long way to eliminate hand cramps.\n\nSerious caveat: don't spend serious money on any pen that will leave your home. Buy the less expensive good workhorse pends like the Pilot Metro, Lamy Safari, Jinhao, and Twisbi Eco other sub $40usd pens. Things will happen and you will lose pens, you don't want to lose a $100+ usd fancy pen or have nib damage. My phd pressie to me is a Conklin full abalone stub nib. It doesn't leave my desk.\n\nInk is cheap. Piston fillers have huge reservoirs. Have lots of fun with it.",
