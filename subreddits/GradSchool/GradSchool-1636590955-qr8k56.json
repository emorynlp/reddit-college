  "text": "I am doing a MA in Spanish, and I have to take my written comp next march. I have barely studied, despite my professors telling me I should start studying a year in advance. A lot has been due to my general disinterest in this program and my desire to study library science (I got a job at my local public library and I absolutely love it, I genuinely feel like this is what I am supposed to do). But I committed to an internship this past summer and finished that, I am too far in to quit now (they also gave me a nice scholarship for my academic ability). basically, what I am asking is do I have enough time to study for the written exam and pass by next march?",

And how much time you have to invest.",
