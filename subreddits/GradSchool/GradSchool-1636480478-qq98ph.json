  "text": "I am a stay-at-home mother of 3 young children. I will graduate from Oregon State University (online), earning a B.S. in Psychology in December 2022 (3.8 GPA). My major program early in my college career (from 2009/2010) was Biology/pre-medicine, so I have taken some in-person life sciences lecture and lab courses as well.\n\nI don't have access to childcare (professional or family) because of finances, lack of availability in my (rural) area, and the pandemic. I won't be able to go to a brick and mortar school for at least 5 years until my youngest is in Kindergarten.\n\nI want to complete a Master's degree (hopefully with a thesis -- they do exist) online that will enable me to find a remote (hopefully non-customer service and non-sales) job making at least $20 per hour after graduation, with the hopes that I can eventually either continue into a brick-and-mortar PhD program or get hired into a non-remote job in the field I graduated in. I have experience with working remotely from home with children as a customer service agent and a medical scribe. It's difficult, but it won't be a problem.\n\nI would (after earning a Bachelor's degree, and finally being able to work somewhere in person) like to earn a minimum of $60,000 per year -- hopefully more, though. \n\nI have considered a master's degree in Computer Science, but I took a intro to CS course last year (earned a B) and worked with Java -- I didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not sure I could do that for the rest of my life.\n\nI am thinking about an online M.S. in Industrial-Organizational Psychology with a thesis. There are three well-respected programs that offer this that I have in mind. I have seen some entry level remote human resources jobs that I could hopefully do from home while my kids are young. I'm hoping that maybe the degree combined with the experience would help me to secure an entry level in-person job in HR and eventually move up to being a HR manager.\n\nDoes anyone have any other ideas for an online master's degree program that would enable me to hopefully qualify for a remote job making at least $20/hour until I can return to the in-person workforce, and hopefully later be able to either enter a terminal degree program or find a higher paying in-person job/career that offers some kind of advancement opportunities?\n\nI know this is a long shot. But maybe there are others that have been in a similar situation.\n\nThanks!",

Most classes are recorded, so I was able to watch them either late, after bedtime, or early in the morning before anyone else got up. That really helped me work around family schedule.",

But I know Missouri S&T has a good reputation among those who have heard of it, (it used to be known as University of Missouri-Rolla, or UMR) and I would think a master's would help in the search for a job that both is remote and pays enough.",
