  "text": "I\u2019ve been working for ~3 years now in a data related field , have a BS in computer science and minor in economics. I want to get into an  MS applied statistics program, where I can get more exposure to ML, experimental design, and specifically causal inference , goal would be to relate these in an interdisciplinary manner\u2026ideally affordable so not only US programs\u2026.\nor an Econ PHD since it\u2019d also be funded, but I doubt I\u2019d be remotely qualified since I have no research experience. \n\nMy math pre reqs are pretty weak - I think I meet the bare minimum for applied statistics programs ( I only have up to Calc3&linear algebra , no advanced statistics courses - mostly stats exposure through Econ courses).\n\nAny programs that may fit this?",
