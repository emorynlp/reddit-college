  "title:": "No one knows what anyone else in the lab is doing! What to do about a chaotic lab?",
  "text": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m really looking for some advice here. As the title says, no one in my lab knows what anyone else is doing at any time. I\u2019m constantly walking into the lab and running into people I didn\u2019t even know were in the lab and who are working on projects that I didn\u2019t even know the lab was involved in. We don\u2019t have a lab manager and sometimes equipment that I need to use is just gone from the lab because someone else I didn\u2019t even know was in the lab took it for their fieldwork. My PI has a post doc who none of the rest of us have ever met and most of the lab doesn\u2019t know about. We do have regular lab meetings but the PI just doesn\u2019t do a good job of managing the lab. She\u2019s a recent hire and she hasn\u2019t done field or lab work herself in years and she keeps taking on more and more projects, especially undergraduate projects. There\u2019s no hierarchy to the lab everyone just reports to her directly. She\u2019s pretty overwhelmed and she knows what everyone is doing but she just doesn\u2019t have the time or appreciate the value of making sure everyone in the lab knows wtf is going on. She\u2019s also generally bad at making sure people are in the loop when they need to be- such as leaving me off of important email chains and realizing later that she forgot to add me. She apologizes and then adds me and tries to catch me up but it\u2019s been a recurring problem. I\u2019m exhausted from being constantly blindsided and while I know my PI is a wonderful, well intentioned person, I don\u2019t think she realizes that this constant wtf is detrimental to lab culture. Myself and the other grad students want to step up and take on more lab management duties and try to do SOMETHING to make the lab more cohesive and we want to go to the PI and suggest a plan for how to organize the lab better and make sure everyone is on the same page but we don\u2019t even know where to start or what to suggest. Any advice? Have you ever dealt with a lab environment like this?",

My institution uses Google so we just default to that. There\u2019s also a document on Drive that contains summaries of the research everyone is working on. We have a very efficient lab manager who has decades of experience thankfully but I think you could easily implement the calendar and shared drive stuff for more organization!",

Be polite, but you can probably phrase it as a way for you guys to facilitate communication between fellow grad students.  \n\nBuild a group listserv or slack to start a medium for communication.  A channel for each \"project\".  Add members into it.  Maybe have a channel for lab equipment rentals (kind of like a sign-out/sign-in sheet).  etc. \n\nFirst thing any professor here does is put everyone on a lab Slack/Teams/Productivity Chat system.",

For lab instruction, add every to a calendar so people can book the instrument when they need to use it, if they plan to take the instrument aways you will know. It\u2019s a bit of work at the beginning, to set it up and get people used to using it, but I think it\u2019s worth the effort.My PI is always so busy with everything , but she has a alarm and notifications on her phone for everything that she needs to do, maybe this will help your PI to remember to update/ inform people.",
