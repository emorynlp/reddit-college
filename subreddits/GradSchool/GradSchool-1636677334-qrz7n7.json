  "text": "I need some help in getting my thoughts straight and would love everyone\u2019s opinions/ideas! \n\nLast year, I graduated with a BA in psychology. About halfway through it, I fell in love with creative writing (specially nonfiction), and took a buttload of writing courses. I even worked my way up to taking an MFA level memoir course. Even though my GPA for writing courses averaged out to a 3.8, I ended my psych degree with a cumulative GPA of 2.83. \n\nI applied to that same university\u2019s MFA in Creative Writing program for nonfiction. Didn\u2019t get in, and was informed by faculty that although my writing samples were strong, it was ultimately my low GPA that led to my rejection. \n\nSo now, I\u2019m looking for masters programs that will accept GPA\u2019s below a 3.0, so I can rewrite my undergraduate one entirely. I found two programs that spark my interest, but are in two different disciplines. This is what I\u2019m conflicted on: \n\nDo I earn a MA in English, allowing me to teach the subject at the K-12 level, and pursue an MFA in creative writing after? \n\nOR \n\nDo I earn a MA in Creative Writing, allowing me to \u2018prepare\u2019 for an MFA later?\n\nBasically, all the MFA programs I desire require a 3.0 or higher, and the ones that don\u2019t seem a little shitty. I need to rewrite my GPA somehow get into one I want. \n\nIt seems like the MA in English is safer job-wise, but the MA in Creative Writing sounds more interesting and fun. \n\nSorry this was long.. I\u2019m curious to hear what option you would pick and why!",
