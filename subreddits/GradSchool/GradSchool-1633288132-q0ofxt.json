  "text": "I want to do a master's degree, but I don't want to make an ill-informed decision. I need data. I wanna see how different degrees (in different countries, too) affect employability, happiness, salary, everything, really! \n\nI'm lucky enough to know what I like. But I feel like I don't know what's going on in the world, and which of the things that I like is my best shot at living ~ my best life ~ \n\nCan ye spare any data? I'm out on the streets here, both arms outstretched, both palms turned skyward. Give me anything!\n\nThank you for your time <3",

      "text": "Don\u2019t forget that statistics in the end are just averages, and are probably in this case extremely skewed by selection bias. Degrees are (IMO) mostly signaling devices besides law, medicine and hard skills related subjects like CS maybe. So just picking what interests you the most and excelling will help you more. \n\nI don\u2019t think there exist any dataset that provides you with all the info you want in one go. Starting point could be google scholar and looking up which datasets they used to evaluate degrees (besides the research itself ofc).",

I'm not gonna make a decision solely based on statistics, but I think it'll help differentiate between programs that are too close to call otherwise (and rule out ones with very low employment potential and stuff like that) \n\nI'll see what I can find on Google Scholar.
