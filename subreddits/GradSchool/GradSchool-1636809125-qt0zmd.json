  "title:": "Ways to manage private, undergrad student loans while in grad school? Otherwise I will have to drop out.",
  "text": "I just finished my MA and am applying to some top schools for my PhD. I think I will get in based on the feedback I am getting. I love my academic career and my CV ain't bad. The one thing holding me back is money. I have a lot of student loan debt (poor decisions of a stupid young guy signing shit without knowing the consequences. We're talking 6 figures). \n\nI am at a point where I cannot wait another 4 or 5 years to seriously start paying them off. They are private loans, with interest accruing. Even putting them in forbearance is just growing the loans and I can't be sure I can get academic job that will pay them off in a reasonable time. I need to start thinking about a family, better credit score, more available income. \n\nIs there any advice or ideas about how to boost my grad school income to around $45K? It's possible to a get fellowship/stipend from some of these schools around $30K-$35K. I do blood plasma donation for another $5k and I am just starting ubereats for a few more K, but I probably don't have time for much more. In order to pay these loans off in a reasonable time (I am determined to pay them off in 5 years give or take with a low standard of living/not doing long term, minimum payments). I am still at least $5k short. Is it possible to negotiate more teaching or research work or higher stipend when/if offers come in? Adjuncting elsewhere in addition to your current assignment? Some sort of fellowships or grants outside the uni offers I can apply to? Any better sidehustles that aren't going to totally swamp me with work? I haven't looked into undergrad tutoring, for instance, if the pay is worth it.\n\nI hate that this is a dollars and cents problem, but it is. Otherwise I leave academia and maybe come back later in life. That's not the worst thing in the world by any stretch, in fact there may be advantages to this, especially if my real-world career experience lines up with my research, but I guess a part of me is afraid if I leave now I won't be marketable in the future/my shot will be blown. Again, not the worst thing that could happen, but I hate to blow a shot if there are options for getting through this.",

You should not be doubling down on your debt to get a PhD.\n\nSecond, what does the academic job market look like for your field of study?\n\nI can't say that I'm really recommending this, but here's what I did:  My PhD program was fully funded, and I was still able to take out a small amount of government-subsidized student loans (at the time I think it was $15K/year) for \"living expenses.\"  I used the $15K to pay off my private loans, so at least my loans didn't grow while I spent 5 years getting my PhD.\n\nIt worked out fine for me, because the job market for my field was very healthy (business), and I was able to pay off all of my loans within a few years of graduating.  But be careful, because YMMV depending on your job market!!\n\nEdited to add:  We don't recommend that our PhD students have other jobs, because the PhD program is supposed to be a full-time job.  That said, I was able to work some small gig jobs during my PhD for extra cash.  Uber seems like a reasonable option.",

          "text": "Yeah I second this. I put my undergrad loans on hold while I finished my MS (mechanical engineering in a (mostly) fully funded research program), and with the interest stoppage due to COVID, my loans haven't really moved since I finished undergrad. In hindsight, I was living with my parents and I didn't really have any expenses; I \\*should've\\* payed down the interest my loans accrued while I was in undergrad. Good and proper budgeting really could've saved me some money there.\n\nOn the second point, I would agree that working a second job while trying to finish a PhD is generally not a great idea. There are a couple ways to make it work, for example, working at a national laboratory or for the federal government (who pays your federal loans down while you work for them, you just owe time) will partially solve your problems. It will, however, extend the time it takes for you to finish by a significant amount, since you're technically a part time student. You're also going to have to pick research that your job agrees with, a direct application of your research into a project your employer is working on. On the other hand, I've had friends who bartend or wait tables while they're in school and it's generally miserable. These are also friends who aren't doing research, so they don't have that extra 20-40 hr/wk commitment on top of their studies. IMO the key is to pace yourself or get a job that is so outside your research hours, it's a non-issue. That being said, there are limits on how much you can work for another company per week (varies from state-to-state), not sure about being self-employed though.",

Four months before the PhD, I was offered a relatively high paying job (\\~78k) doing some data science/analytics at the Feds. \n\nDespite being more attracted to the PhD project, the thought of alleviating some stress in my life cause by financials, and having an income of literally 2x + that I would get from my PhD, I just couldn't refuse. I told the prof I needed to differ my PhD for a year for financial reasons, and told myself I would reassess in the meantime.\n\nTurns out, the job is pretty great, and opened up a ton of doors for other jobs internally that I think will lead me to something just as interesting as my PhD would have down the road while actually earning a liveable income. I still feel I will eventually go back to the PhD - it is something really want to accomplish for my own sake - but I must admit that alleviating some financial stress has been nice.",

You might pay off your debt in 5 years and graduate a year or two later, but what will be the quality of your work? You'll have learned fundamental concepts less deeply or written fewer papers or spent less time networking than you would have otherwise. \n\nThese things affect the jobs you get in academia in a complicated long-term way, meaning you'll be at a disadvantage not just for your first postdoc but for whatever permanent job you apply for in 5-10 years. The phrase \"it's a marathon, not a sprint\" applies not just to the PhD, but to the academic career itself, because doing great at that career requires building an extensive network of ideas and collaborations over many years.\n\nWhy do you feel the need to pay it all off in 5 years? Why not 7 or 10 years? 5 years is awesome in principle, but that goal is not compatible with doing a PhD simultaneously and having a strong academic career afterwards. Your \"take a break before PhD\" idea actually sounds like a great compromise.",

This would help for how much accumulates as well as more of your payment going to principle. Ultimately, this is a trade off of higher Ed. Just so you know, those on time payments and forbearance periods are reported as on time payments which help your credit score. Not all is negative from it. As an aside, before you end up in a different financial ruin- your car insurance probably has a clause about not covering gig work and you would be screwed if you were in a wreck and got hurt or severely hurt someone else. I have seen posts over on r/personalfinance of it happening. \nOtherwise, is part time school an option, roommates, dropping expenses, tutoring, editing papers, selling some product from a hobby? 5k seems like you could get there to finish up but you do need to consider finances.

I still have federal loans left but I put all of my extra income towards private loans and I don\u2019t owe Sallie Mae shit anymore, which feels really good. I\u2019m currently debating whether it\u2019s worth going back to finish the PhD now that I have a stable full-time job doing data visualization which I enjoy, though I find the corporate world really suffocating. I truly miss engaging with the research I love but I also know too much about academia and it\u2019s hard to say whether the pros are worth the cons at this point (especially considering being 30, married, and wanting to start a family). I do wonder how things might have been different for me if I wasn\u2019t so stressed financially during the PhD (you\u2019ll be scraping by no matter what but it\u2019s a different ball game watching loans at 11% interest ballooning when you\u2019re trying to just get by)\u2026 I think being debt-free would have made a huge difference for my academic ambitions. So my advice is that if you can get a decent paying job and pay off your highest interest loans before starting, you\u2019ll feel a lot better during a really challenging time.",

Here's a breakdown of how much I make from each job:\n\n\\- Scholarship: $17k per year\n\n\\- Teaching: $8k per year (works out to an average of 6 hours a week, 30 weeks of the year)\n\n\\- Research: $15,600 (paid $30 hourly\u2014I work on average 10 hours a week)\n\n\\- Editing: $20,592 (paid $22 hourly\u2014I work on average 18 hours a week)\n\nThis works out to $61,000 before taxes, but my scholarship does not count as taxable income so that helps some.\n\nObviously, some jobs/my school work is busier at some times rather than others, so some weeks I might work 0 hours at one job and more at another. I'm very fortunate that, apart from teaching, my work is very flexible.\n\nOn average, I work about 55 hours a week\u2014about 35 hours of real work and 20 hours for my PhD. I would be able to work less if my higher-paying jobs gave me more hours, but unfortunately, as a student, the university is only allowed to employ me a certain amount.\n\nMy decision came down to either (a) financially hurting myself for 4-6 years, or (b) working really hard for 4-6 years to meet the life goals, both financial and familial, outside of my education.\n\nI'm very lucky that I have a very supportive partner who takes on more of the cooking and cleaning while I work so much, so that takes off a lot of the pressure. I'm hoping to increase my scholarship amount by applying to other awards so that I can work a bit less, but have not had luck as of yet.",

You typically need a PhD to get a tenure track position.\n\nOr were you thinking of just getting a job outside of academia?",

      "text": "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a better answer than what the other commenters have said thus far for how to improve your current financial situation, but I do have a big picture question. Is there a reason why you\u2019re not considering industry jobs? I can understand for people in the humanities it might not be feasible to find an industry job that pays better and has more job security than academia, but even for those in the social sciences, industry can offer a lot of job security (and even with a masters only) and often times are higher paying than academic jobs.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting you don\u2019t do a doctorate at all, as that\u2019s obviously up to you, but I\u2019m wondering if maybe:\n\n1) doing a doctorate that only leads to academic jobs (which are scarce) isn\u2019t the best decision financially and especially if you\u2019re planning to work a lot of part time jobs during it (CV suffers, and going on academic job market is already hard even with stellar CV).\n2) doing a doctorate right now is not the best idea. If your major is in a field where there is industry application, then maybe it would be better overall to first work in industry and then go do a doctorate. And again, you\u2019ll be surprised but even non \u201cSTEM\u201d fields like the social sciences are now expanding industry jobs.\n\nNormally my opinion is that it\u2019s easier to finish your degrees as soon as possible. However, my take is different here because of the fact that you\u2019re suggesting you\u2019d need multiple jobs during the PhD to make it work, and that it seems like you\u2019re either only able to or are only interested in pursuing academic jobs afterwards, which is a horrible market unfortunately. But again, I don\u2019t want to discourage you from pursuing a doctorate if that\u2019s what you really want, especially since there are historical diversity and equity issues around low SES individuals being underrepresented in higher education. Who would\u2019ve guessed that when stipends are paid in pennies, the only people who can afford to take a 5 years off from working are people with generational wealth.",
