      "text": "Hmm I haven't heard of a program like that before. From personal experience, the two institutions I went to didn't allow me or any student I knew personally to to take two consecutive semesters off. I did depend on financial aid and scholarships though so that may be part of their reasoning. \n\nI know most places offer night classes for Master's programs or completely online programs. Or you could possibly be a part time student (where you only take one or two classes).",
