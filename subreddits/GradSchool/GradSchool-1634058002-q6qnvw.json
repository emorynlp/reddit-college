  "text": "I was just hoping to get some thoughts from people on here or maybe even people that have experienced similar situations. I finished undergrad in Spring 2020 and struggled to find a job for a while which led to me researching graduate opportunities. I now work for an insurance company but the idea of grad school has stuck with me since then. Specifically I had been looking at the University of Sydney or the University of Western Australia for their Master of Commerce programs and was just trying to get some thoughts from people other than myself and family. What is it like for an American to go to Australia for grad school? Is the age going to be a factor? Sorry I\u2019m not more specific, just really trying to get some thoughts.",

I'm older than most of my classmates, but it didn't prevent me from being accepted, making friends, or anything like that (and it's also not always a huge age difference).",

      "text": "I started my master's at 24 and it was great! Most grad students in the US are older if you mix the master's and PhD students and you become part of a close knit group compared to undergrad. I decided to do a PhD in Australia about 2 years ago and just now am actually planning the move now that the country's opening up post-pandemic. Pretty excited, same language but slightly different culture. I'm almost 29 now and sometimes think about my age, but usually what I find myself saying is \"If not now, when?\".",

Of course you have to decide for yourself if this is the route you want to take, but one good thing about my degree is the cache it carries just because i got it overseas. In the US getting a graduate degree overseas will often stand out to future employers. At least mine has.",
