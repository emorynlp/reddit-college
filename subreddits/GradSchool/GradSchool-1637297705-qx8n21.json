  "text": "I\u2019m constantly running into issues where I\u2019m unsure what is expected.\n\nI\u2019ve discussed with my tutor and he\u2019s very understanding and helpful, but is there somewhere that just gives you the most clear advice.\n\nLike if you want to say \u201cthis theory is\u2026 it will be used to juxstapose the following opinions. here are some things that are good about the theory, but here are some things that are bad.\u201d\n\ni\u2019ll read one place that when you write a list of things like supporting it that you need to give some more detail on each thing. Whereas I\u2019m only listing them because i read you need to give the supporting and objections of a theory. But then i read or am marked when I turn in a paper for not giving more detail.\n\nThats just one example. Is there any website that just gives it to you straight?\n\nThank you",

There are many different ways to write the same thing well, and therefore no website can give you a straightforward way to do it exactly right all the time.\n\nThe best way to learn how to write better is to 1) read a lot, especially things that are like the thing you are trying to write and 2) write a lot, and get feedback on that writing from people who know how to do it.",
