Both a blessing and a curse. \n\nFor awards this competitive, remember this:\n\nThe only thing you can ensure is that your application meets all requirements and makes it into the 'pretty good' applicant pile. From there it is really up to chance, and what your reviewers had for breakfast that morning.\n\nRemember, you're a good scientist and a good and interesting person even if you don't roll double sixes in the GRFP process.",

If the story is there, you are a good fit, and you idea is excellent a few typos won\u2019t sink you. \n\nNext time read everything outloud before you submit. \n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself. I once emailed a Nobel laureate and called him by another name. He responded to the rest of my email because it was written to him. He figured it must be a typo.\n\nAnyway, point is. This happens. It\u2019s embarrassing at the time but literally no one will remember. \n\nPeople will remember attempts. Attempts are all that matters\u2026. ;)",
