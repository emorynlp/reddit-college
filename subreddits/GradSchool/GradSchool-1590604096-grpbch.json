Ya'll are superhuman.  \n\nWe may not know where the future will lead- as with many of my fellow professional grad students I am paying for my degree out of pocket.  It's scary to not know how the economy will be at the end of all this, and if the degree will pay-off in the job market of the future.  It's hard to focus with everything falling apart around us.

I didn't know I needed to hear this as much as I did until I read it.\n\nI think part of me is still struggling with the dual role of being both a student and a full-time worker. I'm not sure about the rest of you, but I think I've had a hard time \"letting go\" of my professional-role self which is expected to be an adult, make decisions, and know what's happening so that my student self can ask for what it needs and just... not know things sometimes. Especially in a pandemic. Sometimes my student self just wants to say \"I don't know what's happening and I'm kind of overwhelmed right now.\" So I'm going to make a promise to myself to better at saying, \"hey - I'm not doing so great today. Maybe tomorrow I will be, but I just need a minute right now.\" And letting that be okay. \n\nTo everyone else out there - I hope you allow yourself to be extra kind and gentle with yourself right now.
