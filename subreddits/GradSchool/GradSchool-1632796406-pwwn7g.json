My non-gradschool friends talking about their \u201cnormal\u201d lives was a huge comfort to me during my PhD. It reminded me that I was in a highly abnormal environment, and that sometimes when things sucked it was because gradschool sucked not because I sucked.\n\nI still remember an incident where I walked into the office of an important person (a department head) who had gone several days without answering an email that was extremely time-sensitive/critical for me. The department head then made a phonecall and chewed out my advisor for \u201cletting\u201d me do that, and my advisor then made it clear to me that I had really stepped in it and should never, ever do something like that again. Within the alternative reality of grad school, I had clearly sinned and committed a major faux pas and should be quite ashamed of myself and worried about further repercussions.\n\nBut according to a close friend who skipped college entirely and has a successful career, my department head needed to \u201cget the fuck over herself\u201d. Another non-gradschool friend made some funny comments about territorial urine-marking. These friends helped me remember that it was my environment that was crazy, not me.\n\nThis may be harder for you to do, since as an undergrad you are also a student and may not have much non-academic life experience yet. But you can still help your friend \u201czoom out\u201d and remember what matters. In most fields, what the professor they TA for thinks about their teaching will not have the teeniest, tiniest bit of an impact on their future. At all. In the long run, what they eat for breakfast matters more, because it could impact their future risk of heart disease. And then there\u2019s all the really big stuff that makes someone a good person leading a good life and has absolutely nothing to do with grad school\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t belittle their concerns, but do ask questions about how the things they\u2019re stressed out over affect their future. In the process of answering that, they may realize that some things aren\u2019t as important as they thought they were. In general, I think \u201casking questions that might help your friend clarify situations and see them in a different light\u201d might be a good way for you to help them when they\u2019re struggling with something you don\u2019t have any experience with.\n\nAnd do remind them of \u201cthe big stuff\u201d sometimes - \u201cYou are my friend because (list some things that make them a good and likeable person), not because you get your conference abstracts in on time.\u201d Also, just empathy and listening can help.
