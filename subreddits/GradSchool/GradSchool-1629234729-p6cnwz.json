  "title:": "Existential dread of starting a PhD in the current world climate",
  "text": "Saw a post a little while ago expressing a sort of existential dread about entering grad school with the current state/climate of the world and I share that worry. I\u2019m normally an optimist about this kind of stuff, but the state of things (climate change, etc.) continues to get worse and I\u2019m really getting concerned whether spending 5-10 years on a PhD is worth it at this point. I definitely have a lean towards industry as of now, if that has an influence in this.\n\nI\u2019m entering grad school with the intention of getting a PhD (epidemiology/biostats), but now I\u2019m wondering if I should just get my Master\u2019s and move on with my life/career considering there\u2019s a very real possibility we could be in chaos in a few years.\n\nI love my research to death and would love to see it through. I don\u2019t necessarily feel that time would be wasted, but I wonder if it\u2019s \u201cworth\u201d getting a PhD with things going how they are right now.",

      "text": "I'm an epidemiologist who graduated with my MPH 5 years ago and am now starting my doctorate next month. There's no rush. Take your time and make deliberate choices for yourself. Live your life according to what works for you, it's not a race to see who can go from diapers to tenure the fastest.\n\nIdeally you can make decisions which work out both in the medium and long term. For me, I know I'll both enjoy being a graduate student for a few years AND enjoy having that added credential on my resume moving forward. It's not like I'm slogging through the unbearable muck of a PhD hoping that there's light at the end of the tunnel. And that has a lot to do with the fact that I waited until the time was right.\n\nBesides, there are so many opportunities in our field outside of academia which you can pursue with a masters degree, and if you want to go back for a PhD after a couple years you'll have a solid foundation.\n\nWhen it comes to the sense of imminent social and ecological collapse, there's a degree to which people of every generation have felt that existential dread. I'm not saying we're in no worse shape now than in the past, but I don't think it's anything around which to make life plans (unless maybe you're considering purchasing a home in Arizona)",

The earth goes through cycles of catastrophic weather. Our footprint doesn't help the situation, and we obviously need to improve as a species, but it's nothing to have crippling anxiety about.\n\nYou should be more worried about another world war, or worse, a nuclear war. Even that is... Questionable, but I have some anxiety about the whole US-china/Russia relations recent years.\n\nOr something that's more likely to happen, a deadly illness that wipes out a large amount of the population.

      "text": "So I graduated last year with my BS in chemistry, and have been working as a temp lab tech for the last 12 months in Industry. I knew I wanted to go to Grad School, but never was sure about it, and when the pandemic hit, it made it unbearable to even think about it. Taking a break between my undergrad and grad school, and especially in and industry relevent to my field, helped tremendously. I work with adhesives so I am learning a bit about polymer chemistry, which I already had some experience with from undergrad research. But it gave me time to think about what matters to me and what I want to do. I started to question whether I want to be in industry, or transition to academia or do government research. But most importantly, I decided I wanted a PhD, and I wanted to pursue nanotechnology and/or catalysis in renewable energy and battery applications. I miss doing research, and with some insight of having worked in industry for a year, I know that I want to also have job security when I'm done with school for good. You can manage with an MS just fine, but if you like research enough to commit for ~5 years, go for the PhD. Getting yourself financially stable and successful will be a matter of education, work experience and networking, just do what you feel will best get you to where you want to be. But I also recommend taking a year off to work in industry, and then decide, but don't take a gap period without having a plan. You could decide you only want an MS and you can have the company help you pay it off. Or you could go back to get a PhD and apply for a stipend. But the climate crisis won't get as bad as you probably think in the next 5 years. You have time, so why not get prepared for when the shit hits the fan? Especially with covid, and other future diseases, a degree in your desired field would be very advantageous. Ask yourself what is important to you, and what would help you best to reach your goal",

      "text": "I found this a really good article on thinking about the future:\n\nhttps://www.ecosophia.net/the-future-is-a-landscape/\n\nThe author is overall more pessimistic than me, actually one of the most well known \u201ccollapse\u201d thinkers out there. But the main thing I hope to express here is the frame of mind of thinking about the future in a more complicated way.\n\nThe tone is basically set in this first paragraph: \n\n> I\u2019ve been reflecting of late about the way that our habitual expectations about change blind us to the way that change actually happens. One of the most important of these is the frankly weird but pervasive notion that the future is a single place, where only one kind of thing happens. It\u2019s always \u201cThe Future,\u201d very much in the singular.  To most people these days, of course, \u201cThe Future\u201d is either progress as usual or it\u2019s instant apocalypse, and I\u2019ve discussed that before, but let\u2019s look at the broader pattern for a moment.\n\nI think it identifies something in the collective consciousness about this moment in time. Many people feel we\u2019re heading to some apocalyptic event. \n\nWhen really it will be more complex, both spatially and temporally, with different rates going on for different phenomena and in different places.\n\nAnother thing for me is the book I\u2019m currently reading: *The Ministry for the Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson. \n\nThe book starts out right inside one of the most horrible climate catastrophies you can imagine. I won\u2019t spoil anything. But out of that it goes on to tell the story of how, over many decades and in the midst of frequent disasters and crises, a lot of different small bits of action add up and collectively help bend our course towards a much better path. \n\nKind of helped give me some inspiration for how we can act in the face of all this, even when it\u2019s in response to terrible disasters. And how we might actually bend the arc towards good over time if smart and passionate people keep at it. \n\nUltimately I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s best for you to choose one or the other for your own career and life. I\u2019ve struggled with similar questions. I\u2019m also in a field that\u2019s potentially very helpful for our problems, but not sure if pursuing my own PhD in it is the right move. (Leaning towards yes recently, and actually parts of this thread are also nudging me in that direction).\n\nAll I can say is to recommend living your life in a way that could optimally help if things do go well. (And remember, \u201cwell\u201d can coexist with disasters, even really bad ones. The future isn\u2019t a single place it\u2019s a landscape).",

      "text": "I share your worry in the general, but I think you might have a slightly unrealistic concept of what climate collapse is going to look like. I think this is a common issue among well-meaning people. We all know that \"climate apocalypse\" is coming, but most people don't actually have a good sense of what that really means.\n\nWe're not going to wake up one morning (at least most of us won't) and find that our entire world order has been upended. Instead, this is a slow (but accelerating) process of transformation in lots of different ways, which has already begun.\n\nThe sorts of things that you should be preparing for now are: persistent economic recession; war, famine, disease, and mass migration that begin in parts of the world that are already poorer, hotter, more arid, more densely populated, less politically stable, more vulnerable to natural disasters (think: South Asia, Africa, etc.) and spread over the course of years; and a *gradual* shift in the habitable regions of the world away from the equator and towards the poles. We're talking 10, 20, 50 years for this stuff.\n\nIn my opinion, having a Ph.D. in a key field (epidemiology for sure counts) is going to be a *protective* factor in the coming world. People with in-demand skills are going to be more important then than they are now. An example: what happens if you and your family live somewhere that becomes unsuitable and you need to emigrate? Having a Ph.D. makes that easier, you're a better candidate to would-be host countries. This is already true and it will only become more true.\n\nIn other words, if you believe a Ph.D. is right for you *but* you think the impending climate crisis should change that, I would say to you that in fact I believe the opposite is true. On the other hand, if you aren't actually sure that you want a Ph.D. then you shouldn't do it, for all the common mundane reasons having nothing to do with climate change.",

                  "text": "Cheers. I'll try to put something coherent together tomorrow. u/JamesTiberiusChirp u/Cheesed111 u/UmiNotsuki\n\nThis recent article might be a good primer: the current ways the IPCC has been modeling economic impacts is very problematic (though, I'm not sure if they've changed their approach for the forthcoming AR6.)\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/14747731.2020.1807856\n\nA couple of brief, somewhat disjointed thoughts that add up to something:\nThe economy is a complex adaptive system that is reliant on stable supply chains. It also tends to maximize efficiency. There tends to be a tradeoff between efficiency and resiliency in complex systems (there's a good citation I can't remember here.) Efficient systems tend to be fragile to external stimuli once they reach their limit to absorb that impact. A key question is how well the economy can absorb climate-induced shocks (e.g. famine, ports going down from extreme weather, other disruptions...) And how quickly it can adapt around those.\n\nA common saying is \"the US / world / region X is three meals away from anarchy\" obviously famine is incredibly disruptive to a functioning economy. Food isn't the only type of shortage, though - look at what's happened with microchips through this pandemic. How long will it take the US to spin up more semiconductor plants, as Biden has called for? Quick enough to avoid supply shortages? It can take 5-10 years to build up infrastructure, factories, specific capabilities - is there enough \"slack\" in the system to hold out that long?\n\nBecause we've globalized so much of our supply chains, we're much less resilient than back when countries were fairly isolated. Extreme weather events, sea level rise, desertification in local areas will have second order effects everywhere. It might take a bit to notice them - has society really noticed that Ford doesn't have any F150s at dealerships right now? There are a ton waiting for computers. \n\nBecause most developed countries are pivoting towards the service industry, supply chain problems that occur way upstream (eg mining) won't be immediately visible. It'll take a while for us to feel the effects of upstream shortages or issues. We also have some, but not much, capacity to adapt to shortages (e.g. keep using old graphics cards for now.)\n\nCheck out these reports to help understand the scope of potential material shortages:\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/112/20/6295\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/112/14/4257\n\nNeoclassical economics teaches that in the case of shortages, people will find substitutes for the thing that's hard to come by. If you run out of apples, use a pear or an orange. This is great for when substitutes exist. What happens, though, when substitutes don't exist? Is there an alternative to semiconductors? (What happens if the world's main semiconductor facility in Taiwan goes down? How would the economy seriously function if we just couldn't buy computers or servers any more? Eventual collapse.) For our economy to function, we're pretty reliant on specific materials that come from all over the world. To get those materials, economies all over the world need to be largely functioning. Climate change might not allow for that.\n\nOne way to view the economy is a dude spinning plates on sticks. (Hopefully you've seen that visual) - with stable supply chains, when things are steady-state, there's plenty of time and energy to keep all the plates spinning. Each new climate impact causes a plate to wobble, though. Each region that's hit will cause a plate to wobble. It might take a while for us to notice if it's far away, but it'll affect the globalized economy. Wobbling, but not falling, plates are largely okay. We can keep going as we are for a time, but the climate-induced impacts will keep stacking up. Pretty soon, the plates will start falling, which implies a general collapse.\n\nTo get a sense of the globalized economy, check out:\nhttps://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/\n\nSo this line of thought only really focused on supply chains (which is big), but did not consider the direct effects of climate change on an economy (e.g. how big a hit to GDP.) that's another huge topic for another day, I think. Hopefully this post prompts some new ideas or ways to think through impacts, though.\n\nEdit: another potentially big issue is the interplay between environmental impacts and energy intensity of energy sources. Fossil fuels are used because of how much energy we get out of them. This can be calculated as energy-return-on-investment... how much energy do you get relative to how much it takes to produce. The EROI of fossil fuels is much higher than renewables. By switching to renewables, is there enough surplus energy to fuel the economy? (Probably yes, but possibly at a reduced level that will have economic impacts.) So the transition to renewables will have second order effects that may appear nonlinearly..",

                          "text": ">What are your thoughts on this? \n\nIs there land available for sale near your family? ;P\n\nI think we have plenty of time before shit really hits the fan (2-3 decades, hopefully?) And if governments start taking meaningful action prompted by AR6, then there's a decent chance we'll avoid worst-case scenarios. Assigning probabilities of events, timelines, and specific impacts is pure speculation, though, so I'd like to avoid any real estimates.\n\nThere is plenty of time to do a PhD, see the world, and use academia to contribute to society. Go for it. Because of your well positioned family, you'll always have some sort of anchor to a resilient community. That alone provides you with adaptation strategies that just aren't available for a lot of people.\n\nI'd caution going too far down the prepper rabbit hole... A lot of doomsdayers use their pessimistic bias to see the immediate end of everything. I've gone to conferences with a ton of pessimistic voices, and they often let their emotions and biases dictate their \"scientific\" models. (Most models on both the optimistic (e.g. DICE) and pessimistic (e.g. limits to growth) sides are filled with tenuous assumptions...)\n\nCommunity is certainly important, as is building resiliency, but I'd encourage you to continue with your education if that's definitely what you'd like to do. That is, if you definitely would want to do a PhD if climate change didn't exist, just go for it! Who knows what future trajectory we'll all end up on. There's a chance we'll all adapt just fine with minimal effort.\n\nRegarding \"seeing the world,\" I'm assuming you mean international flights and touring other countries. I think there's an ethical question hidden in there... Flights pollute a lot. Is that pollution justifiable for a tourist trip? Only you can really answer that, and you could also pay to offset your carbon. My family, though, has decided to limit flights as much as possible (along with other ecological decisions. We're starting to figure out permaculture and homesteading, at least as much as we can where we live.)\n\nHope this helps. Let me know if you'd like me to expand more on anything specifically.",

      "text": "I'm just starting a PhD in the geosciences/paleoclimatology, and this is something I have thought about too much recently as well. Through listening to The Daily, Pod Save America, How to Save a Planet, Ologies (check these out!) and reading news articles, I've been exposed to a hearty dose of climate stories and I have a few conclusions or mindsets that are helpful for me, although some days I am more worried than others.\n\nHere's a conversation I have with myself to help me figure out the best choice for myself. I think to myself in regards to climate change, what would I be doing if I weren't in grad school. Would I buy a farm in the mountains and start a completely self-reliant lifestyle? I'm totally not trying to sound belittling because that actually does sound awesome (but a ton of work) and I am as environmentally conscious as I can be, but for me, I can't see that fulfilling me. Would I dedicate my life to becoming an activist? Again, for me personally and knowing how I operate, that's just something I can't see myself doing. Everyone should be engaged in activism as much as they can, but I know that if I stopped my PhD in light of these other choices, I don't think the work from these jobs would make me happy. \n\nI feel like I put myself in this scenario in my head where I'm like: \"Ok, so I can either start a self-sufficient farm and create some sort of security for myself in the long term or become a full on activist and fight with everything I've got, or I can get my PhD and just ignore Climate Change & activism.\" But I honestly think this is unfair & unhealthy way of looking at it. It's not black and white or mutually exclusive like this. There's no reason why you can't get your PhD **and** be engaged in outreach & activism organizations. I don't think it's helpful to say to ourselves \"you can only pick one of those choices\" because it's not that simple. Like even if I dropped out and decided to follow a career path that would give myself some extra security (start working sooner, becoming an off grid farmer), there's no way to even know if it would be enough. Would working a few extra years really matter in the end to protect myself from climate change? If food supply lines get disrupted (which they will to some degree at some point), what do I do then? The way I see it, I am betting on scientists, activists, and humanity prevailing (not an easy bet) which means continuing with grad school and getting involved in activism & outreach as much as I can. Because if I did stop my goal, and climate change ends up being *somewhat* manageable throughout my lifetime, I think I will have a ton of regrets. Personally I would rather be hopefully optimistic working towards my PhD and being engaged in activism, promoting civic engagement, etc. along the way than leaving as sort of a safety net. I wouldn't demean anyone for choosing that path, but I can't do it myself.\n\nTL;DR: My advice is to follow your goal/dream but be engaged with activism & outreach fighting climate change and promoting STEM as much as you can. There are LOTS of organizations in the geosciences for this, and I'm sure there are tons in most fields.",

          "text": "This is exactly how I feel myself, and you worded it very well. I think we can still follow our passions (such as pursuing a PhD in a field of our interest), but still make personal lifestyle changes or get involved in activism or outreach to prevent the worst of climate change.\n\nI've always debated and still wonder if I should've spend more time in activist roles, and I hugely appreciate everyone who is very vocal about climate change. I realized though that more than anything, I want to do research in grad school and possibly pursue a PhD. I can't imagine myself being happy in any other scenario. This is why I'm thinking of doing grad school research on an environmental or climate change related topic as a way of doing what I love and doing something to help our planet. When I'm doing something to help, it gives me hope and optimism rather than feeling depressed and watching the disaster unfold. I hope I contribute to preventing the worst of climate change through my scientific work, and educate people around me.\n\nClimate change is also a very multidisciplinary problem, and we need people of all backgrounds to work together and fight. Whether you're in an earth/environmental field or not, you can still contribute to fighting climate change through your work, educating yourself and others, making lifestyle changes, or getting involved in activism, among others!\n\nEdit: spelling",
