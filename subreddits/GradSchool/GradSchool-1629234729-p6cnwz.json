I knew I wanted to go to Grad School, but never was sure about it, and when the pandemic hit, it made it unbearable to even think about it. Taking a break between my undergrad and grad school, and especially in and industry relevent to my field, helped tremendously. I work with adhesives so I am learning a bit about polymer chemistry, which I already had some experience with from undergrad research. But it gave me time to think about what matters to me and what I want to do. I started to question whether I want to be in industry, or transition to academia or do government research. But most importantly, I decided I wanted a PhD, and I wanted to pursue nanotechnology and/or catalysis in renewable energy and battery applications. I miss doing research, and with some insight of having worked in industry for a year, I know that I want to also have job security when I'm done with school for good. You can manage with an MS just fine, but if you like research enough to commit for ~5 years, go for the PhD. Getting yourself financially stable and successful will be a matter of education, work experience and networking, just do what you feel will best get you to where you want to be. But I also recommend taking a year off to work in industry, and then decide, but don't take a gap period without having a plan. You could decide you only want an MS and you can have the company help you pay it off. Or you could go back to get a PhD and apply for a stipend.

But the main thing I hope to express here is the frame of mind of thinking about the future in a more complicated way.\n\nThe tone is basically set in this first paragraph: \n\n> I\u2019ve been reflecting of late about the way that our habitual expectations about change blind us to the way that change actually happens. One of the most important of these is the frankly weird but pervasive notion that the future is a single place, where only one kind of thing happens. It\u2019s always \u201cThe Future,\u201d very much in the singular.  To most people these days, of course, \u201cThe Future\u201d is either progress as usual or it\u2019s instant apocalypse, and I\u2019ve discussed that before, but let\u2019s look at the broader pattern for a moment.\n\nI think it identifies something in the collective consciousness about this moment in time. Many people feel we\u2019re heading to some apocalyptic event. \n\nWhen really it will be more complex, both spatially and temporally, with different rates going on for different phenomena and in different places.\n\nAnother thing for me is the book I\u2019m currently reading: *The Ministry for the Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson. \n\nThe book starts out right inside one of the most horrible climate catastrophies you can imagine. I won\u2019t spoil anything. But out of that it goes on to tell the story of how, over many decades and in the midst of frequent disasters and crises, a lot of different small bits of action add up and collectively help bend our course towards a much better path. \n\nKind of helped give me some inspiration for how we can act in the face of all this, even when it\u2019s in response to terrible disasters. And how we might actually bend the arc towards good over time if smart and passionate people keep at it. \n\nUltimately I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s best for you to choose one or the other for your own career and life. I\u2019ve struggled with similar questions. I\u2019m also in a field that\u2019s potentially very helpful for our problems, but not sure if pursuing my own PhD in it is the right move. (Leaning towards yes recently, and actually parts of this thread are also nudging me in that direction).\n\nAll I can say is to recommend living your life in a way that could optimally help if things do go well. (And remember, \u201cwell\u201d can coexist with disasters, even really bad ones.

I think this is a common issue among well-meaning people. We all know that \"climate apocalypse\" is coming, but most people don't actually have a good sense of what that really means.\n\nWe're not going to wake up one morning (at least most of us won't) and find that our entire world order has been upended. Instead, this is a slow (but accelerating) process of transformation in lots of different ways, which has already begun.\n\nThe sorts of things that you should be preparing for now are: persistent economic recession; war, famine, disease, and mass migration that begin in parts of the world that are already poorer, hotter, more arid, more densely populated, less politically stable, more vulnerable to natural disasters (think: South Asia, Africa, etc.) and spread over the course of years; and a *gradual* shift in the habitable regions of the world away from the equator and towards the poles. We're talking 10, 20, 50 years for this stuff.\n\nIn my opinion, having a Ph.D. in a key field (epidemiology for sure counts) is going to be a *protective* factor in the coming world. People with in-demand skills are going to be more important then than they are now. An example: what happens if you and your family live somewhere that becomes unsuitable and you need to emigrate? Having a Ph.D. makes that easier, you're a better candidate to would-be host countries. This is already true and it will only become more true.\n\nIn other words, if you believe a Ph.D. is right for you *but* you think the impending climate crisis should change that, I would say to you that in fact I believe the opposite is true. On the other hand, if you aren't actually sure that you want a Ph.D. then you shouldn't do it, for all the common mundane reasons having nothing to do with climate change.", "author": "UmiNotsuki", "created": 1629239433, "upvotes": 248}, "h9caa88": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p6cnwz/existential_dread_of_starting_a_phd_in_the/h9caa88/", "text": "I wouldn't start it if I were you.

Through listening to The Daily, Pod Save America, How to Save a Planet, Ologies (check these out!) and reading news articles, I've been exposed to a hearty dose of climate stories and I have a few conclusions or mindsets that are helpful for me, although some days I am more worried than others.\n\nHere's a conversation I have with myself to help me figure out the best choice for myself. I think to myself in regards to climate change, what would I be doing if I weren't in grad school. Would I buy a farm in the mountains and start a completely self-reliant lifestyle? I'm totally not trying to sound belittling because that actually does sound awesome (but a ton of work) and I am as environmentally conscious as I can be, but for me, I can't see that fulfilling me. Would I dedicate my life to becoming an activist? Again, for me personally and knowing how I operate, that's just something I can't see myself doing. Everyone should be engaged in activism as much as they can, but I know that if I stopped my PhD in light of these other choices, I don't think the work from these jobs would make me happy. \n\nI feel like I put myself in this scenario in my head where I'm like: \"Ok, so I can either start a self-sufficient farm and create some sort of security for myself in the long term or become a full on activist and fight with everything I've got, or I can get my PhD and just ignore Climate Change & activism.\" But I honestly think this is unfair & unhealthy way of looking at it. It's not black and white or mutually exclusive like this. There's no reason why you can't get your PhD **and** be engaged in outreach & activism organizations. I don't think it's helpful to say to ourselves \"you can only pick one of those choices\" because it's not that simple. Like even if I dropped out and decided to follow a career path that would give myself some extra security (start working sooner, becoming an off grid farmer), there's no way to even know if it would be enough. Would working a few extra years really matter in the end to protect myself from climate change? If food supply lines get disrupted (which they will to some degree at some point), what do I do then? The way I see it, I am betting on scientists, activists, and humanity prevailing (not an easy bet) which means continuing with grad school and getting involved in activism & outreach as much as I can. Because if I did stop my goal, and climate change ends up being *somewhat* manageable throughout my lifetime, I think I will have a ton of regrets. Personally I would rather be hopefully optimistic working towards my PhD and being engaged in activism, promoting civic engagement, etc. along the way than leaving as sort of a safety net. I wouldn't demean anyone for choosing that path, but I can't do it myself.\n\nTL;DR: My advice is to follow your goal/dream but be engaged with activism & outreach fighting climate change and promoting STEM as much as you can.
