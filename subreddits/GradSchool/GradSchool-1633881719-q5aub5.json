  "text": "I know this is a lot of info, so skip to the end if you don\u2019t want to read it.\n\nThis was supposed to be my last quarter before I intended to graduate in December. However, I got a full-time job offer that I couldn\u2019t pass up. My new plan was to take 2 classes this term, funded by financial aid, and finish my final class in the winter, which I would have to pay out of pocket. But I\u2019m struggling mentally. \n\nFirst, I want to say that this is my dream job, the reason I went to grad school. It\u2019s an amazing twist of fate that I was hired by this company. But it requires a lot of responsibility and I\u2019m experiencing major imposter syndrome. \n\nI had my second day on Thursday, which was mostly me syncing up all my calendars across the three work computers I have \ud83e\udd74. I\u2019m also taking care of my partner who just had surgery the day before I started, tending to him, cooking meals, and walking our dog. My sleep schedule went from 8+ hrs to 6.5 or less. I\u2019m drinking 2x or more caffeine. Plus doing school work. This all happened the day before my first day. These might not seem like big changes to some of you, but I\u2019m not good at handling stress.\n\nOn Thursday night, after my second day of work, I had an extreme migraine with vertigo unlike anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. I almost went to the hospital because it was so scary. I had to ask for PTO and called in sick on my third day.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if it would be best for my heath and my success at this job to withdraw from my capstone, pay back the financial aid, and just take one class a term. I mean I think I know the answer, but it\u2019s a financially taxing one and I want to make sure it\u2019s the right decision. Or should I wait to see if things get better?\n\nTLDR I\u2019m trying to finish school (taking 2 classes / quarter) while working a full-time job that I\u2019m terrified to fail at. The external stressors along with the pressure I\u2019m putting on myself are  making me physically ill. Should I withdraw from a course or stick it out and weather the initial panic storm?",

      "text": "Speak to a mental health professional and your PI/graduate co-ordinator, and see if you can work out a plan that will let you finish up with less stress. There is no nobility or glamour in suffering or 'toughing it out'. Graduate school in some ways is like the marines or special ops training, they teach you how to survive on the bare minimum, persevere through impossible odds, but they dont teach you to ask for help, or that asking for help is ok. Take a leave of absence if you can. It's odds on that the company is interested in you because of your record so far, and they would probably understand if you had to take some time off.",
