My new quarter just began for a couple of days, but I already felt overwhelmed and miserable, having a very hard transition from zoom university to real one. I\u2019m a home person. I went out once to twice a month in average in the past one and half years. Most of the time, I was very disciplined and productive when I was alone. I also worked out everyday, of course at home. I still kept connected with people, having audio or video chats with my friends and family members. So I didn\u2019t feel lonely at all. Everything looked perfect, except for the pandemic. But my school reopens this quarter. I felt like I spent tons of time commuting from home to school (actually only 50-60mins each way), walking between different buildings, in line with a lot of students to wait for a cup of coffee or buy my lunch. I\u2019m the person having to sleep 10 hours everyday. Now I neither  gain enough sleep not feel productive. It seems my disciplined and peaceful life already far away from me. What should I do?", "author": "newmehu", "created": 1632693105, "retrieved": 1632843953, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"heg7c3a": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw379o/having_a_hard_transition_from_zoom_university_to/heg7c3a/", "text": "Try to bundle certain activities together so you don\u2019t have to spend as much time commuting (i.e. make coffee at home before school, do work in places next to your classes, meal prep on weekends). Find something you can do on the weekends that makes you feel productive but is not explicitly schoolwork, like reading a blog in your field of study, club activities, chores, or cooking. \n\nAlso most important, find a place on campus or at home that you will feel productive in and only do work there. This way, whenever you go there, you will feel compelled to do work. This can be a busy local coffee shop or the quietest part of your campus library. Whatever it is, don\u2019t do anything other than work or you will start the slippery slope of non-productiveness in your \u201cproductive\u201d space.", "author": "applepiefortea", "created": 1632730603, "upvotes": 3}, "heelxae": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw379o/having_a_hard_transition_from_zoom_university_to/heelxae/", "text": "Be gentle with yourself and give yourself time to adjust.
