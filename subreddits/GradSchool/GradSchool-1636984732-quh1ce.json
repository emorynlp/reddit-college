  "text": "I fucked up. I've had a horrible year mental health-wise which has led to some terrible thesis-related decisions. I hid myself and haven't been productive at all, and now I have exactly one month to write my MS thesis. I haven't started at all. I feel like a failure on every level. \n\nI'm having horrible anxiety with panic attacks just thinking about how much work I need to do. \n\nHow fucked am I? Is a month enough time? My first draft is due before Thanksgiving.",

Some people thought this sounded more intimidating, but my thesis managed to be 25 pages of solid, highly relevant content as opposed to some of the 75+ page theses I saw that had pretty all-encompassing lit reviews, where students then struggled to truncate it down for submission to a publication. It can be the decision you and your committee make as to whether you actually go ahead and publish in a journal, but I think that would be a good place to start.",

      "text": "Hey OP, I am in a super similar situation as you (Phd to masters). My thesis is also due in exactly one month \ud83d\ude05 I don\u2019t know if this helps but I was panicking about my thesis and managed to write an entire chapter in 2.5 weeks and I even took days off (40 pages). My first chapter I wrote in a month (70 pages), but I was doing 75% lab work and 25% thesis. Honestly, if I could do it, I believe anyone can. \n\nI don\u2019t know what your situation is, but I just wanted to say that switching  to a masters from a PhD does not make you a failure as you said in your previous comments. It is a hard decision to make, and takes a lot of strength to decide that the program is not something you actually ended up wanting to do. Personally, I\u2019ve been pretty open about my journey to switching to a masters with my peers and I would say 99% of them are supportive and genuinely happy for me. Switching to a masters is not something that is commonly spoken about (other than in jokes/frustration among fellow graduate students), but in all honesty it happens way more frequently than we think and it is nothing to be ashamed of. Getting a masters degree is a huge accomplishment, and you should be proud of what you have achieved to get you to this point. \n\nAlso, look at the bright side, you are finished with your degree in one month. And then you can take a well deserved break/ open the next chapter for your life. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

Everyone I've seen finish with an MSc vs PhD I admired for being able to make a good decision for themselves. \n\nAs for how to finish, I did almost my entire PhD thesis in 2 months. Stop thinking about the end product and focus on just writing a single sentence. Start with the easy parts you're golden on like methods sections. You know that part, you did the things. Then results because again, it's just fact, no interpretation. Then I like writing my research statement and writing my intro around that. Since again, it isn't open to interpretation, it's all facts you need to just find from other peoples work. Once you get going I promise it will become easier. Just be easier on yourself, it's not like everyone else wrote their thesis in a breeze either. It takes time. You got this.",

Also, I suggest you to speak with your supervisor on your current progress in a week time, hopefully he/she will give some advice or offer for an extension. \n\nEat healthy and drink plenty of water and get enough sleep. If you are in the stage of struggling with insomnia, speak to a counselor, there will be one at your university/institution. \n\nLastly, yes this is a MS thesis, but your creditability and life should not be determined by it. Your life has way more than this. Wish you well and all the best!",
