  "text": "I haven't talked to my thesis committee in months because of mental health issues, I've had an email for them in my drafts for months. But I basically just fell off the planet and never sent it. I haven't been able to make any progress on my research or writing. I'm very behind on everything and feel like everything around me is moving on without me. It finally got to the point where I had to see my doctor about it and get on some medication.\nI finally sent the email.\nAddress your mental health y'all. The sooner you can admit it to yourself, the sooner you can admit it to others and move forward. Your committee members can be surprisingly understanding.",

I take a low dose SSRI and it hasn't changed who I am, just helped me put useful coping strategies into practice. Before starting meds, I knew logically that exercise, meditation, and talking to friends and family would help my anxiety, but had a really hard time actually doing those things. \n\nMeds affect everyone differently, but the psychiatrist and your doctor should always start you out on a low dose and circle back ever couple weeks to check up on your progress. I had to take clonazepam occasionally to address panic attacks in the first couple weeks of getting my anxiety treated while the SSRI slowly kicked in, and just knowing I had something to help when my anxiety got really bad was super reassuring, so that might be an option if you aren't interested in considering a long term daily medication. Best of luck!!! I was super apprehensive about starting an SSRI but it's helped me massively.",

I think (and this is just me theorizing) that the SSRI gives me enough serotonin in my brain to allow me to be more optimistic/realistic instead of pessimistic and fight-or-flight-y at a baseline level. That helps me not get into worrying loops in the first place. I also had nausea, muscle tension, digestive issues, and challenges with breathing evenly all associated with my anxiety, which have all gotten WAY better or disappeared entirely with an SSRI. \n\nOne of the big things my therapist helped me with was working on was confronting my fears driving my anxiety. An example: I was afraid of whether my rotation PI approved/disapproved of my work and communication, but simultaneously knew his lab and mentorship approach probably wasn't the best fit for my needs. \n\nShe encouraged me to schedule a meeting with him to get some constructive criticism since she helped me realize that even if he said the worst thing I could imagine, it was ok since I probably didn't want to join his lab anyways! He ended up not having anything negative to say even when I asked directly for constructive criticism on those issues, just expressed his frustration that rotations are so short, and gave me encouragement and general advice on excelling in my PhD.",

I did send an email saying I had to stop to take care of family for COVID and the response was \"ok.\" When I tried to get back on track and was overwhelmed and trying to figure it out, I connected with my co-chairs and they basically shrugged their shoulders.  After this I fell off the emotional deep end, while I wanted to do stuff, I just couldn't for a few months.  I am now reconnecting with my work, talking with a therapist about general life stuff, and made a pact to check in with a friend weekly.",
