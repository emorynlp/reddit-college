My story is about Jerry.\n\nJerry wanted to make 10X PBS. I pointed him, for the third time, towards our binder of lab recipes. I reminded him that we were low on NaCl, of all things, because he hadn\u2019t ordered it after dropping the container weeks ago. I suggested making half of the recipe. Half a liter, instead of a liter.\n\n*Half a liter?*\n\nHe always repeated my instructions in question form.\n\nI nodded. He didn\u2019t move. I gave him time to think.\n\n*What size beaker should I use?* \n\nHe wasn\u2019t the most independent student.\n\n*One that fits half a liter, at least.*\n\nHe nodded and mulled things over in front of the glassware cabinet, eventually settling on a 2L beaker. \n\nI watched to make sure he used the right tap before turning back to my dissection.\n\n*What do I add next?*\n\nI kept my eyes on the microscope. \n\n*It\u2019s in the recipe book.*\n\nI heard him flipping through the pages and then I heard him mutter. \n\n*80 grams.*\n\nI looked up. \n\n*Jerry.* \n\nHe looked at me.\n\n*Half a liter, instead of a liter.*\n\nHe looked at the beaker.\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nHe looked at the beaker.\n\n*But I already put the water in.*\n\nI turned back to my dissection.\n\n*It\u2019s just water, Jerry.*\n\nHe didn\u2019t move. \n\n*It\u2019s just water, Jerry. Pour half of it out, pour it all out and start over, whatever you want.*\n\nHe didn\u2019t move. I waited for him to repeat my instructions in question form.\n\n*Pour it out?*\n\nI looked up from my dissection and nodded. \n\nHE POURED IT OUT RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR, GUYS.\n\nTo give credit where credit isn\u2019t really due, he did realize something was wrong the moment the first drop hit the ground.

I leave her to finish the rest of her device and measure it, and go on my way.\n\nA few days later, the postdoc in charge of Irene\u2019s project messages me. \u201cAre you sure Irene\u2019s wafer had metal on it?\u201d I said I was sure. Apparently, all the metal had disappeared off of Irene\u2019s wafer overnight. And oh yeah, Irene only thought to mention this fact to the postdoc after she had already finished fabricating and measuring the device (which had no back contacts and was basically missing a major component to make it functional).\n\nWe grilled Irene: \u201care you sure you cleaned the wafer properly? Did you store it properly?\u201d Etc. Irene is adamant she did everything correctly, and the metal just fell off and disappeared overnight.\n\nI mention this issue to a senior research associate in my lab. Research associate tells me, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Either the deposition never happened, or she has the wrong wafer.\u201d \n\nI tell Irene to check her samples again. It turns out, Irene had 2 silicon wafers stored in similar-looking sample holders, one that she deposited the metal on, and one that she didn\u2019t.

He lied on his CV and said he knew how to do stuff that he didn\u2019t know how to do, so the PI, who had clinical duties, relied on us to teach him.\n\nFirst off, the first thing that annoyed everyone was that he was a follower of the pickup artist/redpill crew that rely on \u201cnegging\u201d women in order to gain their attention (this was like 10 years ago). So that was happening. \n\nHe was doing his first ever western blot, and whoever showed him how to use the developer thought it was okay to leave him in there alone. He comes back with an empty film.\n\n \u201cIt didn\u2019t work\u201d.  He says as he returns to our area.\n\nWe start inspecting the blot, and it was completely blank. \n\n\u201cAlright, I guess we need to do a longer exposure.

We enter, to find the machine beeping and alarming and the blots are nowhere to be found.\n\nWe ended up needing to call someone to repair the machine, as he had apparently fed not only the blots, the cardboard, but also NINE films that never came out the other end. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. After proving utter incompetence in the lab, this guy is relegated to outlining a review for the PI. Halfway through the summer, he decides he\u2019s done doing that and decides that he\u2019s just going to spend the summer going clubbing and studying for his MCAT. So he would come in at 11 every morning, hungover, and study from noon until 3, and then leave. His PI stopped interacting with him once it became clear he was no longer doing any relevant work.\n\nOn his last week, he marches into the PI\u2019s office with an outline not of the review, but of a letter of recommendation that he would like her to write. She said to him that on no uncertain terms would she be writing a letter of recommendation for him. Not only did he lie on his resume, but he did absolutely zero lab work during the months of July and August. He stormed out muttering something about \u201ca waste of a summer with no letter\u201d and the PI thought that was the last she would hear of him.\n\nNope.\n\nThe following week she received an email, basically saying now that she\u2019s had time to \u201ccool off\u201d would she consider doing the right thing and wrote the letter. The PI reaffirmed her firm position, and he proceeded to threaten her with violence. He knew where she lived, as she had had a lab dinner at the start of the summer, and she also lived alone. So she was rightfully terrified and reported him to the police.

He would often sneak in and start working with his headphones in so no one would to talk to him, so there were times when he\u2019d go 45 minutes before we realized he was high as hell.\n\nHe would do repetitive tasks like grind up tissue for us. One day, he was grinding mouse aortas with a mechanical homogenizer, it looked kind of like a tiny immersion blender. Well, after he was done and handed off the \u201cground\u201d tissue, I took a look at the homogenizer to realize there were like 3 or 4 WHOLE aortas tangled up in the teeth. \n\nI point this out to him.

I've had PIs ask me what's wrong with their rats (they didn't know rats have giant balls), why did their mice breed (they put male and female mice together), I've seen them put about 30 mice in one very small cage to euthanize them (HUGE NO), and I've seen cases where the PI just doesn't understand you have to euthanize the mice at a certain point. I think that was the worst, they had some study on cancer and they'd just let the tumors take over, push out through the skin, get infected, chewed on by roommates, etc. The PI thought they were allowed to just let the mice die on their own and would get mad when the in house veterinarian euthanized them. \n\nSo more of a \"those people are doctors??\"", "author": "FurretsOotersMinks", "created": 1613486434, "upvotes": 176}, "gnnd7n2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ll30p3/whats_your_favorite_hes_a_doctor_now_story/gnnd7n2/", "text": "r/storiesaboutkevin", "author": "flybluejayfly", "created": 1613485620, "upvotes": 13}, "gnnagj9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ll30p3/whats_your_favorite_hes_a_doctor_now_story/gnnagj9/", "text": "In a lab I was doing a summer internship at the time as an undergrad, we got 2 new rotation students (both eventually ended up joining the lab). A postdoc was showing both of them how to pour agar plates...how to heat up the agar, when to add the antibiotics, etc. \n\n\nWhere the mess happened was when the postdoc instructed them to pour the agar into the petri dishes, after having laid them all out on the bench. I guess he forgot to mention he should take the lids off to pour, because they started pouring with all the lids on and it turned into a huge, jello-ey mess all over his bench. The postdoc just pinched the bridge of his nose is disbelief and told them to clean it up as he was walking away. Both of those grad students were able to get good papers out and graduate, so I suppose they learned their lesson!\n\n\nI have a lot of stories about another guy who was a grad student when I was an undergrad in a different lab. He made a ton of rather silly/borderline angering mistakes, but the oddest thing was that if I was doing tissue culture in well-plates or dishes, he would always marvel that it is a wonder that the cells could stay sterile in that environment. Making the comment once is okay I guess, but it was almost like he was newly marveled by the fact every. single. time. he saw me with a stack of plates.", "author": "bowdownpeasants", "created": 1613484120, "upvotes": 78}, "gnn9y4m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ll30p3/whats_your_favorite_hes_a_doctor_now_story/gnn9y4m/", "text": "If Ralph Wiggum got a PhD...", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1613483834, "upvotes": 30}, "gnn9tr0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ll30p3/whats_your_favorite_hes_a_doctor_now_story/gnn9tr0/", "text": "We had a medic intercalate into lab, back when we were heavily into tissue culture.
