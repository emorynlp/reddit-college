  "text": "I know this is a common experience but I am burning out months before graduation and actually getting into my field. I am in my internship for my masters in counseling (marriage and family) and I am crumbling. \n\nI feel like a failure. I am overwhelmed, drowning, I can\u2019t keep up and in the last week my client load nearly doubled. How on earth am I going to do this when I have a professional case load? How am I supposed to handle some of the most complicated cases with little to no experience? There are so many \u201chow\u201d questions I could ask. But I really need someone to listen. As I feel my friends are flourishing while I\u2019m drowning and my supervisor rebuffs me stating \u201cthis goes beyond our relationship and sounds like this is something you should talk with your therapist about\u201d\n\nHow did you do it? How did you survive it all?",

      "text": "Another therapist intern here. We will have more autonomy when we start working real jobs. I plan on going into private practice so I can create my own schedule and take time off when I need. I just recently started taking Fridays off my internship for the sake of my mental health. I was working 45 hour weeks in order to meet the 600 hour requirement. I was and still am recovering from feeling burnt out. I have my own therapist and also blow off steam with others in my cohort. Do what you need to, to get by. My director always says \"Somehow, it all gets done.\" It's been my mantra through school.\n\nEdit to say: We also will be under supervision when we graduate, so we will have people there to still support us and walk us through cases. Make sure you find a supervisor that matches your energy, it will make all the difference.",

              "text": "It sounds less like a rebuff and more of a statement of fact where the supervisor is trying to establish necessary boundaries. Your supervisor cannot be your counselor. \n\nSo they can advise on issues *within* your internship. But they cannot help you with major crises you are experiencing in your life which might be affecting your job performance. And it sounds like your problems are a result of those crises.",

      "text": "Sounds like you need to reframe your perspective. You're on internship, which means you're still training. You aren't *supposed* to have all the answers. You aren't *supposed* to fix all the problems. You are supposed to show up for clients and try your best, the end. \n\nRemember that your role as a therapist is NOT to be the problem solver, but the support and guidance for clients to come to their own solution. When you get pulled into their whirlwind with the belief that you must solve it, you lose sight of your therapeutic focus. You can model for clients how to talk about their whirlwind of problems without getting sucked in or overwhelmed by it. Focus on the client's reaction to talking about it in the moment. Remind clients and yourself that this is a long and collaborative process which *should* require more effort on the client's part than the therapist's. It won't be \"solved\" now or next week or probably even months from now. Maybe there *is no solution*, but rather growth and progress in a healthier direction.\n\n> How am I supposed to handle some of the most complicated cases with little to no experience?\n\nYou're getting that experience *now*, that's the purpose of the internship. Remind yourself of that: **the purpose of this internship is to gain experience in complicated cases**. Gaining experience *is the goal*. If you're sitting with those complicated clients and trying your best, *you're accomplishing your goal*. Meet with supervisors after to discuss the case and gain guidance. Maybe review some literature or treatment manuals on the topic (if it's a specific topic). \n\n> As I feel my friends are flourishing \n\nRemind yourself that we don't often see the struggles that others experience; they are very likely experiencing similar distress and you just don't see it. They may even look at you and think you're the one flourishing. This is an emotion-based thought, stemming from your anxiety and fear of inadequacy. Emotion-based thoughts often diverge from reality.",
