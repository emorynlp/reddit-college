  "text": "Hey all-\n\n1) No one in my family is in STEM/academia, \n2) I dislike my MS PI (so he doesn't even know I have a paper coming out), \n3) my non-academic friends don't understand\nand, \n4) my fellow graduate cohort are super judgey and always try to \"one-up\" you \n\nSo I don't really have anyone to share this great news with so I thought I would put it out into the void of reddit and also share that there are still good things about 2020\n\nAs shitty as this year has been, I just found out that my first ever manuscript, with myself as primary author, and it being research from undergraduate work, has officially been accepted!! Just have to wait for the proofs!\n\nAs much as a miserable, depressed state I've been in since starting my MS, there can still be a little ray of happiness from time to time!\n\nKeep forging ahead all!\n\n\n\nEdit: just came back to say that each and everyone one of you that are commenting are absolute gems and that I can't thank you enough I am in happy tears \ud83d\ude2d \u2665\n\n\nAgain, thank you all \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d you have made the rest of my year so cheerful and bright \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f",

I know being isolated at a time like this must be very hard (both physically by being at home and \"culturally\" isolated by your inner circle not congratulating you on the paper) . My parents experienced a similar scenario when they were young, but I can tell you for sure the reaction to your next papers will be better. When they published their first papers, my parents went through all 1-4, but things gradually changed:\n\n1. As time went on, my parents became research-STEM role models for the rest of the family, so most young kids in the family started gravitating toward STEM. Now we share and discuss papers on the family chat. Older family members now have to keep up with us, you may well be the reason a small kid in the family gets their Ph.D. in 20 years XD\n2. My undergrad PI's had a very narrow area of expertise, so when my first paper was published in another field, they didn't know nor cared about it. For my Ph.D. I know it's important to have a P.I. who works in a wider area. A good P.I. should celebrate papers like a good coach recognizes his/her team's wins, my parents usually take their grad students to a restaurant to celebrate major publications.\n3. My parents and I have reached a dorkiness level where we have tons of friends from Academia, but very few non-academic friends (my mom's soccer-mom friends and my dad's football buddies are all STEM graduates). Being an adult now, I am making an effort to have some non-stem friends so I can break out of my \"STEM bubble\".\n4. I have been in these environments, but I promise there will be other places in the future where people will congratulate you, read your papers, and provide meaningful insight and connections.\n\nI know that the most we can do right now in most countries to celebrate is to have takeout and a couple of beers at home. But things will get better!",
