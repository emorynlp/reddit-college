  "text": "I (26) am seriously considering enlisting in the military full time as an officer? \n\nI'm having a hard time getting hired for anything after being depressed and unemployed for 2 years and I'm just done. I can sometimes get temp data entry jobs but that's all. I can't even get a job as a server/barista. I'd like to go back to school for something practical and/or move out but I'm worried I'm going to be stuck either hating what I do or not being able to get anything I can handle (I found data entry excruciatingly boring).\n\nI don't want another 3  years to go buy and instead of finishing my contract and getting out I'm stuck being the same loser living at home.",

So I wasn't in person and it wasn't as intimidating.\n\nDespite umpteen commercials trying to get people into cyber officer roles when I actually talked to recruiter for two different branches they are full for cyber officers. The only openings they had were for warrant cyber officers which are more like network admin as opposed to cyber defense or policymakers. I opted not to join.\n\nSo make sure you understand exactly the position you would be enlisting in and get everything in writing if you do decide to go in. Good luck.",

Fell into an unhealthy lifestyle so I decided to commit and join the military. Honestly, it was a great decision after being in for almost 5 years. I kinda got screwed by my recruiter and went enlisted but I got over it and am thankful for the military experiences I've had so far.\n\nEither way, I recommend you look into Officer gigs (do NOT let your recruiter bully you into going enlisted) and see if you'd be comfortable with the lifestyle. I'd share more info but it depends what you're looking to do tbh",

              "text": "So if you're talking about the enlisted police officer route, I would not recommend it just based on what I've heard. It's really a gamble on what base you can get and the work can be grueling. They tend to have very long work shifts along with the additional duties that military life brings. I can recommend some things based on what you want to do once you're out of the military life though.\n\nI feel that, just be aware that you might get sent somewhere completely different so it's not a guarantee you'll go where you want to. Certain officer jobs will limit you to certain bases so the career itself is important",

Leaving with 3 associates, a Bachelor and a expensive certification all on the governments dime. My retirement fund (TSP) is making $20-25k in interest each year, I managed to save $60k for a house down payment in 3 years by saving my wife's salary as a teacher and I'm looking at $3kish retirement paycheck every month for the rest of my life and a $600 a year health insurance for my whole family that covers everything. My family will have 4 sources of income soon,  retirement check,  VA disability, wife's salary and my post military job. \n\nThe military is not for everybody and it takes a certain mind set to deal with it but honestly it's no better or worse than civilian work force. There is safety in stability and we do a good job of watching out for each other and even protecting the dumb asses. If you go enlisted only sign up for 4 years until you figure out if it's something you want, if you have a degree go officer and be a whipping boy for 8-10 years then ride out the rest of your time in command and enjoy the retirement life. \n\nDM me if you want any advice or information, I won't sugar coat anything.",
