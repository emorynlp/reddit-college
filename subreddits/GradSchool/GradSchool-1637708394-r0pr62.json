  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m going to be graduating with my undergrad next year and am looking for a grad program. My bachelors will be in zoology and I want to do something related to conservation biology for my masters. I\u2019m having a hard time finding the type of program I\u2019d like to do in my state. I did however find an interdisciplinary studies degree (both an MS option and MA option) that is focused solely on conservation biology. I know interdisciplinary studies degrees aren\u2019t usually the move, but could this be an exception to the rule? \n\nJust looking for thoughts on this. Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "I\u2019m not sure how it works at the institution you are looking at, but with my institution a lot of profs and departments don\u2019t always like helping students navigate the interdisciplinary program because it is a bureaucratic mess. Interdisciplinary students at my institution can also have a harder time finding funding opportunities. What this means for you, I think, is that you will want to see if you can talk to current interdisciplinary students at your prospective institution and ask them what navigating the process is like for them and how they did it.",

      "text": "I'm also graduating from undergrad with an interdisciplinary degree. I'm getting an MSW because it makes more sense, career wise, but also plan on getting an interdisciplinary masters as well. I highly suggest looking into any school that offers an INT grad program and then emailing their head faculity. It's the hard road, for sure, but the right advisors will enjoy working with you on it.",
