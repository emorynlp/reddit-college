Some are leaving school, while others are trying to tough it out. Given the upcoming lift of eviction moratoria and skyrocketing rent prices (including on-campus... my university just raised grad housing rents by 85%), I fear homelessness is set to become commonplace among grad students. \n\nFor those who think it a little suspicious that a half-dozen people would share this one particular concern with me:  I have a bit of an open secret. I've been homeless for about three years and I'm a vocal advocate for campus housing reform. People know I'm surviving grad school while living on the streets. \n\nIt began as a choice for me:  a conscientious objection to insane rent prices (even before this year!) and the total lack of consequences for many landlords' criminal behavior. The grad students who have spoken to me about their impending homelessness aren't being given a choice, however. And, unlike me, they don't have enough time to plan for what's coming. \n\nI'm posting this here to raise awareness of what might be a major wave of hardship sweeping through our shared community. There is a lot of shame and stigma around homelessness and universities have very sparse support programs outside of offering high-interest loans. A bit of social support and kindness toward your struggling colleagues can make an enormous difference.", "author": "impressive_neglect", "created": 1625947362, "retrieved": 1632845321, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 557, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"h4ud5hc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ohps7k/anecdote_homelessness_rising_among_graduate/h4ud5hc/", "text": "Oh hey!
