  "title:": "I definitely overstretched myself in my first year of graduate school (M.S)",
  "text": "Hi friends,\n\nJust started a M.S in geospatial data sciences and I thought \"I can take 4 courses and work with my advisor no problem!\". I want to go into ecological modeling which is a lot of theoretical ecology and while I've taken math courses, I severely underestimated how much math I needed to be competent in. I was also silly and my first modeling course is designed for folks who've had some experience with models before, and of course I do not. It's also my first semester learning to code and 2 of my courses as well as my thesis work are all in R. So it feels like I'm taking an extra course with how much background review I have to do for that as well as for my statistics class. Which means I spend less time getting familiar with my thesis project with my advisor (I don't start working on it technically until next semester, so it's mostly just me trying to wrap my head around things).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI came into grad school being like \"I'm going to be so great at developing a healthy work/life balance!!\" LOLOLOLOL luckily my advisor and professors are very encouraging and I'm doing fine in my courses despite feeling like I'm drowning and can't fully get all that I want out of my courses because I don't have enough time (and physically/mentally cannot work past 10 PM).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, I'm planning to only take 3 courses next semester. Just wanted to put this here for support lol.",

      "text": "When I was signing up for this fall (I started over the summer) I was planning to take 6 (as in SIX) classes. My advisor was like, \"Uh, maybe rethink that?\"\n\nI didn't realize full time (at my school) for graduate work is 3 classes. So I dropped 2 and even with just 3 now I'm drowning. I can't imagine doing more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I totally get it. You're not alone!",
