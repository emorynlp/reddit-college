To me, that counts as success.", "text": "I was the most depressed I\u2019d been in years or probably ever. I was eating to comfort myself. I gave UberEats waaaaay too much of my money and of course I gained weight. I started to question what the point of it all was and even started contemplating my own death. I posted here about my depression and so many of you helped me realize I was not alone. This sent me down another spiral of why the hell do we put ourselves through this???? I asked my therapist once if grad school is low key torture and she said \u201chonestly yes\u201d. Of course she supplied me with comforting advice after that and the suggestion of meds came up. Turns out, after an extensive blood test, there was no need for antidepressants which was kind of disappointing because I was hoping for some form of happy pill...Anyway, I say all that to say that completing this semester is a miracle for me. Every single assignment that I forced myself to do just to get a grade is an accomplishment. I did EVERYTHING that I had ZERO interest in doing despite how pointless I felt it was. \n\nLast night I submitted a final that I know will probably not be received well and I know it\u2019s not the best I could have given. I waited til the last minute and my professor gave us guidelines that I didn\u2019t fully follow. I\u2019m honestly not happy about it because grad school has a way of making you question your worth/intelligence, but I\u2019m not gonna focus on that. I submitted it and that\u2019s all that matters. I finished this semester and that\u2019s beautiful. Perfection can kiss my butt and ridiculous expectations can do the same. 2 years down, 1 more to go. \n\nEveryone hang in there!! & to anyone graduating this month, congratulations!!!", "author": "ManifeztedBliss", "created": 1620908424, "retrieved": 1632953711, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gy6o98a": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nbfc14/i_wanted_to_drop_out_in_february_i_didnt_to_me/gy6o98a/", "text": "I\u2019m also really troubled by this concept that it just sucks for us all but we keep doing it anyway! Why does it have to be that way?! Why do we all have to deal with the anxiety, depression, impostor syndrome, etc just for the sake of higher education? I find it ridiculous but I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019re nearing a point where mental health is actually being taken seriously, instead of just accepting that it matters but also that it\u2019s just shit for grad students, and that those old faculty who are just content with the way it is are being phased out and the newer generation of senior faculty will be kinder and more empathetic. Most of the early career faculty I know are way better mentors than the more senior faculty, idk if it\u2019s a culture shift or what, but I just hope that they listen to us and are actually trying to change things instead of letting us suffer because they had to suffer too. It feels like a broken system and I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m not planning on sticking around to help fix it, I\u2019m just dreaming of the day I finish my PhD and leave academia, but I hope it\u2019s not like this for other grad students in the future. That\u2019s what I have to tell myself to get by! It\u2019s teaching me a lot about what I don\u2019t want to put up with in my career beyond school and I know people are saying there\u2019s a form of this wherever you go but I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re just pessimists and it\u2019s possible to find, or create for yourself, a job you love. \n\nAnyway, congrats on hanging in there!", "author": "ontariodwarf", "created": 1621055485, "upvotes": 1}, "gy12rzx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nbfc14/i_wanted_to_drop_out_in_february_i_didnt_to_me/gy12rzx/", "text": ">I was the most depressed I\u2019d been in years or probably ever.\n\nSame here! I've been wanting to drop out since last October, I'm not sure how I still haven't. Forget about impostor syndrome, depression definitely trumps that! I know I can do this, but my brain is giving up on me. I was feeling so down mid my first semester, then tragedy after tragedy strikes and here I am now finishing my first year of grad school scrambling to get a 60 in three of my classes, so I can request a COVID Pass grade. Never in my life, would I have imagined I would have to literally be calculating the bare minimum grade I need on my final papers to pass, especially not in Grad School!

I just experienced my worst semester myself and barely passed classes with a C, but the point is, we passed. This illusion that we always have to give perfect grades is just an illusion.

So on top of challenging classes that demand the best of us, we also have to flow with life's ups and downs. That's super hard.\n\nPat yourself on the back.
