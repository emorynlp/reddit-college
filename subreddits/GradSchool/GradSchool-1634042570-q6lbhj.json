  "title:": "Third semester of an MS at my dream school and I'm losing my mind and all direction",
  "text": "Hi everyone. I am in desperate need of advice.\n\n**TLDR:** I hate my university, I hate my advisor, I don't even know if I want to pursue the career path my program is preparing me for. I have bipolar disorder and a depressive episode is being triggered by my job and feelings of shame and guilt from feeling like I'm a failure and that I just can't make it through grad school. Considering withdrawing. Any advice? Has anyone pushed through despite wanting to run tf away halfway through? I am 19 credits towards a 36-credit degree and I don't think I've ever hated my life more than I do now.\n\nLong version.... I'm in my third semester at a school I'd never thought I'd get into and wanted to attend to prove to myself that I'm capable and worthy. I struggled during my first semester (was totally unprepared for graduate work) and I'm struggling again. I'm behind on assignments and I have two Incompletes. I work full time in a job (dept./staff support in academia) I absolutely can't stand that is crushing me because I have no support and literally stare at a corner all day (because my desk faces a corner, and the furniture is too heavy for me to move). I've also had a Title IX case opened against a co-worker/faculty member because he's a creep and continues to be a creep. I have to provide emotional support to my boss every time I see her because she's always so stressed out. This job is killing me. I have constant back pain and anxiety about coming in. I've met maybe three faculty members and have had zero support by way of training and even just being treated as a person as opposed to a servant.\n\nI'm actively applying for other jobs, but my academics are seriously suffering in the meantime. I feel depressed (I have bipolar I, so depression is super rare for me), I feel disengaged, I feel disconnected, I feel alone in both my academics and my job. I literally do not care what anyone talks about in class discussions and yesterday I felt like I was outside of my body watching me watching them talk about nonsense (usually I'm very active in discussions). And I'm so f-ing tired of seeing the friends I've made through school go to all of these school events and love their life and their program and spend all kinds of time on campus while meanwhile I'm toiling away in a thankless position and struggling to keep up with the weekly readings. I just want the privilege of being a full-time student who can devote attention and focus to my studies. I've never had it, not even in undergrad.\n\nMy advisor has been no help. Her suggestions have been along the lines of \"have you tried joining the student associations if you're looking for a sense of community?\" and I'm like are you serious? I spend 11 hours of my time doing work stuff, then I go to class for two hours, and I'm supposed to find time to do the homework and sleep in between all of that. She directed me to the University counseling center before even checking if I'm eligible for their services (I'm not, because I waived the health fee -- I have private insurance -- and am not attending full time).\n\nI want to run away, quit my job, quit my program, and leave it behind. But I can't be in staff/admin support jobs forever. It'll kill me. I have no idea what to do (other than wait for a therapy appointment, which is taking forever).",

      "text": "Had that same feeling during my senior year in undergrad. Horrible advisor, Department assigned him so had nothing to do. Did not help a bit. Rather had weird behaviour and bad attitude. Never felt mentally low like that time before. Still survived.  Continued with him but after some discussion he allowed to take advise from another professor who was friendly, somehow managed to complete it. I won\u2019t want LOR from him cause it will not do any good.\n\n\nHere is my suggestion,  take a deep breath, look for alternative source to get help.Sometimes in weekend , go to visit the city  by walk, explore different unknown foods, eat them, enjoy them, pass quality time by urself. Don't post on facebook rather keep it as a guilty pleasure. Ignore the advisor, finish the Ms, give a middle finger to all these shi*s and start a new life. Best of luck. There are so many self obsessed, humanity less, narcissistic people. Don't let them ruin ur life, ur happy moments. May God be with u. I once thought that probably i can't finish my undergrad, here i am applying for next fall for PhD. And if God wants maybe i will get it, if HE does not want, then i will not. But never let anyone harm my mental peace.",

      "text": "If you do not want a PhD, you don't need to be a star student to graduate. If your MS will advance your career, I would try putting in only enough effort that you get grades sufficient enough to maintain good academic standing and get credit (typically a B). No sense wracking your brain and nerves trying to aim for A's if a MS is the end of the academic line for you. \n\nAlso, try doing something just for yourself. I call it an unguilty pleasure because I experience absolutely no guilt whatsoever taking time to myself. I like food, so I go to random restaurants or order something I havent tried before just because. If it's a nice day, I will eat out. If not, Netflix and good food (and wine). \n\nI'd also probably cut back on the emotional support to your adviser. She's an adult, she can self-soothe. Providing free emotional labor to people who, even if they don't mean it, are emotional black holes can be extremely exhausting. You can express sympathy or whatever, but I wouldn't get too involved if she is stressed. She can manage that, your plate is already full enough as it is.",

      "text": "Everyone's experience is different but I feel like I relate to you in the sense that working full time and doing grad school is an immensely stressful experience.  As others have said, nothing is worth putting yourself through prolonged suffering.  If the you find yourself consistently depleted or crushed from doing certain things everyday, like work in your case, it would be healthier to remove that stressor from your life as soon as possible. I understand it is not easy to leave a job that enables you to literally survive, but if it is making it so difficult to live your life, leave as soon as you feasibly can.  It may sound harsh but you don't owe your boss anything especially not emotional support, you're an employee, not their therapist. You do not owe the school your loyalty especially when they don't respond in kind. You only owe yourself kindness and compassion.",

      "text": "Would you be able to take a leave of absence, like for a semester or so? Burnout and mental health struggles are very valid and real challenges, especially when you're working full time and going to school. \n\nIf you can't take a leave of absence, I would try to see if you can get a therapist. When I felt like I was sinking faster than I could tread, I signed up for therapy (and recently made an appointment for a psychiatrist). It doesn't make everything magically better, but it helps me get through the roughest bits. I know you mentioned waiting for a therapy appointment, but maybe you can see if there's any online therapists that are available, who might have more open spots?\n\nAlso, like others have mentioned, if you're not going to apply for PhD programs, just aim for the B (or whatever is considered passing for credit).  \n\nI'm sorry I couldn't be much help. I'm rooting for you and really wish you the very best and hope things work out for you.",

I am not eligible for school counseling services because I have private insurance. (Like - she assumed I have the school counselors as a resource, but I don't. They're only accessible by students who pay the health fee. I waived the health fee because I have private insurance. I hope that makes sense)\n\n  \nIt is of course a stupid and minor annoyance but at the time, every minor annoyance was amplified.",

If not your options are to finish because of sunk cost, transfer to something that better suits your current needs and keeps your credits or withdraw altogether. \nI began my program last month and I hated it until this last weekend when I found a new topic of research that I'm actually passionate about. I can't give you too much advice from my own experience but persons before me have always advised to study your passion. It's the only things that can push you to read all those papers when you're already burn out. \nLook for a new job. That's it. Just look for a new one and move. In 2021 loyalty to a team that doesn't support Or respect you doesn't pay off in the long run and I'm saying this as an HR professional. \nSending love and encouragement to you.",
