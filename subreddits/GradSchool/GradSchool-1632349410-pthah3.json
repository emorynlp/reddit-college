I like to work with people and make a lot of money. That\u2019s why I am currently working in tech sales. I am re-evaluating my career, and in addition to working with people and $$$, I value flexibility + I have a strong desire to do a more meaningful job where I profoundly impact people\u2019s lives. Thus the decision to become a clinical psychologist to run a practice in 10 years. How do I approach getting a postgraduate degree in clinical psychology to practice and not do research/ be a scientist in the future? All universities with this program in Ontario seem to be research-heavy\u2026 or am I not wholly understanding what universities offer to students applying for this degree?", "author": "gentillealouette1", "created": 1632349410, "retrieved": 1632844069, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "comments": {"hdx8loy": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pthah3/i_am_looking_for_help_applying_for_clinical/hdx8loy/", "text": "I agree with what the other commenter said. There are some (very few) fully funded PsyD programs out there, but they\u2019re almost as research heavy as a PhD. I\u2019m currently working on my own thesis research, working in my mentor\u2019s lab, engaging in non-lab research that he\u2019s trying to make me do for my CV/residency apps in a few years, and seeing therapy and cognitive assessment clients in a clinical capacity. All that plus actual classes and homework means I put in ~60 hours a week, and my stipend is $22k per academic year. It\u2019s really hard.\n\nI won\u2019t say don\u2019t do it. But I will say think long and hard about it before you make the decision. The money is there, but it\u2019s 5-7 years in the future. I wouldn\u2019t be able to do it if I didn\u2019t have another source of income.

I hear there aren't many in Canada. PhDs are almost always geared towards research careers. PsyDs are for clinical careers. Avoid diploma mill schools. Consider expanding your search to the US where there are more options. Or do a master's level degree that allows you to practice as a therapist. I don't know what those are in Canada but in the US, an MSW with a license (LICSW, usually) allows you to practice as a therapist. Programs are much shorter. Why do you want to do clinical psych rather than one of those programs if your goal is to be a therapist and you live somewhere that doesn't really have a lot of PsyD programs?\n\nEdit: this is also the wrong field for you if you really value making money and are set on getting the doctorate. You will be broke for about 6 years. The whole time. Even if you take out loans and receive a stipend (PhD program) but especially if you do go for clinical work oriented programs (PsyD program) as you generally pay for those and don't get paid. Then you graduate. Hooray! Now you have six months of freedom before you have to pay off unsubsidized loans with high interest rates. Not to mention you have to probably do a postdoc now for a year or two so that you can accrue hours to get licensed. Postdocs get paid shit. But you will rejoice because it is 3x as much as you've made for the past three years. But you are still broke and in debt. Next comes the licensing exam. You will need to buy prep books, maybe pay for some extra classes, study on the weekends, and pay to take and retake the exam. Now come licensing fees. And fees for professional organizations. You also probably need to take a business class now to learn how to manage a practice. You'll deal with insurance companies who will refuse to pay you what you ask. You have to rent an office. And don't forget about malpractice insurance. Oh, and fees for keeping lawyers on retainer because you will get sued. Probably repeatedly. Also clinical psych doctoral programs are among the most selective programs around. Lower acceptance rates than medical school on average for PhD programs. Do you have publications? Relevant clinical experiences? Letters of reference from prominent psychologists? Become a life coach, maybe. You don't have to go to school, don't acquire loans, don't have to get licensed, and you can charge whatever you want while feeling like you've made a positive difference.", "author": "lonelypotato3849", "created": 1632365238, "upvotes": 1}}}
