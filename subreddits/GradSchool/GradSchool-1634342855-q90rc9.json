  "text": "I'm a PhD student going into my second year and I recently made a return to the office for the first time. \n\nThere are 12 other PhD students in the office and amongst themselves 8 were invited to another office mate's flat for a \"PhD dinner party\". I (alongside 4 others) was ignored and not invited despite spending time trying to socialise with them and introduce myself for the last couple of weeks.\n\nThis is Why I don't miss working from home, stupid office politics. It sucks because I thought we were all getting in and this happened. For starters they thought my desk was abandoned becuase the university forgot to assign one to me. This means I didn't even have a chair and don't even have an office workstation to use on campus...\n\nI missed a 2 week period of being on campus because of this delay and I think this kind of set me back socially.\n\nThey were planning it openly right in front of us and didn't even think to ask if we'd like to join them or make up for it if slave was an issue ...\n\nSorry just needed to vent...",

I know it sucks to have them act like jerks, but ignoring them might be the best route?\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice my advisor has given me is to make friends who have intellectual and social interests outside of my department\u2026 makes things easier when they\u2019re not always connected to crappy work/office drama.",
