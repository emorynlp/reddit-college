  "text": "I graduated with my bachelor's in my home country in 2009. In my last year I had participated in an exchange semester with a US state university. I loved it so much that I went back for my masters  (MBA) after a year as an international graduate student. I was also in a relationship with my now husband who was attending another state university a few hours away. \n\nHowever I planned the cost of being an international student poorly. First I did not get the GA position I was originally promised for the first year. Also I was given an in campus housing for 2 bedroom instead of 1 due to lack of availability, and ended up paying a lot more for that. Also I unexpectedly got pregnant with my son, he was born in the summer prior to my final semester and was given permission to take my last classes online since I had moved in with my now husband (in a different state) to raise our baby together. He had graduated a year prior and was employed full time.\n\nI ran out of money to pay for tuitions after the first year. The school gave me some payment extension plan for the next couple semesters, however despite finally getting a TA position, I wasn't catching up on the money owed. \n\n\nI had one semester (2 classes) left to graduate. However the university did no longer allow me to continue further (rightfully so) due to my inability to finish paying by the end of my final semester. It was also now the time to repay the student loans I had taken in my home country and I had ran out of any loan money to use for my balance.\n\nThis went downhill very fast from there as my student status was almost immediately terminated. \nIn order to be able to finish and reinstate my status I needed to pay the almost 20k balance owed. With a baby and my spouse only starting in his career, little financial help possible from family, it was not possible at that time.\n\nIn order to continue living together and raise our son, we got married, took over a year (that I had to spend in my home country) to be able to return to the US with a permanent residency. \nWe became homeowners, had another child, I got a job, life continued and we slowly got into a comfortable financial position, savings, retirement accounts etc... however I couldn't make my family suffer the financial consequences of my past for my school debt.\n\nI filed a personal chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2018 to discharge my school and other debts (not a loan) as the university was no longer willing to work a payment plan with me. \n\nOnce that was taken care of I finally took the steps to finish my degree. I waited until the pandemic ended and was readmitted in my old program, was approved to use my old credits and authorized to graduate after taking the 2 classes missing on my program. \n\nI will graduate this December, almost 10 years later.\n\nNever give up, regrets can eat you up, there is always a way to finish something you started even when it seems impossible. I found out the people at my college were willing to go above and beyond to help a former and returning student.",

          "text": "Thanks! It was one of those bittersweet regrets of my life. I am happy in my current situation, family and financially wise but the fact that I never completed my degree was haunting me in the back of my head. I am thankful and pleasantly surprised that even so many years later I could make it happen and start from where I left it.\n\nI see a lot of posts about possibly dropping out on here and I thought my story can maybe help those who for financial or mental health reasons need a break. If I did it after so many years it is possible, work with your university and advisors you d be surprised how willing they are to help.\n\nIn my case ironically graduating with my MBA several years down the road with work experience will end up benefitting me a lot more than just fresh out of undergrad had I finished all these years ago",
