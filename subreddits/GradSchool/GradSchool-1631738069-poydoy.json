I have 300 students and was forced to cancel class twice this week due to a possible super spreader event. Is it against University protocol?

However, to make up for this inconvenience those of us assigned to this facility get an extra 5k a year stipend. Additionally, our cost of living is lower than if we were at the main school. I am able to rent a room in a nearby house from my research facility for 400/month which includes all utilities and internet.\n\nCovid in no way affected my income but allowed me to attend remotely which freed up my time significantly. I was able to work from home (I mostly do data analysis) for a very long time, and they also got around to making a deal with a nearby school in the same system so now we can go to their Campus Health instead of traveling to our own. Further, because Covid precautions and low recruitment numbers no new students have come here for over a year, so I've not been given a roommate- aka I've been renting a 2BR/2B house 2 minutes from my lab for 400/month.\n\nThen the stimulus checks were a cherry on top.\n\nSeveral times during the pandemic I have metaphorically looked around and realized how incredibly fortunate I was to be in the position I was at the time this hit. My heart goes out to those who are suffering.\n\n(As an added \"Dodged a bullet there\" note, I finished my comprehensives during the pandemic so will never have to go to campus again, meaning I don't have to worry about the absolute buffoonery going on up there about in-person attendance and Covid lack-of-precautions.)", "author": "Ancient_Winter", "created": 1631794148, "upvotes": 1}, "hd23ywz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/poydoy/has_covid19_wrecked_havoc_on_your_finances_too/hd23ywz/", "text": "No, about the same.
