  "text": "I'm a third year PhD student, and the pandemic stress has hit me hard, making it difficult for me to focus or work for more than a few hours each day. I have been trying my very best, but I still can't seem to make progress with anything. I met with my advisor this morning, and he told me he can't tell that I made any progress this past year and that I really need to step it up if I want to stay on track. While I agree with him, I don't really know what I can do differently. The stress from the pandemic has been eroding away at me.\n\nI'm mostly making this post because I need to vent, but I guess I'm also looking for suggestions. I love my program, and I love what I'm doing. I WANT to be able to work as much as I did pre-pandemic, but no matter how hard I try I can't. I feel helpless. (Yes I know therapy is probably a good idea at this point)",

I would recommend this option if you think it would be right for you and if your program allows it.",

I get very bad seasonal depression so basically every year I am a superstar with energy and charisma when it's warm, and become an introverted asshole who can't finish anything all Winter. It's the way it's gone for me, sorta a seasonally bipolar state...\n\n\nI think it's one thing to say you have \"pandemic stress\" and another thing to recognize that no such thing exists as a whole. What aspects of pandemic life are causing stress and pain? If this is a hard question to answer, therapy could help. If you can reflect on what REALLY is bothering you, you can then reflect on what you can do to chnage that.\n\n\nFor example, are you distressed by current events? Then maybe ignorance is bliss for you, and just cut it all out. Unsub, unfollow, delete apps, whatever it takes. Or is it the inability to be social in ways the pandemic has limited (bars, going out, traveling, weekend trips, etc.)? In that case, unless all your friends you had pre-pandemic left you may just start forcing yourself to hang out with people. This is something I try to do when depressed. Set a schedule for it, and call them to lock in plans. better yet invite them over so you can't try to get out of it last minute, or suffer depression/stress-induced malaise about leaving the house. For some it's the lack of a inter-personal work environment. If you think that plays a role luckily you are not alone, and there are many people who would be willing to be work or study buddies with you creating accountability via zoom or in person. Maybe that is something that could be established over reddit if you are shy about reaching out within your irl network. \n\n\nAll I'm trying to say is dissect your stress a bit, and in that you may find some ways to move forward. \"Because of the pandemic\" is generally a cop out of reflecting on what changes in your life upset you and why. You have to want to move forward, and mean it. Say it to yourself if necessary. If you want to quit of take a year off, come to thaty conclusion . but don't drag your feet between two realities because you haven't taken the time to really reflect on what you want and how you might be able to get it easier.",

On days I can\u2019t focus, knocking off those small tasks helps keep the project moving forward and my sense of accomplishment going (small victories are still victories). This app is also great bc I can go back and see what tasks I\u2019ve accomplished which is great for filling in reports. This is just a strategy that\u2019s worked for me and helped me get through grad school. Sending you good vibes. It\u2019s been a very weird year indeed.",

      "text": "There's definitely no shame in therapy, and it could really help. That being said, it's perfectly understandable to not be as productive as usual during these times, and I know my productivity suffered a lot for many months. I hope your supervisor understands this, although it's also understandable for them to encourage you to pick it up. They should want to see you be successful, so that's all they're trying to do. At the end of the day, if you're just not productive this year and you end up needing an extra semester or so to complete your degree, that's not the worst thing ever. You likely won't be the only one in that boat either.\n\nPersonally, I find I'm getting back to my old self more and more over the past month or so.   \nOne major thing I did was start a bullet journal. Basically just a Word document where I type down what I've done or what I need to do. Making it electronic is great as well, so you can search it if you need to remember something from a month ago. It's also encouraging to see the word count go up. It's almost at 10'000 words now, yay! Also then if your supervisor asks what you've been doing, you have your journal to refer to.  \nA second major thing I did was address some bad habits that I picked up at the start of the pandemic, like drinking and smoking weed too frequently. It's not easy for many people to do, I know, but I replaced these bad habits with exercising a bit before bed every night, followed by a short meditation session, and then listening to a sleep hypnosis podcast to fall asleep (as weed usually helped me get to sleep before). It's like jumping in a cool lake; you'll hesitate to start the exercise to begin with, but it feels great once you do. Exercise is also known to get your neurons going in general, so would recommend, whatever form of exercise you like.",

Definitely pick the bullet journal back up if you found it helped. No trouble if there's a gap in it.\n\nAnd yeah, I had the same sort of approach too for weed, with similar results. It's not the worst thing ever; but if you can avoid it being a habit, I think you're better off, so good to hear you've been off of it for a bit.\n\nI listen to Sleep Cove. You can find it on most streaming platforms. The guy (Christopher Fitton) is a really good hypnotist, and the music is a big part of it. There's a bunch of episodes to choose from and makes new ones every week. They range from specific life improvement, like reaching goals, reducing anxiety, etc. to simply reading a story, Peter Pan, Sherlock Holmes, etc. I also started it because my roommate stays up late most nights and would wake me up with doors, steps, etc. so nice to have something to drown it out.\n\nGood to see you're reaching out for advice and trying to make improvements, and I hope you get the results you want. You're definitely not alone. Take it one step at a time.\n\nCheers,",

One thing I wanted to say is don't make permanent decisions for a temporary situation. Although things will never be the same, they won't always be the way they are right now. We don't have and can't control what's goin on externally; we only have internal control (mind). It's a lot of work to switch from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset, but it will help you become incredibly resilient. Be proud of what you've done so far, and if nobody else pats you on the back, pat yourself on the back and keep going forward. Be your #1 cheerleader. I wish you the best.\ud83d\ude42\u2618\ufe0f",

It can be so painful to be in this power hierarchy with an advisor, who for years dictates your life and your workload. And many advisors are wonderful and mean well, and they have their own anxieties about students' productivity/graduating on time/whatever. Don't take on your advisor's anxiety :) \"on track\" is something we made up. Why is graduating in a certain time frame \"on track\"? Who decided that this time frame was Perfect for Everyone Always in Every Situation ? It's bullshit, it's made-up, and our advisors often blindly adhere to these norms and get anxious when we deviate from them. You are doing the best you can.",

I'm not saying that OP should have been more productive and that their advisor is entirely right to be disappointed in them. Not at all.

On the other hand - sometimes we can't control who/what has control over us. Sometimes people/events/circumstances TAKE control over us; there is no \"letting\" it have control - it simply DOES have control. Sometimes it's okay, necessary, and useful to be upset. We have emotions for a reason, after all. \n\nYour approach sounds like it works for you and that's great. But it may not be useful for others right now - or for academia/society at large, for that matter. If we just acquiesce, surrender, and stoically \"accept\" our circumstances then they will never change. It's a dialectic - accepting vs. challenging. Both strategies have their time and place. For some people in some situations accepting works wonders; for others it may be the worst possible option. It sounds to me like you're attempting to force YOUR strategy onto others.

If the system continues as it is I know that I, for one, will simply not be able to make it. At this point I have no choice left but to fight. Hanging on to my anger helps give me the energy to do that. Being upset at external events is extremely valuable to me under the given circumstances - that said, I do try to moderate it. It is not \"destroying me internally.\" \n\nThat said, me speaking up and being upset isn't enough. I can't create change by myself. I find it so frustrating that there are so many folks who are just as angry and upset as me, who want change just as badly as I do (so they say), but when it comes time to act, they continue to put their heads down and keep on keeping on because... they can, I guess. I can't. I wish the folks who can would help fight for my right to be in academia too.",

What do you mean though when you refer to your right to be on academia? Have the governmental measures linked to covid impacted your right to study? I hope not, but I see how this could pose difficulties for you if you need to travel abroad or conduct experiments. I wouldn't say that your right to study would be impacted in this case. Rather, the realm of possibilities offered to you have narrowed. But I don't know the specifics of your situation so I can't really judge.",

      "text": "I'm in the same boat. My advisor doesn't really give much attention to anyone below year 4 in the PhD because the lab is so huge, but a couple days ago one of my older student mentors flat out told me \"I'm so *frustrated* with you\" for not taking ownership of our shared project. It was crushing.\n\nAs you suspected, therapy helps. I started a few months ago. A lot of the lack of motivation I felt turned out to be a negative feedback loop in my head where I was constantly shaming myself for not being productive, but then the added pain of the shame made it even harder to engage with my studies. It was easier to just tune out. Also, I had simply reached my breaking point after years of being mistreated in a relationship and (as I now realize) emotionally neglected as a child. That shit has to be dealt with before I can move on with my life. Similarly, I suspect \"pandemic stress\" is not the only thing that's bothering you, OP. \n\nTherapy validates your feelings, gives your pain a right to exist, and teaches you self-compassion. For me, at least, that was like a release, and my ability to focus has slowly started to come back! And the older grad student that I mentioned at the beginning? He's a jerk and his opinion doesn't really matter. A good mentor wouldn't say something like that; they would be focused on nurturing the student's abilities and supporting them through times of stress, instead of just shaming them. I am learning to recognize and protect myself from those types of people in therapy. \n\nOf course your situation is unique, but whatever's going on with you, a therapist will be able to help. Also, it's okay if you have to shop around for a while for a therapist who \"gets\" you. The generic university counsellor did nothing for me and was not experienced in the types of stress I had experienced throughout life.",

      "text": "There's a lot of good advice here and I want to reiterate that you should give yourself permission to be less productive sometimes, especially now that we're all under chronic stress with a global pandemic. Listen to your mind and body and don't try to \"force\" productivity if you're otherwise exhausted. You need to \"fill your cup\" and come back to work later.\n\nTry to find times of day or week when you're most productive. Don't force yourself to keep a 9-5 schedule if that doesn't work for you - honestly for me being able to break away from the regular 9-5 has been the best part of the pandemic. I'm an early riser and tend to have my most productive time right away in the morning (maybe 7am to noon), then I hit a midday slump, and after that I tend to have some okay work time in the late afternoon to early evening (maybe 4pm to 7pm, but it's never as productive as my morning time). So I use my afternoons for eating, house chores, mindless work (like emails or admin work), working out, and relaxing. I also can rarely work for a full 8 hours in a day, and so I'll usually end up working one weekend day to make up the hours. But I have a strict \"no work\" rule for at least one day per week, and if I do work on a weekend day, it's \"fun\" work that I enjoy (like writing or thinking about my next proposal), never work that is a chore (which for me is admin work and grading).\n\nGive yourself permission to have down weeks, to relax and give your brain a break. You can't do good work without it, and you need to do something to turn off and replenish your stores so you can work well later. Explore hobbies. Take down time. Finding a therapist is a great idea.\n\nYou got this. This is a hard, shitty time for all of us. Try to break out of the shame / judgement cycle and ask yourself some honest questions and explore why work has been so hard. Remember you are not your job, you are not a bad person just because you haven't been productive, and everyone has productivity loss when they're stressed.",

I hope you are not repeating the things you said in your comment to yourself, because you're not doing yourself a favor. Recognizing the amount of pain/stress you're in does not \"lead to the hole being deeper\"; that mindset just sounds like you're in denial and scared to acknowledge the problem. I lost my motivation last year. Therapy has taught me that it is impossible to just \"get over\" something like this by continuing to tell myself to keep \"putting more energy into it\". Negative self-talk like that made me feel even more desperate and ashamed of my lack of progress and kept me trapped in the problem for far longer than I needed to be. What actually helped me was learning self-compassion. Obviously I had a problem and telling myself that I *shouldn't* have a problem was utterly useless and counterproductive.  Recognizing that the problem is real (i.e., \"validation\"), that it exists for a reason, and working to address that reason is how mental health care works. My motivation has slowly started to come back since addressing my issues the right way: with understanding, patience, and compassion. I enjoy reading again. Thinking through a research problem no longer feels like running without being able to breathe. I could cry from happiness.\n\nIf you are not experiencing this yourself, then go away. This thread isn't for you and we don't need you shaming us for not \"putting more energy into it\". We've already tried shaming ourselves and it doesn't help :)\n\nOne last note: The amount of energy and type of focus required to complete the two tasks--word padding vs. actual writing--are not the same. Losing motivation is a bad situation to be in. Nobody wants to feel this way, like they are physically incapable of doing the thing that absolutely needs to be done and watching time slip away from them in an inevitable countdown towards self-destruction... So if this little piece of bullshit advice helps someone cope? Good.",

You think I'm being \"dishonest\" because you don't actually care about understanding what I'm saying. The strength of your opinion doesn't make it a fact: alternative coping strategies exist, and yours is not the only acceptable one. It's not my job to teach you empathy, so I'm done with this conversation.",

I know you didn\u2019t mention any depression in your post, and I am not armchair diagnosing you or implying that you are depressed in any way, but there is an excellent post on the advice column/blog Captain Awkward about tightening up your work performance when there is something getting in your way, or whoever is above you doesn\u2019t seem to see you are trying to improve.. (The letter writer specifically mentioned being depressed so the advice is geared towards that, but I didn\u2019t want there to be any confusion with regard to what I think you are going through mentally.) \n\nI feel like a lot of her tips would help you here. It\u2019s letter #450, I have been using it myself for my pandemic related productivity issues. It\u2019s not academia-specific, but still useful. Hope you find it helpful! \n\nFinally, yes I would look into finding a therapist if you are able to. My school has a graduate school for psychology and I was able to find a psych student there who has been excellent for me.",

It's disheartening to hear that psych programs aren't accommodating to their students having mental issues. I guess I thought that would not be the case, but thank you for showing me that I was wrong.",

Going into the labs and just doing experiments are easier but I cannot seem to sit down and write this paper. Hopefully we'll get through this, you're not alone lol",

      "text": "First of all, I'm really sorry you had to hear that. It definitely looks like you really wanted to perform as best as you could. Second, I would just like to remind you that we don't always have the best productivity. We're not machines. NO ONE maintains the same productivity 24/7, 365 days a year. I mean yeah, it sucks that your productivity went down for a full year. But it's not like this happened pre-covid. It's a pretty weird situation we have here. Maybe try getting some air? Like, go for a drive to the beach or go hiking or cycling? To me, it looks like you're under too much stress and it's kind of a never ending repetition of getting more stressed. Stress is only good when it's just enough to get you working. Try getting a regular amount of excercise everyday. I know this is easier said than done and we already have so much pressure to put all our time into work, but this might help in the long run.\nI think a lot of us are in the same state as you because we haven't been out as much as before, we haven't been able to spend time with our big group of friends, we haven't been able to sit at a caf\u00e9 to drink coffee, we haven't been able to do so many things that we took for granted.\nIt's normal for your body and brain to be underperforming. Our pandemic life is so repetitive and dull. It makes perfect sense that we aren't happy, full of ideas/motivation/energy.",

Even if they are just helping you with time management strategies, the simple act of regularly setting aside time to reflect on progress with someone who has experience counseling others can be so helpful. 100% recommend starting with a therapist. We only have so much mental bandwidth and energy, and therapy is a great way to explore what is eating up your bandwidth (i.e., what stessors?) and how to address that.",
