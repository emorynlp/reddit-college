It's the way it's gone for me, sorta a seasonally bipolar state...\n\n\nI think it's one thing to say you have \"pandemic stress\" and another thing to recognize that no such thing exists as a whole. What aspects of pandemic life are causing stress and pain? If this is a hard question to answer, therapy could help. If you can reflect on what REALLY is bothering you, you can then reflect on what you can do to chnage that.\n\n\nFor example, are you distressed by current events? Then maybe ignorance is bliss for you, and just cut it all out. Unsub, unfollow, delete apps, whatever it takes. Or is it the inability to be social in ways the pandemic has limited (bars, going out, traveling, weekend trips, etc.)? In that case, unless all your friends you had pre-pandemic left you may just start forcing yourself to hang out with people. This is something I try to do when depressed. Set a schedule for it, and call them to lock in plans. better yet invite them over so you can't try to get out of it last minute, or suffer depression/stress-induced malaise about leaving the house. For some it's the lack of a inter-personal work environment. If you think that plays a role luckily you are not alone, and there are many people who would be willing to be work or study buddies with you creating accountability via zoom or in person. Maybe that is something that could be established over reddit if you are shy about reaching out within your irl network. \n\n\nAll I'm trying to say is dissect your stress a bit, and in that you may find some ways to move forward. \"Because of the pandemic\" is generally a cop out of reflecting on what changes in your life upset you and why. You have to want to move forward, and mean it. Say it to yourself if necessary. If you want to quit of take a year off, come to thaty conclusion . but don't drag your feet between two realities because you haven't taken the time to really reflect on what you want and how you might be able to get it easier.", "author": "superxavi", "created": 1613598681, "upvotes": 3}, "gnt3o4l": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/llxee3/it_finally_happened_advisor_said_i_havent_made/gnt3o4l/", "text": "Commenting to let you know you are not alone!!!!!

Also then if your supervisor asks what you've been doing, you have your journal to refer to.  \nA second major thing I did was address some bad habits that I picked up at the start of the pandemic, like drinking and smoking weed too frequently. It's not easy for many people to do, I know, but I replaced these bad habits with exercising a bit before bed every night, followed by a short meditation session, and then listening to a sleep hypnosis podcast to fall asleep (as weed usually helped me get to sleep before).

My advisor doesn't really give much attention to anyone below year 4 in the PhD because the lab is so huge, but a couple days ago one of my older student mentors flat out told me \"I'm so *frustrated* with you\" for not taking ownership of our shared project. It was crushing.\n\nAs you suspected, therapy helps. I started a few months ago. A lot of the lack of motivation I felt turned out to be a negative feedback loop in my head where I was constantly shaming myself for not being productive, but then the added pain of the shame made it even harder to engage with my studies. It was easier to just tune out. Also, I had simply reached my breaking point after years of being mistreated in a relationship and (as I now realize) emotionally neglected as a child. That shit has to be dealt with before I can move on with my life. Similarly, I suspect \"pandemic stress\" is not the only thing that's bothering you, OP. \n\nTherapy validates your feelings, gives your pain a right to exist, and teaches you self-compassion. For me, at least, that was like a release, and my ability to focus has slowly started to come back! And the older grad student that I mentioned at the beginning? He's a jerk and his opinion doesn't really matter. A good mentor wouldn't say something like that; they would be focused on nurturing the student's abilities and supporting them through times of stress, instead of just shaming them. I am learning to recognize and protect myself from those types of people in therapy. \n\nOf course your situation is unique, but whatever's going on with you, a therapist will be able to help.

Listen to your mind and body and don't try to \"force\" productivity if you're otherwise exhausted. You need to \"fill your cup\" and come back to work later.\n\nTry to find times of day or week when you're most productive. Don't force yourself to keep a 9-5 schedule if that doesn't work for you - honestly for me being able to break away from the regular 9-5 has been the best part of the pandemic. I'm an early riser and tend to have my most productive time right away in the morning (maybe 7am to noon), then I hit a midday slump, and after that I tend to have some okay work time in the late afternoon to early evening (maybe 4pm to 7pm, but it's never as productive as my morning time). So I use my afternoons for eating, house chores, mindless work (like emails or admin work), working out, and relaxing. I also can rarely work for a full 8 hours in a day, and so I'll usually end up working one weekend day to make up the hours. But I have a strict \"no work\" rule for at least one day per week, and if I do work on a weekend day, it's \"fun\" work that I enjoy (like writing or thinking about my next proposal), never work that is a chore (which for me is admin work and grading).\n\nGive yourself permission to have down weeks, to relax and give your brain a break. You can't do good work without it, and you need to do something to turn off and replenish your stores so you can work well later. Explore hobbies. Take down time. Finding a therapist is a great idea.\n\nYou got this. This is a hard, shitty time for all of us.
