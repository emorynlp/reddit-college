It's the thing I prioritize because it always means I'm ready to answer questions... even if I'm absolutely exhausted. \n\n>I probably work, at most, 4 to 6 hours a day. I avoid booking a meeting before 1100 because I will be irritable and not focused until the drugs kick in. I spend the mornings curled up around my cat waiting for the drugs to kick in so I can get something done. \n\n>I simply will not read emails on the weekends. I refuse. My brain can barely tolerate the 30ish hours of work that I do during the week. Anything more is simply a bridge too goddamned far. \n\n>The reason that I always have something to say on most topics is because I've probably hyperfixated on that at some point in time. My husband laughs at my constant curiosity but I literally can't help it. The internet has made it so that any unanswered question can usually be figured out relatively quickly... and I must know... NOW! Doesn't matter that the conversation moved on and it took me 15 minutes to find that tidbit of info... I MUST KNOW.\n\n>The ADHD makes my brain work weirdly fast. I jump between topics and ideas really rapidly. By the time my coworkers are just getting to step 2 I'm already on step 5. This is not a boon, I cannot explain how I got to step 5 but I intuitively know it makes sense to be there. Try explaining that in a paper... ugh. \n\nIronically, my boss is much the same way and I have a sneaking suspicion that he is an ADHD kid too. He just has that vibe and he has WAY too many tabs open for a normal. He also has areas of research that he exclusively pawns off to his grad students because he can't deal with them. He literally can't, if you ask him to look them over it will never get done. \n\nOh, and on a personal level, I can be unintentionally brisk if I am fixated on a problem. This means I tend to give the solution rather than care about the feelings of the person presenting the problem. This only seems to be a problem with people I think should have it figured out, my colleagues. I don't seem to have the same response to my students, for some reason. It takes some getting used to but my colleagues now use me as an unofficial \"Reviewer 2\" because I will be aggressive in my analysis of their work without taking into account their feelings.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about that last one. I've worked on it with my therapist but is still creeps in no matter how much I work on it. On the bright side, once people get used to me as \"academically aggressive\" they actually kind of like it.
