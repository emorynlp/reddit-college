Officially, it's for statistical data and curiosity so that they know what you're interested in. But in reality, this is not the main reason. It's common knowledge that schools are very protective of their \"yield\" (num of people enrolled as a percentage of the number of admits), as they seem to correlate this with their \"prestige\". As you can read here, many students are turned down when the department believes the applicant will enroll at a higher-ranked program. If you mention the other programs you're applying to, and some are indeed higher-ranked, they might think they are your \"safety\" school and reject you in fear of their yield. However, if they are the highest ranked, that makes it seems like you think admission to this school is a long shot, which also doesn't help your application. (As for those schools that ask for the number of programs: if it's too many, this might lead them to believe you're not very specific and they're just one of many. However, mentioning 4-5 should be ok, but this won't help you ofcourse. Nonetheless, mentioning too few or too many will hurt, though. Again: mainly possible downsides.) In either case, there's very few pros and many cons. In previous threads, there's also empirical evidence that not mentioning other schools doesn't affect your admissions much, while mentioning them might. Play it safe and don't mention them :).\n\nAlso /r/GradAdmissions is the better sub for this type of question in the future",

Or is it someone's limited anecdotal experience from working with one department? Or just a theory? Because the fact that some schools are somewhat \"protective of their yield\" doesn't necessarily imply this is true\n\nThe other reason I ask is that could also work the other way. If a school is aware that one is applying to other programs, they might work harder to woo a particular candidate.",

I was completely honest with every institution and told them all where I was applying, and the end result was that they all tried to sweeten their deals. One university offered me an extra $10k p.a. plus a campus apartment plus access to the tennis courts! All because they knew who they were competing against.\n\nEdit: and they were a mix of top-5, best-in-the-world programmes and programmes you\u2019ve never heard of. The low-ranked programmes didn\u2019t give up on me just because I applied to a lot of top programmes.",

Many are looking for the best deal. Others have significant others who have a part in the decision.\n\n> So at best, all that list indicates is where they applied. It tells someone nothing about preference.\n\nNobody is saying that making decisions on that basis is reliable: the concern is that assumptions derived from that information will have an effect on how people perceive an application and that those assumptions might have a negative impact but very likely won't have a positive impact.\n\nThe counter argument, that an applicant who says they are considering other schools may receive better funding, seems to me to be valid. However, if an applicant is more concerned about being accepted than they are eager to start a bidding war, I can absolutely see why someone would opt to withhold the information.\n\nIt would be nice to have some empirical data on this topic, but given how inconsistent schools are about publishing any admissions data, let alone detailed data down to what other schools a candidate was considering, I think we're going to be left with anecdotes for the time being.\n\nI personally suspect the effect is quite small either way. The choice is probably symbolic. Grad applications are chaotic and unpredictable, so people are eager to find small ways they might be able to have some control.",

[Department head] is great. You know she went here, right?\u201d At that point I had a verbal acceptance but was still waiting on a formal admissions packet and I think it actually helped her push for a stronger financial aid package to try to bring me over to their side. \n\n(I ended up going with the other program and have regretted it ever since)",
