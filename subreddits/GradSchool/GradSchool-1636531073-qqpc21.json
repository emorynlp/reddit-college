  "text": "we have a new program coordinator in my master\u2019s program and she has been making me feel like shit, full stop. \n\nshe was 20 minutes late to our meeting today, was short with me and kept cutting me off in the middle of my questions. she has been the number one stressor in my program since the start, and i kindly need her to back off. \n\ncontext: my grades are fine\u2014i\u2019m just..emotional. that\u2018s the reason she just wants to keep tabs on me. (have had to leave class quietly to compose myself once or twice because i get overwhelmed\ud83e\udd2a) or a professor has seen me cry in office hours \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a. that is why she\u2019s on my case. \n\n\nTL;DR: how do i set healthy boundaries with authority figures/coordinators in academia without being disrespectful? scared to talk to my uni about this as i don\u2019t want to burn bridges and have it backfire.",

      "text": "I think it depends on what she is doing, and what you mean by emotional. If you become overwhelmed to the point of having t o excuse yourself from class and cry during office hours, what are you doing to manage your stress/anxiety? That seems like something that might be worth checking in on. \n\nI think it really depends on what types of questions she asks you and what her behavior is. If you have anxiety, for example, I think it would be reasonable to check in with you to see how you are managing your anxiety, but you are not under any obligation to divulge personal information about your mental health. You can respond to questions like that by saying \"I'm fine, thanks\", being vague, or just politely telling them that you don't feel comfortable discussing it. Generally, the things you discuss with your university's mental health services are confidential, so you should be able to talk to them and be confident nobody else would know about it. \n\nIf the offending behavior is just rude, petty, things like interrupting you or being late to a meeting, I don't know that there's really a way to address that without being seen as petty and rude yourself. In those cases, you really just have to learn to pick your battles, and petty shit isn't a hill worth dying on.",

I just want to set boundaries because I\u2019m not comfortable talking to her. \n\nThank you\ud83e\udd7a",

I am working with my mental health team at the university and do not feel comfortable discussing aspects of my mental health treatment plan outside of that context. Thank you for understanding this\".\n\nThat's probably what I would say.  I'd find questions like that inappropriate, unless this person is actively involved in trying to help find solutions to a specific problem you may be experiencing. If there are aspects of your mental health that are negatively impacting your progress in the program, it might be appropriate to gently inquire out of concern and ask what she can do to help, but you are not obligated to divulge that information, especially not to someone who is not qualified to deal with mental illness.",

Because you'll be able to talk this out in more detail with a therapist, they will then be able to advise you as to how to handle the situation. \n\nParticularly because they will also know whether the program coordinator's behavior has crossed into an area where it should be reported. And they will know who you should talk to in that circumstance.",
