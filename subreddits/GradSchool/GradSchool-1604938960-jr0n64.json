Ask your peers if they're struggling or if you can help them. Be kind but assertive. Have something to cover your own ass. \nIf you're at the MA level and you've got peeps in your class acting like high school seniors, that doesn't reflect poorly on YOU.",

I ask because I know among my friends each of us have extremely different definitions of what's an acceptable timeline to do things. Like one friend panics if an assignment isn't complete with like weeks of time to spare before the deadline while another friend wouldn't even think of starting until a couple days before. Neither approach is inherently wrong but it can create a lot of anxiety/conflict if all of you are operating under the assumption that everyone else works on the same schedule as your own. Now if there was a clear discussion of everyone's deadline/responsibilities and they're not following through, then I don't think the professor can take that out on you as long as you have documentation that you did the part you were supposed to do.",

Honestly from this point on I would just make sure all your communication with this group is in email/fb message/some kind of trackable written online form. Or if you do zoom meet, take notes and email it out to everyone after as like a summary of who's going to do what and when so there's some record that you did try to get everyone moving.\n\nI know it sucks if you're someone who's used to getting tasks done earlier but unless the deadline is like tomorrow, there's still time for everyone to pull through! Lol even if it is tomorrow, people can pull through massive projects in a single night when the pressure of time is there. Just focus on what you can realistically control which is completing your part to the best of your ability.",
