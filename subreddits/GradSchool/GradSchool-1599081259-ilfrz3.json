But none of this is normal.", "text": "We spent three months out of the lab. At the start of the quarantine, my boss was all \"Everyone should do whatever they need to do to feel and stay safe\". And as we went back to work and things edged on...It has become \"Get back to normal.\" Actually, not even \"get back to normal.\" More like \"Make up the time you've lost.\" My PI is generally a good mentor and a reasonable boss, but the pressure he's putting on us right now to be productive is even more when things are normal. And things AREN'T NORMAL.\n\nWe've had two COVID positives in our lab of 12 already. All of us put into 2 week quarantines twice already during the not even three months we've been back at work. We're about to bring undergrads back into the lab from a university population that's trending over 5% positive for asymptomatic individuals. We're in a city and at a university who is doing as little as possible, generally shoving their heads in the sand as a way to deal with this pandemic.\n\nMy anxiety is extremely high. Everyone's is. And that's because this is not normal. We can't get back to normal because this is NOT NORMAL. I know everyone is tired of the regulations and the distancing but at least where I live, this is the worst it's ever been. So forgive me if my productivity level is a little low and I'm not going to be able to \"make up\" the three months I've lost. Forgive me if I'm not \"back to max capacity\" by October. I, all of us, just need a little compassion, need someone to acknowledge that this isn't regular life. Because it's not, and I'm so tired of people acting like it should be.\n\n/rant.", "author": "biologynerd3", "created": 1599081259, "retrieved": 1632846365, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gnqai3h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ilfrz3/my_pi_is_pushing_us_to_get_back_to_normal_but/gnqai3h/", "text": "Hi, I know this is an old post but I am so glad I found it.

Is there something happening higher up at the Uni that has your PI concerned? \n\nMy worry is that the Dean or Chair has told faculty at your uni that if they don't meet their publishing and grant requirements that might lose their funding, which would mean that graduate students would lose their funding.
