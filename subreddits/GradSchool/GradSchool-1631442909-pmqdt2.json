While I did major in math, I went to a liberal arts school and did a lot more than just math. I took education, race and gender studies classes, Arabic for a semester. During my first year, I came in lost and confused but by my 2nd year I felt more grounded. I decided to take math but only took the bare minimum for the major. I dealt with anxiety, depression and adhd throughout college and it definitely  impacted the first two years before I really took steps to address it. That being said, I have average grades. I didn\u2019t excel but I enjoyed what I was learning for the most part.\n\nNow I\u2019m doing a masters. I just moved to a new city 14 hours away from home. I don\u2019t really feel connected to a lot of my cohort, being a she/they and an ethnic minority. Also, these people have richer math backgrounds than me. I try not to compare myself much to them\nBcuz \u2026 they most likely feel the same way as me. But I\u2019m here trying to get out of bed and study. But the thought it causing my chest to tighten. I cried several times throughout the day and I feel so alone\u2026.", "author": "Prudent_Passenger596", "created": 1631442909, "retrieved": 1632844616, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "comments": {"hclpf53": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmqdt2/ive_only_had_my_first_lectures_and_my_panic/hclpf53/", "text": "Oh and the free counseling at school is nice!", "author": "memercopter", "created": 1631476233, "upvotes": 1}, "hcl4vwx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmqdt2/ive_only_had_my_first_lectures_and_my_panic/hcl4vwx/", "text": "Set aside some time for yourself.
