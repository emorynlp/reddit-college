  "text": "I'm qualifying this year. As a first gen student, it's all been very stressful and confusing. Do you think it's ok to reach out to someone in my dept who already qualified and ask to see their papers? I think it would be so helpful if I had something to reference.",

For me it was really helpful to see some answers that passed and some that failed just to see the level of detail that was appropriate. Beyond that, it\u2019s not like the actual answer is something you can \u201csteal,\u201d since questions change so much anyway. But doesn\u2019t hurt to ask just in case they\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t.",

My department keeps a list of all the questions faculty have asked and offer to let students refer to it, but having completed that process not too long ago, I'm really glad I didn't. In my department, professors do not ask broad, general questions. They tend to ask questions that relate somewhat specifically to your research interests, so referring to the paper of another student whose research interests are different than mine would have been a waste of time. \n\nIf you are looking for advice on things like length and formatting, then I could see how that would be helpful, or if your departmental norm is for qual questions to be more broad then that could also be a situation where it would be helpful to see a successful paper. However, before reaching out to other students, it might be more constructive to speak to your adviser first.",

      "text": "It may help in getting to know how peers think through your field, but typically quals or comps are written in pretty individualized ways. I would ask whoever your advisor is about it.\n\nFor my school, there was one general question and two individual questions. All were written in a manner in which they were not possible to study for. For us, that last part was the entire point, to test how you as an individual process a question in your field, not how you paraphrase others' opinions.",
