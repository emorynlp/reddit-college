I should be done either in December or May with a MS in engineering. But holy hell do I hate it now. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t find aspects interesting, but the field is too toxic with how they treat us. Most of my friends in the field are working well over 40 hours a week. Mentorship is really hit and miss, it seems people just expect you to know everything and don\u2019t want to train you. I\u2019ve grown really bitter and I feel I\u2019m not the only one who has felt like this.

I hear about a lot of computer engineering jobs here in Seattle that aren't that bad.\n\nMy experience was the same in physics...now about 10 years out, I see a lot of my disdain was the environment was too stressful, while a good portion was that I just grew out of the interest.\n\nIt sounds like you are burnt out and not inspired by the future opportunities. It's not a bad idea to take a break for a while. I would try to separate your interest in engineering from your experience in a certain unsupportive environment. There are engineering firms that treat people well.\n\nIf you really don't like engineering anymore, that's fine. A good friend of mine became a pastor instead, I am doing life coaching and teaching, there are many ways to survive in this world.

In neuro, I see engineers killing it all.  I think it's easier to come over with technical skills and learn all the brain stuff after, than for typical neuro route.  Additionally, I know we have some engineers in position that have come on and learned how to do MRI and do tasks not all related to their degrees.  But they know how to code, and think logically.  Take a look outside the field, I think you'll find other fields are happy to snatch you up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. a Ph.D. should not result in real debt.

What I can advise, is think through what points caused you this much difficulty and stress.  What questions can you ask for a future career move (during the Q/A session of a work interview) to target and understand these pain points?  Take this difficult and pain in the ass experience that's drained your interest and turn it back around to recognize how do I find a positive environment to flourish in.\n\nAlso reflect on why you chose the field you're interested in.
