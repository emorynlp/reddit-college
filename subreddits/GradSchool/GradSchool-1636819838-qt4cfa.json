  "text": "Hi! A few days ago I posted this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qq5wks/i_literally_dont_care_anymore/). All your comments were so kind and supportive. It really helped to feel less alone in this, because I had been cooped up alone trying to write feeling like the only person to exist.\n\nI\u2019m really proud to say that I did it! I definitely didn\u2019t submit it on time, it was 3 days late. And what I wrote was frankly horrible. It\u2019s a pass at least. I don\u2019t care (but in a good way this time). I did it!!!\n\nMy therapist called me that night to check in (she knew I wasn\u2019t doing well) and advised me that night to drop out of the unit. But faced with that reality, I was smacked out of it. I realised, I would either have to redo the process of classes and the assignments I had already completed all over again\u2026 and go through the absolute anguish of feeling like a failure for not being able to do it and extending my degree when I am desperate for the next stage of my life \u2026. Just to be faced with having to write this damned assignment all over again? I just couldn\u2019t. I would be delaying the inevitable and making everything so much worse.\n\nWith the realisation that not doing it would be so much worse than the pain of doing it\u2026 I bit the bullet. I accepted that whatever I was going to make would be crap and definitely late. Passable, but crap. But doing that was better than having to go through this again.\n\nSo, I forced out my crap. Like truely, it felt like trying to shit when you are constipated. Every single word felt like torture, like genuinely excruciating. Every sentence felt stupid and subpar. But I kept squeezing and straining (I have no idea why I am using a poo metaphor sorry lmfao), taking many mini breaks when I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\n\nI downloaded a program that blocks websites on my computer and set it to 24 hours, because I didn\u2019t trust myself in weaker moments if it were less. When I realised I was using my phone to procrastinate instead, I literally turned it off and asked my Mum to hide it from me so I couldn\u2019t use it anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t think I have magically cured my tendency to freeze up like this, avoid, be a perfectionist or procrastinate. This has been a problem for a very long time. But what this experience has shown me is that it doesn\u2019t have to be my destiny, I can rewrite the script. Hopefully, eventually, I will learn to force myself earlier so I don\u2019t have to go through the emotional turmoil and anxiety I have over the past few weeks.\n\nI have two more assignments to go for this semester now, and I really really want to do this. I now know I can break the cycle of dropping out at the last minute. Submitting the piece of shit I wrote feels so much better than dropping out ever has. Those assignments dont have to be the next great discovery. Or even good. Just done. I will just get them done.",

And yes anything is better than nothing!\n\nPlease continue to see your therapist, this is exactly how I was feeling last semester and completely burnt out. Things got worse for me though, so my therapist recommended a doctor where I was diagnosed with anxiety. I've been taking medication for it and it's really helped. Just reach out for help if you need it, you can do it and if it gets too bad please let someone know. I hope you don't have to suffer much longer.",
