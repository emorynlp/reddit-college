  "text": "Hi all. I'm doing an online program to achieve a degree in library science. . .and I'm burnt out.  \n\n\nI barely graduated with my Bachelor's; I was homeless and scurrying to find a place to live. Still, I intended to see my chances of making it into a master's program in the fall. And I did.  \n\n\nI'm in my first semester. Doing well (grade-wise, participation-wise; I even set-up a Discord server and I'm monitoring it as a mod for our entire class, which has been super advantageous for us all since we're in a distance program). However, with varying personal affairs and a not-so flexible work schedule. . .I'm burning out.  \n\n\nI hit the ground running going into this. But I keep thinking about wanting to do this program \\_right\\_, in my perspective, which means being near the campus to get the full experience I've never had. The entirety of this is something I never thought I'd have (let's call it 'secularly blessed').\n\nI'm going to finish this semester strong, but I want to know if taking time off to really balance out my priorities is possible, since I now know what this graduate school thing is all about. It's also making me lose my mind to be on a screen so much. I'm usually quite active/generally restless and have abandoned many hobbies to really 'maintain' myself. However. . .I don't want to mess this all up.  \n\n\nThank you for reading.",

(If you Google \"\\[institution name\\] graduate school leave of absence\" you'll likely find relevant online documentation and policies.)",

At my university they call them case managers. \n\nI got to a point where the thought of sending emails to explain myself to professors was impossible, so having someone in my corner helped",

I wasn\u2019t sure who to contact in my department, so I called the number _for_ the department itself. Not sure who I was transferred to, but I left a message. No response yet.\n\nShould I try reaching out to my advisor? She\u2019s just uh. . .a bit abrasive with such subjects.",
