  "text": "Does anyone have any tips for a job searcher switching career? I'm done my coursework and am just finishing up my thesis, graduating in May 2022. I used to be a public librarian, and my research is focused on the political economy of adopting renewable energy. I am familiar with quantitative and qualitative research methodology, and am broadly familiar with the field of social science. I am looking to get into a research/analyst position, or possibly planning. The problem I keep running into is required experience. Any help would be appreciated!",

      "text": "I would highly recommend your university's career department, if yours has one. I have worked a ton of random jobs just to pay the rent which have no relatable experience to my field lol, and they helped me tailor my resume and cover letter to apply to jobs. I have volunteered a lot, so they recommended that I mention my volunteer experience and my research experience, and to extract aspects of your past jobs that could help. I have no knowledge of adopting renewable energy, so I couldn't really give you field specific help. You could also ask your advisor, I know that my MA advisor gets a lot of job listing emails from recruiters, so they might be able to help you transfer your experience.",

      "text": "Are you in the US? Have you looked at the national/govt labs focusing on renewable energy (EX: PNNL, Argonne)? They typically have lots of job openings for recent grads, in many locations around the states. I figure other countries probably have this type of facility as well. I think they're usually more science/engineering focused, but it seems to me like they might have policy/analyst positions as well to fulfill their directives.",
