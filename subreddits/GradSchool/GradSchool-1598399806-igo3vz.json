  "text": "Hi all,\n\nA while back I posted on here and r/PhD asking for some tips on how to remember the massive amount of information that PhD students have to read in the form of journal articles to become familiar with their field. Reddit really came through and gave me some awesome advice, so I wanted to finally get around to compiling most of the tips I got. Hopefully this is helpful for someone, it definitely was for me! \n\n**Tips from the Reddity Depths on Remembering Articles and Crap:**\n\n* take notes while you read, then generate a short summary. This can then be added in addition to the actual paper to Zotero or similar applications\n* add tags and keywords to every paper you read in\u00a0 Mendeley\n* organize papers\u00a0 based on what study/topic they're related to\n* take notes and then extract that info into Anki, which will create flashcards for you to\u00a0 practice spaced repetition\n* take notes in a paper notebook, number each entry, and then for any given paper you're writing, identify which numbers are relevant and list them out\n* take notes on paper but also make an executive summary with a few key bullet points - paste these & any important figures into a\u00a0 document\n* after you read, explain the article out loud to yourself, including the name of the researcher (pretend to be teaching it)\n* look to answer specific questions. You'll be more likely to remember features of articles if you're trying to answer a question\n* take a break! If you're drowning in reading you'll lose track of all of it.\u00a0 Go easy on yourself and take a walk or a nap\u00a0\n* read similar papers close together; bundle by topic\n* use spritzinc.com for speed reading. readsy.co lets you upload articles and then spritzinc will show you one word at a time which massively increases your reading speed. Probably more helpful for the humanities where there aren't as many detailed figures/graphs\n* for each paper, do a 3-sentence\u00a0 summary and include why it's important to your research\n* read a few paragraphs at a time, then try to summarize from memory into your notes in these chunks\n* the day after reading a new paper, take 5 minutes to try to remember everything you read. then go back and fill in whatever parts you couldn't remember\u00a0\n* rate each paper on both relevance and quality from\u00a0 1 - 5 stars,\u00a0 which is helpful for organizing sources and prioritizing which papers are most important to remember.",

      "text": "These are great tips but unfortunately super unrealistic and also way too much work to do for each article. If you were to do all these things together it would make your reading time really inefficient, which is a big deal when you are a graduate student with a ton of work and your main focus is to move your research along. Also, a lot of these tips become useless as you advance in your studies as you no longer need to keep regurgitating and summarizing each article if you are familiar with your topic. It\u2019s a great list for first year graduates who are still learning how to read articles and do literature reviews. I absolutely agree that using a reference manager, highlighting, taking a few relevant notes, and tagging articles is super helpful and in my opinion much more efficient. HOWEVER, everyone learns and studies in their own way, I\u2019m just saying that this may be an unrealistic reading process once you try to adapt it into your weekly schedule.",

      "text": "I'm personally not a fan of paper notebooks anymore. What really works well for me in grad classes is to type notes in my own words in a single Microsoft Word document for that class. It makes topics easily searchable. This works even better on a touchscreen tablet with a pen so I can hand write the notes or draw figures in the document if I need to. At the end of one class I'd have over a hundred pages of searchable notes and figures to study from for the final.\n\nDitto the above for taking notes on a paper as you're reading it.\n\nAlso for sources for writing your own paper. NUMBER THE LINKS AS YOU FIND THEM. Even if you're using a different citation format that doesn't use numbers or the sources end up out of order. It's far easier to type a number when you add a citation and then fix all the citations after you complete the writing part of the paper.",
