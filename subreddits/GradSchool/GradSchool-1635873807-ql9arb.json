  "title:": "How To Discuss Poor Grade In Committee Meeting",
  "text": "Hi. So I've done three courses in grad school, one A+, one B, and one C-. A+ was a gimme course, B was my wheelhouse, and C- happened after a really rough month (severe depression, burnout, and dealing with some harassment and some rough interactions with my supervisor). \n\nMy question is: how I should explain the C- and B to my committee... should I be super honest, or should I hold back the excuses as much as possible? Obviously it's a balance, but in your all experience, what kind of details are acceptable? Are there any phrases that you've seen have a good track record? Any advice much appreciated. Thanks.'\n\nBonus paragraph:\n\nFor reference, after this terrible month (August), I finally started exercising, medicating, and seeing a therapist regularly, and I've made some really promising progress in my personal life. I \\*think\\* things with my research are returning back to the pace and quality it was at before. I've got 2 months until the meeting to get my stuff together.",

      "text": "Brutal honesty, always. \n\nThe steps you have taken to improve your chances of success going forward (therapy, exercise, etc.) are all evidence of your ability to recognize a problem and address it in a professional, positive manner. In my experience, it\u2019s not that you stumbled, but the tangible initiative you show to improve your landscape going forward that matters more in grad school. We\u2019re prepping for the real world here :-) If your committee cares about you, they will respect your maturity and positive outlook. You\u2019ve got this, chin up! \n(Open to DM\u2019s if you want to talk further)",

      "text": "I'm also curious to gather more input around this topic, since I've had a few bad experiences with this during both undergrad and master's.\n\nMy \"rule\" was to never bother or burden professors with specifics about my life, especially a few years ago when talking about mental health was more of a taboo.\n\nI had a very difficult time during my semester abroad in undergrad and got a bad grade in one of my classes. When I got back, my advisor asked about it and I said I got overwhelmed with the class. Their answer was very much rude (in the likes of Legally Blonde's \"like, is it hard?\"). It stung.\n\nIf you do know about someone in your department or program who's been in a similar position to yours (grade-wise), maybe try to find out how their experience with the committee was. There are people willing to talk about it, I guess.",

      "text": "I didnt really have interactions like this with my committee (my committee meetings were like \u201chey guys everythings chill Im defending in two weeks\u201d) but me and my supervisor were tight by the end. We had some rough patches but those were really when I thought I needed to be closed off. Really telling her everything helped a lot - job problems, life problems, even telling her stuff like coming out to her and just letting her into my life in a way that allowed her to see that Im not a robot and that we can get along, but that Im busy as hell and she cant expect me to be in the lab 24/7 was the best thing. \n\nIf you had bad experiences with your advisor, you should really try to turn it around - and be careful with the term \u201charassment\u201d. Was it like sexual harassment/invasion of privacy or was it them bugging you for results or productivity and you felt overwhelmed by their insistence on things you didnt have (or something along those lines)? Because at the end of the day, your advisor has a job to do beyond mentor you, which is produce research so I can see how bugging/nagging or after hours communication about academic topics can be perceived as harassment, but thats partially an issue on your end not setting boundaries. If it was SA/non-academic invasion of personal time, then thats a bigger issue that you should elevate, but I think if its not, you should look at professional boundary setting and fostering that professional relationship to avoid labelling your advisor as \u201charassing\u201d.",

          "text": "Harassment was not from my supervisor, but they certainly didn't make the situation easier when they probed me for details and ignored standard procedures to handle the situation on their own. The rough spots were mainly me being uncomfortable that my privacy wasn't really respected (although to some extent, you have to understand the problem to solve it). It's more of a overstepping thing with my supervisor, that led to things being shared that didn't need to be shared. Didn't help that my research slowed down during this time as well.",
