  "text": "I earned my MS in Emergency Management with a concentration in Disaster Resilience today.\n\nIt's been a journey. I flunked out of undergrad my sophomore year in 2007 with a 1.1 GPA. I drove a semi-truck and went to a community college online in 2013. I graduated and left that life and I went back to school in 2015, brought my GPA up into the mid 3's, and earned a BS in Logistics in 2017. I immediately took the GRE, applied to grad school, and now I've got my masters degree. Although my parents are gone, I'm the first in my family to have any higher education at any level. My father was a hard man, and I often wonder if he would have been proud.\n\nI'm off to help in the fight against COVID-19 as an emergency management specialist at the county level. My hope and dream is to help rebuild the federal emergency management infrastructure so we can have some sort of functioning emergency leadership available to states in the next administration. Until then, I remain dedicated to helping the most socially vulnerable communities in our county.\n\nMy wife is a public educator, and I could not have completed this without her unyielding support, encouragement, and love.",

It's people like you. \n\nAnd you're goddamn lucky to have your wife and your life partner with you to support you. Take heart in it and show the same support and empathy to everyone else, as I'm sure you will do. \n\nBe proud of yourself and never lose sight of your goals.\n\nGood luck my friend!",
