I agree that if possible, it\u2019s best to create some distance from your dad if possible especially financially. I will say that I remember my parents being highly skeptical of the grad student model where you get paid to be a GA and free tuition on top of it. My dad had a four year degree from a smaller school and wasn\u2019t particularly great at it, and my mom earned an associates, so it was simply something they didn\u2019t know or understand. It became more real for them once I did get my first offer, and even though our relationship had become fairly strained, the space helped us a lot. After four years, they still don\u2019t fully \u201cget it\u201d but they have a much better idea of how academia works than they did. \n\nWith that said, if you are required to report, make sure you do. Like others have said, get an apartment. Make sure you think about expenses like parking assuming the university will require you to pay, and how you\u2019ll cover transportation otherwise if you don\u2019t drive. You can always take out student loans if you need them, even if you don\u2019t accept all the money they offer. You may want to check to see if you\u2019ll have to pay fees as well; I was unpleasantly surprised with a $1200 bill due in October my first semester. A lot of universities are making announcements right now to try to reassure students about what their future in the fall might look like, but the reality is that we won\u2019t entirely know until we get closer because things are somewhat unpredictable.
