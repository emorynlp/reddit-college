Dont make it your deciding factor, but keep in mind that at the end of the day (and no program will tell you this), but if you decide to go for a PhD later, programs will judge you a little less favorably for coming from a random school that they probably havent heard of versus an applicant that is coming from a more reputable program. Make your decision based on where the professors are doing research that interests you, but if you can find professors doing cool research at highly ranked programs, shoot for those.",

Going for the top ranked universities overall may mean little for your specific field, and the top universities for your field can even mean little in terms of subfields. \n\nExample: if you were to look at the top schools in the US for physics, U Chicago and Harvard pop up pretty consistently, so you might think those might be good choices for me to have applied to as a physicist right? Not when you consider that I specifically do *space weather and ionospheric physics* which neither of those universities really study at all in their physics departments. The top schools for space weather physics are actually UCLA, UNH, U Alaska Fairbanks, and UT Dallas, all of which come across much further down in the overall physics rankings.\n\nAnd even then I ended up at this specific school because I wanted to work with a prof who studied computational modelling of extreme solar events, which is an even *narrower* set of research from space weather overall.\n\nAt the PhD level what matters the most is research, anf that means you need to have an extremely specific idea of what you want to do, and what universities are best equipped to let you do that. That means looking for profs who specialize in that area of work, and universities with plenty of specialized labs and research equipment for it. This may or may not correlate well with overall rankings depending on what you do.",

      "text": "I didn't look at University rankings or the university itself.  That's not an important metric for deciding which grad school to go to (or, in my opinion, it's a lazy way of deciding).\n\nYes I did for undergrad, as undergraduate program is pretty much what those evaluated rankings are commonly based on and that's the product each university is selling you.  But for graduate programs the professor you work with is more important than the university ranking itself.  If you don't want to look at the professor level, then at least look at the program level, but realistically the professor's the more important one.  \n\nThe professor you work with will be your boss.  The person who advises and guides you in your growth and, for many people you meet, is where your reputation starts at.  (\"Oh you work with Dr X?  Yeah I'm familiar of their work.\").  You're in a much smaller cadre than your undergrad program and those interpersonal connections are much more important.  \n\nSo to give actual advice.  \n\n1. Think about what you actually want to do within the major you're interested in.  This will help narrow down what you want your subject to be (and select which professor you want to work with at each university).\n2. Look at the department's faculty list and each professors' research interests and what they do.  Even look at their recent publications on their website or Google Scholar page.  Get a general idea on who they also collaborate with (this is another way to expand your list of professors/universities you want to work with).  Also check them out on Web of Science.  \n3. Look at the Professor's students.  How many they have currently and where their students ended up.\n\nThis will help you build the short-list of programs and professors you want to work with.  By this point, next steps are to actually reach out and start talking with these professors, whether through networking (through a professor you're friendly with in the program or other ways), or just cold emailing.  \n\nNext step is to probably try and set up a meeting with that professor and talk with them about your research interests.  Understand what's expected out of their lab and their students (what measures of success do they keep track of).  Where their current students are.  What the program's like.  etc.  If you can also talk with a current grad student get in contact with them and see what the lab environment is like and what they recommend.  If it's a hard lab environment then the grad student will probably tell you.  \n\nThis should help you narrow down like 2-3 people.",

Depending on your program, you may find that some professors have research background in the area you\u2019re interested. You also may have professors that make it difficult to learn from. For example, my biostatistics professor was brilliant but because of his accent it was very hard to understand him",

Looking at the current faculty and what they are doing is the key. See if there is anything you are interested in or passionate about. You can email them, as well as people that have come from that lab to get an idea of how they work. The area around the university is also important. If you work well in smaller college towns or large cities is also an important thing to consider. Once you start to get interviews though is when you get useful data. How you feel when you are there (if you get to visit in person that is) as well as how you get along with the faculty and other students. You also get a feel for the general morale of the department and what to expect should you join.",
