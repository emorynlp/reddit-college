Not when you consider that I specifically do *space weather and ionospheric physics* which neither of those universities really study at all in their physics departments. The top schools for space weather physics are actually UCLA, UNH, U Alaska Fairbanks, and UT Dallas, all of which come across much further down in the overall physics rankings.\n\nAnd even then I ended up at this specific school because I wanted to work with a prof who studied computational modelling of extreme solar events, which is an even *narrower* set of research from space weather overall.\n\nAt the PhD level what matters the most is research, anf that means you need to have an extremely specific idea of what you want to do, and what universities are best equipped to let you do that. That means looking for profs who specialize in that area of work, and universities with plenty of specialized labs and research equipment for it.

That's not an important metric for deciding which grad school to go to (or, in my opinion, it's a lazy way of deciding).\n\nYes I did for undergrad, as undergraduate program is pretty much what those evaluated rankings are commonly based on and that's the product each university is selling you.  But for graduate programs the professor you work with is more important than the university ranking itself.  If you don't want to look at the professor level, then at least look at the program level, but realistically the professor's the more important one.  \n\nThe professor you work with will be your boss.  The person who advises and guides you in your growth and, for many people you meet, is where your reputation starts at.  (\"Oh you work with Dr X?  Yeah I'm familiar of their work.\").  You're in a much smaller cadre than your undergrad program and those interpersonal connections are much more important.  \n\nSo to give actual advice.  \n\n1. Think about what you actually want to do within the major you're interested in.  This will help narrow down what you want your subject to be (and select which professor you want to work with at each university).\n2. Look at the department's faculty list and each professors' research interests and what they do.  Even look at their recent publications on their website or Google Scholar page.  Get a general idea on who they also collaborate with (this is another way to expand your list of professors/universities you want to work with).  Also check them out on Web of Science.  \n3. Look at the Professor's students.  How many they have currently and where their students ended up.\n\nThis will help you build the short-list of programs and professors you want to work with.  By this point, next steps are to actually reach out and start talking with these professors, whether through networking (through a professor you're friendly with in the program or other ways), or just cold emailing.  \n\nNext step is to probably try and set up a meeting with that professor and talk with them about your research interests.  Understand what's expected out of their lab and their students (what measures of success do they keep track of).  Where their current students are.  What the program's like.  etc.  If you can also talk with a current grad student get in contact with them and see what the lab environment is like and what they recommend.  If it's a hard lab environment then the grad student will probably tell you.  \n\nThis should help you narrow down like 2-3 people.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1630619674, "upvotes": 6}, "hbda04t": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgmz63/how_do_you_even_begin_to_shortlist_universities/hbda04t/", "text": "1.
