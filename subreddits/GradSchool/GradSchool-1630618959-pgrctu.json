This raises my first concern; how to navigate an environment where I am one of the only properly \"new\" students? \n\nAfter I finish my MS I intend to pursue a PhD, which necessitates another move (university I am at does not have PhD program). Moving away from my undergrad friends has been tough and I am already feeling fairly alone and isolated. I don't have troubles meeting people, but I do have troubles connecting with people and so I don't typically have a ton of friends, but a handful of close ones. I am having a bit of mental conflict about how the next few years of my life will go because there is an end date of my time at this current university so my friendships will also have an impending end date. Does anyone have suggestions on how to move past this \"fear\" of making friends that you will lose when you inevitably move again?", "author": "pentemc", "created": 1630618959, "retrieved": 1632845075, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "comments": {"hbefkmk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pgrctu/people_who_have_started_at_new_universities/hbefkmk/", "text": "I got married so she's stuck with me and that's good enough I guess for me.

Mine was once a 13 hour time difference and it sucked on maintaining a friendship department.\n\nIt's hard.  But you make do.  I'd say easiest first point of contact is to become friends with people in your cohort.  Some of the more senior grad students will also be willing to be friends with you and talk with you, and help you \"integrate\" into the program (well they should anyways).  After all, you're all in the same office and workspace and dealing with the same bullshit (grad school).  For most, it's friendship by situation, not friendship by choice.  But those friendships are very helpful and honestly, it'll help you out when you're in a stressful grad school situation that your \"college friends\" can't relate to.\n\nEven then it'll be hard.  So treat it as what it is.  You're in a new place, a new job, and you're out looking for new friends and people.  This can be in student life (aka clubs, university affiliated orgs, etc.), or locally (local clubs, groups, classes, etc.).\n\nFriends from college are great and very much valued, but over time some will be hard to reach, others will continue to be there.  It's part of the fact that you're all no longer in the same place, able to hang out.  It'll happen, but those who you are close to should stay as long as long as both of yall put in the effort to stay connected.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the important thing is you.  Take care of yourself.  With how difficult grad school can be, I'd say it's ok for friends to come second.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1630620418, "upvotes": 4}}}
