  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI posted about 1 week ago about desparately wanting to leave my masters degree - [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jdsa4a/anyone\\_else\\_desperately\\_want\\_to\\_get\\_out\\_of\\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/jdsa4a/anyone_else_desperately_want_to_get_out_of_their/)\n\nI've been mulling it over for a very long time, but this week I finally decided that I'm leaving. Props to all of you that excel in graduate school, but it definitely isn't for me. \n\nI'm going to put all of my energy into my business and continue to grow it because it's what I love to do. \n\nI decided to email my PI to schedule a meeting about leaving and how to make the transition out of my role as seamless as possible.\n\nI feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I'm 100% sure this was the right decision.\n\nThank you all for your help last week, and best of luck with your graduate programs!",

I quit a masters program under a pI, and eventually finished it under a different advisor.\n\nWhat helped me was thinking \u201cI\u2019ll be successful with or without this degree. This degree doesn\u2019t define me, and it\u2019s  honestly not a good use of my time, energy, and stress at this point in my life\u201d",

I was in a competitive masters program doing something I thought I would like but ended up hating. I was surrounded by people I had 0 in common with and I hated the culture. I finally transferred to a different program doing something I LOVE. I am so much happier. And I\u2019m happy for you. Good luck :)",

What kind of business would you want to pursue?\n\nIt\u2019s okay to walk away and quit something for your mental health or have time to do what you really wanted to do (your business). I did last month (PhD) and I have zero regrets. My mental health was deteriorating and I wanted more time to focus on my job and work on my business as well.\nI wish you luck in your endeavors! \u2618\ufe0f",

You don\u2019t need that degree and you have a business and side project already, so that\u2019s smart of you to quit when you have an actually job or business. When I quit, I had a job already so I can pay back loans and the bills. \n\nI had family members disappointed in my decision, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m the one who has to live with this decision, not them. Life is short! My cousin, just passed away and he had many dreams unfulfilled. He was young, in his forties. This pandemic has really made me see how precious and short life really is. I would be upset if I died and had nothing to show for it but to wasted my life getting a degree I didn\u2019t care about and not fulfilling my dreams. I want to live!
