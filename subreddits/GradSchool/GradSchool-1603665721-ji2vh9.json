Props to all of you that excel in graduate school, but it definitely isn't for me. \n\nI'm going to put all of my energy into my business and continue to grow it because it's what I love to do. \n\nI decided to email my PI to schedule a meeting about leaving and how to make the transition out of my role as seamless as possible.\n\nI feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and I'm 100% sure this was the right decision.\n\nThank you all for your help last week, and best of luck with your graduate programs!", "author": "getnooks", "created": 1603665721, "retrieved": 1632953742, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 466, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ga64kz9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ji2vh9/leaving_grad_shool/ga64kz9/", "text": "Good for you, it is such a difficult decision to make.

I finally transferred to a different program doing something I LOVE. I am so much happier. And I\u2019m happy for you.
