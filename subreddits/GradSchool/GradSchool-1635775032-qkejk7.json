  "text": "To keep it short, I\u2019ve been struggling with lack of motivation, attention span, procrastination, forgetting things, and general messiness. \n\nI\u2019m going for a consult with health services about possible reasons including depression/ADHD. However I noticed that I didn\u2019t struggle as much with these things during undergrad. The only other difference is I started smoking weed again during the pandemic/my first year of grad school. I\u2019ll be honest with health services of course, but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else noticed changes after starting to smoke. My short term memory is absolute shit these days. Thanks in advance",

      "text": "Starting to use a drug is often a response to changes in mood. Also, many mental illnesses manifest around 20-25, so feeling different than you did in undergrad is fairly normal.\n\nIf you're anxious about your smoking you should try stopping, if you feel like you need to smoke to feel calm/okay, it is likely a sign of a mental illness that you consult with a doctor about before using weed to self medicate.\n\nI am glad you set up an appointment. That's the first step to feeling better and becoming productive again.",

I feel like its destroyed my autobiographical memory too and I'm much worse with names and faces. \n\nBut take it all with a grain of salt. Everyone reacts differently and your level of use could be a big factor in what you experience. Check r/leaves if you want more resources",

But I argue that is often the exception and not the rule in regards to that. \n\nIt could be a bit of both, depression/anxiety/ADHD often manifest under heavy stress, and grad school is a stressful time! Try cutting back/quitting for a bit while also getting in touch with mental health professionals (cause at the end of the day, they will know more than we do most likely)",

Glad to see you are also getting in touch with a health provider. Mental health issues can appear later in life (as another commenter said) and it is always best to get them checked out early so you can connect with a therapist and learn coping mechanisms/start medication (if it's needed).",
