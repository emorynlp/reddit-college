  "text": "To keep it short, I\u2019ve been struggling with lack of motivation, attention span, procrastination, forgetting things, and general messiness. \n\nI\u2019m going for a consult with health services about possible reasons including depression/ADHD. However I noticed that I didn\u2019t struggle as much with these things during undergrad. The only other difference is I started smoking weed again during the pandemic/my first year of grad school. I\u2019ll be honest with health services of course, but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else noticed changes after starting to smoke. My short term memory is absolute shit these days. Thanks in advance",

      "text": "Starting to use a drug is often a response to changes in mood. Also, many mental illnesses manifest around 20-25, so feeling different than you did in undergrad is fairly normal.\n\nIf you're anxious about your smoking you should try stopping, if you feel like you need to smoke to feel calm/okay, it is likely a sign of a mental illness that you consult with a doctor about before using weed to self medicate.\n\nI am glad you set up an appointment. That's the first step to feeling better and becoming productive again.",
