  "text": "Trying to contact a former professor for my MLIS application to write a letter of recommendation. I found their LinkedIn profile, but I can't find an email address anywhere. Is it okay to contact them there? Would I put the whole request in a LinkedIn message or ask them for an email to make the formal request?",

      "text": "Are they no longer a professor at any institution? It seems weird that you wouldn't be able to get their email from somewhere. Regardless LinkedIn should be fine. I would probably just send a short message telling them you would like to contact them about a letter of rec and would like their email because you are going to need their email regardless.",
