They did not see my initial email until I re-sent it a week after no reply. They agreed to meet with me and said they would be available on 10/1. I replied the same day by suggesting times that would work for me and asked about her availability but received no response (this was about 2 weeks ago). \n\nSince the 1st is this Friday, I sent another email today to try to set up a meeting time or asking if she would prefer to meet a different day. I don\u2019t feel optimistic about getting a response as I know this is a busy time for professors, but I need to know if I should start working on an application for the lab or not. Should I email again in a day if I don\u2019t get a response? I don\u2019t want to be a bother but I also don\u2019t want to get lost in the unreturned email graveyard.", "author": "dankins777", "created": 1632785253, "retrieved": 1632843927, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hej6vkc": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwtcix/how_to_get_an_email_response_from_a_potential/hej6vkc/", "text": "You should try to reach out again. However, it may be a sign the type of advisor you'll be dealing with, so keep that in mind. As their student, will it be this difficult to schedule a meeting, are they always this busy?\n\nWhen I reached out to schools I generally didn't pursue if the communication was poor. I had a similar situation to yours with a prof at UNC and they tried to reschedule our meeting the day-of and never got back to me (stood up).
