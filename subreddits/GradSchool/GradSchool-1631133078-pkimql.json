It\u2019s been about a month into the semester after being gone all summer doing an internship. I was so depressed and anxious all summer and the last month that I made the idea of going to the lab and running samples a huge deal in my head. Every day I would tell myself I need to go but I just couldn\u2019t drag myself out of the house to go. I literally went in, pressed two buttons, sorted out my samples, and then left. Talk about anxiety making a mountain out of a molehill. This is a huge step for me starting back up and getting things for my research going. I know what all I need to do, it\u2019s just so hard to get myself to do it sometimes. Any one else feeling stuck like I did?", "author": "Suff_erin_g", "created": 1631133078, "retrieved": 1632844694, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc9igxz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkimql/i_finally_went_back_out_to_my_lab_and_started_my/hc9igxz/", "text": "You hear that data.

Like eventually I have a ton of stuff to do but I don't know why I keep acting like I need to get it all done in an afternoon. It's literally not even possible even if I weren't overwhelmed??\n\nGood job, Op. I think I'll go back to the lab on Monday (the next day I have more than half an hour) to sort my samples.", "author": "KiwiTheKitty", "created": 1631196749, "upvotes": 2}, "hc481cb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkimql/i_finally_went_back_out_to_my_lab_and_started_my/hc481cb/", "text": "YES. I was so stuck. I have been avoiding campus and it\u2019s just been terrible. I have some major CPTSD stuff going on. And today I went up to campus for lunch for the first time this semester.
