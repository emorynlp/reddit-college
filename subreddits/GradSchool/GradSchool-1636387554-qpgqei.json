  "text": "Hey everyone!   \n\n\nI recently started my Ph.D. and I'm super excited about it. However, a new problem has been created in terms of my training. I used to lift 3x a week and run 3x a week. I don't have a problem in terms of running, but lifting is kind of difficult now.\n\nThe reason is my hometown has just a few small gyms. And unfortunately, the time I am available is when the gyms are super crowded and not being able for me to have proper strength training. I don't know what I should do in terms of strength training or if there is any good program to follow at home.  \n\n\nAny of you went through anything similar? Thank you!",

It\u2019s difficult, but with a little time management, you should be able to get some decent lifting sessions in. Failing that, a good set of adjustable dumbbells should help with home workouts.",

Then if you like it, it might be worth investing in some dumbbells and/or resistance bands to bump up the difficulty. \n\nIn my experience, these workouts don't really do the same thing as heavy compound lifts if that is what you are used to, but they are good workouts and can supplement your running. The benefit to the at home workouts is time flexibility and not having to deal with crowds or traveling to a gym.\n\nDuring lockdown I did 3 days running, 3 days strength YouTube workouts and enjoyed it. I've gone back to the gym now and greatly prefer it, but I do know people who prefer the at home workouts and have not gone back to the gym. So definitely worth a try to see if you enjoy it.",

On days that I have class, I will either take a walk or just stretch. Some weeks I make it to the gym 4x, other weeks I never make it in. \n\nI have considered buying a barbell for my house, but realistically I would never use it because I don\u2019t like working out by myself. I do think this is a great option for you if you like home workouts! \n\nGood luck!!",

The adjustable dumbbells are the best purchase I made in the last few years, I can fit them in my apartment along with a foldable bench and some resistance bands, I can do 90% of what I would do at a gym.\n\nOne last piece of advice: make time for your health, even when your schedule is crazy. I know for me working out has been so important for both my physical and mental health during grad school. I had a coworker who had a stroke during her first year as a PhD student.

Having worked night shift in the past I wake up super early, like 3AM and go then (its nearly always empty then). Then I come home and study until I have to go to lab, then come home and go to bed early at like 9. I know that schedule isn't for everyone, but that's how I've been getting around it. If you are more of a night person, you could always go later like after 9 or 10.\n\nOtherwise, hit up craigslist for gym equipment. I've found some good deals there. My problem is a that I live in a tiny apartment with no space for big gym equipment (I would prefer to workout at home), but that's a no go for me. If you have the space, that may also be a good route to look into.",
