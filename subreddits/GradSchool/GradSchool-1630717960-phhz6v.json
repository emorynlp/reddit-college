I have a 10 hr TA and 5 hr GA, 18 credit hours by requirement, and am also looking for a job, so I anticipate not having much time this semester. In fact, the head of my department (and my mentor) handed out a paper that detailed exactly how we need to get 30-50 hours in the studio a week, outside of classes. I've talked to the 2nd years and they've said that he's serious about this, and that they just \"don't eat\" during the day. This professor once made the grad student I'm a TA for paint 20 paintings over one weekend (for context: one painting typically takes this guy 2-3 weeks, which is standard for oil paintings).\n\n  Each of my days, 6/7 days of the week, range from 10-12 hour days atm, and I don't see this changing. In undergrad I would just make large meals and pack my leftovers, but I tried bringing my leftovers to the studio 4 days in a row and couldn't find time to eat them. I've stocked my studio with Clif bars, which have been a lifesaver, but I know that's not the right nutrition or enough to stay healthy and not lose weight. I plan on keeping a large container of cashews as well, but does anyone have other suggestions for quick but nutritious snacks? \n\nAnd to clarify: part of the issue here is that, with COVID, we aren't supposed to eat in the building, so to eat a proper meal I would need to go outside and sit down. With the short bursts of studio time (2 hours or so before, then between, and then after classes), I can't justify leaving the studio for that long. Again, I've tried to bring real food, it just doesn't work out. With snacky food, I can quickly toss it in my mouth and put my mask back on, so I don't feel the need to go outside, especially since we're allowed to do the same exact thing for drinking water and I'm also vaccinated. \n\nIf you guys have any suggestions, I would really appreciate them. I was not anticipating my studies to be this intense this year, so I feel thoroughly unprepared.

Also like to have a good mix of light, substantial, and expansive (stuff that will absorb water in your stomach like dried fruit); flavor options (salty, sweet, umami, spicy); and sophistication (salami and cheese vs a fruit cup)\n\nAnother thing that may help is to commit to eating one real, very large, meal; either before you leave in the morning or when you get home. Prep these for the week so it\u2019s quick and easy.
