  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm in my second year of my masters and my advisor seems to have just vanished. I was supposed to get funding this semester for doing a fellowship. I didn't hear anything from her about after the semester started, and had to talk to the department head after she didn't reply to my emails about it. She sent me some forms to fill out, then nothing after that. I still haven't got the money I'm supposed to be getting. Luckily I have some savings to fall back onto and have a part time job to pay the bills, but things are tight and I'm tired from having to continue working so much along with my fellowship and doing thesis research. \n\nI have an advisor through the institution I'm doing my fellowship with. He's great and very helpful, but there are some things with my project with them that I'm a little lost on and he can't really help with. I tried emailing my university advisor about it last week, but still haven't heard anything back from her. To be honest, I'm getting a bit ticked with this. She hasn't met with me since August, she never went over the thesis outline I sent her shortly after that, she's barely given me guidance on an ethics application i need to have approved for next semester, and she hasn't given me some documents and contact info she told me she would.\n\nIs it normal for your advisor to just ghost you like this and not give you any help or guidance? I kind of thought that an advisor was supposed to help guide you along the research process, but maybe I'm wrong and being too needy?",
