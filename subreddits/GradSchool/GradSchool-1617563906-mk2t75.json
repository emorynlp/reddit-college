My eyes are heavy and it\u2019s hard to make them focus on anything. It\u2019s not that hard of a reading, I\u2019m just so sleepy.\n\nHow do you deal with this feeling? Grad school doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m sleepy. I need to work.",

Be honest with that. If you really believe sleepy work is better, then you just do it while sleepy and don't make a big deal about wanting to sleep :p Just make sure to get rest at some point, as chronic sleeploss is a much different story from a night or two of little sleep.",

I also felt like this and eventually got diagnosed with adhd (what used to be ADD - now inattentive adhd. Adhd doesn\u2019t just cause hyperactivity. It can also cause the opposite by causing massive fatigue). Not trying to diagnose you. Just share my story. Honestly. At least half my PhD program saw a therapist. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend it. Even if you don\u2019t get/need a formal diagnosis. Talking to someone can really help. Our supervisors don\u2019t always give us the type of support we need. And honestly. Only another PhD can truly understand what the process is like. \n\nI personally recommend a psychologist over other specialties (social worker, psychotherapist etc). Not that others can\u2019t provide good support. But I found that because a psychologist has a PhD. Mine just \u2018got\u2019 everything a PhD was and meant. Without me having to explain some of the subtle details that can be impossible to put into words. \n\nRegardless know that you aren\u2019t alone in feeling this is. And talking to a professional about it is completely normal and super helpful.",

I felt like I couldn't take any time off or I wouldn't be able to produce enough and I'd get kicked out.\n\nIn my later years, I started taking more weekends off.  It gave me a chance to step back from my research and understand the bigger picture.  I started running fewer reactions, but doing so more efficiently- I started thinking more consciously about the role of each experiment in the broader scheme of my research project and its definable goals.\n\nIronically enough, working less allowed me to get far more done than working more.  In addition to publishing more papers, I was a lot happier.  I had more time for my hobbies, my girlfriend, and my mental health.  Perhaps it's time?",

              "text": "It's like any kind of training, you need days of rest/off days. Some of those days while you are doing idle work, errands, busy work or even a part time job(maybe 2 days a week 8-16h a week) you might come up with something. but mainly it is just meant as a break/distraction. I have weeks where I will do 4 days of work and 3 rest. On Monday, Tues. Thurs, fri and off Wed, Sat+Sun. Others I just have the weekend off. Depends on how close to a deadline I am. \n\nIf I'm really far out I work 3 days a week and I will add a day the closer I get, the most I do though is 6 days a week 4 a day. I kinda treat everything like progressive overload in lifting, it may not work for everybody, but it helps me. I also try my best to keep my single sessions at 4 hours if I can just to prevent burn out, and to keep me wanting to study/work instead of blowing my wad at once, unless I am really under some crunch.\n\nI also like to break up every part of my work through the week/session. If I read for an hour a session and start getting tired, bored, or distracted I change to a different thing I need to work on for that project for an hour or two and get back to reading for the last hour. But I make sure that the 4h period of work is only work and no distractions. if I have an idea for something else, or a thought of something to do, I write it down and will address it later in the day during my 2h period of studying, reading, or whatever that isn't directly research related or may be something completely separate that has to do with a hobby, or a topic I crossed and want to spend a bit of time looking into. \n\nI also tend to try and keep those 2h periods of \"free study\" everyday to help expand my interests, knowledge, or simply to keep that child like curiosity about the word. I think expanding your knowledge base, or even reading a random article, story, or studying a language may help in the long run with thought process and possibly having inspiration for further work.\n\nAs for the person not having the ability to practice in NY right now, you may need to find somebody in the meantime that can help. The person you normally see shouldn't see it as an insult, but as a thing you need for your own health. I started seeing somebody my sophomore year of undergrad maybe once a month just to talk about whatever, even though I didn't think I had issues or problems I saw it as a preventative thing.",

                              "text": "No matter what you will always feel incompetent, and will have imposter syndrome. It comes with the territory. The benifit is you will always keep from being satisfied with your work and keep pushing and double checking your work. Imo the moment we feel confident, we get cocky, and when we get cocky we start to slip and will start producing less quality.\nSometimes doing something completely unrelated can spark something, also it is good to let the mind wander and explore occasionally. But even just having other interests help farther down the line.\nI know the feeling of I'm doing B, but I should be doing A. . or if I'm doing B, that is time I could be doing A. It is a real struggle, it is. I've had it throughout my sport career and now academics. But I had to learn to enjoy the ride and broaden my base as much as I can, even just having a crude understanding of many topics and 1, 2, or 3 topics be my bread and butter is valuable. \n\nI'm a wanna be historian, and so my main areas I read about are related to my topic/area, WW2 era Japan, mainly non-combatants, military comfort women. However reading other areas of WW2 which I enjoy help dots be connected, but reading and looking into other areas can help paint a wider picture or even bring new perspective to a topic. Hell, even getting into some arts has helped me. I already had an interest in film photography(from my father and grandfather), movies, paintings, and other things which have helped. Exploring literature and movies has given me several paper topics that I have worked on or am currently working on. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly what your research is on, but exploring a broad area and even fields that seemingly have no relation can have small crossover. But more so it helps you just have your mind just stop focusing on the overarching topic, and your research. We cannot be 100% go, it causes burn out, and overall destroys our research and goals. Having several goals outside of research and work is what makes us better at work. If you don\u2019t work out, I would suggest get started(many free programs), If you don\u2019t watch movies  I suggest you start(find movies you may never had interest in and give them a shot), also try learning something creative drawing, painting, anything really. Set aside time every day to do one of those things or something else you might have interest in. Except for working out, if we aren\u2019t physically healthy we can\u2019t do much. \n\nI\u2019ve been at the burn out wall, I\u2019ve had 3 months of the inability to even look at a book, and if I did nothing was processed. You gotta try living a complete life filled with work, leisure, physical fitness, and being outdoors without any technology to just have some quiet rest and to breath fresh air. \n\nMy weekly schedule is this currently(Mon,Tues,Thurs,Fri)\n1 Wake around the same time between 5:30-6:30am\n2. Spend 2 or 3 hours waking up,eat, have coffee, get my pups their morning walk in, and checking emails, facebook, reddit, etc\n3 Research/Work 4 hour block of time, \n4.workout for 90ish minutes(I like to compete in powerlifting and strongman, so I have goals in that)\n5.leisure/hobby activity about 2h(reading, something with photography[darkroom or photoshop], tying flies[for fishing]), etc),\n6. study Japanese for a 60-90min(which is something I just absolutely love doing and helps out my research) Some says I have a tutor, some days I read, and other days I am doing other work\n7. Have a bigger meal(I like eating later),Watch movies,read/audio book, anime,read manga, go for a bike ride(if it isn\u2019t dark out), play video games, pretty much whatever I want until maybe 10pm\n8. Get ready for bed and Sleep around 10-11pm\n\nIt\u2019s a 12ish hour schedule but with a lot of time that I\u2019m doing things I want that aren\u2019t research related with a few hours every night of just relaxing and the possibility of going to bed early, a date(I\u2019m still hopeful) or getting some fishing in.\n\nMy \u201coff days\u201d I am still studying Japanese(I find it fun), and doing whatever leisure/hobby activity. But the rest of the day is a lot more open and I tend to go fishing, do photography stuff, see friends/family(even if it is discord or something else) or simply watch movies with my pups. I also try my hardest to schedule any meetings, conversations, etcc tha I need to have with whoever on my days off because they are the most lenient for time and I don\u2019t want to feel rushed in conversation, and it also gives me the day to digest the advice and everything that has been covered. \n\nI also let my days play out and am flexible when I do given things throughout the day. What order, and I will give a break for food when I need to, but I tend to keep regular with hunger, or drinking protein.meal replacement shakes to curb hunger. But when it comes to my \u201cwork block\u201d and other things I set dedicated time to I am a bit anal with it and set a timer on my phone(set to airplane mode) and will pause it when I go to the bathroom, walk pups, etc(got that from Lex Fridman). This is why I make sure to keep my \u201con days\u201d to 3 or 4 depending on how far from a deadline I am and gradually add days as needed, also if for some reason I miss a day I don\u2019t think much of it and I don\u2019t try to \u201cget that day back\u201d. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to follow this schedule, and I\u2019m not saying you should, it has Just been what works for me. As for work, I tend to tutor, do gig work, or give a hand to a friend\u2019s business every now and then just to give myself a few extra bucks and distraction. I have money from savings and loans, but I still like to work.\n\nI also do take a week or two off every now and t hen for fishing trips, or other vacation things.",

I'm not sure about your school, but our uni elected to have no spring break / time off for Easter holidays, so grad students have been chugging along since January. After a few months of zero time off, coupled with some chronic health issues, I have been fully burnt out.\n\nI have two recommendations: one, go see a doctor (if you can). Very likely it's a nutrient deficiency, or something else. Two, take two-three days to do as little work as possible. Spend those days in bed. Delete social media. Focus on sleeping, working out / going for walks, and eating nice food. I did this from Thursday onwards after having a complete meltdown on Wednesday, and today (Sunday) I feel recharged, and like I can actually get through the next month of work.\n\nPlease take time to seriously rest. Your health is your wealth, and the work will always be there. You CAN take two or three days off to rest and recuperate. You might feel guilty at first, but I promise it's worth it.",

Im definitely using substances to cope ( weed, caffeine). \n\nSome things that have been helping: exercising, eating vegetables, not drinking alcohol, not smoking weed, not drinking too much caffeine, sleeping at normal hours, dressing like I'm casually going to the lab even if I'm working at home, funny shows, and motivating music (for me, Eminem, Britney Spears, Dr Dre, Biggie, 2Pac) \n\nI'm so sorry you're struggling too but you can definitely get there. Obviously I'm a believer in fake it til you make it, so for reading papers, I sometimes also just set a timer and try to understand as much as I can in 10/15 mins and by the time it goes off, I will want to continue, if not, I take notes so I can do another 10 mins in a bit. \n\nGood luck and hang in there internet stranger :)",

It\u2019s a con if you believe that effective grad students are the ones working all the time - they burn out incredibly fast. \n\nMy second year of grad school I got progressively more tired and depressed. Months of barely being able to do anything coupled with falling asleep in class. I went the counseling center and got on some meds that helped short term, but it just kept getting worse. Finally I had a doctor run a complete blood panel and it turned out I was on the cusp of hypothyroidism, with severe symptoms of brain fog and chronic fatigue. 3 months of thyroid medication later, I was finally feeling less like a zombie.

Most \u201ctraditional\u201d doctors don\u2019t really take nutrient deficiencies seriously.\n\nIf not, ask for bloodwork with full thyroid (including free T3 and T4), all B vitamins (look them all up and specify the names/numbers), vitamin D, full iron panel, ferritin. Then get your results sent to you and look through them. If some of the results are low (below reference range), then you know you have an issue. If some of the results are low but within reference range, do some research - you want to hit an \u201coptimal\u201d level, not just an in-range one. The ranges were created years ago based on results from general population testing, not based on any data about where healthy people\u2019s levels should be. Then look up how to properly supplement for any deficiencies you find, and what cofactors you should be taking along with them. This method requires a bit more work, but it\u2019s worth it if you find something.\n\nI have had many nutrient deficiencies myself & a degree in biochemistry, which was finally useful when researching deficiencies/treatments.",

B12 is plenty.
