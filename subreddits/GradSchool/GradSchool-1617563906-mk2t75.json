The best thing I did for my PhD progress was talk to a psychologist. So many PhD students experience mental health issues. Feeling like this could be a sign of depression.

Even if you don\u2019t get/need a formal diagnosis. Talking to someone can really help. Our supervisors don\u2019t always give us the type of support we need. And honestly. Only another PhD can truly understand what the process is like. \n\nI personally recommend a psychologist over other specialties (social worker, psychotherapist etc).
