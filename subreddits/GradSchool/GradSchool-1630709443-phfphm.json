Since PhD applications are usually do late fall/early spring, do people apply before writing their thesis or do they apply the following fall when they have graduated with their MA? \n\nKind regards,\n\nKI", "author": "Social_interactions", "created": 1630709443, "retrieved": 1632844933, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hbixa42": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phfphm/when_to_apply_for_phd/hbixa42/", "text": "My apps were due in December, so I applied fall semester 2nd year of my MA.", "author": "ResponsibilityOk617", "created": 1630723693, "upvotes": 2}}}
