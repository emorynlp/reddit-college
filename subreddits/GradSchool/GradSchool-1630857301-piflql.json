  "title:": "Do you take notes from your reading of journal articles? Tips for better literature synthesis appreciated",
  "text": "My method for reading is pretty chaotic, especially when I come to write. I completed my first thesis in July for my MSc and although I achieved a good grade, the whole process was chaotic. I had done so much reading prior to the writing. I kept articles in Mendeley and produced word documents full of notes and a synthesis of the literature, yet I used none of it when I actually wrote my thesis. I used the references, but I didn't actually refer to my notes at all. Instead, I had a horrific amount of tabs open across multiple browser windows and kept referring back to the articles when I needed them. \n\nIt therefore takes me ages to write and somehow it works for me but I would rather not have to work like this again for my second thesis. So, does any have any decent tips on how to annotate or even produce notes that can be used efficiently for writing? I cannot continue my academic experience with this messy process haha.\n\nEdit: wow thanks everyone for your helpful tips, I really appreciate it. I\u2019ll definitely read through and find the best method for me based on these comments.",

The right column is for Author, year; the middle column is for article title then quotations from article. the right column is for your thoughts, memos, references, etc. \n3. Read your PDFs and as you go, highlight and drag important points/quotations (of any size) into your world document (middle column). Keep it the authors' words. Your ideas on the right. \n4. Put notes entire topics/projects/papers into ONE word document. maybe just do a strip of color across one row for each new publication. Even on a fairly small laptop, you can do half screen for each window and never have to fiddle with different windows. \n\nThe advantages of this are: \n\n1. It is SEARCHABLE. \n2. it is  low tech/no new software to learn\n3. It puts your notes right alongside the authors, but allows you to keep them separate\n4. easily printable \n5. allows you to add rows in previous parts of your notebook so you can keep authors together (or group some other way if you want)\n\nCan anyone see any disadvantages to this?",

Either take notes on the paper (if printed) or in my notebook (if not). Highly, highly recommend using some kind of dead-tree paper for this: it is super easy to get stuck in the trap of fiddling with note-taking / \"productivity\" software and end up wasting more time than you save, and I find that I have a much easier time remembering things that I've written down (not *typed*).\n\n3. Synthesize the notes from the paper into the Note field on Zotero, and tag appropriately. \n\nIn addition to topic tags, I used some tags for tracking reading / quality: `to read`, `skimmed`, `wont read`, `have read`, `important result`, `ignore`.\n\nZotero search goes through both the PDF contents (if enabled and attached in the software) and your notes, so this left me with something that I could pretty easily find anything quickly.\n\nEDIT: if the paper isn't relevant or good, you also don't need many notes. For example, this is what I wrote about a decent paper:\n\n\n    important to address, but ultimately not applicable to my problem.\n    \n    1.  complexity is > O(log^6m), which is quite large for huge social networks. that isn't for calculating all communities, either, but only a single local one\n    2.  the algorithm requires knowledge of m to run (it is used in the stopping condition). We can estimate n pretty well for FB, Twitter, but getting a reasonable estimate on m is much much harder due to the long tail of the degree distribution.\n    \n    I should look into subsequent work to see if these problems are addressed.\n\n\nand this is what I wrote about a paper that claimed to be scalable but definitely wasn't\n\n```\nO(n^2) -- scalable my ass\n```",
