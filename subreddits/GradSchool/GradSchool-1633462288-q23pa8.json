  "text": "I know this question has probably been answered before but I'm hoping someone with a similar experience has some advice for me.\nI'm considering both PhDs in social policy/public policy, as well as Masters degrees in social policy/public policy/human rights. \nI do not have much financial support other than myself and will need to pay my own living expenses and tuition (after scholarships). I am also applying to top tier schools like UPenn, Georgetown, and UVA, as well as some like Brandeis and Tufts. \n\nFor anyone attending particularly rigorous programs in these fields, could you share if you are working or not and how that is going?",

They are 7 week classes so they are like bursts. My next class has a few days overlap but nothing should be due till the following week. Just study 10 hrs a day on the weekends and 2-3 hrs everyday. Map out your reading and assignments. For instance I read all the material sat, sun, and Monday. Tuesday I\u2019m doing the assignment. It\u2019s not due till wed. Wed, thurs, fri, sat,Sun I reply to discussion threads and prepare myself for the following week. My only time off is Friday night (5-12). Anything is possible if you organize yourself and stick to the plan. Adapt if you need to but always set yourself up for the following day. For instance, this week I was a had more energy to read so Sunday night I read 3 articles instead of 2 only leaving one more article for Monday. Which is good because I was able to edit and rewrite a group paper based on the professors feedback. Now today I only have to write up the initial post for a discussion but I read all the material and I already have some ideas about how it will flow.",

A Master's will be great, and you can move up the ladder in social policy. \n\nI would highly encourage you to seek funding or funded programs. I think GW has some good scholarships for MAs in that field... You may also want to look into other public schools like UNC, UMaryland, etc. which have good reputations, close-ish to DC and may be cheaper. \n\nYou can work during the degree (definitely a good idea for funding reasons). If you are located near where you want to end up, you can start to work in your field while you complete your studies. This will give you a leg-up later. \n\nLastly, and I always caution this, SOME parts of policy require a name-brand policy degree (Georgetown, Colombia, Harvard, UPenn maybe... ) to get a job. This is notoriously the case at the UN and many other international employers. If you want to work at that level, you may have to spend more on school  - in which case working part time is basically a must.",

Many people work part-time. However I think that \"nontraditional\" students are becoming more and more common though, where students have children, a full-time job, etc and are not straight out of undergrad with rich parents.",
