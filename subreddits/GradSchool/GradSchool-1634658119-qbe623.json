One click on a browser extension button and your reference is downloaded to your library, assigned a human-readable citekey, properly formatted, and added to your bibliography. You can [even configure it to automatically use sci-hub as a fallback pdf resolver](https://gagarine.medium.com/use-sci-hub-with-zotero-as-a-fall-back-pdf-resolver-cf139eb2cea7) so you'll never have journal access problems again.",
