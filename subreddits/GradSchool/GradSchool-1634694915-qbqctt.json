  "text": "Does anyone have experience dealing with Master of Engineering Management degree, specifically Dukes? Is it worth it online?\n\nI\u2019m torn if I should go to Duke\u2019s MEM program and drop $65K, although my workplace will definitely assist with the $5,250 IRS allowance each year. Maybe they do more, not sure yet.\n\nBut there is a local, accredited university for the same degree but only $15K. Hmmm\n\nI feel like Duke\u2019s MEM would allow me to hit a career jackpot easier down the road and general clout, but other than that probably a MEM from an average school is also certainly fine.\n\nI also feel like I might regret just not shelling out and going to Duke since I spent time on my application and actually being accepted.\n\nHard decisions!",
