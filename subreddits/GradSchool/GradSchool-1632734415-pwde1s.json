It took me a while to learn how long different tasks would take. So it was really jarring to go into something expecting it to take X amount of time and then it have it take 4 times longer. It can also be frustrating to get used to making mistakes and realizing how much room for error there is. \n\nSometimes it is just a learning curve situation. It's hard when everything is so unfamiliar. Or even something as simple as not meshing with the approach or expectations in your lab group. The labs I've been in have taken a \"figure it out yourself\" approach with very little training. I didn't enjoy that. \n\nEven if you don't like it now, you could still like it, or a different part of research, later. I did not love my MS research so I switched to a different focus (same field) for my PhD and that helped.
