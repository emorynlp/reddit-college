  "title:": "Is smartphone a must to study master degree effectively?",
  "text": "I'm going to study master degree in 2022 in different city without relatives. I will study Ms Computer Science anyway. I do have a laptop for myself, no tablet, but only 1 laptop. I used to be addicted heavily to smartphone/games and it took me 4 years to get back on the track and I don't want myself to fail into that trap again.\n\n I'm curious that should I buy a smartphone to bring it with me or I can carry my dumbphone? Did anyone finish grad degree without using smartphone?",

Without passing judgment, I'd through my penny in here and say that if it's perfectly ok for people to set boundaries who in fact own a smartphone (by stating, 'I don't reply to emails on the weekends' in their email sigs, or not even adding their school/work email to said smartphone, etc) -- then you can do it. In my opinion, I don't even see the need for you to inform your department about this. You simply have created work-life boundaries, regardless of their reasoning/background.",

If you really wanted to you could make do without, but the ability to answer emails and browse the web at the palm of your hand cannot be underrated. As a halfway house, you could opt for a smart phone on the cheaper end of the spectrum, such as the Alcatel 1c, which would allow you to perform tasks such as emails and browsing, but would not necessary have the capability to support heavy gaming etc.",

Both have desktop and/or browser versions.\n\nBeing always available (through text or email on phones) is becoming more and more prevalent but if you are able to meet work/study requirements without being on call like that, imo I think it's better to have those limits. I think those work habits lead to burnout faster and complicate work-life balance, which is already hard enough in grad school. \n\nI will also say I only use my phone for convenience when it comes to both school and research. I 100% am more efficient and comfortable working from my laptop. Losing the phone or specifically its smart capabilities would not actually impact my ability to do class or my assistantship. That may not be the case for all or other fields.\n\nI actually just heard about a paper that suggests situational strategies to maintain self control, like by not exposing yourself to temptation to begin with, might be more effective than exposing yourself, and forcing yourself to resist temptation, so to speak.

I wish I could go back go back to a dumb phone but I just don't think I'd last (I mean I'm sitting here typing this out on my smartphone as we speak). But if you're really fine with it, I say stick to your guns. If someone ends up so inconvenienced because you don't have a smartphone, maybe tell them you'll get one if they foot the bill.

A \"dumb phone\" could be ok, ideally one where people can text you and you can answer easily (like flip phones are hard for that). \n\nFor the program itself it could only be an issue if they use some QR code scanning or some specific apps but honestly pretty rare so normally a laptop with regular email checking is perfectly fine (and healthier and than checking emails 24/7).",

So for messaging and calling and that's about it?\n\nEdit: Just realised you mentioned a dumb phone. Is it similiar to what I've suggested above? If so, I think that should be enough.
