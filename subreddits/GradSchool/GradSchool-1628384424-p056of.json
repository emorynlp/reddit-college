I currently take 4 days off per week. I've generated 0 useable data in the past 2 months. I only go in to maintain my cells.\n\nI have a fully written manuscript but my PI insist on more data and says this is the last piece before we submit. I've spent 3.5 years perfecting my rejected manuscript and numerous times had to scrape many many hypotheses. The core premises of my project constantly shift and it makes me feel unconfident in my science however it is too late for me to start something new. Also, I am currently 'working' on 2 review papers except I lie and say I'm not ready to show my drafts.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic my productivity has slowly windled into a place where I no longer feel an urge or drive to do experiments. I have 0 intellectual curiosity when it comes to this project because my PI has magically squeezed every last ounce of my enthusiasm and I'm left as a shell of my former science self.\n\nSoon the jig will be up but I'll just collect my stipend payments and not give a shit about my productivity.\n\nAMA", "author": "debt69", "created": 1628384424, "retrieved": 1632953755, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 464, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"h871dg3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p056of/ive_spent_the_last_two_months_literally_doing/h871dg3/", "text": "Wait so this isn't supposed to happen every year?", "author": "KingofSheepX", "created": 1628446798, "upvotes": 5}, "h86rk5s": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/p056of/ive_spent_the_last_two_months_literally_doing/h86rk5s/", "text": "I love you, OP; stuff can suck, fuck it.
