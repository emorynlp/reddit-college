I'm being bombarded with blackboard updates, new communications, and expectations to be making blackboard discussion posts multiple times a week outside of classes, in addition to the normal readings and assignments.\n\nProfessors will say one thing in class and then post on blackboard a different assignment and then change their minds, all the while expecting you to come onto the discussion board every other day to respond to your professor and classmates.  This is all while we are learning in person so I'm going to campus for classes every week.  It seems like there's no good way to draw boundaries and have times that are reserved for family/jobs/life.  You can't just say \"I'm going to post my discussion posts at X time\" and schedule it in because the discussion post requirements also include needing to respond to other students who may not have posted yet, so then you get to keep checking back.\n\nWhen I went to college and my first round of grad school, you went to classes, got your assignments, turned in your assignments during the class where they were due, went to office hours if you wanted to discuss something with the professor, and that was that.  Maybe an occasional email from a professor to change a class time or update something on the syllabus.  If you wanted to discuss more with your classmates, you created a study group.  If you had group projects, you figured out a time to meet and did that.\n\nWhy is this suddenly a nonstop communication fest where I need to be paying attention to and having classroom discussions multiple times a week outside of class? It's emotionally exhausting to feel like I have to be mentally prepared to be \"in the classroom\" all waking hours.
