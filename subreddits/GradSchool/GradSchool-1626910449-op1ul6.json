My advisor told me to quit because I have ADHD", "text": "I am a first year student and I've made a few mistakes. I'm great at troubleshooting, so when we discuss where experiments went wrong, I list details. He accused me of not taking accountability, but to me, the details are also my responsibility and by going through them, I am taking responsibility for my actions. He then said that I am too careless and I should consider dropping out because my \"medical issue\" (the ADHD) doesn't allow me to improve. I'm devastated and I really don't know what to do now. I'm not sure if another lab would take me. I'm not sure if I'd even want that. What I really want is to stay where I am and to have him understand that I'm here to learn and grow, but it seems he's not really open to that. The postdocs and other students in the lab are supportive of me, but there's nothing they can do to stand up for me without facing retaliation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone for your support. I see some are suspicious of my story, and I will admit I have made some significant mistakes. When I do this, I list all the areas I can think of where I may have gone wrong. I never deny my mistakes, but it is not true that I'm not paying attention to the details of my work. I am medicated for ADHD and it is well-managed. The only reason I ever brought it up at all is because I have trouble word-finding when I'm speaking which is highly noticeable and embarrassing, so I like to explain it.\n\nI did not mention that I had to leave in the middle of the day last week due to a different medical condition. I'm not very comfortable sharing this type of information in great detail, but it is a hereditary heart condition. At that time, I was scared because of my symptoms, but I didn't leave anything unattended. I am fine now and the lab tech was concerned about my health when I returned, so I briefly explained the situation to him. He must have explained it to my advisor. My advisor also listed this as a reason I should quit, saying I can't handle the work. The both of these things in combination are rather damning, I agree. And to those of you agreeing with him, let me remind you: I'm always trying to improve. Instead of helping me, he is berating me and telling me I will never improve. \n\nI really needed to hear some kind words to give me the push to address this through proper channels, so I'm doing that now! I'll update when I can. In typical abuser fashion, he is now pretending like nothing ever happened.

There are a few things I'd like to know: (1) what is the nature of your reasons for failure, and (2) how do you convey them to your advisor?\n\n(1) Nature of failure: Sometimes experiments fail because we simply don't realize an additional variable was added that ruined the entire process. I've recently had a 10x failure streak on a process we KNOW should work to the point where my advisor just bought brand new thousand-dollar equipment to fix the problem. (It turns out the problem was literally that a screw had gotten loose, fixed the screw, and well now we have 2 equipment.) Sometimes we add the variable ourselves by careless mistake, like if we overslept and left an experiment in the oven for an extra 2 hours not realizing how it may change the results. Even though both mistakes here are caused by carelessness, the latter is more damaging towards your reputation because it reflects a change in what should be known process variables. Is this the kind of \"carelessness\" that your advisor is mad about?\n\n(2) Convey to your advisor: You could perhaps deliver your results to your advisor in a more structured format. This shows that you understand the process (lay out steps that you took, variables, etc.), and it can help diagnose what went wrong. Lay out EVERYTHING that you did in the easiest and clearest way for your advisor to read it. Maybe what is happening is that your results are not very structured and so your advisor is actually struggling to follow what is happening.\n\nNotice how I laid out the structure of this post. I identified the two things I was going to talk about, and then went and talked about them sequentially in bullet points. Notice that these topics do not overlap in content and collectively exhaust all points of discussion by focusing on during/after running the experiment; in other words, a very clean and organized structure! When you show your results to your advisor, can you improve on your structuring and layout so that your advisor sees competence even in your failure?\n\nFinal note: you could also just have a mean advisor, and you are a first-year student with no track record of success yet. Once you start succeeding, maybe your advisor will treat you differently?", "author": "someoneinsignificant", "created": 1626925283, "upvotes": 5}, "h635wx4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/op1ul6/any_advice_my_advisor_told_me_to_quit_because_i/h635wx4/", "text": "You should report your advisor to your institution's office for students with disabilities.
