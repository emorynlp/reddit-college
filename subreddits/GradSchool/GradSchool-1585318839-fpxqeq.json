While I (in bioinformatics) no longer take courses, I haven taken 2 courses that advanced undergrads were also taking and I was being graded on the same deliverables +  2 extra (substantially large) projects in addition to regular deliverables because \"grad students are more advanced and therefore need to do more work\".\n\nMy friend in neuroscience has multiple \"qualifying exams\" taken at the end of each semester in his first year where he has to get >85% on written exams that cover all content of the classes taken that semester. \n\nAdditionally, I know some programs, (e.g. at Stanford - I believe Electrical Engineering?) tend to weed out students in their first year based on their academic work in the courses they take and they kick out the bottom 10% etc. I heard aomething similar about Chemical Engineering ad Duke but don't remember the details.\n\nI know there are programs where you are OK as long as you pass your courses. My program requires that you do not get any C's and no more than 2 B's (out of 10 courses, which is quite relaxed). My friend at MIT EECS has to get all As except a maximum of 1 B and had to retake a course because it was his 2nd B. And he did put in a lot of work for it and is a good student overall. The course is just very challenging.\n\nIm happy for you if your program has been quite lenient with your course responsibilities but that is your experience. The rigor of requirements change from program to program. Some programs actually want ro challenge their students through coursework as well.",
