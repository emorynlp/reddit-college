I\u2019ve ditched those people. I\u2019ve gotten better at walking again. I\u2019m still trying to kick my bad eating habits. Dating has sucked since I\u2019ve been here but hey that\u2019s okay. I just wanted to brag and say I just petitioned to graduate. Sure I\u2019ve been ghosted by a lot of people, sure I\u2019ve been mistreated\u2026you know what? I\u2019ll have my masters in December. Man, I\u2019m so proud of myself. This is like the one thing that cannot be taken from me. Like who tf cares if I\u2019m fat, and my bills are sky high?
