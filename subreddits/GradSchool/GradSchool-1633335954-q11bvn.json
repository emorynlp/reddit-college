  "text": "I\u2019ve been in a really bad place for like the past three years, especially in the past year. I have felt stagnant in my career and in my relationships. COVID basically ruined my social life for a bit. Since then, I\u2019ve just met people who want to go to bars. You know? I\u2019ve ditched those people. I\u2019ve gotten better at walking again. I\u2019m still trying to kick my bad eating habits. Dating has sucked since I\u2019ve been here but hey that\u2019s okay. I just wanted to brag and say I just petitioned to graduate. Sure I\u2019ve been ghosted by a lot of people, sure I\u2019ve been mistreated\u2026you know what? I\u2019ll have my masters in December. Man, I\u2019m so proud of myself. This is like the one thing that cannot be taken from me. Like who tf cares if I\u2019m fat, and my bills are sky high? I have this degree. \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf93 anyway, shoot for the stars. Even if you chunky dunk instead of skinny dip.",

Let your performance speak...and I would say, why not channelize your set backs and the shit people have given you into becoming healthy and achieving what you set out to?\nYou know, believe me, these people will come back someday, those who've ghosted you, but then you won't need them. Because, those who cannot stick around when you aren't at your best, why would you actually need them when you ARE at your best! See, I know covid has been tough on people, it has destroyed families, and people might be struggling within and in their own way...but this pandemic was all about reaching out and looking out for each other!\nI believe in Karma! It comes around definately....and I'd say good riddance! Who wants a dead weight ....cuz you know how I see these people? These 'free loaders' are parasites who feed on you till you can support them but they won't be capable of returning anything to you....that's because it isn't their basic nature. So just let it go...I'd say go with the flow and you'll be amazed! Try working out, it will reduce stress and you'll be able to sleep well...helps me big time.",
