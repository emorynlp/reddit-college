It isn't a class issue for them. Keep in mind a lot of people railing at the elite also see Donald Trump, a self proclaimed billionaire CEO who lived until recently in a golden penthouse in manhattan as \"one of them\".\n\nI think when people bitch at \"the elite\" what they are really complaining about are people in professions and positions they perceive to be exclusionary and prestigious. Academics get hate because our position is seen as \"prestigious\" and some sort of exclusive club that turns deserving people away.\n\nMost of the modern populist \"anti elite\" figures seem to have a common theme in their past of being excluded from some prestigious club or thing they wanted in on.  For Donald Trump it was the manhattan rich social circles that turned him away. For Steve Bannon it was Hollywood producers and Tech CEOs that said no. For Tucker Carlson he was rejected by the CIA (and is still salty about it to the point he still includes it as a big part of his biography). for Charlie Kirk he was rejected by West Point and for Jason Chaffetz it was the US Secret Service that turned him down.\n\nIf you actually look at the salaries for some of these professions, it isn't that much. The CIA and Secret Service don't pay that well, and at most  you'd be making low six figures. Most of the time you'd be making something like $60K a year if that. Carlson in particular makes many times more at Fox News than what he would have made at the CIA. But it's not the money that breeds his resentment there, it's the idea that he was excluded from some thing he wanted in on that would have been seen as at least somewhat prestigious had he got in.\n\nThis is also the reason so many of these same people obsess so much about affirmative action: it isn't really about class tensions, it's about feeling like \"somebody else took your spot\" in a club you wanted in that you felt you were more entitled to. This is why Steve Bannon, despite railing against the liberal elite, loves to brag about the fact he went to Harvard. He \\*does\\* in fact possess an elitist attitude, he just doesn't like the fact he's been excluded from some of the clubs because that hurts his ego.\n\nI seem to remember hearing comments from some extended family about how they thought \"all those liberals were giving away spots at Harvard to those minorities when they didn't deserve it\" with affirmative action, and that is ultimately where this \"liberal elite\" sentiment really comes from.

Of course it is possible for a grad student to embody \"elitism\" in looking down on those with less education. It is possible for damn near anyone to be an elitist, some guy with the luxury trim version of your car might be just as arrogant about your car being the base model. The \"elitist\" attitude should not be confused with actual \"elites\".\n\nWho are the actual elites? I'd argue the ones in the upper echelon of society with undue influence on its workings and excessive wealth. So who are these people? (They're a surprisingly insular group).\n \nLauren Rivera at Northwestern spent a large portion of her career studying them. Specifically the hiring practices of America's white-shoe firms (the most elite accounting, legal, investing institutions). She coined the term \"Culture Matching\" to describe the process by which these institutions recruit the next generation of elites. ([Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122412463213)) \n\nShe found that these firms were incredibly specific in their searches. They wanted people from very specific schools (almost always HPYS and Penn for business), very specific majors, with very specific backgrounds and hobbies, etc. Fitting in with the culture was far more important than grades or skills. While interviewing someone at a recruiting fair she watched them toss the resume of an Asian guy from MIT who was near the top of his class. They causally explained that he wasn't a good \"fit\". Yes, surely racism is a large part of this, classism, sexism, and sectarianism too, but these folks were so specific they looked for the right hobbies and interests. They were just as quick to discard people for not matching those requirements; in fact one specifically wanted young white men from Yale who enjoyed mountain climbing, while another specifically rejected \"active\" / sporty people.\n\nRivera's work is way outside of my field, but always fascinating to read as it is a look into an almost alien world right next door. \n\nBy these standards, most grad students are not \"elite\" at all. In fact, I'd argue there is no path to becoming \"elites\" for the majority of us. No credentials, no accomplishments, no work success will make up for you not being their specific fit. Even if you or I became tenured professors at Berkeley or resident physicians at Hopkins, we'd never be seen by these folks as part of their group.\n_________\n\n**TL;DR:** No, looking at Rivera's research, elites are very insular group and no educational credential will make you one of them.", "author": "Ut_Prosim", "created": 1615653732, "upvotes": 4}, "gqt7vtn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/m45etd/its_very_jarring_for_me_to_hear_people_refer_to/gqt7vtn/", "text": "You're confusing \"**economic elite\"** with \"**intellectual elite**,\" which is what that poster is referring to.\n\nI went to college on Pell Grants and Federal work-study.

Growing up in a school district that had semi-quality educators is a privilege. Being able to afford the time and money (even if that money is a loan) is a privilege. Being able to live with family while you're in school (if you could) is a privilege. Having people that support you emotionally is a privilege.

What's important to understand here is that its no little known fact that the majority of individuals who get into academia tend to be from higher SES backgrounds. There is a large culture in academia that is highly elitist. It doesn't just have to do with money. \n\nTake also into account that there are many folks who are unable to pursue academic careers because they had even less means to doing so than you and I. What is considered elite can be a little relative. Just because you know richer people doesn't mean you aren't rich in the eyes of some. But again, this doesn't just have to do with money.\n\nIt's my opinion thta you can acknowledge the fact that the Academy often has an elitist culture while simultaneously knowing you aren't/working to not be. If you end up working with or forming relationships with non academics who have this understanding (a LOT of them do), you will have to come to terms with this inner conflict.\n\nAlso some food for thought. What do you think about the fact that you seem to have been unaware of this mentality by non-academia folks?

I feel like a lot of this post has gone in a direction that I generally agree with, but I would also be interested to know what the term was here. Because while I agree with a lot of what was said here, there is undoubtedly some bull going around academia and some amount of arrogance and snobbery that makes me feel dumb and inferior time to time. There is some truth that there are \u201celitists\u201d in academia (just as there are in most fields), but certainly not everyone, or even most people now, in academia are really \u201celite\u201d.\n\n> So. Are we all \"elites\"? I feel like I'm one surprise bill away from poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a culture war dog whistle. Colleges and universities have been a huge target in many culture war subjects, so using the term in a pejorative way and associating it with colleges serves to create a sentiment where it can automatically keep some from listen to an argument because the \u201celites\u201d are perceived as bad and cannot be trusted. So even if they speak the truth, you cannot believe it. \n\nThe ironic thing is that many of the people who stoke these sentiments often have better academic pedigrees than most of us ever will. Yes, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, please tell us about the evil institutions that were crucial for your success and ability to become US senators. And actually, are there any federal legislators without a degree? Still, unfortunately, that attitude filters down to ordinary folks who may very well have have felt ignored by and condescend by some academic or some one with a college degree, at some point. Again, I think most of this use of the term \u201celite\u201d is meant as a smear, often for unfounded reasons, but it should also be a reminder to all of us not to be an asshole to people who do have less education or fewer credentials than us.

Even education aside, one\u2019s degree status is a very reliable predictor for future income and socioeconomic class. Moreover, so many things are becoming polarized where education status is a reliable predictor (especially politics), to the point where university graduates have *very different* interests and priorities than those who did not attend university.\n\nAnd while there are those who come from poorer backgrounds or even remain poor after a university degree (I myself was a financial aid kid), it\u2019s still a privilege in the same sense that white privilege is still a thing even though there are white people in poverty. \n\n\nThis is all the context for why someone would make a derogatory remark about people who attend university in the first place. It doesn\u2019t excuse or justify it, but these socioeconomic differences as well as polarization along education lines are part of the cause of tension between those who do attend university and those who don\u2019t. This hostility is not just because they hate the idea of learning or whatever. \n\n\nPersonally I also think \u201celite\u201d is an apt descriptor for myself and my personal colleagues given I pursued a PhD at a well regarded university; there is definitely a bubble in terms of the lives we lead that is incredibly hard to pierce. My immediate interests are not the same as one who lives in a poor rural town. Even though I grew up a financial aid kid, by virtue of having a STEM PhD I have an extremely high likelihood  of a solid and secure middle class life for the rest of my life without having to keep clawing my way up the socioeconomic ladder or constantly fearing homelessness. \n\nNot to mention that those who come from poorer or \u201cless refined\u201d backgrounds often face prejudices in university and graduate school. \u201cElitism\u201d is a very real phenomenon.

They did that not by questioning expertise per se but by separating people into dainty elites -- and tying them to the liberal policies they tended to advocate -- and \"hard-working Americans guided experience and common sense\", which happened to work as a way to combine the working class/white populists and anyone reflexively against liberal policies (the socially and economically conservative) into a voting bloc.\n\nFast forward to now, and the use of \"elite\" isn't even parsed anymore.
