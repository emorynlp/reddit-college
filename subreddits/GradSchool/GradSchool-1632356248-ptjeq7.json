  "text": "Hi Folks, long time lurker, first time caller.\n\nI have been reading posts in this group for a bit and trying to rationalise my experience with your posts. I am having a different experience to the experiences I see you all reporting. So I wanted to know \n\n* Where are you all located (countries primarily)?\n* What field are you in?\n* Are you all in the hard sciences or are there any social scientists in the subreddit?\n\nI'll go first. I'm in Australia, I'm in education practice research and I am clearly in the social sciences.\n\nThanks",

Fwiw Mt sustainable ag MS program is still awesome but covid and life got in the way. \n\nI want to eventually be an agricultural sociologist, so I'm straddling (and struggling with) that divide. My undergrad is biotech/molecular sciences, which I realized I actually hated by the time I got through all the prereqs and into senior level courses but at that point I couldn't afford to change majors.\n\nIf I could go back and tell 18 year old me what to major in, I'd have done sociology or community development and sustainable ag/horticulture/something.
