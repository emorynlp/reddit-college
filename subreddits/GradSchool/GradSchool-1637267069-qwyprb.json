  "text": "I'm a PhD student working in an office. Sadly I'm in a different research group than the rest of the students so I've generally been excluded from most of the office chatter etc.\n\nI've introduced myself to all of them and made an effort to be social but it feels like I've kind of been ignored or pushed out. They openly plan social events with each other and leave me as the odd man out in the office :( \n\nI know it's probably just in my head but it sucks :(",

      "text": "That does suck\ud83d\ude1e. I've been there and it turns out it wasn't in my head (but that's a different story and definitely not the norm). Grad school is difficult and isolating enough, it sucks not to have someone to talk to who's going through it with you.\nI'm not sure if you want advice or just want someone to affirm it sucks. Either is valid, but if you don't want advice, ignore my next paragraph.\nDoes your department have a grad student organization? If so, they should be planning social events- maybe get involved there? If not, it's worth considering starting a Dept grad student org, but that does take a lot of time. There should be a college-level graduate student organization, so try getting involved there? Otherwise, maybe do a bit of Facebook stalking, find out their hobbies, and try to start conversations you know they should be interested in. Also, it's possible that even though you made the effort, that didn't translate completely to them. They could think you don't want to be social, or maybe they're just shy. Or maybe you're talking about only academic stuff with them so they think you're \"too serious\"?\nI hope it works out for you!",

Hint that you would love to hang out with them more.\n\nMaking sure that everyone is included socially is a skill that (sadly) not everyone has.  I wouldn't attribute it to malice--maybe just ignorance.",

Perhaps they already had a standing social engagement before you arrived and didn\u2019t even think to invite you or thought maybe you had a strong social circle outside of grad school and wouldn\u2019t be interested. I would make a real effort to invite them out and indicate an interest in joining in on their events. If they still don\u2019t bite, then you can move on and find another friend group, but I would assume fatigue mixed with the generally poor social skills of most grad students might mean that you get overlooked rather than anything personal.",
