The Universities I am applying to want me to submit a 10-20 page writing sample. They want a writing sample that uses primary sources. I have gone through four years of work and the longest history paper I currently have is a 11-page historiography about the plague since I saved my capstone until the Spring. These are all secondary sources though since it is a historiography paper. All my papers that are more than 10 pages were for my political science minor. I was looking at a Masters's in political science or public relations. I have also been considering law school. Should I go a different route with my studies? I am still unsure what I want to do career-wise so maybe I should choose something outside of history?\n\nThank you.", "author": "Silversky780", "created": 1631157627, "retrieved": 1632844698, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc5hf7m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pkpmj6/writing_sample_for_applications_and_degree_choices/hc5hf7m/", "text": "Because they are asking for a sample paper and not necessarily one from your past studies, I feel you should write one that uses primary sources and send it to them.", "author": "Kathurima", "created": 1631166905, "upvotes": 2}}}
