  "text": "Any of you that are in grad school, if you attended a conference, did your school make you pay out of pocket? \n\nThere\u2019s a conference my professor wants us to attend in order to take a required course. The only thing is the conference costs $275 not including $60 for membership. It\u2019s not too expensive, but it\u2019s a lot of money. Some of my classmates, including me are annoyed because we all work part time and it\u2019s tough. \n\n\nIs it usual to pay for conferences out of pocket for grad school?",

I've never gotten it any time I've applied, despite presenting multiple papers at some of these conferences. My subfield in my department just started giving out some conference funding, but even that is minimal and you usually can't get it multiple times in a row. \n\nI go to about 3-4 conferences a year. Thankfully, two refund registration costs for students (established professionals donate registration scholarships and they go to the youngest (in year not age) presenting students first and work their way up to older non-presenting students), and none have over a $75 registration fee. Even then if I volunteer those fees go away too. Then there is lots of long car rides and very full hotel rooms to lower costs. If you have friends at another school that cover conferences, that is the best way to get free housing.",

But in my experience most are willing to pay as long as it's reasonable. \n\nLook to see if you have access to #1. Ask your boss about #2.
