I thought I'd post this, not to boast, but to give some hope to people in my shoes. This is a throwaway account, by the way.\n\nIf you're on this forum and you're worried you can't pursue your dreams because, in the past, you weren't as high of an achiever as you are now I'm here to tell you that you can do it.\n\nMe: 3.1-ish GPA, 1 year of research experience, 1 year of experience in industry post-graduation from college.\n\nA year ago, almost exactly, I found myself miserable at my industry job. I didn't feel any passion for what I was doing and manufacturing environments treat you terribly. Leaving college I'd known that I wanted to go to graduate school but I was dissuaded because I thought, and was told, that my low GPA would hold me back from admission. I reached a point in my mental health that I just flat out folded on my job and decided that I HAD to pursue my dreams of being a scientist. If I failed, then I failed.\n\nI reached out to this forum and many other common forums for people to ask their chances. I was literally told things like:\n\n\"You have absolutely no chance of getting in\"\n\n\"You couldn't even get into a ranked school with that GPA\"\n\n\"With a GPA that low you'd be wasting everyone's time, you're obviously not smart.\"\n\n\"The schools you'd get into aren't even worth going to\"\n\nWhatever. I didn't have but a single person tell me I had a chance out of about 50 responses to posts I'd made. It was \"obviously\" futile, but I tried anyways.\n\nThis was my method:\n\n1. I emailed professors personally after reading over their research.\n2. When a professor seemed interesting or promising I emailed the department chairs expressing my interest in specific professors and their program.\n3. I took initiative and made offers to visit schools that felt promising. I took buses, I stayed in crappy hotels and slept in airports. Despite not having money to blow on visits, I made it happen - comfortable or not.\n4. I sent pre-visit emails to staff members I saw as potential collaborators and post-visit thank-you's for taking their valuable time to meet with someone who was obviously not an ideal candidate (but I never painted myself as anything other than confident).\n\nThis was my method. I ended up applying to about 10 schools because I figured that MAYBE I would get into one or two of them if I was lucky because of statistics alone.\n\nSchools I applied to/rank in my field:\n\nArizona State University-9\n\nOregon State University-30\n\nUniversity of Montana-20\n\nHarvard University-3\n\nUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County-60\n\nTennessee Tech University-65\n\nVillanova-unranked\n\nUniversity of Florida-15\n\nNot going to name the one I went to -22\n\nUniversity of California Irvine -32\n\nSo - where did I get in?\n\nOther than UC Irvine, EVERY. SINGLE. PROGRAM. With full funding. \n\nMy takeaways: \n\n1. Showing interest and making sure when people look at your application they know your face is HUGE. People don't see you as a number at that point, they see you as a person who already went out of their way to prove to you that they would be dependable.\n2. Don't discount lower ranked schools. UMBC (Baltimore County) was a school I'd never heard of before this process, and they impressed me as much as any other institution I visited. And they were wonderful people, I might add.\n3. Be confident, but not cocky. Email people. Politely ask them for some papers that detail future work they might do. If you like a professor and they don't email you back politely call and leave a voicemail regarding your interest in their work.\n4. Be gracious and polite. These people have to hear from so many of us every year and sift through a bizillion emails. They have to think \"can I stand working with this individual for upwards of 5 years?\" so of course they'll chose someone that is, at the very least, dependable, flexible, and caring about  their own personal needs.\n\nForums of any variation can be metaphorical cancer. Believe in yourself, try hard, and pave your own way if you have to. If  a num-nuts like me can pull this off I know any of you can. \n\nGood luck out there to anyone in the shoes I was very recently wearing.", "author": "dantanpanfantaytay", "created": 1534343117, "retrieved": 1632954493, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 274, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"e97in7j": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/97inqd/my_grad_school_low_gpa_success_story/e97in7j/", "text": "This is really encouraging. Graduated with a 2.9 from a top tier school. Had an Advisor tell me flat out try to talk me out of the idea of going to grad school in my senior year because of my GPA. \n\nMy last two years of college I did really well, but the first two years I was unfocused, uninterested (went to college because parents forced me to, not because I wanted to) dealing with a chaotic (at best) home life and undiagnosed psych issues - all of which tanked my GPA.\n\nEnd of Sophomore year after a brief stint in the (psych ward) transferred to a school in another state (to get distance from the family), started on a steady course of meds and therapy. Things started to stabilize: I got focused, changed majors, got passionate about school (and life in general). Graduated, 3.6 GPA in one major, 3.8 in the other (but 2.9 overall because of those first years), got an internship that was converted into a full time position and have been steadily working my way up the ladder at this company since. My coworkers and supervisors love me and I feel I\u2019m doing well for myself. \n\nNow that I am older, more focused and more mature, I really want to go to grad school, but that advisor\u2019s voice is always in the back of my head telling me that I shouldn\u2019t even try.\n\n\nTL;DR: I was an unfocused, unmotivated, depressed kid from a broken family.

For those interested, here is a general template I used.**\n\nIts nothing mind-blowing or amazing, but it worked for me. If you have more specific questions feel free to PM me, I'd love to help (as time allows). \n\nAlso, remember: I've only been in the grad school game for a few months at this point- I'm no expert, I only have to go with what worked for me and what I've been told by people when I asked the \"why me?\" question. Best of luck to all of you and thank you for the well wishes!\n\nEmail to professor:\n\n1st paragraph: Give a general introduction. I stated who I was, what my specialty is, and what my intention was right off of the back.\n\n2nd paragraph: I told the professor specifically why I was interested in them and what parts of their research I was impressed by. Maybe a good time to cite a paper of theirs you\u2019ve read. Ask them politely if they could consider your credentials and if you sound like a good fit FOR THEM, offer if they\u2019d like to talk further on the phone or over email about your interest in them and their work moving forward.\n\n3rd paragraph: State your background. List research experience first, if you have any. Let them know here if your research is your main reason for wanting to return to graduate school. Also, if need be, relate this to why you\u2019re pursuing a graduate degree in the topic you\u2019re interested in. If you\u2019ve been published or did any poster presentations, make sure this is clear as well.\n\n4th paragraph: List academic credentials, GPA and such. If you improved your GPA in your later years opposed to earlier years this is a trend people tend to take as a green light, especially if your GPA improved with research (I was told this). List GRE Scores, and list any coding experience you might have.\n\n5th paragraph: Give them some personal information, at least that\u2019s what I did. Tell them about your hobbies if they\u2019re interesting or relevant, or even a testament to your character. I had professors mention that I felt more human in my introduction because of it after I visited their schools.\n\n6th paragraph: Tell them you\u2019ll be applying soon and you\u2019d be thrilled to hear back from them. If you feel like it, offer to read papers relevant to ongoing research, and wrap up the email.\n\nDepartment chair emails:\n\nKeep these more general. Introduce yourself in a similar fashion and offer similar details about yourself. If you\u2019ve identified professors of interest, let the chair know you have some stake in their research. If not, feel free to give the chair a list of your interests and ask the chair if there might be any professors that share similar interests. Sometimes, there is more going on than is listed in the bio on the professor\u2019s website.\n\nThings I screwed up/Things not to do:\n\n* Never be too forward. Be confident, but don\u2019t barge in and tell them you think you\u2019d be a great fit. Let them decide that, just give them the opportunity to view you as more than a number on an application. \n* If there are multiple professors in a department that you\u2019re interested in, don\u2019t be overly specific with your interest towards either one of them. Email them individually, but keep your interests consistent to both professors.\n* Don\u2019t ask about funding. Funding is important but it isn\u2019t a \u201cfirst email\u201d sort of topic. I think I turned a handful of people off.\n\nThings to do:\n\n* Email LOTS of professors and LOTS of department chairs(at different schools of course). There is so much to learn and there is cool work going on that you didn\u2019t even know existed. I thought I was going to do something vastly different for my phd at before I did more research.\n* Kind of goes along with lots of emails\u2026 but - consider lots of schools. Many schools have many funding situations. If you do your homework and send emails to plenty of people you will probably end up with a good list of faculty that give you fairly positive responses. From what I learned, responses are positive for a reason. They won\u2019t intentionally mislead you. If they have funding and interest in you they will happily accept your offer to visit and appreciate your initiative. Sometimes they\u2019ll even personally fly you out to their location.\n* Take advantage of your travel - IF you have the time (big IF, I know) email other schools in the region you\u2019re flying or driving to and try to meet with their departments as well. Be efficient\n* Consider the location. Think about the city you\u2019re visiting as if you\u2019re going to spend the next 5 years there, because you just might. This really plays into account in the final decision process. If your positive mental health is something that could be a significant factor in your completion of a PhD(as it probably will be for me) make sure you like where you\u2019ll end up. If you\u2019re going to miss your family a ton make sure you\u2019re near a major airport, etc.\n* ENJOY YOURSELF. When else in your life do you have the potential to have a handful of what are basically job offers to move somewhere new and LEARN for 5+ years. Enjoy the experience. Yes, it\u2019s a terrifying step forward but try to make it positive, that\u2019s how you\u2019ll get the most out of it. (I could take my own advice on this one).\n\nDr. \\_\\_\\_,\n\nMy name is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I\u2019m a recent graduate from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I studied \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Currently, I am \\_\\_\\_\\_ but I intend to return to school for my PhD in \\_\\_\\_ during the fall of 2018.\n\nYour interest in \\_\\_\\_\\_ caught my eye as I share similar interests. My main interests are in \\_\\_\\_\\_. I was hoping you could review my credentials. If it looks like I might be a good fit for your research group I\u2019d love to talk on the phone with you about my interests and career goals and I\u2019d love to hear more about your own.\n\nAs far as my background is concerned, while I was an undergraduate student I did research for our \\_\\_\\_\\_ department on\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I presented this research in an undergraduate seminar and I have since been published. I enjoyed my time as a researcher and it is in large part why I would like to return to academia.  This research is also what got my interested in sustainability related topics.\n\nMy academic credentials are as follows: my GPA in undergraduate was \\_\\_\\_, although I finished strong with a \\_\\_\\_ GPA during my senior year, the same year I began research research. As far as my GRE scores are concerned I got \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I have experience with multiple coding languages (though right now I\u2019m a bit rusty) including Matlab, C++, and Python.\n\nIn my personal life I\u2019m an avid outdoorsman. I try to camp at least once a month and I grew up a member of\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.In my spare time I also brew beer, rebuild small displacement engines, and read a lot. (Other general information was included in this paragraph too).\n\nI\u2019ll be applying soon, and if there will be any openings in your lab group this coming fall I would be ecstatic to hear more about the opportunities that are available. If you would like any more information from me, I\u2019d be happy to provide it. Also, if you have any papers that are relevant to ongoing research in your group I would love to read more about them.\n\nI hope to hear back from your soon!\n\nThank you for your time,\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_", "author": "dantanpanfantaytay", "created": 1534383357, "upvotes": 26}, "e49n5m0": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/97inqd/my_grad_school_low_gpa_success_story/e49n5m0/", "text": "What was the purpose of emailing the department chairs?
