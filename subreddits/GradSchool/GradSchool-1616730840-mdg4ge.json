I wanted to show the intersectionality between feminist theory and queer theory as it related to international political economy and decided to take the plunge and \u201cout myself\u201d as a part time drag queen to my classmates and professor. \n\nMy professor even asked if I would RE RECORD the presentation in full drag. She concluded the grade by saying \u201cexcellent work.\u201d\n\nHoly crap. What a rush that was. I was terrified but I knew that I understood the material and that the presentation wouldn\u2019t be gratuitous. I am so so so happy that I took the material and applied my own personal history to give a unique (and unforgettable) presentation that she responded positively to. \n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the post. Just wanted to share a small victory of my first semester in grad school.", "author": "Nam3Tak3n33", "created": 1616730840, "retrieved": 1632845163, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1269, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"h213su9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mdg4ge/i_gave_a_very_serious_academic_presentation_in/h213su9/", "text": "Fuck inclusivity, I'm gonna be honest and tell you that you motivated me to get my degree because it's going to be a cold day in hell where an ideologue such as yourself gets doctor in front of their name while I remain formally uneducated.", "author": "RNGreed", "created": 1623888016, "upvotes": 0}, "gtnwksl": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mdg4ge/i_gave_a_very_serious_academic_presentation_in/gtnwksl/", "text": "Please post the link if you feel comfortable. this sounds incredible, and I would love to watch, learn, and share your report.", "author": "rnaryjane024", "created": 1617779998, "upvotes": 1}, "gsct7i8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mdg4ge/i_gave_a_very_serious_academic_presentation_in/gsct7i8/", "text": "Based", "author": "YesAndYall", "created": 1616801906, "upvotes": 1}, "gscnfhm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mdg4ge/i_gave_a_very_serious_academic_presentation_in/gscnfhm/", "text": "You should do an autoethnography piece!", "author": "SliceOfBrain", "created": 1616799437, "upvotes": 1}, "gscb8gz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mdg4ge/i_gave_a_very_serious_academic_presentation_in/gscb8gz/", "text": "That is so awesome I'm going to cry, thank you so much for sharing.
