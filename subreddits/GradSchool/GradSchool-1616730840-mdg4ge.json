  "text": "Just got the grade back today from a Zoom presentation I gave on critical feminist economic theory. I wanted to show the intersectionality between feminist theory and queer theory as it related to international political economy and decided to take the plunge and \u201cout myself\u201d as a part time drag queen to my classmates and professor. \n\nMy professor even asked if I would RE RECORD the presentation in full drag. She concluded the grade by saying \u201cexcellent work.\u201d\n\nHoly crap. What a rush that was. I was terrified but I knew that I understood the material and that the presentation wouldn\u2019t be gratuitous. I am so so so happy that I took the material and applied my own personal history to give a unique (and unforgettable) presentation that she responded positively to. \n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the post. Just wanted to share a small victory of my first semester in grad school.",

The fact that you came looking to start a conflict on a post largely forgotten about tells me all I need to know about your character. \n\nShould you decide to pursue a graduate degree, as you claim, I\u2019ll be glad to know that my little post on the internet showing the pride I felt on a well-received assignment was what motivated you to enter into a world where you will be challenged daily. Far be it for me to stop you. \n\nGood luck. And good night.",

          "text": "Honestly it was just an intro to theory. Nothing super groundbreaking. But I did reference a question from Dr. Kate Bedford that I thought was very poignant. \u201cIs neoliberalism reliant on female altruism at the service of the state?\u201d Considering that humanistic altruism is a trait firmly imbedded in neoliberal economic theory, I really liked the extension of that question when looked at trough a feminist lens. Liberal theory says that people are mostly good and will make mostly altruistic choices, but it incorrectly assumes that people are given *equal* choices. And from that feminists ask the question of whether or not gendered women have to be *more* altruistic to keep the status quo. I really like those big theoretical questions in political thought: Who should rule? What is justice? And this question, in my opinion, is another great example of a \u201cbig theoretical question.\u201d\n\nEdit to add: my current studies are having me look less at global political economy. I\u2019m working on a paper now on queer tourism and national declarations of queer security in Sub-Saharan Africa. But there is definite room to consider neoliberal valuations of queer people as economic commodities (\u201cpink washing\u201d) in places like Cape Town.",
