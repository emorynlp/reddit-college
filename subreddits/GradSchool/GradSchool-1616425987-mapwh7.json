  "text": "Last week, I officially finished my master\u2019s degree. I thought I would feel triumphant and proud, but honestly I\u2019m kind of feeling like I just missed out on two years of my 20s and that I\u2019m behind others my age in terms of starting a career, getting settled somewhere, etc.\n\nI know this is irrational. I now have a graduate degree from a great school and I have a good job related to my field lined up. So I have no reason to feel so blue. Just wondering if anyone can relate to this feeling or has any advice.",

I really enjoyed my early 20s, but that happiness was short lived. I've been busting my ass for the last 5 yrs working and going back to school to for engineering to make up for the mistakes I made in undergrad. I'm 31 and I'll be 36 by the time I finish grad school and start my career. Age means nothing. Be excited about this next step in your life. You'll be putting to practice everything you've learned over a lifetime of learning. Not to mention no longer being a broke college student sounds like the greatest thing in the world right now lol. For real though, you are on your own timeline and you have your own path.  Don't let others social media influence how you should feel about your accomplishments and where you are in your life. You're exactly where you need to be. Congratulations on completing what a very small population of people in this WORLD has done.",

But now it's starting to sink in that at the very least, just having this graduate degree is going to lead to so many more opportunities in my field that were just not available to me previously.  I'm not going to just be rejected from job opportunities because I don't have a graduate degree.\n\nYou'll have your whole life to settle down, and you'll likely advance in your career much more quickly with your graduate degree.  Bask in your achievement, especially since you have a job in your field already lined up!",

After about 7 years, I'll have almost 50 years to do jobs, traveling, and moving if I want to keep working until I'm 75 (which is likely, I want to die on a project).",

Makes sense for super ambitious people - however, it is important to slow down and make a conscious, mindful effort to celebrate your graduation for what it is - A MASSIVE ACCOMPLISHMENT. \n\nCONGRATULATIONS \ud83c\udf89",

It sounds a lot like what you're going through. The body and mind build up a giant load of stress from graduate school, especially the thesis process. Many end up hitting huge funks right after they finish. It's a huge relief, but your body is so used to the constant stress that it doesn't really know what to do. A couple of the commenters on this thread note they slept for 12+ hours afterwards. It's a pretty common experience according to Bren\u00e9. She does a lot of research on emotions and burnout and completing the stress cycle.\n\nIt's super informative stuff if you care to listen. Hope you feel better soon AND CONGRATULATIONS!!!!",

For 2 or more years, your time is never yours and you have little to no money. It's hard not to look at people with even meager salaries whose job stops with the clock and wonder if your choice was worth it. I think the best thing you can do is stop dwelling on the past. You can't turn back time, so wondering if you made the right choice won't change your present or future. If you are worried you wasted two years of your 20s, then get to living. (FYI as someone on the other side of 30, turns out you don't die, it's still a ton of fun.) You just accomplished a huge step in your career and life, now get on with the next one!",

At the end of the day, we'll be dead in 90 years and nothing we do now will have mattered for the most part.\n\nPeople can celebrate whatever they want but to me, getting my Master's won't be that big of a deal as I have higher ambitions. I have a bunch of great memories from my program and made a lot of friends, but the reality is I'm at an arguable T5 program and there are idiots in my cohort. I can't imagine (but I can, actually) the situation at lower ranked programs or non-STEM departments.\n\nPhD's are a bigger deal and I have no experience with that. I'm sure getting one is cool, but falls into similar issues.",

I had something like email anxiety - every time I saw I had an email in my inbox, I\u2019d be nervously wondering if it was my advisor sending me bad news.
