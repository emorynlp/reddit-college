  "text": "Hi, last time I posted here was a thread about application process to my current university in Austria. I recently defended my thesis and received an offer from my thesis advisor. \n\nI  can assure you that the master's was extremely frustrating, it was 3 semesters for courses + 1 semester for a thesis. The major problem I faced was finding a topic and an advisor for my thesis. It took me SO MANY MONTHS to get a topic, I have talked to many professors from different departments and different universities. It was ridiculous; although it could also be that things aren't really crystal clear. When I did my bachelors, things have to be official and one must be bound to the advisor. Whereas here, it was more like, you go and try experimenting for a month or two and see if you like it or not, and if you do you continue with the topic. I only figured this after a semester or so, I decided to just take any topic (I knew at that time, that it's something that I absolutely do not want to do, but I had no other option). I did it for a month, I told my previous advisor that I can't continue, it's not interesting and I can't push myself into it. He understood, I continued looking and sending e-mails to different institutes and professors at the university. One of them was my current advisor, he said he has an opening, that was late 2019, we agreed to start on March 2020 as they had too many students at that time, and February was a semester break. Corona happened, starting delayed until August 2020. Honestly, the worst thing about all this is financing, I was bleeding money, it's also very expensive here compared to where I come from. I have definitely broken down so many times, very close to giving up as I am UNABLE to get to the finish line. I'm glad that I managed to get over that hurdle. I sincerely hope the PhD isn't as depressing, especially after hearing many burn-out stories here in the sub. I feel like there are fewer success stories than struggle ones. It makes sense though, you don't necessarily reach out if you're doing well. \nAnyway, I did materials science, and now my PhD is in physics. I remember someone saying that MS isn't really interesting and that I was ''unlucky'' or some sort to be doing this masters. I kept asking myself during every course I took, if this is interesting or not, just because of that comment. You know what? it was never close to boring. I honestly did not exactly know what I am getting myself into, but I knew what I DID NOT want to do.\nSimilar to my first advisor, I KNEW I DID NOT WANT TO DO IT, but I went ahead against my intuition just to prove to myself - that it was indeed not the correct decision. Obviously this varies from person to another, but in a world of unknown circumstances, my gut feeling guides me (kinda - it's also a lot of thinking).\n\nAnyway, what I want to say, even if things are looking grim, even if things look hopeless, just do what you can do. You have an assignment to submit? do it, giving up on the cause won't take you forward, finishing the assignment will. No one is replying to your applications? so what? File more, get in their faces, go to their offices (bit hard currently, but it does help getting a word from them)",

While these are amplified here, there is a pretty significant selection bias to using this sub if you fall into that category, as it serves as a good outlet for complaints. Is the PhD experience perfect? No. Is it easy? No. Are there plenty of days that suck? Yes. But overall it's a net positive, and the prize at the end is justified and worth it. There are plenty of people who have fine, good, and even great experiences in their PhD program. Most are fine, you just aren't as likely to hear from them here.\n\nI say this not to minimize the suffering of those whose experiences have been truly bad, but rather to point out that there is about as equal of a likelihood of your experience being good as there is for it being bad - which is like most jobs, particularly if you're one of us who came straight from college. All my friends hate their jobs! You'll be underpaid and likely overworked, but it generally ends up being worth it, and more importantly, you'll at least be doing something interesting and hopefully fulfilling. Plus, for all the things that suck, there are lots of cool perks. For example, on Monday I spent essentially the entire day reading and thinking. Almost nowhere else could you do that and it not be a problem. I'm also more or less my own boss, albeit with some oversight from a relatively accessible CEO. Plus, I've grown measurably in terms of my knowledge and ability, and there are people here who have a vested interest in enhancing my intellect, and preparing me to be an independent scientist. Even in a job where your boss takes an interest in you (\"takes you under their wing\") it doesn't really equate to the same thing.\n\nI know you said a lot more than this in your post, I just thought by addressing this statement and sharing some of my experience it might ameliorate some of your pessimism about the next phase.",
