  "text": "Is there a way to transfer the references library to Word with the same chronological order (the order in which they were added to the library)? They change into alphabetical order when I transfer them to Word. I had the same problem when I wrote my manuscripts, but the references were less than 50; I was able to rearrange the order manually using (edit & manage citations) from Word. I'm writing my thesis, and it would be a nightmare to do such a thing with +300 references.",
