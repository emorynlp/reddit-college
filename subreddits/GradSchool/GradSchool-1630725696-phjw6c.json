I need to include (1) past research experiences, (2) topics of research interest, (3) why \\[department\\] is a good fit to pursue research interests, and (4) ways in which I've demonstrated  resilience and resourcefulness. Is this supposed to be like an undergraduate applications essay, where I include a bit of personal information about myself and connect it to my own life (and have a bit of fun with it), or am I purely supposed to write about my research interests? For a bit of context, I've worked in pediatric endocrinology research for 2 years but would like to go into Neuroscience for my PhD. I'm having trouble connecting the 2 as well bringing them into my own personal life... I am able to tell a back story that explains my love for Endo, as well as a personal story that connects to my interest in Neuro, but I'm struggling tying everything together. Do I focus on one over the other, or is it better to have an essay that includes everything but isn't cohesive as a unit? Do I write about how my relationship with my diabetic brother sparked my love for endocrinology, or how working as a with paraplegics in a ski/snowboard setting made me realize I want to work in rehabilitation/regenerative medicine? I can't exactly connect the two very well and I feel like the essay as a whole will be so disjointed if I include both. The only connection between the two is the idea of wanting to help people, but that is way too broad to use. please help hahahahah\n\nSincerely a very lost and overwhelmed girl in need of guidance ", "author": "sarahdarah123", "created": 1630725696, "retrieved": 1632953154, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hbm39dh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phjw6c/writing_phd_admission_personal_statement_do_i/hbm39dh/", "text": "I would recommend having a little bit of fun. Obviously dont make a joke out of the essay, there is definitely an art to showing your personality through your writing, but focus on your research experience and interests. The personal story might not go too far, but talk about what interests you about neuroscience. Kind of extract from the personal story the lessons and take home points and write about those. If I were on an admissions committee though, an essay that showed some personality would catch my eye more than a dry, almost clinical essay in a sea of others written similarly.", "author": "GayMedic69", "created": 1630789874, "upvotes": 1}, "hbkikkk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phjw6c/writing_phd_admission_personal_statement_do_i/hbkikkk/", "text": "Normally people just talk about research and professional experiences. Don\u2019t worry at all if your previous research doesn\u2019t perfectly line up with what you plan to do. It\u2019s understandable if there\u2019s a gap due to availability of experiences or just because you simply changed your mind! \n\nI\u2019m an electrical engineer with a focus in power systems, but my power systems experience is a bit disjointed. I\u2019ve always worked for power companies or in power research, but the exact work is disjointed because of what was available to me. If you want to talk about working with the paraplegic in a skiing/snowboarding setting, it\u2019s definitely not frowned upon. I personally wrote a lot about environmental justice and some personal reasons why in mine. I grew up bordering a superfund site that impacted a lot of family and friends health, so taking careful considerations into power systems research that aren\u2019t necessarily based in engineering and science are important in my thought process. Within power development, they sorta just built the grid and plants with a NIMBY attitude, so a lot of equipment is in lower income neighborhoods with no care for how it impacts the community. \n\nI personally am of the opinion that, at least in STEM, we don\u2019t focus enough on the humanity/social side and impact of our work. Showing some greater understanding of the impact that your work has on the people/things it affects rather than just the scientific end result is a very valuable quality in a scientist/engineer, imo. It brings some nuance to your thought process for things unmeasurable by science.", "author": "happytransformer", "created": 1630764256, "upvotes": 2}, "hbj4sp7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phjw6c/writing_phd_admission_personal_statement_do_i/hbj4sp7/", "text": "I'm faculty (now) and would recommend writing about research only, not like a college essay. It wouldn't bother me at all if your research before grad school was different than what you were applying to do in my lab. Talk about the experience you have and about transferable skills/what you learned about the research process. Then move on to talk about what you want to do in grad school.", "author": "icecoldmeese", "created": 1630727942, "upvotes": 7}}}
