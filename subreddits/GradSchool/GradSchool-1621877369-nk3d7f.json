Back to my undergrad, MSc, and research assistant days I was a workaholic. I realized that I actively wean myself out of the \"workaholic researcher\" state of mind during the last months of my RA days in preparation for the start of my PhD. I actually was successful during the first year of my PhD-- supervisors were happy with my progress  even though I don't spend 50+ hrs in the lab. I had time to join uni clubs & societies and attend most/some of their events as well as do some of my hobbies.\n\nI started to feel pressure to overwork again during the lockdown when I would see one of my labmates still going to the lab almost everyday even though our supervisor didn't really require us to (we were both considered essential workers for our institute since we were in charge of refilling N2  for one of the NMRs in our bldg). Soon, other labmates were also coming to the lab even during lockdown since they also feel pressured to come (including me), seeing that my supervisor was pleased that this one student that was still generating results/data. I relapsed to my workaholic researcher days shortly after this, to the point that I felt guilty not working during the Christmas break because I knew that my labmates were still working in the lab (granted most of them did not celebrate Christmas). I burned out around that time and what's worse is it took like 2 months of barely scraping by (and a very disappointing progress report during our lab meeting) before I can regain interest with my research again. \n\nIt's just really hard to maintain a non-workaholic attitude when you see all the people in your lab being a workaholic.
