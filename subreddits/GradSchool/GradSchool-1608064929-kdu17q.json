Or maybe I'm just screaming into the void, not sure. A lot of times it's easy to feel unmotivated, especially during this pandemic and quarantine. Isolation, working from home, economic uncertainty, death..sometimes these things make feeling motivated and okay very difficult. The difficulty in motivating yourself can make you judge yourself for being \"stupid\", \"lazy\", or \"worthless\". Especially for perfectionists (like me; it's not a good trait). In these times I've found it helps to remember:\n\n**YOUR VALUE IS NOT BASED ON YOUR PRODUCTIVITY!!**\n\nEven though some people may make you feel like it is, including those people with \"perfect\" lives on Facebook who workout by fighting sharks at 3 am every morning or the thousands of blogs teaching how to optimize every aspect of your life. Or your own negative thoughts. No matter how \"lazy\" you apparently are, this does not change things. It doesn't matter how many attempts and failures at getting work done you have. You are valuable. Until you remember this, you won't regain peace with yourself and motivation, no matter how many motivational speeches you watch on YouTube. Be kind to yourself and start with the smallest possible goals and tasks.\n\nI half wrote this for myself but I hope it can be a good reminder to someone else.", "author": "Ankhsty", "created": 1608064929, "retrieved": 1632953739, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 471, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gg3m4s8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kdu17q/your_value_is_not_based_on_your_productivity/gg3m4s8/", "text": "It is so hard to be kind to myself.
