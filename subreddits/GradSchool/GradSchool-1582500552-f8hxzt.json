I've been working on this project for months and finally it got accepted! It makes me feel like I can actually contribute some good ideas. Sending positive vibes to you all, hope to join you in grad school one day.",

There\u2019s so much going on, and if you\u2019re presenting, it\u2019s even more enriching. \n\nAs a young professional, I highly suggest listening to the podcast HelloPhD \u201cEpisode 097: Conference like the Pros\u201d.\n\nIt was really helpful for me (even though I also wasn\u2019t in grad school during my first conference).",
