  "title:": "I made a new friend in grad school!",
  "text": "Just wanted to share something that made my day. I\u2019m a first year PhD student and like many on this subreddit I\u2019ve been encountering the struggles of classes and research in an entirely online space, trying to find a work/life balance, and dealing with imposter syndrome and trying to feel like I belong at a top-tier research university that just doesn\u2019t feel like home yet. \n\nThis semester I\u2019m taking a class that has undergrads in it, and this super bright sophomore who is taking this upper level class reached out to me to ask some questions about a project. I met up with him on zoom, helped him with his questions, and then we ended up chatting for an hour, just talking about hobbies, where we grew up, and campus things that I didn\u2019t know yet since it\u2019s my first year. I feel like haven\u2019t made a new friend in over a year since I graduated undergrad, and it was amazing just getting to connect with someone in a deeper way. At the end of our talk, he told me \u201cYou\u2019re really cool.\u201d And that just made my day. \n\nEven if there are moments where you\u2019re insecure about your accomplishments, whether you belong, or your work, don\u2019t forget that the lens inward is always way more critical, and you\u2019re probably admired and respected for where you\u2019re at right now. And even outside of school your personality and interests are important to hold onto in your identity. If you need the reminder today, you\u2019re really cool.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards! Grad school and particularly online grad school is tough, but best of luck to all you cool people. Even if you haven\u2019t been able to make deeper connections yet don\u2019t give up! There is time and you\u2019re not alone.",
