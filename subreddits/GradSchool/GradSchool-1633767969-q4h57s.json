  "text": "Hey all, \nI\u2019ve been looking into grad schools, specifically in regards to business. My concern is, will I be able to handle grad school or will I fail out. I\u2019m graduating soon from an undergrad in Econ, however I was on academic probation for much of the time, and am not graduating with high marks at all. Nevertheless, I\u2019m still graduating, so I wanted to hear of anyone in similar situations who still was able to attend grad school? What\u2019s the best practices to do better in grad, or even to get into grad in the first place? \nThanks!",

      "text": "I think it depends on how you plan on going about grad school. Part time? Full time? Applying for appointment-ships as an RA/TA? \n\nI\u2019m a 2nd year grad student and I do a minimum of 3 hours of TA/Research/Homework every single day to keep on top of things. Procrastinating has very different consequences when pursuing higher degrees and the stakes are higher. It\u2019s worth it because you grow a lot as a professional / scholar, but you need to understand it will expect more from you day to day.",
