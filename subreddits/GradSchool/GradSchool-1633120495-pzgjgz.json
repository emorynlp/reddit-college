  "title:": "Trouble with making friends in my program",
  "text": "I\u2019m currently in year 2 of my 2-year social work program. The first year was entirely virtual but I still managed to make some acquaintances and friends in my cohort who I\u2019ve met up with a few times. I have noticed other people have already formed friend groups and hang out all the time. While I have a few people I would consider a \u201cfriend\u201d I don\u2019t have a group or people I hang out regularly with from my program. \n\n\nThis year, some classes are in person so we\u2019ve been able to be together in person. I was excited for classes, but on my first day I felt weird seeing a lot of people already hanging out and posting pictures on social media before class. It seems like lots of people are already friends and make plans. I am a busy person outside of class so I usually aim to only be on campus 30 mins before class and maybe a little after. Some people seem to hang out on campus all the time with each other. \n\nI guess I\u2019m feeling self conscious that I\u2019m not super buddied up with a lot of people. There are people I know from other classes and can say hi to but I don\u2019t feel that I have many friendships and am struggling to feel confident in pursuing them when it seems like everyone else is already friends with people they like. I can reach out to people more and maybe be on campus more but it seems so overwhelming with everyone so excited to be in person and social. Like, I want friends but also have some social anxiety and don\u2019t really know what to do. \n\nI find this dilemma to be distracting me from classes and doing work. I\u2019m just really bad at making friends and get overwhelmed easily. Does anyone have any advice or guidance?",

      "text": "Hi! Sorry that this is making you feel self-conscious.\n\nI imagine that the people who seem super buddied up had a lot of online/texting communication in the last year. Or at least one of them is quite extraverted and willing to take on the awkwardness of starting the social interaction.\n\nIf you're socially self-conscious, it becomes difficult to overcome this without other outgoing people in the small group that you started friendships with to get the ball rolling on more regular hangouts. \n\n> I am a busy person outside of class so I usually aim to only be on campus 30 mins before class and maybe a little after.\n\nAre you willing to change this? I know that is sucks, but face-to-face contact is going to be the best way to build those friendships. Sometimes the rest of your life will prohibit that (mine does too, I'm totally prepared to not make true friends during grad school), but it's a tradeoff.\n\nSome options:\n- You could plan a regular activity. The plus of something that reoccurs is that it becomes easier to invite folks. e.g., \"Hi everyone, whoever wants to meet at the bar/park/computer labs/study space on Fridays after class, I'll be hanging out there!\" Scary the first time, but every time after that is easier.\n- Find one of the groups already hanging out and build a connection with a single person from that group.\n\nI know this is difficult, so I wish you the best of luck!",
