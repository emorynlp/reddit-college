Then I tape the list to the wall beside my desk and cross items off in red pen as I go.\n\nMy current list involves semi-big items like \"finish marking all final exams\" or \"send draft of manuscript x to coauthor\"",

      "text": "I'm with you on that. At least for me, I've found WFH is out of the question until probably next semester. Library or lab is where I gotta go. And designating something fun with others at the end of a long day helps me instead of thinking I should just get it all done today, I'll think I have dinner planned at 5 so I want to be in a good place then so I can physically and mentally walk away from my work and enjoy the moments away. This helps me focus when I return to work too. Home stretch, I believe in you!",
