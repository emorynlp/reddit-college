  "text": "Title says it all but basically, as a first semester graduate student, I'm trying to find ways to see if the literature I'm actually finding is any good, based on the journal it comes from. I discovered Beall's list and I've been looking at different sites and what not for cataloguing impact scores and similar types of information. It's remarkable how many big databases (AGRIS for example) carry some really bad papers in their midst...\n\nFor additional context: my research is within agroecology and my project has to do with vermicompost tea. This literature review I'm doing involves comparing solid vermicompost with liquid vermicompost, and the methods used to analyze them both, in addition to their compared benefits and detriments. \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Faculty in your department will have a good handle on the journals that are trustworthy and generally publish good work, particularly for niche topics, so you can ask them for help too. Maybe talk to your advisor too?\n\nGenerally, impact factor can be used as an indicator for how often the average publication from a journal gets cited in a given year, but, for example, it doesn't paint an entire picture of how the peer review process was for a specific paper-- this is where faculty in your field can be of assistance. An indicator I ask colleagues and other faculty when I'm looking at new journals to either publish in or look into some more is \"Have you or would you review an article for this journal?\"\n\nAlso, look at the papers that are citing the literature in question. For publications that are relatively recent and may only have a few articles that have cited it, look out for the journals that are citing this work too. This can be an indicator of the impact of a specific paper and where it's influencing the field, particularly if newer work ends up in well-known journals. This is also a good check, because I think you should be aware of articles with only self-citations.",

      "text": "Take a look at [scite\\_](https://scite.ai/)! It is expanding more and more and looks at the way the papers are cited to determine if there are positive, neutral or negative reports of it. \n\nIn my area (psychology), there isn't always a relationship between high impact to good papers. And just because there are lots of citations, it doesn't reflect the nature of those citations or if recent evidence has refuted it. But psychology is going through a bit of a replication crisis so maybe I'm being more skeptical than makes sense in other fields.",
