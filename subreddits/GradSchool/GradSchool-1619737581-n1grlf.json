For those of you in the market, and with money to spend, I really recommend Agendio: it's upwards of $60 but you can customize almost every aspect of it. It was WELL worth it to me; I saved up for it. Not only do they have the hourly spreads for the whole week, but they also allow you to insert spare pages, which I used to insert grid pages at the beginning of each month and create habit trackers for the month. You can swap out almost everything, and really customize it to what you will remember to check the most, and where you anticipate you'll be writing info down. For example, if you prefer to write your responsibilities each day instead of making a schedule every day like mine, you can swap out the boxes so that they're empty spaces. If you work a 9-5, you can use a 8am-6pm layout, but if you have stuff to remember at 7 am and midnight, you can find an 18-hour layout.
