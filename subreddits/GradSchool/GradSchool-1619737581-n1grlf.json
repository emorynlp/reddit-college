  "text": "Recently I decided to get a journal/planner to write down my day to day task lists and reminders. Initially I was a bit skeptical about the idea but it ended up booking my productivity because I have records of all the things I need to do and it boosts my morale on days I'm not feeling very productive. \n\nAll on all I highly recommend getting a daily planner to organise your work.",

For example, 11-12 I do this class homework, 12-1 I catch up on lecture notes for this class, 1-2 I read my textbook on this class, etc. It takes 3 minutes and it helps a lot with procrastination. If you procrastinate, you essentially have this metric telling you how much you're procrastinating. I will realize that I took an hour reading a 3-paged document, when I could've read it in 15 mins if I hadn't been procrastinating.",

I also try to write down the activities I would like to do the following day right after, so it is still fresh in my mind and I don\u2019t forget to continue it the next day.

      "text": "I couldn't agree with this more; the one semester I really felt on top of my academics was when I bought a planner *and actually used it.* I had a planner with a weekly spread of daily schedule broken down by the hour, so that I could color in the hours that I had classes or mandatory appointments. For those of you in the market, and with money to spend, I really recommend Agendio: it's upwards of $60 but you can customize almost every aspect of it. It was WELL worth it to me; I saved up for it. Not only do they have the hourly spreads for the whole week, but they also allow you to insert spare pages, which I used to insert grid pages at the beginning of each month and create habit trackers for the month. You can swap out almost everything, and really customize it to what you will remember to check the most, and where you anticipate you'll be writing info down. For example, if you prefer to write your responsibilities each day instead of making a schedule every day like mine, you can swap out the boxes so that they're empty spaces. If you work a 9-5, you can use a 8am-6pm layout, but if you have stuff to remember at 7 am and midnight, you can find an 18-hour layout. It's really incredible.",

I used one where I went through the weekly spreads and put major deadlines/exams on the date they were due, highlighted. Then, in pencil, I would write the list of things to do every single day, roughly in order of importance, crossing them off as I went or erasing and rewriting as needed. I saved the monthly spreads to decorate with stickers, draw pictures of things I\u2019d done, and basically try to visually emphasize anything remotely fun I did. That way when I look at my past months, I feel encouraged by seeing even the tiniest bit of fun memorialized on the page. It\u2019s also satisfying looking back at the weekly spreads to see how much you accomplished. Ultimately, I got so busy that I moved to a aesthetically color coded google calendar because I needed to plan my time by the hour, rather than just lists. But, I think one should start with a basic list planner and then upgrade to more intense ways of detailing your time after you build a routine.",

I use the reminders app on my phone for the rest of it. I have different lists for each class, but I mostly view tasks in the general list so I can see how my days are planned out. I don\u2019t put everything in there though, mostly just when I have a lot I need to get done and want to make sure I don\u2019t forget anything. Sometimes I put them in the order I feel like I want to do them in and put little time reminders as an estimate of when I should start/be finished with something, sometimes I don\u2019t. The flexibility to decide on a case by case basis works for me, probably not for everyone though lol.",
