  "text": "Edit: Thank you all for commiserating with me, sending me words of encouragement, and just generally engaging in this discussion. I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience. \n\n.\n\n\nComplete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:\n\n.\n\n\n\nI love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don\u2019t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I\u2019m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. \n\nWhat I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can\u2019t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit. \n\nI understand this may ruffle some feathers in a sub where a majority of its subscribers are hardworking individuals and high achievers who will probably end up in academia. But I\u2019m done with it and I feel so liberated saying this.",

      "text": "I do think there is an element of this problem that is self-imposed.  I did not work that hard in grad school - honestly I probably averaged like 30 hours/week, tops.  It's doable if that's what you want.  I intentionally chose a hands-off professor who gives his students a lot of flexibility, and I set pretty firm limits with myself about not working in the evenings or weekends.  I chose a committee that is known for being friendly/supportive rather than rigorous.\n\nOf course there's a trade-off -  I'm graduating a little later than most of my cohort, but I'm by no means the last.  I probably have fewer and lower-impact papers than them.  I definitely could not get a job in academia.  But I do have a job lined up at a high-profile consulting company that I'm hella excited for.\n\nAnd during the last 5 years, I've had a lot of fun!  I got married, I've gone on great vacations, I've read a ton of books and knitted a lot.  I have the best quality of life of anyone I know.\n\nNot everyone wants this, and that's okay.  But you can choose to set limits on work, and still graduate.",

Really, to anyone thinking about a PhD....don't do it unless you are VERY confident that you are willing to sign your life over to that field and understand that for the next 5 years you will be consumed by it for very little pay or even a debt.  \n\n\nMaybe it takes this sort of experience to figure out that it isn't for you, but if you are graduating college looking forward to \"work life balance\" then don't do a PhD.",

          "text": "A lot of people think that graduate school is the only way to advance their career, and often times it is depending on their field. I was well aware of what I was getting into, having been involved in academic research for over a decade. I will never regret getting my PhD. It\u2019s the hardest and the most rewarding thing I\u2019ve ever done. However, this experience also illuminated for me that academia is a broken system rife with elitism, competition, and bureaucracy. Something I\u2019ve always known but thought it was worth dealing with to be a scientist. Another thing is that people keep perpetuating the \u201cyou have to sacrifice work-life balance to be a good academic\u201d narrative. Academia gaslights us into believing that you have to submit yourself to that kind of life, and then feel inadequate when we don\u2019t want to be subjected to that because those who have bought into the culture make us feel like we aren\u2019t good scientists because of it. I urge you to unlearn that you have to \u201csign your life over to your field\u201d, it will truly liberate you.",

And for those who say that kind of crazy dedication helps you finish faster, that definitely is not always the case. I finished in about the same amount of time as my friends who put in 2-3x the hours. Given all that, I knew academia wasn\u2019t the right path for me. Realizing that early on I was able to start educating myself about industry, jobs that are out there, and who to talk to to learn about and actually get those jobs. Now I still work 40-50 hour weeks and no weekends and make 2x what I would as a postdoc. Don\u2019t let the guilt of leaving academia dissuade you, it\u2019s perfectly fine to want to have a life.",

However, bear in mind, no matter what line of career you end up in, academic or otherwise, if you want to be in the top 1% of successful people (the metric for how this is measured varies according to the line of work), you are going to have to put in the hours. On the flip side, there is nothing wrong with wanting to work 40-50 hours and maintaining an strict work-life balance, but doing this you're likely going to have to make peace with being a cog in the machine, with minimal control over the larger aspects of the work you're doing and possibly fewer avenues for career growth. But as I said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Life is yours! You get to decide what to do with it!",

Of course it's not about money, I get to do something I love.

I do believe it\u2019s absolutely possible based on my own experience and that of a few of my friends. While I am certainly not saying I can just phone it in for 40 hours a week and make six figures in the private sector or in the government, I also know that the work I would be doing would require totally different levels of mental input than what an academic career demands. The point is that the work would be categorically different than what I am doing now as a scientist.",

And for a long time I believed that to be a scientist you had to just accept the hard but rewarding work (and that\u2019s true). And for a long time I didn\u2019t care that much about the money at all, I just wanted to do what I loved. However, when I started my program and had to take a huge paycut to follow my dreams it was a rough adjustment. Like I said, I am in my thirties and getting paid a pathetic stipend while most of my friends have well-established careers. It\u2019s hard to really explain this to people who have never been passionate about something. You\u2019re willing to make those drastic sacrifices. However, the cutthroat competition, the pressure to publish or perish, the stress and anxiety of always feeling like you\u2019re not as capable or as smart as your peers is truly starting to ruin me emotionally. Maybe I\u2019m just another academic casualty. I still want to do something that\u2019s science adjacent, just not this...not this way.\n\nEdit: it was less intellectually stimulating work but it was research that other people created. I wanted to be a scientist, not a research assistant. And although at the time I was getting paid more than I do now, I was basically at my earning ceiling, and I would not have been able to earn more or progress in my research career without an advanced degree.",

Stepping out of the ivory tower is still seen as betrayal to many higher academics unfortunately. My supervisor has made off-hand comments about my friends taking positions in industry or management/policy/technician/sci-comm roles, as if she thinks they suddenly can't expand their career options beyond one path. I'm in Aus and although academia is probably more relaxed here than in many places, it's still insane.\n\nJust today I told my PhD supervisor that one of my friends got the industry  science management job I had applied for (we were both qualified, but my friend's a bit further ahead of me. So thrilled for her regardless). My supervisor's disappointed response: \"hmm I thought she would go into research...\" What the fuck? So she has a PhD in research but can't possibly do work in related areas? And during a situation where jobs are so hard to find due to a worldwide pandemic? Good to know my supervisor will be disappointed in my future endeavours then...\n\nThe job my friend got is 37 hours a week, full time in a small city, and pays 85-92K a year for conducting really collaborative and important work. Weekends. Holidays. No expectation to work once you leave your office. Entry level - only a bachelor's degree was required. That's the fucking dream man. Fuck the 90 billion-hour week, the publishing/funding slavery, and the academics who try to pigeon-hole you into one niche career path for the rest of your working life. After my supervisor made comments suggesting Post Docs today, I just smiled and nodded silently. No thanks. \n\nSubmitting my PhD thesis in four months, publishing my chapters for closure and planning my leave. Have multiple exit plans but times are difficult and opportunities few. Full solidarity with you here.",
