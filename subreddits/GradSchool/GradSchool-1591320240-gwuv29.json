I wrote this last night during a mini anxiety attack so my post probably came off as disorganized, whiny, entitled, and perhaps defensive. As I responded to someone below, the whole point of this was to say that I ultimately want to have a career where my work is financially valued more than it is in academia. I want my life to be about passion, and science is something I am truly passionate about. However, I am also of the opinion that at the end of the day a job is a job is a job and we should all demand to be compensated appropriately for our level of education, skill, and experience. \n\n.\n\n\nComplete stream of consciousness below and seriously not even worth reading:\n\n.\n\n\n\nI love being an academic scientist in the sense that I enjoy doing the research, the hours of reading/learning that goes into it, the discussion, and generally the *idea* of being an academic. But I hate doing the fucking work. I hate it. I don\u2019t want to do it anymore. I hate having to write, the deadlines, having to come home after a full workday and continue working on my couch at 8pm like I\u2019m doing right now editing my prelim exam. I am just not a person who believes that your work should permeate every aspect of your life. I want the work-life balance and I want to get paid well for the work that I do. My (now ex) partner started a job as an assistant professor at a small liberal arts college last May after graduating for $50k a year. Like, wtf. I was earning that much as a research coordinator with a BA before I started my PhD. \n\nWhat I want is to work my 40-50 hours, and then go home for the weekend, smoke a bowl, and live my life without having work on my mind all the time. But most of all, I want to get paid more than what I would get paid as a professor. I can\u2019t wait to finish my PhD in two years and dip the fuck out into government or private sector. The idea of having to put so much fucking effort into my career makes me want to vomit. \n\nI understand this may ruffle some feathers in a sub where a majority of its subscribers are hardworking individuals and high achievers who will probably end up in academia. But I\u2019m done with it and I feel so liberated saying this.", "author": "SaintLoserMisery", "created": 1591320240, "retrieved": 1632953966, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"ft5t7tq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gwuv29/i_rant_i_want_to_be_completely_candid_about/ft5t7tq/", "text": "I do think there is an element of this problem that is self-imposed.  I did not work that hard in grad school - honestly I probably averaged like 30 hours/week, tops.  It's doable if that's what you want.  I intentionally chose a hands-off professor who gives his students a lot of flexibility, and I set pretty firm limits with myself about not working in the evenings or weekends.  I chose a committee that is known for being friendly/supportive rather than rigorous.\n\nOf course there's a trade-off -  I'm graduating a little later than most of my cohort, but I'm by no means the last.  I probably have fewer and lower-impact papers than them.  I definitely could not get a job in academia.  But I do have a job lined up at a high-profile consulting company that I'm hella excited for.\n\nAnd during the last 5 years, I've had a lot of fun!  I got married, I've gone on great vacations, I've read a ton of books and knitted a lot.  I have the best quality of life of anyone I know.\n\nNot everyone wants this, and that's okay.

I finished in about the same amount of time as my friends who put in 2-3x the hours. Given all that, I knew academia wasn\u2019t the right path for me. Realizing that early on I was able to start educating myself about industry, jobs that are out there, and who to talk to to learn about and actually get those jobs. Now I still work 40-50 hour weeks and no weekends and make 2x what I would as a postdoc.

However, bear in mind, no matter what line of career you end up in, academic or otherwise, if you want to be in the top 1% of successful people (the metric for how this is measured varies according to the line of work), you are going to have to put in the hours. On the flip side, there is nothing wrong with wanting to work 40-50 hours and maintaining an strict work-life balance, but doing this you're likely going to have to make peace with being a cog in the machine, with minimal control over the larger aspects of the work you're doing and possibly fewer avenues for career growth.

Of course it's not about money, I get to do something I love.
