Decided that medical school wasn\u2019t for me, however, I don\u2019t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry. I keep hearing on here that recruiters don\u2019t care if you have an online degree but when I talk to tech friends and family in the Bay Area, many of them urge me to go in-person.\n\nMy main goal is to use the master\u2019s to fill in my CS gaps as well as use it as a springboard to get a job (I live in the Bay). I\u2019m been learning iOS for the last year or so and having this masters is kind of a back-up in the situation that recruiters decide to just trash my resume since I don\u2019t have a CS degree.\n\nI\u2019m currently in this dilemma of whether or not I should attend an online master\u2019s program like OMSCS, UT Austin, or UIUC.\n\nThe other option is to try applying to the on-campus equivalent of these schools as well as some others (UPenn, UCLA, USC). This would probably require me to take the GRE and obtain additional letters of rec.\n\nBut more importantly, my main concern is the cost. OMSCS is 7k and UIUC is around 21k. If I were to be admitted at a good on-campus master\u2019s I\u2019d be paying 70-80k and will probably take out loans. Is the price tag worth it to go in-person? How much of a difference would it make for someone like me who has no previous internship experience?\n\nWould love to hear from those that were in the same dilemma.", "author": "iamthat1dude", "created": 1630961649, "retrieved": 1632844756, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
