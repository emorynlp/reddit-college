I'm often reminded by my peers, therapist, and loved ones how into my work and passionate I am, considering that it took me until undergrad' to finally succeed in education. Teaching students from all different majors, however, made me realize how many other students don't care or contribute when trying to earn good grades.\n\nNow, a majority of my students passed the class, while only 25% actually not passing. Despite the division of grades, or the clear evidence of students simply not caring about the work, I had several students contest me on why they should pass the class (or be saved). One example was a student who I'll call Grace. She was energetic and youthful, very much someone excited about being at a new level if not new position with age. Alas, she came to class on her phone, asleep, and hardly participating, never asking questions; yet, when I would hand  work back, she would flag me down during or after class to explain why I gave her marks and/or low results. I emphasized that she needed to perform tasks as discussed in lecture, and she would simply return with, \"So how do I do that?\"\n\nI've learned that the students who really want to succeed are going to show up and do so. If not, and if they do show signs of struggling, they realistically must expect that they must ask for help or guidance. It's impossible for us to save them, putting all effort on our end instead of theirs (it takes one to save another, just as it takes one to succeed on their own effort).\n\nWhile your professor's comment (or laughter) makes me wince, I support you for doing the right thing and giving the student the grade that they deserved. It hurts having to be the one to make the hard decisions, but if they were actually going to graduate the following quarter, then it was up to them to put the work in to do so.", "author": "fictionfelid", "created": 1576374711, "upvotes": 2}, "fawrs54": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/eagquv/maybe_some_undergrads_shouldnt_graduate/fawrs54/", "text": "This hits soooo close to home rn", "author": "danishruyu1", "created": 1576374677, "upvotes": 2}, "fawnm2w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/eagquv/maybe_some_undergrads_shouldnt_graduate/fawnm2w/", "text": "To be honest, this is me this semester (not literally).

Given I also work at a school for at risk kids, so it's expected.  Our jobs also involve teaching them important character values that their parents didn't.  But it is difficult because most of that character building its cemented in when they are children.

So when a kid from this kind of background goes to college, they being this kind of attitude with them.\n\nOn one hand i feel for that person because college is 10000 dollars and year (if you were a cheap ass like me and went to a cheap school) plus opportunity costs of not working vs high school which is virtually free.
