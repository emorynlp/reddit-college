Is it even manageable to have a side hustle?", "text": "So I'm a newly admitted PhD student (three weeks in). I am supported by a stipend but if I choose to lease a car, I will not be able to afford it with just my stipend. Right now I'm car-less and I feel suffocated. The nearest grocery store is miles away and uber is unideal for frequent transportation. \n\nMy first idea for a side hustle is one that I was planning to work on before grad school but never got the chance. And that's audiobook narration. I have all the equipment and know how to edit. \n\nAnyhow, have you managed side hustles as a graduate student? If so, what did you do and how did you do it?", "author": "mybicepsarenoodles", "created": 1631418117, "retrieved": 1632952671, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"hcnkw28": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pmlf5b/what_kind_of_side_hustles_are_feasible_as_a_grad/hcnkw28/", "text": ">but if I choose to lease a car\n\nI'll second the \"do not lease a car\" advice. That's *almost* as expensive as buying new and generally a terrible deal. There are a very small number of people in really weird situations for whom leasing makes sense. Buying a beat up used car is probably the better option, if you wind up deciding that you absolutely need a car to buy food. \n\nOther options that might or might not be available/realistic depending on factors I don't know:  \n\n* Carpooling to shop with other graduate students  \n* Using a grocery delivery service (these popped up all over the place during the pandemic)\n* Getting a bicycle with a basket on it  \n\nIt's probably a good idea to ask around. Students who have been in your program longer than three weeks have presumably been getting food somehow. Maybe they all just have cars. But if that's *not* the case then whatever they've figured out might also work for you. Maybe there's a bus route you don't know about. Maybe there's already a carpool for this in your department. Maybe there's a tiny family owned grocery store tucked away near campus that doesn't show up on Google maps. Maybe all the grad students have a mutualist agri-co-op on the roof of the building that they've hidden from maintenance for years via a series of progressively less and less plausible hijinks. You never know. \n\nSide hustles the I've done/heard of people doing:\n\n* Tutoring can be good money, depending on the area. $50 or $60 per hour wouldn't be weird where I am, and it's not a crazy HCOL area or anything. Being beholden to undergrads' schedules is a bit annoying, though. \n* Editing papers for authors for whom English is a second language to make them sound more fluent. The pay was *horrid* but the flexibility was awesome. I could earn less than minimum wage *whenever I wanted from home!* There was a service I signed onto that paid per paper over PayPal which has since disappeared, but I'm sure something similar still exists if you snoop around.   \n* Straight up being faculty at a community college (probably only possible post-masters). You'd need a car for this but it could basically be a 20 hr. per week job that pays better than your stipend and at that point you could probably afford it. This would *likely* be a violation of something you signed to receive that stipend so... tread carefully.
