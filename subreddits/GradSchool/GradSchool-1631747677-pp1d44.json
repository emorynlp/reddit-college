After delaying it for one year, I still only got to 10% of it done and I just keep procrastinating, I can't stop. I have severe anxiety and have had some depressive episodes and because of that my supervisor doesn't email me much so I haven't even spoke to him in 2 months. I don't know what to do and I really wanna finish the thesis but there's no way I can get a delayed date by now and I'm just feeling hopeless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I just wrote this to vent and to know if there's anyone out there who's been through a similar experience and how did it turn out ", "author": "throwerpt", "created": 1631747677, "retrieved": 1632952564, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "comments": {"hd1895u": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp1d44/i_messed_up_and_procrastination_won/hd1895u/", "text": "Chances are you've been working on it unconciously/conciously for a year and you certainly know more about the topic than you think you do, so its absolutely doable, but it's important to be strategic. get an idea of how many words you need to write per day til the deadline and keep that as a writing target (some days you'll write more, some you'll write less--youll pick up momentum soon). as long as you have the words on paper youre good and you have material to work with and reshape, move around etc-- but don't spend too long on it because ultimately the best thesis is a finished thesis. this isnt your life's work, just an assignment and a means to a qualification.\n\n i completely get your paralysing anxiety though. I had the exact same with my MA thesis, (and all the coursework that came before it), and I had also had a year-ish to do mine because it was a research masters, but by like 4 weeks before the deadline i barely had a topic, and i had had a lot of trouble getting in touch with my advisor also. when i did manage to get in touch with him, he reminded me of just what i said at the start of this comment, that the ideas are probably there, and to just write. describe the data you're working with (depends on your subject area--i had been doing ethnographic work for a few months, but making little progress on analysis) and the analysis will come out as youre writing it; things will remind you of other things, new arguments will pop out at you--just go with them. ultimately few people will ever read it so you can try out different things.\n\nby a miracle, and with the help of some friends who i could discuss ideas with, and in the home-stretch a friend who i could send it to to help cut it down to meet the word limit, i was able to submit something (it was already about a month late, on the cusp of the very final day i could submit for that academic year) and it ended up going better than i could have hoped. my department loved it and encouraged me to apply abroad for a phd, which ive just started --the cycle of procrastination begins again. procrastination is the enemy though, but the enemy of procrastination is momentum, but its the first few days that are the most frustrating.\n\ni think in the end i was able to write something like 1000/1500ish words a day (?!?!?) for about two and a half weeks and managed to get something in. \n\na friend from my program had a similar situation, but they had such a tough time with the procrastination first time round that they ended up deferring for a year and submitting something then on account of mental health difficulties. i dont know what their final stretch was like, but they ended up winning a significant MA thesis award for that project. i dont think theres any link between how capable you are academically/intellectually, and being able to make deadlines. i think my main advise is just to back yourself, trust that you know your shit and you've prepared (actively/passively, in one way or another, even in procrastination). also knowing that if you can't do it, it's really not the end of the world and go easy on yourself in that respect. \n\ni really hope it goes well for you though!!! sending you big time solidarity vibes", "author": "AAJD", "created": 1631760835, "upvotes": 3}, "hd11tpu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pp1d44/i_messed_up_and_procrastination_won/hd11tpu/", "text": "Get an accountability buddy.

What I\u2019ve learned (and am still learning): be kind to yourself, but also know that you\u2019re ultimately accountable for the decisions that you make. Do you have peers you get along with? An academic counsellor? Sometimes talking to people IRL might help with perspective. I\u2019ve been fortunate to have a supervisor who\u2019s kind and encouraging.
