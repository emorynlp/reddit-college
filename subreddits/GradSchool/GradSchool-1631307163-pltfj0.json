  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've become pretty dead-set on wanting to pursue a masters degree in computer engineering or electrical engineering. I would like to get my masters at a top school. My dream would be MIT, Stanford, CMU, etc. but I'd still be really happy if I got into Georgia Tech, UMich, Berkeley, etc. I'm wondering what my chances would be given my situation.\n\nTo be clear, I'm only interested in pursuing a masters, not a PhD.\n\nTo give a bit more about my background, I'm an undergraduate at Texas A&M University in my junior year. I'm majoring in computer science and will be getting minors in Electrical Engineering and Math, and have a 3.7 GPA. I was a software engineering intern at SpaceX, Tesla, and AMD, and was a machine learning intern at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.\n\nI think my work experience is the thing that will make me stand out.\n\nHowever, I've done my research and it seems that for graduate admissions, they really, really care about prior research experience. I did undergraduate research for 4 months, and I did not like it at all. I'm not interested in research at all, and would not like to do more research as a 'means to an end' just to get into a top masters program.\n\nAdditionally, graduate admissions also seem to care greatly about letters of recommendation. Unfortunately, I do not have a strong relationship with any professor: I've never gone to office hours a day in my life, and have never been involved with professors outside of normal class. My manager at Tesla and some other people from my internships would write good LORs, but they aren't academics so would grad admissions care about LORs from them that much?\n\nI guess my manager at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has an academic background (she has a PhD from Yale), so would an LOR from her stand out?\n\nI'm willing to grind to get a top score on the GRE but given my situation, I need to know if those efforts would be worth it.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR: Strong work experience, decent GPA, but iffy LORs and no research experience. Chances to get into a top masters program?",

      "text": "You have great work experience, unfortunately those dont mean too much for grad school, more so for the job market. Grad schools, even for a masters in engineering or cs, want to see your capabilities as a student first and research plays a big part (among other things). If you're trying to get into tier1 eng schools, your GPA would also need to be higher, especially coming from a lower ranked school you would need to stand out extra since tier 1 CS undergrads would def have an advantage. I recommend reaching out to faculty members in schools you're interested in and see what they suggest.",

As I said in my post, my LORs would mostly be from people in industry rather than academia. I have 1 reference that has an academic background (senior research scientist with a PhD from yale). Would an LOR from her count for anything?",
