  "title:": "Is it normal to feel super overwhelmed/anxious the first few weeks of grad school?",
  "text": "I just started two weeks ago and I\u2019m currently in week 3, just ones class. It\u2019s an online ma counseling program. Been out of school for a whole year. It\u2019s a little different than what I\u2019m used to. 8 week courses (whereas I did 16 weeks before). It\u2019s a lot every week. Reading two chapters for the week for one class and two quizzes and discussion/essays. I feel like these assignments are different that undergrad. Really is making me think harder. Not easy at all. Workload isn\u2019t too bad. But I\u2019m about to have another class soon in two weeks, so there will be overlap between them. I\u2019m scared. Don\u2019t know if I can handle this. I\u2019ve been feeling super anxious and depressed the first weeks and I feel like it\u2019s affecting my ability to work efficiently and effectively. I wasn\u2019t feeling this way before the program, I was actually super excited to start. I\u2019ll be starting meds tomorrow for anxiety. It\u2019s gonna take a while to kick in. But I hope it works and helps me throughout grad school. I\u2019m also gonna do cbt. Just wanna know if others are going through something similar or went through this. I feel bad because there is a lot of other people in this program. They have kids and a full time job and are full time students and seem to be doing fine. I don\u2019t even have a job, I have all the time in the world but am struggling real bad compared to these people.",

      "text": "In the same boat. Just started my first (in-person) semester three weeks ago for my MS, taking two classes while working 30 hours/week and I'm already feeling burned. It didn't feel as taxing in my undergrad working 20 hrs with 12 credits. See a lot of people with kids and full-time work managing to get through it and can't help but feel incapable but I'm sure most if not everyone has dealt with this early on in school. I'm just hanging on and hoping that I can finally get into a routine that feels right.",

      "text": "Friend, it is completely normal to feel overwhelmed for the whole duration.\n\nThe first weeks I was a bit overconfident, then the anxiety set in after that. 4.5 years later, I'm still not sure what I'm doing, but they tell me I'm an expert.\n\nIt's going to feel like everyone except you knows what they're doing, but the truth is that everyone else has gone or is going through the same experience.",

      "text": "Grad school is a lot harder than undergrad and you're expected to do a lot more at a much higher level. So yes, it's normal to feel overwhelmed. The pressure is much higher and you're not given as much direction.",
