  "text": "I\u2019m a third year graduate student in the biomedical sciences and I\u2019m starting to realize that this academia shit is for the birds. I\u2019m an \u201colder\u201d student at 28 and since the pandemic, I\u2019m just at my limit. So many of my peers have money to travel, enjoy life, save for retirement, get married, have children, etc., but I stuck constantly trying to live just above minimum wage until I graduate and hopefully find a decent job. It\u2019s not even really about the money, it\u2019s more of an ache for stability and just being satisfied with where I am in life. I have no hobbies and everything has just been science during my undergrad days. I seriously cannot stand it anymore.",

I feel like I'm putting large parts of my life on hold for this and I'm starting to feel like that's not what I really want.

You aren't made to work your entire life, you have to take time for yourself too. Set boundaries and give yourself time to try things out like going to the gym or painting or knitting or playing video games or something. \n\nAs far as the family and money stuff, it does really suck we get paid jack shit and I do hate feeling like the university is taking advantage of me for cheap labor, so I definitely feel you there.

It\u2019s not that there\u2019s not enough funding per say, it\u2019s just a misallocation of funding due to the perverse incentives we have set up as a society that somehow incentivize people (along every relevant axis) to go into industry as soon as possible while punishing those who dare seek higher degrees to become experts and leaders in their fields. \n(Speaking of America specifically)",

                  "text": "I would actually push back on this a bit. I actually don\u2019t like when people hand wave and blame it on \u201ccapitalism\u201d as there\u2019s actually many [different types of capitalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism). Take northern Europe for example, it\u2019s incoherent to hold that they\u2019re both capitalistic and \u201cgood\u201d countries. But while they are capitalist in nature, most should realize that the way they function is fundamentally different than the US - hence there\u2019s different varieties of capitalism.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a number of things happening right now that are paralyzing America. (This won\u2019t be exhaustive, others may chime in for more things, but you\u2019ll get the point.) **First** is the misalignment of interests between Congress and the general public. Citizens United changed the _formal_ dynamics and allowed representatives to be loyal to Big Industry over their constituents. That is to say if Big Industry are the ones with the money to get you re-elected and the ones paying most of your paychecks, then in most cases you\u2019ll do the absolute minimum for your constituents and most of your efforts will instead be directed towards Big Industry. **Second** is the \u201cFOX News phenomena\u201d characterized by a lack of general knowledge and critical thinking. This has occurred for a variety of reasons, including -but not limited to- the decay of public education, government skepticism due to the myriad of horrible things they did in the 20th century (think MK Ultra and Tuskegee) and continue to do into the 21st (think mass NSA Surveillance), and overall government dysfunction relative to doing things in the public interest. (As an aside, if you measure the function of Congress relative to who it holds loyalty to -Industry- then it\u2019s actually remarkably better at its job than most otherwise think.) Here it\u2019s also important to note that since WW2, an enormous amount of tax payer money has been spent abroad instead of being reinvested into America. One of the clear end results of this is American infrastructure that is quite literally crumbling. Our past governments didn\u2019t invest enough in America and the bill they delayed has now come due. **Third** American institutions were built in the 18th century and could have never anticipated the modern age. The sheer bureaucratic inertia that they wield is a metaphorical Titanic second to none. Trying to change and adapt them in any meaningful capacity is largely a fools errand at this point. (Which is not to say that people shouldn\u2019t try, just that the full degree of necessary change won\u2019t be realized). The enormous growth in the US (and global) population coupled with increasing globalization and the destabilizing effects of the digital age (think Facebook 2016 election), has produced a perfect storm that is straining our institutions to their breaking point. They were never conceived to cohere a society this big or complex. This point is actually very important: analogue institutions cannot organize a digital society fast enough to curb chaos. **Said another way, the US government is facing a fundamental coordination problem.**\n\nIt\u2019s not capitalism itself that is bad. In fact, I\u2019d argue that capitalism is a requirement for any society of this scale - it\u2019s simply not possible to centrally plan economies. What do all of the great cities of Europe have in common? They originated as merchant ports. Florence, for example, became the powerhouse that it was due to the invention of double entry bookkeeping which made banking/accounting much easier and trustworthy - functionally meaning that people wanted to do business with Florence. This invention is arguably what enabled the Age of Exploration and brought medieval Europe out of the Dark Ages. Another example was the rise of Amsterdam due to the creation of the world\u2019s first stock exchange (built to trade shares of the Dutch East India Company). \n\nMy point is that capitalism is inseparable from free markets, and historically the countries that have the best markets with the lowest friction and lowest trust requirements almost exclusively become the countries that dominate the world at their respective periods in time. What\u2019s wrong with America is very specifically the _US instantiation of capitalism_ which is mostly caused and reinforced in a vicious cycle by a number of endemic societal factors. This isn\u2019t the same government that could bust monopolies, run the Manhattan Project, or send us to the Moon. No, those days are long gone. It\u2019s time for something new.",

                          "text": "Here quoting from Wikipedia\u2019s definition of capitalism:\n> Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Central characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, a price system, private property and the recognition of property rights, voluntary exchange and wage labor. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by owners of wealth, property, or production ability in capital and financial markets\u2014whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.\n\nIf your thesis is that capitalism is bad, then you hold some combination of these sentiments:\n1) Price systems (ie stock markets) are bad.\n2) Voluntary exchange is bad.\n3) We should have equality of outcome. (This is the reverse of capital accumulation, which is the prime motivator for people to contribute to society and innovate)\n4) Competitive markets are bad. (Yes we do have effective business cartels in the US, but they aren\u2019t formally instantiated, and most businesses are competitive. Don\u2019t cherry pick to fit your bias.)\n5) Wage labor is bad. (No this doesn\u2019t refer to minimum wage; it refers to the ability for people to sell their work under a legally binding employment contract.)\n6) Decisions regarding investments and prices should not be made by the free market, but feather centrally controlled and dictated by the government.\n\nNow I\u2019m not saying you hold all -or even necessarily any- of those sentiments, I\u2019m just trying to point out that most people don\u2019t realize what the actual tenants of capitalism are.\n\nIf I had to guess you\u2019re probably confusing our governance system (ostensibly a [federal republic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic) but in reality a [plutocracy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy)) with our formal economic system (capitalism). Just because we have no shortage of socio-economic problems doesn\u2019t mean that the root of the issue is our economic system. Government systems and economic systems do have overlap, yes. But the core of the issue is governmental, not economic. If it was economic then the US (as a whole) wouldn\u2019t be a nation of innovators with absurd amounts of money (again as a whole). Alternatively, you could also be critical of the financial system - which is debt based in nature and not fundamentally backed by real tangible goods (like gold for example) see [fiat money](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money). But again, financial systems, although related, are separate from both economic and governance systems. You need to be able to distinguish these in order to pin-point the root cause of the problems manifesting in society.",

I\u2019ve moved 5 times in the last 10 years, and I\u2019m tired. I remind myself that I\u2019ve made it this far. I will give 2-3 more years. If I cannot find a tenure track assistant professor or a permanent research position in 2-3 years, I\u2019m going to dip out and go into the industry. Keeping this idea in mind, I\u2019ve made efforts to keep my foot in the industry (committees and volunteer work).\n\nFor the original OP, I had similar feelings, but decided to push through. Now, in the postdoc, you are treated better, receive a somewhat normal salary, and can focus on one thing: research. You don\u2019t have to worry about a defense, prelim exams, classes, just research. It\u2019s more pleasant. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not stable, but you feel more in control of your future. As I said, I\u2019m giving 2-3 more years of \u201cpostdoc\u201d research, and if I cannot find a stable permanent position, I\u2019m going into the industry. I see the light at the end of the road.

These are absolutely valid and respectable degrees, same as a Bachelors, but they're not PhDs. I honestly don't see any good reason why they *should* have a PhD for an admin position, nor any reason why PhD holders in particular would be uniquely qualified to do an admin job.\n\nEdit: none of the admin positions advertised by my university ask for anything higher than A-levels. And that's for main admin at a top university, not even assistants. I doubt the people managing them have a PhD. A Bachelors, maybe, but if the actual workers only need their A-levels, the person managing them certainly doesn't need a PhD. And the people much higher than that, at the VC or dept head level, are promoted up through the *academic* ranks, not the admin ones, so OP can't hope for those jobs anyway if they're not going into academia.",

But the people without PhDs very quickly hit a glass ceiling at the administrative department director level, assistant dean level, or associate VP level. You just don't see people progressing to those levels without a Phd unless its a specific area like financial / HR offices which have their own metrics, like you say MBA. Yes you sometimes see higher ups with EdDs instead of PhDs but not at the elite schools. \n\n(Either way I'm not sure that quibble is really in the spirit of my original point, but OK)\n\nIn any case the point I'm making is that the university environment is one that acknowledges and rewards academic training. So one who decides to leave the TT and just go do soemthing else can still have a very rewarding career in university admin where their PhD will not be viewed as a \"waste\" of earning potential years.",
