The paper is a group project with four others. We each are expected to research and write about a different theme,  before working together to apply what we have learned to an analysis of a business and to make recommendations, tying in elements from all five themes.\n\n I think I went in with reasonable expectations about the challenges of a group project, but this situation has left me shattered.\n\nThree days ago we had a meeting to review our separate sections (in theory finalised) and look at bringing them together to do the analysis.\n\nBefore the meeting I was reading one member's work and it seemed wildly inconsistent. I checked four or five passages and sure enough, three were blatantly plagiarized. I brought this up in the meeting; the writer undertook to correct it by today. As we reviewed and discussed her section it was evident she had no idea what she had \"written\" and couldn't clarify simple questions.\n\nThree of us met again the next day and emailed the Prof, with whom we met today. At the time of that meeting, we had only found those three examples and had not thought to look at her other sections. Prof's advice was helpful - see what she comes back with. If still suspect, remove it, send it through to him to deal with and crack on. However because she had contributed to other sections of the report, we would need to acknowledge that and continue on.\n\nTonight she has uploaded her 'fixed' section. The three instances I pointed out have been improved, but another (that I had not pointed out) is unchanged. The three of us met up again and looked through her other sections, which, no surprise, also had instances of plagiarism.\n\nWe have emailed Prof and requested that the uni take things from here - it is now well beyond our ability and responsibility to manage. I am anticipating that she will be removed from the group and left to her fate in front of the academic integrity board.\n\nBut - I am now struggling. I cannot believe the utter disregard for others that someone would behave this way and put others at risk of expulsion or at best failure. It is now clear to me that she never had any intention of contributing or collaborating on the group work, and I feel stupid that we delayed much of it to accommodate her need for extensions.\n\nOn the one hand, I have learned a valuable lesson, but on the other I don't think this was a reasonably foreseeable issue.\n\nHer topic was quite important to the analysis,so now we need to work out how to proceed.\n\nI'd be grateful for any advice or experience others have to offer, both with regards to coping/managing the situation, as well as pulling together a paper when missing a key element.\n\nThanks in advance.", "author": "dor_dreamer", "created": 1632844677, "retrieved": 1632951956, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "comments": {"hemxlsf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/px9fpc/masters_group_project_plagiarism_advice_please/hemxlsf/", "text": ">I'd be grateful for any advice or experience others have to offer,\n\nI've been on the other side of this.

Things like this happen occasionally, and I get the story, and figure the best way forward, but I never punish students for bad behaviour from the black sheep. Especially considering the admirable way you identified and attempted to solve the issue. I would be pretty proud of you!  I think it would be appropriate to express your concern to the Prof. that your grade will suffer due to the group member, and see what response you get.

This is terrible to have happen in a setting where you sincerely hope everyone shares a basic level of integrity. Second, this really comes down to the professor IMHO. You all should set up a meeting- in person or virtual but NOT over email- with the remaining members of the group and the professor and discuss the best way forward. Have some suggestions to propose how you all might complete the \"spirit\" of the work to earn your grade, but let the Prof guide the decision making because ultimately they are in charge of how this goes. It's not your fault that someone else chose to plagiarize; dividing up the work is appropriate in a group project, and you are really lucky you caught it. However, obviously you can't use that work, so you and your team are left holding the bag. The professor should be able to offer you a reasonable way out. If they don't, I would consider escalating this to the chair of the department. Try to have as much in writing as possible so it's not anyone's word against anyone else's. Best of luck and congrats on making it to (almost) the end of your master's!", "author": "shackofcards", "created": 1632846766, "upvotes": 3}}}
