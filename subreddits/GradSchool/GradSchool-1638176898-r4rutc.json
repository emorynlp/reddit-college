  "text": "im an undergraduate student, and i 'have my foot in the door' to potentially join a research lab at my university. ive looked through the members of the lab professional backgrounds on LinkedIn, and they all have such interesting pasts and professional experiences that i would love to chat with them about - the work they've done is really interesting.\n\ntechnically, they haven't told me any of this, its just kind of public info. im meeting the members of the lab for the first time in the upcoming week and don't know how to bring this up in casual conversation or approach them about it (\"hey by the way i was stalking your LinkedIn and saw that you had done this\" just doesn't sound right and will probably make me sound creepy). how should i talk to them about it? should i not and just talk about the work that's been posted on the lab's website? the members of the lab are mostly graduate students, along with the prof that's heading it. \n\ni mostly just want to make a good first impression during this meeting so that i can actually join the work they're doing since it really interests me",
