  "title:": "Question for college tutors: need location recommendations and generic advice (intro to logic)",
  "text": "I'm planning to tutor undergraduate students for some extra income. I'd prefer to meet off campus so that I can drive/park. I was considering meeting at a local coffee shop, but I'm concerned that this environment could be too distracting. What do you think? Any off-campus location recommendations that would be appropriate for tutoring college students? \n\nAlso, does anyone have any resources or generic advice on tutoring undergraduates (specifically intro to logic)? How would you recommend structuring an in-person tutoring session? Is there anything you'd recommend avoiding?",

      "text": "My first thought was to tutor at a public library but this might depend as the environments at these can vary. I tutor on my campus, undergraduate with other undergrads, and I generally just try to get to know them a little better the first few minutes of a session(and if the discussion flows certain directions this will happen more as well, it just seems to depend) and after a few meetings we will be fairly acquainted. Logic is out of my wheelhouse though and I'm not sure what I said was helpful, best of luck.",

      "text": "Not sure how things work with the pandemic, but some public libraries have private study rooms that you can reserve. I've tutored in coffee shops before with no issue, as long as you know a priori what the general traffic is like at that time of day. If there's a subreddit for the town or for the university, ask around there for specific recommendations for spaces given your constraints of parking, general time of day & day of week, public access, and presumably free wi-fi. \n\nFor actual pedagogical approaches, the only real answer is that it needs to be tailored to the specific needs of each student. Some need a full rehash of lecture, some will have specific conceptual questions, some may need to see more examples of exercises, some need a babysitter to keep them on task more than anything else, and so on. \n\nThe only specific technique that I highly recommend is encouraging the student to attempt explaining concepts to you in their own words. This is helpful for gauging where their knowledge gaps are, if any. Students frequently struggle to accurately grasp what exactly it is they are misunderstanding, so purely relying on their self-description is less than effective for structuring a session. Also, sometimes the studentreally does understand the concept but just lacks confidence.",

      "text": "I strongly second the idea of looking at a local public library. Whether a coffee shop is too distracting might depend heavily upon the time of day and your student. Some people can study and learn in noisy environments, other's can't. A public library may also be more of a professional setting, and there's a better chance of having easier access to outlets if you or  your student use electronic devices.",
