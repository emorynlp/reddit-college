  "text": "I'm strongly considering getting a Masters after by B.S in Computer Science. I'm pretty new to the process, so just have a lot of questions:\n\n1. What does Terminal Masters mean? Pros and Cons?\n2. I'm strongly leaning towards a non-research based Masters. Is this possible at a top University?\n3. Looked into MIT but they don't seem to have a non-PhD program, is this right? Do they have a non-research based program if they only do PhDs?\n4. How long does it take to get Masters, if I do it over-night while working full time?\n5. What do these programs look for?\n6. What are some programs that are prestigious and some common requirements. For example getting into an Undergraduate program required SAT/ACT, Essay, Rec Letters, etc. What about Masters program?\n7. What should I be doing as a Freshman/Sophomore/Junior to set myself up for success?\n8. When do people start applying? Does undergrad prestige matter?\n9. Anything else I'm not thinking about?",
