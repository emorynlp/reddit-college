  "text": "Look, I appreciate this question doesn't exactly fit here but since it's a forum for graduate students to share their experiences, I'm asking here :) \n\nI'm exactly 1 year into my program. I'm a PhD student in Maths and I do research in a small office-- thanks to lockdowns though, I've never been in the office or met the 10 other people I'll be sharing it with. I started September 2020 in the middle of lockdown in the uk. \n\nI guess what I'm asking is- how do I make friends and socialise in the department having never met them all? Should I go round and say hi? Is it a good idea to ask for socials and propose making a group chat? seeing as we all work in the same faculty that might work?",

      "text": "Talk with the more senior students.  Usually they're the one who already knows everyone in the program and should have somewhat of a social structure setup.  \n\nUsually if a new student in my research group joins, we 100% get them acquainted with everyone within the research group.  We look out for them as they're our own.  We also take the time to get them acquainted with the people outside of our lab and in our program.  \n\nJust talking with people should be good.",

      "text": "I would go around and say hi. People probably do have a science Twitter or something they'd like to give but idk, I feel like just going around asking people for their socials would feel a little like you're interviewing them? I wouldn't make a group chat either, I occasionally use a group chat to talk to the other students in my lab, but I've never texted the majority of the students in my department about work so I feel like that's a bit excessive. Typically trying to get grad students to add new things to their workflow like an extra group chat or slack workspace will be met with friction. \n\nMaybe you could organize a social thing for the students in the department. Ask around and see if other people are interested in like a potluck at the park or snack social hour in a conference room in your building.",
