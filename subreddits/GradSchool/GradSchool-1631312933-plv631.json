I have not had my gender marker changed. Should I say I\u2019m a female to make myself more competitive in the engineering category? I know more men apply and they don\u2019t give points for diversity, just promoting it\n\nBonus Q: should my proposal be on a less groundbreaking project I did my thesis on in undergrad or an idea for a novel concept I know less about?", "author": "where_is__my_mind", "created": 1631312933, "retrieved": 1632952721, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "comments": {"hcej62e": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plv631/gfrp_question/hcej62e/", "text": "1. Use it as a pilot study for validation and proof of concept of your future study, indicating that the manuscript is under review or in progress and leave it at that. I wouldn't bring it up in the way you mentioned because you want the panel to have all possible perceptions of you and your advising team to be positive. \n\n2. On the forms, it doesn't matter - that's for tracking, not decision-making. In the personal statement though is where is matters - make sure that if there have been struggles that you have faced in your science as a result of your identity or intersections thereof, that's where it will matter. \n\nBonus: in general, the purpose of the GRFP is to fund the scientist, not the science. There are review metrics for novelty, but if it's a project that you can't communicate well to the review panel because it's not as familiar to you, you'll lose more points for messaging than you'll gain for novelty.", "author": "Planetary_Piggy", "created": 1631337517, "upvotes": 2}}}
