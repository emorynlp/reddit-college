  "title:": "Getting an assistantship after starting grad school",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am about to start my masters this Spring but I was not awarded an assistantship. I am planning on applying to assistantships after my first semester, and would be very grateful to hear about the experience of people that might have done this. My plan is to do really well in my classes and build strong relationships with my professors. \n\nIs this at all feasible or are only new graduate students given priority?\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "You need to contact professors and if any professor can allow you to do research in their lab - that can be changed to a GRA. Also GTA is another option. The department decides the funding for masters students after taking care of the funding for PhD students. Both GRA and GTA is an interview based decision at my university",
