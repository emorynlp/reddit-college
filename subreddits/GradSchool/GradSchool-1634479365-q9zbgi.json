  "text": "Hasn\u2019t happened to me, but I\u2019m wondering what happens. I\u2019ve been getting quite proficient in bioinformatics, so my advisor has been setting me up with several different collaborators to do data analysis for them. They need someone to analyze their data, I like getting publications :)  \n\nSo what happens if I do a bunch of work for them but they don\u2019t end up publishing? Is it just \u201coh well, that was a waste of time\u201d?",

      "text": "You should have this conversation with your co-authors before you analyze their data. Always have authorship conversations as early as possible- it saves so much pain later in the process. \n\nYou can ask them if you can go ahead and publish it if it falls too low in their priority list\u2014 Ask if you can take the first author role, and lead the paper. \n\nI\u2019ve taken previous students\u2019 work that they abandoned and turned it into papers. They became 2nd or 3rd author, and I was bumped to first, and made it my own before sending it out.",

But you may also make a useful connection and have someone to collab on something that WILL get published. But of course, that runs the same risk.",

My bet's on that they didn't like it so they chucked it and decided not to go with it. My PI however...hopes for the best.\n\nIt can be disappointing, but sooner or later I hear collaborations fall apart for one reason or another.\n\n0 / 2 publications from collaborations worked on. One more and maybe it's me not them haha",
