  "text": "I am very torn on this one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe study and research society in the social sciences, so we can generally assume not everyone we encounter/read about are happy go lucky people. My professor said he's banned from teaching/referring to a book written by one of the 'big' writers in the field. The author had written about suicide, and it's deemed too sensitive to be taught at undergraduate/postgraduate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as someone with personal experience of suicide, I understand how even reading about it can be upsetting, disconcerting. I was surprised that although it isn't allowed as a key reading to be discussed in seminars, it's not even allowed to be on the further reading list, with a disclaimer about the content and a note to say (just for example) if you want to discuss this we can arrange this outside of the classroom, just not in front of other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? I feel that this is unnecessary censorship and students should be given the option to explore further texts should they wish to and if they feel comfortable. But again, is there something I'm just not getting here? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n:)",

      "text": "Skipping Durkheim's \"Suicide\" is a disservice to students and the discipline itself. It has to be covered with care no doubt, but avoiding it altogether seems just lazy to me. It is challenging for sure, as it also was for Durkheim (on a different degree and level), but thats precisely what is worthwhile reviewing of a 100+ year old book with honestly outdated theory, data, and methods. The intellectual and sociological quest of understanding even the most grim issues of social life is what makes it a must IMHO. Boo to your institution for taking the easy way out.",

      "text": "I don't believe we should be censoring works. College students are adults, and we should trust their ability to handle sensitive content, particularly if it's fundamental literature in a discipline. Particularly in social sciences and humanities, if you strip out content that may be uncomfortable, you may miss a lot of valuable conversations about understanding human behavior and systems, which is why we're here.\n\n\nI also feel, personally, that *not* talking about something for fear of it being triggering just makes it harder for folks to openly discuss difficult topics. On a professional level, I can say that, for example, historical sites are more able to change how they represent marginalized groups since we see a shift in the discourse around that and more of a demand for it. On a more personal level, like you, I have some personal experience, and chronic (passive) suicidal thoughts are part of how I experience mental illness. Reading about it can be triggering, but it can also help me understand that aspect of myself, and having it as a thing academics talk about can help it feel like it's valid as a topic to explore and learn about, and not something that needs to stay in a box and never come out.",

Maybe even a review article as an alternative so students don't have to read in-depth, but are still exposed to the material. There are certainly days I've had to look away from slides, step out of the room during discussion, and even skip class because I wasn't in a place to be present for a reading/discussion/lecture on an issue, but I'm glad it wasn't skipped altogether because of the value of encountering new perspectives and new information on sensitive topics.\n\nI'm a social scientist too. I study state violence. It wouldn't have been fair to me in undergrad to forgo readings on genocide, sexual violence, torture, etc. for the sake of my sensitivities or mental health because it's real stuff that happens. If graphic alien space porn was banned from a literature syllabus, that feels like a very different kind of censorship than a prominent academic writing on an issue that affects countless people in real life.",

      "text": "Tl;dr: sensitivity and flexibility when teaching sensitive topics is good and frankly necessary. Censorship in the hope of protecting people is still censorship and that's bad. The ideal is that sensitive or painful materials are available to all but behind a trigger warning that briefly explains the contents (and a formative education that focuses on giving students the tools and understanding they need to make good decisions for themselves, but that's asking a lot more). \n\nIt's one thing to not teach it in class (and assign it as mandatory reading, etc) - I think that's reasonable. As someone mentioned, maybe the line is that it's not taught in a required class but it could be taught in an elective. My view is that perhaps it is taught in a small, less-popular elective and not the elective that is technically not required but supremely popular and/or the elective of choice for different programs.\n\nOr perhaps it's taught but there is an alternative reading/assignment that could be offered. Students would be given the opportunity to opt out of that class period or two and meet on their own/have a discussion on the board on the class page, whatever.\n\nEither way, students should definitely get a warning so they can make an informed decision. Some people will say that the students need to toughen up and deal with it, since it's reality but I think that's incredibly harsh and honestly? Where the hell in the real world are they going to deal with that in a setting that they didn't ask for, can't leave to go take a breather, or otherwise manage their own needs? Counselor-types sign up for the possibility that they'll encounter suicidal people. If your friend or family member is struggling, you're not in a classroom full of people and you can go hyperventilate in the bathroom for a few minutes, wash your face, and come back.\n\nTo actually answer the question directly: not including it as required reading/teaching it in a mandatory or really popular class is absolutely reasonable and, imo, responsible. But to pretend it doesn't exist and doesn't contribute? Absolutely wrong. Label things adequately, ensure students (and thus people, since everyone was a student at some point) are equipped with the tools and skills to make good decisions, and let them free on the world.\n\nMy friend took a genocide studies course. I don't know that I have the stomach for that. That definitely doesn't mean that the course shouldn't exist! It should be labeled appropriately and understood that hey, maybe a particular topic is too much for any particular student, and the professor needs to be sensitive to that. If somebody needs to slip out of class early or tweak the response paper's scope, fine. \n\nMy thinking in terms of adequate labeling is: you pull a book off the shelf at the library and it has a little slip in the front with a warning and short description of contents. You use the online journal search and when you click on the title, there's a little popup box going \"this may have sensitive content - brief explanation yada yada. Do you wish to proceed?\" and you click yes and start reading, or you reassess and go \"oh, no that's not what I'm looking for\" or \"actually, maybe the chatty floor on the library with no privacy is not the place to read this and maybe have a strong reaction - let me move to the cubicles for this.\"",

              "text": "Well, I think universities should be \"safe spaces\" in the sense people are free to explore intellectual ideas. Not all ideas, however, are intellectual and belong in a university. Creationism, for example, doesn't need to be taught in a university geology class because there is no empirical evidence to support it. If it's a theology class, then that's a different story. \n\nFor other subjects, I think it's problematic to approach them through a modern lens because the people did not exist in the modern era. Students should be free to critique Shakespeare's racism (if there's evidence of it), or interpret his plays through a feminist lens if they are so inclined to do so. But I think I have more of a problem when the instructors are telling students that their way is *the* way to interpret historical works rather than just one of many. I think it's fine if an instructor has their preferred method, but I think a good one would expose students to an array of interpretive tools, even if their pet theory gets a little more emphasis. I think one danger to interpreting historical work through a modern lens can be seen in the \"spare the rod, spoil the child\" mentality popular among US evangelicals, particularly in the US South. For many, this is an endorsement of corporal punishment. However, the ancient Hebrews were a pastoral people where shepherding was a dominant part of the culture. A rod for them may have been a shepherds rod, and shepherds don't beat their sheep. \n\nI'm also skeptical of the McDonaldsization of academia that is perpetuated by administrators. The administrative class, as a whole, I think needs to be cut by a minimum of 90% across the board. If students don't want to be exposed to certain material, then their recourse should be to drop the class not have university admin ban certain materials. It kind of reminds me of Dolores Umbridge banning the practical application of magic in favor or watered down \"theory\". There's something to be said for reading the words of historical works themselves rather than those words mediated through someone else's biased interpretation.",
