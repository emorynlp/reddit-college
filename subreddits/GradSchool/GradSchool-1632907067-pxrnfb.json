I was surprised that although it isn't allowed as a key reading to be discussed in seminars, it's not even allowed to be on the further reading list, with a disclaimer about the content and a note to say (just for example) if you want to discuss this we can arrange this outside of the classroom, just not in front of other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

On a professional level, I can say that, for example, historical sites are more able to change how they represent marginalized groups since we see a shift in the discourse around that and more of a demand for it. On a more personal level, like you, I have some personal experience, and chronic (passive) suicidal thoughts are part of how I experience mental illness.

Maybe even a review article as an alternative so students don't have to read in-depth, but are still exposed to the material. There are certainly days I've had to look away from slides, step out of the room during discussion, and even skip class because I wasn't in a place to be present for a reading/discussion/lecture on an issue, but I'm glad it wasn't skipped altogether because of the value of encountering new perspectives and new information on sensitive topics.\n\nI'm a social scientist too.

Censorship in the hope of protecting people is still censorship and that's bad. The ideal is that sensitive or painful materials are available to all but behind a trigger warning that briefly explains the contents (and a formative education that focuses on giving students the tools and understanding they need to make good decisions for themselves, but that's asking a lot more). \n\nIt's one thing to not teach it in class (and assign it as mandatory reading, etc) - I think that's reasonable. As someone mentioned, maybe the line is that it's not taught in a required class but it could be taught in an elective. My view is that perhaps it is taught in a small, less-popular elective and not the elective that is technically not required but supremely popular and/or the elective of choice for different programs.\n\nOr perhaps it's taught but there is an alternative reading/assignment that could be offered. Students would be given the opportunity to opt out of that class period or two and meet on their own/have a discussion on the board on the class page, whatever.\n\nEither way, students should definitely get a warning so they can make an informed decision. Some people will say that the students need to toughen up and deal with it, since it's reality but I think that's incredibly harsh and honestly? Where the hell in the real world are they going to deal with that in a setting that they didn't ask for, can't leave to go take a breather, or otherwise manage their own needs? Counselor-types sign up for the possibility that they'll encounter suicidal people. If your friend or family member is struggling, you're not in a classroom full of people and you can go hyperventilate in the bathroom for a few minutes, wash your face, and come back.\n\nTo actually answer the question directly: not including it as required reading/teaching it in a mandatory or really popular class is absolutely reasonable and, imo, responsible. But to pretend it doesn't exist and doesn't contribute? Absolutely wrong. Label things adequately, ensure students (and thus people, since everyone was a student at some point) are equipped with the tools and skills to make good decisions, and let them free on the world.\n\nMy friend took a genocide studies course. I don't know that I have the stomach for that. That definitely doesn't mean that the course shouldn't exist! It should be labeled appropriately and understood that hey, maybe a particular topic is too much for any particular student, and the professor needs to be sensitive to that. If somebody needs to slip out of class early or tweak the response paper's scope, fine. \n\nMy thinking in terms of adequate labeling is: you pull a book off the shelf at the library and it has a little slip in the front with a warning and short description of contents. You use the online journal search and when you click on the title, there's a little popup box going \"this may have sensitive content - brief explanation yada yada. Do you wish to proceed?\" and you click yes and start reading, or you reassess and go \"oh, no that's not what I'm looking for\" or \"actually, maybe the chatty floor on the library with no privacy is not the place to read this and maybe have a strong reaction - let me move to the cubicles for this.\"", "author": "Lucky-Reporter-6460", "created": 1632926727, "upvotes": 4}, "heq61xn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pxrnfb/book_banned_from_being_taught_at_my_university/heq61xn/", "text": "Even without reading your post, censorship at this level of academia should be frowned upon.
