I couldn\u2019t handle the negativity, especially since it\u2019s been a very frustrating month of debugging and slaving over a new system I\u2019ve been setting up. \n\nI was trying to explain to him how frustrating this whole experience had been and just started crying with everyone there. It was really unexpected. I got up and left the meeting and sobbed in another room for a few minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to feel like you or your work matters in science. The accomplishments you set out to achieve take a very long time to come to fruition, and many times entire projects are abandoned due to funding issues or the whims of your advisor changing. I\u2019m completely emotionally drained, and don\u2019t know how to continue on with my work. I feel so burdened by grad school, it\u2019s just so difficult to feel inspired and motivated here.\n\nI hope you are having a better day than me.

Know that you are not alone in the feelings of fustration.\n\nMy journey in gradschool was 5 years of negativity.  I was constantly told my work wasn't good enough, and I didn't even know if my supervisor would sign my release forms until the night before my funding deadline was up, even then he wrote on the comments that he was only letting me graduate because of the deadline even though I produced 2 first author papers and a patent in my time under him.\n\nI developed stress hives in this journey that now and then resurface even to this day.  I am a strong minded person surrounded by people who love me and support me, so I can fully understand those moments of despair that a person can reach while in this pressure environment.\n\nJust remember that gradschool is not who you are, and to not make any long term decisions while in these emotional moments.  Vent, chat, take a breather.  Take a step back and know your life will go on whether grad school eventuates or not.  \n\nAlso unless your supervisor singled you out, don't take his comments personally, he's probably trying to get more output from your group but doing it in an ineffective way.  Good Researchers don't necessarily make good leaders.\n\nDrop me a PM if you want to vent.

It's not productive, and a dick move.  Science is hard enough even when everyone *is* supportive. \n\nI say this btw as someone who had to basically restart her PhD a few years in because I had a toxic supervisor who regularly made me cry in situations just like what you've described.  At the time, I was confused because no one else ever makes me cry, and I figured maybe I just couldn't cut it.  Then I realized it was actually a toxic situation where he was doing things like you've said (switching projects on a whim, blaming me for not working hard enough even when I was working my butt off), and ultimately it fell apart.  So believe you me, I've been there, and it's amazing how much more I love science now that I am no longer in that environment.\n\nIf there's anyone else you can talk to about this (either a therapist, or someone more senior in the department), I would definitely recommend doing so.  Even if you can't switch advisers, maybe you could get a co-adviser or at least someone who can help give you perspective on what's reasonable and what's not.\n\nHugs!

Sounds like your advisor is kind of a dick. It is the responsibility of the PI / supervisor / professor to set the tone and cultivate a positive environment for their students. If you feel like the environment in the lab is toxic, I would speak to someone about it - and possibly consider leaving their lab and starting a new project in someone else's. Or, at least, develop some strategies to manage the professor's behaviour and make this situation more acceptable for you. For example, set a meeting and share your feelings.
