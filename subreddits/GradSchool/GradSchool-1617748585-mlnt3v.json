I\u2019m openly non-binary/trans, and it\u2019s caused some issues within my department. \n\nFirst issue is that I teach Spanish and use \u201cElle\u201d pronouns (neutral). I teach them to my students as an option, but one that is still new and not the norm in many areas. I was told I need to use female pronouns to not confuse my students. \n\nSecond issue occurred because I have my name changed on Zoom and Canvas, but my professor dead-named me in class last week. I explained I don\u2019t use that name, and would appreciate her using the name I have everywhere. She told me I should just change my name in the canvas grade book (I can\u2019t unless I legally change my name). \n\n\nNow today was the last issue. I participated in the research of a fellow student who asked for gender at the start of the study, and put the options of \u201cmale/female/other\u201d. I clicked other. During his presentation today, he said he put me as female since that was what I really am. I was shocked. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how to approach this. I could submit a complaint with my name attracted to it, but I\u2019m worried about pissing off everyone above me and fucking up my shot of getting into a PhD program or future networking opportunities.

If things become a pattern, then bring it up with administration. \n\nGetting deadnamed once or twice by busy people who don\u2019t know you very well and are reading your name, before having your name legally changed, happens. Frankly, when you interact with tons of students it\u2019s hard to remember all of these details, and the professor may not know how your name can even be changed in the system. Maybe wait and see if it becomes a pattern of intentional malice, and not just a mistake. You don\u2019t want to go nuclear too fast and destroy what could potentially be really good relationships and professional contacts. Even people who don\u2019t seem super \u201cwoke\u201d at first might very well warm up to you. I\u2019ve seen it happen. It\u2019s hard to know at first. These issues are still new for a lot of people, which. Not trying to make excuses for them, but I felt like me just being polite and understanding went a long way. \n\nThe prof who changed your gender on the survey can go to hell tho lol. What kind of research was it? If it was social and not biological research then I don\u2019t get why he would do that. Weird. \n\nAs for teaching.... I think this is complicated. Personally I wouldn\u2019t introduce gender neutral pronouns to students to use all the time in the  classroom, but more introduce them to it once as just \u201cthis exists in the world and you might see it in some places.\u201d It can be confusing and it\u2019s definitely controversial. However, college classes are supposed to introduce you to a wide range of accents and situations. My professors who were Chilean spoke super differently than my professors who were Spanish, for example. In that sense, you may be just one \u201cflavor\u201d of Spanish your students could acquire and grow to understand. I think the problem may arise if you inflate the gender neutral pronouns to seem more common than they are, or insist that they just be used or else the students are inherently bigoted. I\u2019m not sure that a direct attack like that is the best way to go in terms of just acclimating students (or profs) and convincing people to your side. Some people also have the perspective that non-binary identity can be separated from gendered pronouns, that you can be non-binary while using gendered pronouns. Some languages (like turkish) dont have any gendered pronouns at all but that doesn\u2019t imply the speakers are all non-binary nor does it erase social gender. So I feel like there\u2019s multiple ways to approach this. \n\nIn any case, I would prioritize positive relationships however you can if you want to continue into a PhD program.

Even if you could submit things anonymously you can't, really, because everyone will know it's you. (also, it's incredibly shitty policy, but most places when there's a complaint about a prof will tell the prof the details as a matter of course).\n\nDo you have a tertiary union? It might be worth talking to them as well as the diversity/inclusion office. If the professor of the people in the department that told you to use the wrong pronouns are in the union, it might be more effective if they get correction from that avenue as well (so they know the union isn't going to have their back if it comes down to a dispute).\n\nComplaining about this absolutely has the chance of pissing people off and could definitely affect your phd applications. But here's the thing - you probably don't want to do a phd program with someone who doesn't respect your identity. It's hard enough to do a phd as is, even harder to do one as a nonbinary person.\n\nYou *can* just go in the closet and get the masters and phd done. I'm not saying it's the only way, but it's going to make some things easier (and lots of other things way harder). It doesn't get any easier as you go on, either: Post-docs are hypercompetitive and something like \"having annoying pronouns\" isn't great for the \"department fit\" portion of a lot of post-doc applications. Not to mention, even in the most supportive department it's going to fall to you to educate and advocate. Even if it's something you enjoy (like I do), it can often be an exhausting burden on top of everything else you need to do over the course of a phd.\n\nYou could also be up front at your phd interviews (I probably wouldn't bring it up during the application process, though). You don't have to lead with the transphobia you've experienced, but asking about the faculty culture and if you'll find support and camaraderie as an lgbt+ person at X campus is a totally acceptable question.\n\nI'd also suggest, if you haven't already, building your own personal network of contacts. There are facebook groups (nonbinary academics network and nonbinary linguistics network) that you might find helpful. I'm out as trans/nonbinary and just coming to the end of my linguistics phd.
