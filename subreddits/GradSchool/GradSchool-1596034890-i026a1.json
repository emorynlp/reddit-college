He's also been sued by a past grad student for emotional abuse, to give you an indication of his behavior.\n\nAs a result of his constant put-downs and claims that he's not sure she has what it takes to graduate, her self-esteem has plummeted a great deal. She is regularly down, calls herself a loser and a failure regularly despite my protests, and nothing I do or say seems to help her out of this funk. She attends therapy virtually every other week, but when I ask if she should attend more often she says that she doesn't think therapy really helps her anyway so what is the point.\n\nI'm just so sad that this is what she's been reduced to thanks to the crappy attitude of a 4-times divorced jerk who sees her as a waste, and I've regularly fantasized about giving him a piece of my mind (and fist) because I just don't know how to help her. I know her dream is to get her PhD, I see how happy the work can make her when he's not insulting her intelligence, and suggesting that she look into changing professors doesn't seem to help her either. Her parents have asked her if she just wants to quit, but the idea of quitting on her dream seems to only make her more miserable.\n\nThis may not be the best place to ask for help, but I'm desperate. Please help me help my wife.\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for all of your suggestions. I\u2019ve talked to her about some of the options for reporting him, but she still really doesn\u2019t want to, so I\u2019ll just continue doing my best to support her and offer any help I can with whatever she chooses to do. Neither of us know what an ombudsman(?) is, but I\u2019ll be looking into it and what our options are as well. I think we\u2019re not in a one party consent state unfortunately, so recording conversations is out, but we do have emails at least (though he seems to be good at not outright calling her things, just overall being a dick in her words).

The process of pursuing these paths, as well as the subsequent effort to find a new faculty member who hasn't heard false rumours, etc., about your work ethic will require a huge amount of effort. I would only go down that path if it is last resort. Ideally, a student repairs the relationship/situation with the faculty member to something workable, perhaps with informal assistance or input from a friendly third part (e.g. more senior faculty member known to the student). It sucks, but after going through and also advocating on behalf of students in similar situations, my experience is that you have to accept that the jerk-ish behaviour won't fundamentally change.\n\nEdit: And of course, this is only pointing out a \"solution\" or option for continuing with the current research.

Just as I was getting desperate, the head of the department sat down to talk to me and told me a professor who I had little contact with in the past wanted to take me on. I was stunned at the time, because my research experience by that point did not even match well with that professor's area. I had little faith in myself at the time, but I switched to the new professor and worked hard to catch up. Things turned out fine because he is just much better at advising students, and despite my lack of experience, I made progress very quickly and got my Ph.D in less than 2 years.\n\nThe reason I am sharing my experience is this: grad school generally do not want students to fail, so your wife's problem really isn't just her own problem. Someone in the department may be watching out for her and trying to figure out a solution. And she might find help in unexpected ways.

If therapy isn't working out for her, she might want to look into different therapists.

As an 'outsider' in this situation, she may not value your advice as much as that of a peer because  you just don't 'get' that this is what you have to do to get your PhD. (which is bullshit, and I'm sorry.)\n\nSome other strategies to consider: \n\n1. Asking her point-blank, \"Do you want my advice, or do you just need to vent?\" It might be that she just wants to vent to you, and isn't looking for solutions (and thus gets frustrated when you try to suggest them).\n2. Encourage her to step away from her work. Sometimes, all it takes is some distance to see just how far into the shit you've sunk. And even if it doesn't lead to revelations, it'll still make her happier to be doing things she loves with people she loves. Try to have some special time every week where it's just you two, no work allowed. Go do the things you loved doing together before this swallowed her life. \n   1. She may resist at first. People in abusive relationships tend to feel the need to 'earn' the abuser's clemency by going above and beyond on every little thing, investing an unhealthy amount of their self worth into how well they've pleased that person (\"If I stop working, that proves I really AM a lazy dumb piece of shit!!!\"). Be prepared for that.\n3. Get your own therapist. Supporting someone can be just as hard as going through a tough time yourself, because you don't have control. \n4. Try not to let this become the focus of every conversation. It might lead to her feeling overwhelmed and start avoiding conversations with you because it always turns into a 'here's all the reasons why you're handling this wrong and what you need to do better' session. \n\nGood luck, friend!! I'm going to be (hopefully) entering a master's next fall, and I'll likely be going it alone since my partner will be joining the Army and we don't know where he'll be stationed. I'm kinda scared to think about spending long nights at school and then coming home to an empty house...No goofy smile, hugs, or the random cups of tea he makes for me when he knows I need it.

Keep a record of all emails, like back them up to another email, and write down all verbal conversations. Lastly, people have said that she should have a mediator, like the grad school advisor. This could go well or it could go horrible. At my school we also have a bully PI and when people stood up to him he made their lives worse. If she gets someone involved before she graduates he could try to make sure she doesn't, not that he will be successful but he might try or he could make things worse for her. I'm not saying don't do anything but please take that into consideration. If she does talk to someone make sure she documents things first, that way it will not be her word against his.

It's crazy how much importance grad students put into impressing or making their profs happy.  It's like some kind of Stockholm syndrome were we just need their approval for own self worth.
