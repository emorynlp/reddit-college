And I felt that if I got to do what I was passionate about I wouldn't find it so hard to be motivated. I'm in my dream research lab and program, I have the most caring and supportive PI a grad student could ask for, and amazing ppl to work with and my work is truly fascinating. I was incredibly lucky to get here. I've failed courses in my UG and my GPA was below the minimum but grad school gave me a chance. I am happy and grateful. And yet I constantly struggle to find the motivation to feel like doing work and I keep putting off things. I don't understand it, I really love what I do. I'm good at writing and presenting and reading papers is literally my favourite thing about research. I have accomplished some things, I have random spurts of productivity and I would stay up all night when those times hit. This year was really sucky my mental health was probably at its lowest with family issues and catching covid. But i keep screwing myself over and I dont know how to overcome this disconnect.\n\nWhenever I'm thinking about how much work I should be doing I kind of just enter a freeze, I could stare at my phone for hours while I have a mental battle with my mind to open my computer. This makes me incredibly depressed and I cry hating myself. I get mad at myself because I've missed important deadlines this year. I should've had no problem with transferring to the PhD program (almost at the end of my Msc timeline) but because so much was overdue the department is saying no. i've put my PI in a tough spot because they still believe in me and support me continuing work in their lab. I feel like my academic future is hanging in the balance and it's my fault. And if I can't overcome this then do I even deserve to be here? Does anyone else experience this? How do you overcome those lowest and worst times? I'm still trying and I just really want to overcome it because it just doesn't make sense.", "author": "munch_cellbio", "created": 1607811066, "retrieved": 1632954422, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 293, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gfpgd4e": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kby5ul/anyone_feel_a_disconnect_between_with_the_passion/gfpgd4e/", "text": "Ahh I know that feeling of completely paralyzed by just thinking about how much work I need to do/should be doing... but a small mental trick that has worked for me is to tell myself \u201cIf something is worth doing, it\u2019s worth doing badly.\u201d (Not the traditional \u201cit\u2019s worth doing well\u201d) That\u2019ll get me bypass my perfectionist mentality, out of the \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d, and actually start doing the work :)", "author": "jinandtonic19", "created": 1607874654, "upvotes": 1}, "gfo5hie": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kby5ul/anyone_feel_a_disconnect_between_with_the_passion/gfo5hie/", "text": "Passion and motivation are completely separate things.

If someone likes to make bracelets in their free time and finds it enjoyable, if they start being paid to make bracelets they hate it and are miserable. What was an organic component of the 'actual self' migrated and became a duty and responsibility of the 'ought to' self that is only able to cognate the presence or absence of NEGATIVE outcomes. Happiness and fulfillment dies in the context of evaluating for negative outcomes!\n\n\"Whenever I think about how much work I should be doing I kind of just enter a freeze\"\n\nIn self-discrepancy theory, it is thought that we feel distress and discomfort when we compare our actual/real selves to an \"I ought to be \\_\\_\\_\\_\" self and perceive a gap. It becomes an endless emotional-thought loop that we use for trying to coerce our brains into grudging cooperation. But when we reach a certain level of discomfort, it doesn't work and makes us more stressed out and feel worse!\n\nI think that it might help to radically change your frame of reference, and put things into a dominant perspective from your actual, realistic self instead of directing behaviour from the 'ought to' perspective, which is honestly the toxic authoritarian critic inside all of us. I think it would help your situation to spend some time to acknowledge that your actual self is struggling, in pain, probably terrified of failure, maybe afraid of disappointing someone specific, and overall needs a break from an evaluative context that has been going on too long.\n\nHere is one exercise that can refresh your relationships to your obligations by taking inventory of the emotional gravity of the situation. This exercise is not going to feel intuitive though because it's probably the complete opposite from what you've been thinking repetitively for a long time. I highly recommend WRITING DOWN these sentences somewhere, because these ideas interact with your brain on a totally different attentional level than if you were to just read it. It doesn't work at all for me if I just read it. Writing it down has a totally different outcome.\n\nSince genuine motivation comes from psychological security, the exercise is for establishing 'okay-ness' about EVERY 'terrible' possible outcome. The new thought process would be something along the lines of: it's okay if I fail. I am not doing to die. The world isn't going to end if I don't get this credential or accomplish this. It is completely understandable for someone to struggle in this situation under this workload. Everything will go on, and there are future chances for me beyond this one. There will be people who want to help me succeed. I am still valuable even without a credential. A credential doesn't represent who I really am. My self-esteem is not based on only achievement. If I throw all my work out the window and I fail, I will still exist and have value. If I fail, then I will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. The worst that can happen is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. If that happens, then I will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nInstead of the anxiety provoking '... but what if?!' thought, it totally changes the dynamic to rephrase it like: \"If \\_\\_\\_ happens, I will \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" I read about that in some other subreddit a long time ago but it stuck with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions because it would help me procrastinate on these oppressive term papers haha", "author": "Niorba", "created": 1607850522, "upvotes": 4}, "gfnz3h6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kby5ul/anyone_feel_a_disconnect_between_with_the_passion/gfnz3h6/", "text": "Seconding the other poster who suggested an ADHD assessment.\n\nThere is a lot more to ADHD than the stereotypical \"hyper kid\" version - often if a kid is smart enough to be able to compensate for symptoms (eg. do something in a rush at the last minute and still get a good grade) and on the quiet side, the diagnosis is missed.\n\nThen we grow up and move out into the world where we have to do our own laundry, remember to pay our bills, etc. and our symptoms become more noticeable. And we sometimes pursue stimulating/challenging work (like grad school) that eventually takes us to a level where being smart is no longer enough to compensate for and hide our issues.\n\nThe motivation part is huge. It's not that ADHDers lack motivation, it's that there's a disconnect where our brains sometimes can't turn that into action. You could have an extremely powerful construction machine like a crane, but if there's a bad connection for the control buttons then no matter how many times you press the buttons that machine is not going to get much work done.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD halfway through my PhD, and I don't think I would have made it to the end and graduated had I not been diagnosed. I also now have a lot less self-hatred and shame over things like my room being messy.\n\nIt takes a professional to decide whether to diagnose you, because other things like depression can sometimes mimic some of the symptoms of ADHD (and sometimes life with ADHD can be a major contributing factor in depression!) But if you feel that there is even a chance that you might have ADHD then I highly recommend getting that assessment!\n\n/r/adhd can also be a great resource and a wonderful and supportive community!", "author": "tentkeys", "created": 1607847691, "upvotes": 7}, "gfnszxh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kby5ul/anyone_feel_a_disconnect_between_with_the_passion/gfnszxh/", "text": "I can tell you that I am not at all passionate about academia or being a scholar/writer/whatever.

Some people get anxious and instantly want to tackle the problem. And some people get anxious and avoid the problem all together. Basically flight or fight. \n\nI am like you, when I am anxious about something, I tend to want to avoid it. So if I have a lot of work or a test that makes me nervous, I end up not doing it and procrastinating until the very last moment. Recognizing that my response to work was just my anxious response literally changed the game for me. Now I know this and I learned how to deal with this, I finish my papers and tests hours and days before the deadline instead of minutes before. \n\nSome practical tips I have for that are to do lists for each day. Do not just write down all your deadlines and try to tackle them all. For every day, prioritize the tasks that need to happen and write them down for that day. Then the next day, make a different list. Also, I break down my work sessions into 50 minutes of work and a 10 minute break and repeat. Most importantly, just start SOMETHING. Even if it\u2019s a small task, accomplishing something helps keep me feeling less anxious and pushes me to keep going. \n\nTo address your questions, yes you deserve to be in graduate school. Remember, you were chosen to be in your program. The people you look up to and respect chose YOU. I cling to that in times I doubt myself. Yes, we all experience this. You overcome these times by reaching out to others like you are doing and remembering that you are passionate about graduate school. Above all, being a graduate student is a learning curve and takes skill like any other job. You have to learn time management and discipline.
