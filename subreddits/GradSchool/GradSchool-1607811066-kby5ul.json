  "title:": "Anyone feel a disconnect between with the passion for their research and motivation?",
  "text": "I've always struggled with procrastination in my undergrad. And I felt that if I got to do what I was passionate about I wouldn't find it so hard to be motivated. I'm in my dream research lab and program, I have the most caring and supportive PI a grad student could ask for, and amazing ppl to work with and my work is truly fascinating. I was incredibly lucky to get here. I've failed courses in my UG and my GPA was below the minimum but grad school gave me a chance. I am happy and grateful. And yet I constantly struggle to find the motivation to feel like doing work and I keep putting off things. I don't understand it, I really love what I do. I'm good at writing and presenting and reading papers is literally my favourite thing about research. I have accomplished some things, I have random spurts of productivity and I would stay up all night when those times hit. This year was really sucky my mental health was probably at its lowest with family issues and catching covid. But i keep screwing myself over and I dont know how to overcome this disconnect.\n\nWhenever I'm thinking about how much work I should be doing I kind of just enter a freeze, I could stare at my phone for hours while I have a mental battle with my mind to open my computer. This makes me incredibly depressed and I cry hating myself. I get mad at myself because I've missed important deadlines this year. I should've had no problem with transferring to the PhD program (almost at the end of my Msc timeline) but because so much was overdue the department is saying no. i've put my PI in a tough spot because they still believe in me and support me continuing work in their lab. I feel like my academic future is hanging in the balance and it's my fault. And if I can't overcome this then do I even deserve to be here? Does anyone else experience this? How do you overcome those lowest and worst times? I'm still trying and I just really want to overcome it because it just doesn't make sense.",

      "text": "One of my immediate thoughts when reading was what happens when intrinsic motivation is subsumed by extrinsic motivators/incentives/pressures. If someone likes to make bracelets in their free time and finds it enjoyable, if they start being paid to make bracelets they hate it and are miserable. What was an organic component of the 'actual self' migrated and became a duty and responsibility of the 'ought to' self that is only able to cognate the presence or absence of NEGATIVE outcomes. Happiness and fulfillment dies in the context of evaluating for negative outcomes!\n\n\"Whenever I think about how much work I should be doing I kind of just enter a freeze\"\n\nIn self-discrepancy theory, it is thought that we feel distress and discomfort when we compare our actual/real selves to an \"I ought to be \\_\\_\\_\\_\" self and perceive a gap. It becomes an endless emotional-thought loop that we use for trying to coerce our brains into grudging cooperation. But when we reach a certain level of discomfort, it doesn't work and makes us more stressed out and feel worse!\n\nI think that it might help to radically change your frame of reference, and put things into a dominant perspective from your actual, realistic self instead of directing behaviour from the 'ought to' perspective, which is honestly the toxic authoritarian critic inside all of us. I think it would help your situation to spend some time to acknowledge that your actual self is struggling, in pain, probably terrified of failure, maybe afraid of disappointing someone specific, and overall needs a break from an evaluative context that has been going on too long.\n\nHere is one exercise that can refresh your relationships to your obligations by taking inventory of the emotional gravity of the situation. This exercise is not going to feel intuitive though because it's probably the complete opposite from what you've been thinking repetitively for a long time. I highly recommend WRITING DOWN these sentences somewhere, because these ideas interact with your brain on a totally different attentional level than if you were to just read it. It doesn't work at all for me if I just read it. Writing it down has a totally different outcome.\n\nSince genuine motivation comes from psychological security, the exercise is for establishing 'okay-ness' about EVERY 'terrible' possible outcome. The new thought process would be something along the lines of: it's okay if I fail. I am not doing to die. The world isn't going to end if I don't get this credential or accomplish this. It is completely understandable for someone to struggle in this situation under this workload. Everything will go on, and there are future chances for me beyond this one. There will be people who want to help me succeed. I am still valuable even without a credential. A credential doesn't represent who I really am. My self-esteem is not based on only achievement. If I throw all my work out the window and I fail, I will still exist and have value. If I fail, then I will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. The worst that can happen is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. If that happens, then I will \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nInstead of the anxiety provoking '... but what if?!' thought, it totally changes the dynamic to rephrase it like: \"If \\_\\_\\_ happens, I will \\_\\_\\_\\_.\" I read about that in some other subreddit a long time ago but it stuck with me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to answer any questions because it would help me procrastinate on these oppressive term papers haha",

      "text": "Seconding the other poster who suggested an ADHD assessment.\n\nThere is a lot more to ADHD than the stereotypical \"hyper kid\" version - often if a kid is smart enough to be able to compensate for symptoms (eg. do something in a rush at the last minute and still get a good grade) and on the quiet side, the diagnosis is missed.\n\nThen we grow up and move out into the world where we have to do our own laundry, remember to pay our bills, etc. and our symptoms become more noticeable. And we sometimes pursue stimulating/challenging work (like grad school) that eventually takes us to a level where being smart is no longer enough to compensate for and hide our issues.\n\nThe motivation part is huge. It's not that ADHDers lack motivation, it's that there's a disconnect where our brains sometimes can't turn that into action. You could have an extremely powerful construction machine like a crane, but if there's a bad connection for the control buttons then no matter how many times you press the buttons that machine is not going to get much work done.\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD halfway through my PhD, and I don't think I would have made it to the end and graduated had I not been diagnosed. I also now have a lot less self-hatred and shame over things like my room being messy.\n\nIt takes a professional to decide whether to diagnose you, because other things like depression can sometimes mimic some of the symptoms of ADHD (and sometimes life with ADHD can be a major contributing factor in depression!) But if you feel that there is even a chance that you might have ADHD then I highly recommend getting that assessment!\n\n/r/adhd can also be a great resource and a wonderful and supportive community!",

I got into this to teach, and I'm being trained to do that, while putting up with the world of academia.\n\nSo, for me, I just think of it practically. \"These are the hoops I have to jump through to get to the thing I want.\" I think that helps me be a bit more grounded in how I approach school. I do sometimes get interested in the things I write about, but if I felt that my interest was beholden, primarily, to my interest in research itself, that I would have quit school a long time ago.",

I find that taking a holiday, a week or two if I can, to go catch up with friends and watch movies and play video games and go hiking and go for road trips. Then I find when I grt back it does wonders to my productivity, I come back more motivated and clear-headed with more of a big picture of perspective.\n\nSometimes you just need a break to enjoy yourself!

      "text": "One time a graduate student in my lab was talking about the different ways people tackle anxiety. Some people get anxious and instantly want to tackle the problem. And some people get anxious and avoid the problem all together. Basically flight or fight. \n\nI am like you, when I am anxious about something, I tend to want to avoid it. So if I have a lot of work or a test that makes me nervous, I end up not doing it and procrastinating until the very last moment. Recognizing that my response to work was just my anxious response literally changed the game for me. Now I know this and I learned how to deal with this, I finish my papers and tests hours and days before the deadline instead of minutes before. \n\nSome practical tips I have for that are to do lists for each day. Do not just write down all your deadlines and try to tackle them all. For every day, prioritize the tasks that need to happen and write them down for that day. Then the next day, make a different list. Also, I break down my work sessions into 50 minutes of work and a 10 minute break and repeat. Most importantly, just start SOMETHING. Even if it\u2019s a small task, accomplishing something helps keep me feeling less anxious and pushes me to keep going. \n\nTo address your questions, yes you deserve to be in graduate school. Remember, you were chosen to be in your program. The people you look up to and respect chose YOU. I cling to that in times I doubt myself. Yes, we all experience this. You overcome these times by reaching out to others like you are doing and remembering that you are passionate about graduate school. Above all, being a graduate student is a learning curve and takes skill like any other job. You have to learn time management and discipline. I believe in you!! \n\nI also highly recommend therapy.",

      "text": "Procrastination doesn't arise from disliking a task or even from not wanting to do a task. It arises from perfectionism and fear of failure.\n\nI find it easiest to get things done if I set myself small, reasonable deadlines instead of big, looming ones. Instead of thinking about how much work you have ahead, think of the *next* work you have to do.\n\nFor example: I have a lot to do next week, I've been behind all term thanks to teaching. But I've written down a few small specific things I have to do next week. I have to submit final grades (a few minutes), update my CV, update my GitHub, apply to a summer internship, submit recommendation requests, perform a probability computation for one research project, think deeply about a specific mathematical example, and make a plan for break for the edits I'm going to make for a paper that got rejected. I am going to tackle one to two of those tasks per day next week, no more. Then I can reward myself with something relaxing when they're done, and I can know that the next day I'll do something else. \n\nEven big tasks can be broken down into small digestible chunks, and for me at least that's the only way to get through them.",

But I don't know ways on my own to not do these things. No matter how badly I want to change these patterns in my life, no matter how many times I resolve to do things differently, I can't keep it up, it's feels impossible. \n\nIt's not a choice I'm making, and the shame I've felt over the not being able to change it has been worse than my failures themselves. Lazy people are happy when they're unproductive, it feels rewarding to them. I'm paralyzed with despair and shame when I'm not doing work I need to or I just stare at the TV all day instead of embroidering or literally anything I know I enjoy doing.\n\nI recommend the book \"You Mean I'm Not Lazy, Stupid or Crazy?!: The Classic Self-Help Book for Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder\" by Kate Kelly, Peggy Ramundo, Edward M. M.D. Hallowell.\n\nExecutive dysfunction is also a symptom of anxiety and depression, for the record.

I'm not sure of the exact tests, as I assume there are multiple - the second one gave me a different test after realizing that the initial one she wanted to give me was the same as the first one.  There was also an IQ test as well with the second ADHD test.\n\nWhile I don't have ADHD, she pointed out that I do have deficits when it came to listening/aural comprehension - basically, things go in one ear and out the other, unless I apply some other sensory to it (for me, writing - a very tactile/\"doing it\" sense).  She also pointed out that that is why I have a difficult time retaining information that I read - I can read it and understand it, I just don't retain it unless I make some immediate connection.\n\nSince my undergrad, I've had a miserable time retaining information that I read in lecture and in my readings.  Put me in a lab, show me how to do something and then let me do it, and I'm good to go.  Put me in a lab and tell me how to do something, I'll forget within five minutes, even if I write it down (and then still have questions about what I wrote down).  \n\nI can't say much has changed...I'm still shit at listening, and I can barely make it through a single paper in a day.

I honestly didn't think this disconnect should exist but it really helps a lot to know that it does happen and that I'm not alone. I do have some mental health issues that I've been dealing with for years (antidepressants and counseling). It didn't occur to me until now that I've ignored treating my anxiety. I really do appreciate how open and supportive this subreddit is. You guys have no idea how much a dose of positivity and encouragement like this is helping me right now <3",

It\u2019s hard to get out of the cycle of self-downing, but recognizing that negative behaviors like procrastination come from a need to self-soothe anxiety rather than some fundamental defect is an important step.\n\nI\u2019d also second the suggestions to break big complex tasks into pieces, either in terms of sub tasks or time intervals, as well as a little mindfulness. When compared to how much time one can spend on the internet, 10 min meditation seems doable. Another trick is to just one thing productive: clean one flask, read one paper, write one paragraph, etc., then it can be easier to do one more, another, another.",

You may want to consider seeing a therapist or counselor and talking it out if you\u2019re not already. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do think that this is a very common problem that other graduate students have. But if this is happening to you often or causing you a lot of distress, you should definitely see someone about it.\n\nWhen I experience these kinds of things (which I currently am, procrastinating writing my dissertation proposal in which I am both very interested in passionate about) I try to break the task up into its smallest component parts and then set myself up with small, manageable goals that I give myself deadlines for. It can also be helpful to have someone else who knows what those deadlines are and can help keep you accountable. I find that this makes my tasks feel less overwhelming and more manageable, so I\u2019m less afraid of even opening up my computer and starting the task.",

See it as you are putting in a hard day's work so you can keep your job, which you gotta do to meet your own needs. It sucks but that's how jobs are sometimes, you just gotta do it.  \n\n\nWith regard to the times when you freeze and literally can't make yourself start working, it seems like you have anxiety. You might consider mindfulness meditation to gain better self-control and discipline. It will help you be kind but firm with yourself.",

      "text": "While passion definitely can have an impact on motivation, there are so many other factors that also affect motivation. 3 months ago I was super motivated, and now I\u2019m struggling with motivation as well. Partly because I started too many things at the same time while I was motivated, and I overworked myself for 2 months and I just got exhausted. Some of the stuff hasn\u2019t worked out yet, and even though I\u2019ve worked hard I haven\u2019t reached the milestones I set for myself. \n\nAlthough, I have learned a lot during the last few months, and as a result of that I would say my passion for my field of research has actually grown. With all I learned, I\u2019m even more excited about it now. \n\nBut right now my motivation mostly stems from deadlines. The thing about motivation, it\u2019s never gonna be in a fixed state. It will fluctuate up and down all the time, and sometimes it\u2019s a lot harder to deal with than other times. I think one of the bests things you can do, is think about what you can do that\u2019s best for you and your goals. If you can, just do something small and easy in the morning that builds towards that goal, even if it\u2019s just by a little bit. I also find going for a jog every now and then can help. Everyone is different though.",

          "text": "I really agree with the bolded statement here. It seems like a lot of people are talking about self-discipline but obviously OP isn't having fun instead of doing work, so I think its a little more complicated than that.\n\nI also struggled with procrastination during my undergrad. It was bad enough that I gave up on grad school and found a job instead, intending to go back to grad school when I was more mature. Now, 6 years later, I'm in my first year of grad school and feel a lot of the same struggles with procrastination that I did before (unfortunately getting older was no magic cure for procrastination). What I have realized over the past few months is that thinking its a lack of self-discipline makes it harder for me to get started because the real root cause is that I'm not forgiving myself for not meeting my own standards.\n\nThe way I've been able to overcome this recently is to plan out an hour by hour schedule of what I need to get done. This sounds more serious than it actually is though. The most important thing for this to work is making sure I give myself more than enough time for each task, and also plan in an achievable end point each day. That way, you can make logical decisions about what is and isn't feasible for you to complete in a day instead of trying to do everything and feeling overwhelmed (and then doing nothing). I've tried this before and failed when I tried to put too much into a day, you almost have to double all your time estimates to make it work. Then if you finish something early you can take a break without any guilt.\n\nI should also mention that this is a great way to get caught up on whatever is overdue. Making a plan that allows everything to get done shows that you will have the time to do it, and if you have to share it with your PI/department, it can make life easier for your PI since they can see that you're making progress and have natural check in points.\n\nTL;DR its not a lack of self-discipline, you're beating yourself up too much",
