  "text": "I recently finished my Master's in Data Science and am missing the academic environment. For some reason, I enjoyed the stress and overall craziness grad school provided and am thinking about going back for another degree even though I'm happy in my field.\n\nMy employer will pay for about 95% of the tuition cost so the main loss would be my insanity... \n\nI can't determine if I'm losing my mind or if this is normal for people who are wired to always try to learn something new.",

Going to back to school just for the sake of doing so might not be the answer however (and believe me, I\u2019ve also considered it). Maybe see what certifications you can get in your field instead. I\u2019m really not familiar with data science, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty you could pursue that would occupy your time and give you some new skills to learn/sharpen.",
