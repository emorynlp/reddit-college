I applied to one program where I didn't meet the requirement. I emailed the program head and CC'ed the profs I wanted to work with after I applied, saying that I thought I was a great fit for their program and hope that they will look over my application even though I don't meet the requirement.

Still got into the PhD program I wanted and have done fine ever since. Grades are important, IMO, in helping to establish whether youre a serious, engaged student or not. But I think a lot of applicants are going to be applying who fucked around as an undergrad. Its super common. Your MA GPA would, I think, weigh more heavily because of it, and because obviously its actually graduate work. \n\nWhere I think you may struggle is in highly competitive application processes, where a program may have a large number of prospects for a small number of spots. Inevitably those processes seem to come down to very small differences between qualifications. \n\nMy advice then would be to A) Apply widely. It costs money and that sucks, but if you feel strongly about the PhD you should cast a wide net. You never know what will come back. B) I would figure out generally what you want to do, find the profs who do that thing, and then contact them. Come to them with questions, ideas, a clear research interest, and see if theyre taking students. I did this exact thing with my advisor and I think it really helped my application process. The #1 deciding factor in applications is what the potential advisor thinks about an applicant. If you want to get in, make sure that your potential advisor will say \"yeah, I want Mooddestroyer here.\"",

If you don't, you better have produced a decent amount/high-quality publications since undergrad.\n\nEDIT: Because it seems there's a disconnect between maintaining a grad school GPA and the intentions of the grad school. Yes, you need to maintain a GPA to stay in a program; however, grad schools are structured so that classes are nearly impossible to fail and/or fall below that GPA. When you apply to jobs with a PhD, no one gives a flying fuck about your PhD GPA, its what you've learned and how you applied yourself. \n\nLike they say, you know what they call a doctor that graduated at the bottom of their class?

Ive only known one student who admitted to getting a C, and Ive known plenty who have stayed above 3.5 but still have washed out of the program. IDK If I would say its political, in the sense that the advisor's students get higher grades, but it is more of a game than as an undergrad.  Profs give grades to send a message, not as some reflection of the quality of work. And then they only send messages through grades if youre not plugged in enough to have had that conversation with them in person already.",

Every program I've ever looked at for math has something like \"must maintain a 2.x average\" as one of the graduation requirements. The grades are assigned pretty arbitrarily by the whims of each instructor. It basically means that giving someone a C means \"I believe that you shouldn't be in this program\". But that GPA does have real consequences and if you stay below the threshold for too many semesters in a row they will just up and kick you out. (In practice this really only matters during the first couple of years while you're taking core classes--after that everything is just an A or an F.)",

For me to stay above 3.0, I had to commit most every single waking moment dedicated to learning and understanding the material in each class. I had to read over 400 books and articles (all of which are saved in Pdfs to my Mendeley citation software), I wrote hundreds of pages of midterm papers and final papers, and had to constantly be engaging with the classroom discussions I was present in. It was a nightmare to maintain a 3.0 GPA as well a trying to conduct my research at the same time, which arguably suffered because I was under so much stress from my classroom work.
