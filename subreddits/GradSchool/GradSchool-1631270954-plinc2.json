But I think a lot of applicants are going to be applying who fucked around as an undergrad. Its super common. Your MA GPA would, I think, weigh more heavily because of it, and because obviously its actually graduate work. \n\nWhere I think you may struggle is in highly competitive application processes, where a program may have a large number of prospects for a small number of spots. Inevitably those processes seem to come down to very small differences between qualifications. \n\nMy advice then would be to A) Apply widely. It costs money and that sucks, but if you feel strongly about the PhD you should cast a wide net. You never know what will come back. B) I would figure out generally what you want to do, find the profs who do that thing, and then contact them. Come to them with questions, ideas, a clear research interest, and see if theyre taking students. I did this exact thing with my advisor and I think it really helped my application process.

Yes, you need to maintain a GPA to stay in a program; however, grad schools are structured so that classes are nearly impossible to fail and/or fall below that GPA.
