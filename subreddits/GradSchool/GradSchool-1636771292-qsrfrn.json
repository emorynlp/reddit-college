  "text": "Hello All,\n\nI am reaching out because I am reapplying. I wanted to ask - did anyone who reapplied saw their old letter of recommendation on their profile still? And is it okay to use it again? Or is it better to get one that\u2019s updated from the same recommenders? \n\nThanks in advance!",
