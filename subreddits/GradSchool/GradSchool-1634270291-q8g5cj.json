  "text": "I\u2019m in a masters program that has one Econ and one stats requirement. I\u2019m terrible at both but the rest of the program is my strength and interest. I figured I\u2019d be able to get by. \n\nHalfway through the semester and I did really bad on the midterm for stats and I\u2019m concerned I might fail the course if I can\u2019t somehow get a super high grade on final. \n\nIf you fail a class, do they usually require you to resit the same class or can you take the fail and leave it on your transcript? \n\nAny advice or similar situations helpful because I\u2019m quite stressed about it right now.\n\nThanks",
