We ended up moving it online instead. To anyone else in this situation, I'd highly recommend exploring that option. We used Zoom, which was easy to set up since all the faculty are using it for teaching anyway.\n\nA couple of tips for anyone else that will be defending online:\n\n1. Use a webcam. Doesn't need to be a good webcam, but use one. Hand gestures and facial expressions make it much easier to emphasize things, and also because even the best slides get boring when you have them up for a while :)\n2. Test everything FIRST. I did a zoom test run yesterday to check my webcam/mic/screen sharing settings. Today, we did a mic check before proceeding (both me and the committee)---and it is good that we did, because one of my committee members did not have their mic set up right and couldn't talk.\n\nNow to turn off my brain and play DOOM for the next 8 hours (:", "author": "emallson", "created": 1584721493, "retrieved": 1632845213, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 757, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fl3om1m": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/flxugw/i_passed_my_defense/fl3om1m/", "text": "Congrats!
