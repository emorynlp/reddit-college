I always recommend the 3-2-1 backup strategy as a **minimum** baseline.  This means you should have 3 backups across at least 2 storage mediums, of which at least 1 is off-site (e.g. cloud storage), with regular, automatic backups.  Use something which supports versioning (most cloud services do) to prevent ransomware or file corruption irrevocably being copied over the backups.  \n\nI embed into our PhD students the idea that any data to which you do not apply the 3-2-1 backup strategy does not really exist - because you're effectively willing to lose it in an instant.  I have, on more than one occasion, seen years of work lost to naivety/lack of care, ultimately costing that person their degree - it's heartbreaking.  Take more backups if you can - most universities have roaming profiles which are occasionally backed up to cold storage; find out what your university does and make use of it.\n\nAs a matter of course, whenever a student brings me work, I'll always take and retain a copy of it, which I feed into my own backup strategy.  It becomes part of our regular supervision, so while I tell them I'm going to do it in the first instance, they often don't notice or remember subsequently.  On several occasions (especially back before cloud services were really a big deal), I've managed to save a students' work, and probably their degree, in this way.  Reminding someone who thinks they're about to lose their degree that I have a copy of their work and seeing the relief spread across their face is pleasant.", "author": "Timmeh7", "created": 1531823247, "upvotes": 7}, "e2j5meo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/8zgwgs/a_friendly_reminder_to_back_up_all_your_data_now/e2j5meo/", "text": "Bought a TB of storage for Google Drive.
