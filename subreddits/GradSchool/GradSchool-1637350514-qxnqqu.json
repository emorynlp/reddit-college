      "text": "My professors told me to do that, so I wrote my own and got into my 1st choice grad school program! Many professors are super busy with their own stuff, so to save them time, they'll have you write your own LoR and they'll look over it and if they see something that needs changing, they'll change it.\nOn mine, I just wrote two things that I excelled at and one thing that I needed improvement on. This helps with balance, and doesn't make it look like your bragging about yourself and you don't need improvement. Lol\n\nBut don't be turned off by writing your own letters. I was the same way at first too, but then I saw it as a way to truly evaluate myself!",
