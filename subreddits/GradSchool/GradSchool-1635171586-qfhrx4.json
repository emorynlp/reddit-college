  "text": "Hi all. I am going to meet (virtually) with a senior researcher and talk about the possibility of me visiting their lab for some months. Do you have any advice on things I should defnitely ask/prepare or maybe also avoid doing? So far, I have read through the literature of the researchers in the lab, thought of how a collaboration could look like (project ideas) and prepared all the administrative things (funding). The lab of the researcher is not in the US, so country-nonspecific advice is welcome. Any advice appreciated!",
