  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m currently a senior in undergrad majoring in communication with a specialization in public relations!i have no idea if I want to get a masters in PR/communication since Im going to receive a bachelor\u2019s in it. For those who got a bachelors degree in PR/Communication, did you get your masters in public relations or something else? Is it worth getting a masters in communication or public relations when you already received a bachelors in it? What\u2019s some advice you can give about picking a school for a masters degree (preferably US based, but any in Europe would be cool to hear about too!)? Also if I\u2019m more into the social media and event promoting/planning, would a masters in PR/communication be a better choice or something else like marketing, advertising, or business administration?  Thanks in advance! \nSincerely, someone who has no idea what they\u2019re doing anymore lol",

      "text": "It sounds like you're not exactly sure what you want to do yet.\n\nIf you get a job in your field for a year or two, you'll have a much better idea of what direction you want to go for a master's, should you even choose to do one. Working in the field helps a lot with planning your long-term career goals in a way that going to school doesn't.\n\nPlus, a year or two of work experience can be a plus for getting more out of the masters. As you'll be able to tie what you're learning to actually experience you've had.",
