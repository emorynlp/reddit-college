  "text": "I did well in both classes until the final exams (multiple choice finals are bullshit). Now I have two dang A- on my transcript bumping me down to a 3.9 gpa. \n\nI know this would seem petty to worry about in undergrad, but it is my understanding that the grades in grad school are seen in a totally different perspective (i.e. a B is basically failing). Ugh should I he worried?\n\nOne class I am taking this semester is with the same wacko who taught one of the class I got in A- in...so I'm worried cuz the man is so disorganized and makes zero sense with the material (total jerk when you ask for help too). Point is, I am worried I am going to get another A- or hell, even a B in the class.",

      "text": "\"B's get degrees. Stop worrying about getting all A's and just finishing grad school on time.\" - My friends already with their master's degree and high paying jobs. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThey told me employers usually don't look at grades, just the degree and portfolio.\n\nBut I understand that getting A's is more of a personal achievement. I was the same way when I started, but mid-semester and I currently have a B in one class and I don't care anymore. Now I agree with my friends and I just want to get done!\n\nBut to answer your question, no you shouldn't worry.",

      "text": "I'd argue the opposite. Undergrad grades mean a lot more than grad grades. When I apply for a job (3rd PhD student), I'm not putting my gpa (3.97) because no one cares. They're gonna look at what skills I learned / what papers I published. For undergrad your grade is more important because you have minimal real world / research experience, so your gpa help gauges how well you can do a certain job. But it's really just a crapshoot, your first job out of school, you're gonna be learning everything on the job (at least coming form undergrad)",
