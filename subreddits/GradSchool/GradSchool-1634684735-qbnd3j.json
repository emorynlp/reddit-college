  "title:": "Removing a committee member",
  "text": "Has anyone replaced a committee member late in the game (post comps, pre-drafts)? I have one committee member whose \"questions\" are always deliberately humiliating, and in our last meeting, he crossed a line, demonstrating willful ignorance and contempt of my proposed plan for finishing. Two other members reached out to me after that meeting, to say, basically, \"I hope you're ok, that's just what \\[he\\] is like, he does that with everyone.\" I know this, because I've heard stories and I've known him for 15 years, but this last interaction felt like the last straw. \n\nI don't have any plans to work with this person or in his field (or academia) in the future. He is not heavily invested in my project, and part of me thinks he might be relieved to not be on my committee anymore. Just wondering if anyone else has experience with removing members whose behavior is unprofessional/borderline abusive. I know it's very normalized in academia, but I've had enough. Anyone else?",

      "text": "The way I see it you're creating two problems for your chair: getting rid of the jerk and finding a replacement. You could solve the second one for them by approaching another faculty member and asking if they'll sit on the committee provided the jerk leaves. Then you can tell your chair \"his behavior is unprofessional and I'm concerned he might impede my progress without cause or justification.\" Now there's only one awkward conversation to be had.",

      "text": "I removed a committee member right before prelims because of different issues but that I found out later was kind of an elitist jerk. I still have a committee member that I should have also removed. We\u2019ll see how awful my defense goes with him, but I wish I had swapped him out to lessen my anxiety. Just remove your problem member while you can and don\u2019t look back! Especially if the rest of the committee agrees. Not sure about your uni, but at mine you don\u2019t even have to give a reason when you submit the paperwork.",

      "text": "I have not, but my adviser floated the idea of removing a committee member because they were not responding to my adviser's emails. Fortunately I have a good relationship with this person so I was able to email them and basically say \"hey, please respond to my adviser ASAP\" and everything turned out fine. My adviser even floated a couple replacement ideas, but luckily they were unnecessary. \n\nI would talk to your adviser about this first. I think ultimately it is your decision because it's your committee, but as another person suggested, it would be helpful to have someone in mind to replace them first and see what your adviser thinks. \"He does it with everyone\" is not an excuse for unprofessional behavior and the fact that these people bothered to say that to begin with suggest, to me, some cultural problems in the department. \n\nIf/when you do decide to remove this person, I would keep it relatively short and somewhat vague. Maybe say that your dissertation is taking a different direction than originally intended so his service on your committee will no longer be necessary.",

Things like, \u2018I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re asking this question, I thought you were capable of understanding simple concepts\u2019 or \u2018my plan is definitely fine, do you need medical attention for the stroke you must be having?\u2019 etc. Honestly I think this is pretty common, and it\u2019s a great opportunity to hone your sassy skills knowing your committee has your back. Good luck!",
