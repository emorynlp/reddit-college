      "text": "What are you taking notes for? So you can contribute ideas and questions to class discussion? So you have notes for writing papers? Notes to study for tests? To increase memory retention?\n\nDepending on what your goals are, you might take notes differently. Or you might not take them at all. I used to highlight or use minimal marking to note passages I thought were important before class. Note taking during readings would tend to distract me.\n\nBut I did always take extensive notes of what the professor was saying in class.",
