      "text": "What are you taking notes for? So you can contribute ideas and questions to class discussion? So you have notes for writing papers? Notes to study for tests? To increase memory retention?\n\nDepending on what your goals are, you might take notes differently. Or you might not take them at all. I used to highlight or use minimal marking to note passages I thought were important before class. Note taking during readings would tend to distract me.\n\nBut I did always take extensive notes of what the professor was saying in class.",

      "text": "I have learned so much through necessity in grad school! My note-taking also changes with each class. I don't really take notes but highlight cases for law and only do lecture notes, I'll do book notes in management and stats focusing on terms and major ideas, for quantitative classes I'll focus on definitions and formulas. All terms are one color pen and formulas are another. Code notes are in yet another color. It's still evolving and it takes time!\n\nA friend of mine about to graduate never really got the hang of it and writes basically everything down. Not really conducive to studying but he's managed to do well and he has a ton of knowledge, even if he's constantly stressed out.\n\nGive yourself time and just go with what feels right. I really only consciously got the hang of notes during my second semester, and of scheduling last year. It's all part of the process, you'll figure out what works for you! If it's not coming, definitely ask friends and take advantage of campus resources.",
