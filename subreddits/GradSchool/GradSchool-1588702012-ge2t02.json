The thing I realized with grad school is that it is also opportunity to enjoy that things you may not have had enjoyed in undergrad: meet new people (initiate the conversation) it is far more interesting to network during grad school because every one has a richer background; make crazy ideas happen--pursue out-of-this world research/thesis topics; savor the experience.

Almost everyone at some point feels like they do not belong there.  Some think it is because they are not smart enough, others that admissions made a mistake and others that they do not have the work experience others have.  This is actually normal and just adjusting to being in a place with older people who have more life experience than being fresh out of high school.  If you were accepted into the school, then you belong at the school.\n\nSince you are doing counselling, if you are not familiar with Yalom's The Gift of Therapy I highly suggest you read that and his other stuff.
