  "title:": "My job offers 12k tuition reimbursement, do masters degrees increase your earning potential that much?",
  "text": "Hi everyone, i graduated with a B.S. in geography in 2020, and recently switched jobs from non profit planning to environmental services(so trash basically, lol). This company offers tuition reimbursement of 12k but most of them are MBAs, where only one program would build off the degree i hold. Is there anyone here with a masters of environmental science that can determine if this is worth the time invested? I do love to learn but working full time (may potentially need a 2nd part time job too) and doing school seems quite daunting. \n\nFor more context, i was a GIS specialist but took this new job with potential to take more of a sustainability path and get out from behind the desk and speak to people. \n\nI believe I can do it, but I just want to know if it would be worth the potential stress. Any information or insight  is helpful :)",
