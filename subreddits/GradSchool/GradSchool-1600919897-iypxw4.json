I think it's like professors are getting used to it in a sense and just don't recognize how mentally, emotionally, and physically taxing this entire situation still is. Maybe it's because they're older and they have their own spouses/families, whereas many grad students, for example, live alone and have so little normal interaction with people anymore. I already struggled with motivation but now I'm lucky if I feed myself a proper amount of food in a day because I can't be bothered to do it. Much less having the capacity to focus on research and classes. \n\nThis attitude in zoom classes is also bothering me as well. When things first went virtual last semester, there was a lot of leniency-- turn your cameras off in class if you need to, take a break, let people know of you need extensions, etc... And just generally also lowering workload and expectations. Now this semester it's like they expect everyone to suddenly be adjusted. All of my classes don't want you to ever turn your camera off. And I don't care. I need a break from the screen. I need a break from looking at myself. This isn't normal. This semester I'm also taking a required course that is well known in our department to easily be double the work it should be, and we're just continuing to let it be that way, despite zoom making the nature of the class itself even more difficult (it's a course on language documentation, and we actually work with a consultant and document the language...  So it's several hours a week over zoom of listening to and transcribing sounds. It's God awful).\n\nIdk what else to say except I hear you. I'm sorry that your professor wasn't receptive to your comments about your capacity to work right now.

I really hope that your professors and mentors begin realizing that we are in such an unprecedented time and everyone is facing difficult and unique challenges, and put simply, the same standard cannot be met by most people right now.
