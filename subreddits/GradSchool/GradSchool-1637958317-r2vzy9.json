  "text": "Hi all. I previously attended a university abroad in Canada and was able to get 12 courses transferred over to my current university. However, I didn\u2019t do good at all (around a 2.0 gpa) but the credits still transferred and are recorded as \u201cT\u201d for the official grade on my current transcript. In addition, I\u2019ve taken pre req courses on sites that have one time low fees per course to transfer over. All in all I have about 60 credits in total I\u2019ve transferred.\n\nI\u2019m now doing very well at my current university thankfully, all A\u2019s, but I\u2019m worried that my prior performance will always haunt me. Would I have to hand in the transcript from the previous university? If I were to see if I can omit the transfer credits, would I still have to report the prior education?\n\nI\u2019m just frustrated that my past could really hinder my ability to further my education despite excelling now. Thanks!",

      "text": "As long as you've been accepted to that college and didn't lie on any admission forms, then your transfer credits should be accepted. Worst case scenario they transfer to general courses and may not apply to your degree. Regarding your GPA, transfer credits only transfer the credit hours not the grades. Your GPA is housed at each institution and only affects admission. So if you finish your degree at your current institution, your final GPA will only be determined by the grades from the classes at your current institution. \n\nHope that helps! Best of luck to you!",
