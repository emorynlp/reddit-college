My former supervisor at the small nonprofit I worked at before starting grad school left on maternity leave just as I was starting the semester.  It's been just about 2 months now.

One of myprofs I asked for a LOR did one for me. She even met me on zoom when her kid was asleep to discuss what was needed. If you need one from her do it.
