  "title:": "Anyone else being chronically distracted by the election?",
  "text": "I've spent 50-60% of my time over the last couple of days tracking this election. Every now and then I manage to force myself into seclusion and get a few hours of work done, but as an avid participant in politics it's always on my mind. Eventually I cave and jump into a political subreddit or spend an hour reading political analyses.\n\nI can't tell if I'm genuinely distracted by politics or if this is just another manifestation of my chronic pre-defense apathy. I'm defending in a few weeks and don't have much left to do to prep, so I've been indulging in procrastination - a dangerous mix of underestimating the defense and overestimating my preparedness.\n\nI was hoping I could focus more today but with so much still up in the air as of this morning.... Well, I'm posting here so that should tell you how focused on work I am!",

I'm an international student but generally don't feel out of place/foreign (as strange as that may sound) but this kind of scheduling reminds me. In 2016, my freshman year at my undergrad university (American), I remember professors cancelled classes and pushed due dates back post-election day. Not going to get that kind of leniency in a foreign country, I suppose. And it's especially hard to focus when I'm trying to ignore the news (to get things done!) but I'm the only American that most of my friends/acquaintances/housemates know so everyone is reaching out to me to hear my opinions.",
