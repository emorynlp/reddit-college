I've been doing a PhD program in physical chemistry for about 2 years, and today I had my first \"holy shit, these results are so exciting\" moment! To make a long story short, I'm working on catalysts, and up until now, for like a year, we thought that one of the elements was not involved in catalysis. We used it as part of the support material, to make the Pt more effective. Yesterday, I read a new paper about that element in a similar compound as an active catalyst for a similar reaction that we use. \n\nSo I presented this paper to my advisor, and suggested we look at the data (I had just run catalysis for the support sample by itself without Pt, just as a blank and I hadn't looked at the products for it because I assumed there just wouldn't be anything). I just looked at it, and holy shit I was right!!! It's forming products without platinum! This is huge for my research!!
