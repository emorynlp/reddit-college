First of all, calculate the odds of a random young-ish person you meet that you want to hit on, whether in bar or even directly on campus, ending up in your class. I doubt it's higher than \\~.03. Second, if it happens, deal with it appropriately (notify the professor or ask another TA to grade, figure it out). You didn't do anything at all unethical unless you handle yourself poorly.

Shit, my parents met on a dive boat while my mom was seasick (both of them are avid scuba divers), and my brother met his significant other during a ballroom dance competition.\n\nI met my boyfriend through reddit of all places funnily enough (we frequented some of the same subreddits), and he actually lived about two to three hours drive away from my university when I first met him. Initially it was mostly online chatting, which turned to zoom/skype calls, which then became visits, and eventually it became serious enough that he moved in with me at an apartment one town over from campus.
