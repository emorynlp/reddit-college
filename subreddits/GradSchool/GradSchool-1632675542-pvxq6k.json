I was in a stem PhD program at a big university. He was great about responding to my messages, put a lot of effort into papers, and was generally \u201cthere.\u201d However, I rarely felt like he really valued me or my contributions or my ideas. He was habitually combative in conversations about my STEM subject. Sometimes my ideas were met with curiosity and interest, and sometimes they were met with scoffing. \n\nI graduated, got a job not in academia that pays well and has good work-life balance. My co-workers have nearly always been kind in interactions, especially when it comes to working through ideas. It\u2019s very possible to disagree with a person\u2019s idea without aiming to shame them for having it.\n\nI had lunch with my old labmates and advisor recently and ended up experiencing the same kind of combative interaction w my advisor! Except I wasn\u2019t used to it anymore. I brought up a pretty reasonable idea- not to actually implement, but to casually explore in conversation what\u2019s possible. He quickly dismissed everything I was saying.\n\nI continued to defend my idea and he continued to dismiss it- making almost absurd claims. For example I mentioned I was interviewing for a new job where the main responsibility was simulating particular physical behavior. My old advisor said the relevant physics problem was \u201csolved.\u201d Like it is? So this company is throwing 6 figures a year at an already solved problem?\n\nI checked in with another former person in the lab who witnessed the interaction and she said she felt it was a really uncomfortable situation as well, and she thought my (very general) idea made sense.\n\nIt made me wonder how many other times I let him make me feel stupid unnecessarily because I had some degree of trust in him. It makes me never want to come back to academia.\n\nEdited wording for clarity", "author": "ktittythc", "created": 1632675542, "retrieved": 1632843931, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 261, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"heh8bbg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvxq6k/went_back_to_my_lab_after_graduation/heh8bbg/", "text": "This is not a good advisor in general. They likely do not have the full picture. Out of curiosity, I'm not sure if you're female, and your advisor is particularly combative with women in general (this sometimes happens in male dominated fields, and you mentioned that the other person you checked with was female). Without more context about the general idea or problem, its difficult to decide whether your advisor is right and knows an approach you might not have considered, or if he is relying on an outdated or incomplete picture of problem. \n\nIt is fine to be combative in academia or a research setting, as long as you know when to accept that you were wrong, otherwise you just look silly defending a position you dreamed up yourself. It may also be that your advisor may be insecure and felt the need to show off on his 'turf' in the lab, so even after you have left, he still sees you as his student, rather than a research professional in your own right. The problem your advisor is talking about may indeed be 'solved', but under some constraints, or may be impractical to implement in industry, the company is probably looking for a different perspective.", "author": "SquirrelOnTheDam", "created": 1632754685, "upvotes": 2}, "hegefwf": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvxq6k/went_back_to_my_lab_after_graduation/hegefwf/", "text": "Well done OP, you must've made him jealous.\n\nOh just to add, if this employer pays you 6-figure salary, it's most likely spending 7-figure budgets or more in related technologies and (of course) employing talented people like yourself.

Your advisor is either jealous of you, threatened by you, or just didn't think you'd make it and is having a hard time stomaching the taste of all that crow.\n\nThe average CS prof makes about $90K a year. Do you think your advisor is making six figures? Probably not. Why do you think that is? Maybe he just prefers academia and the lower salary. Maybe he wanted the exact kind of job you have but never could get it. What do you think his work-life balance is like? It's probably pretty shit, except during the summer.\n\nI'd be willing to bet that this professor is not happy. Happy people celebrate the successes of others. Good teachers feel proud when their students are successful. He saw that you were happy, and he feels like you don't deserve it, like you're getting something he deserves and doesn't have. He made you feel stupid on purpose because your success makes him feel insecure.\n\nI don't normally jump to this conclusion, but in your situation, it feels like Occam's Razor to me.", "author": "titlit_vv", "created": 1632712856, "upvotes": 16}, "hefisln": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvxq6k/went_back_to_my_lab_after_graduation/hefisln/", "text": "I left my PhD and got a job at a nonprofit.

It just blows my mind how willing academics are to let others exploit them. I\u2019ve had so many coworkers tell me that the situation is that we are mutually exploiting each other, what the fuck? There is some seriously shitty libertarian ideas and sentiments that have propagated in biomedical sciences in academia, in my experience. I don\u2019t think honest collaborative science occurs in the current paradigm. I think it\u2019s mostly corrupt entrenched labs exploiting junior workers to publish rushed and improper science.
