  "title:": "Concerns about advisor and work environment",
  "text": " I joined my current lab as I was entering my third year of my undergrad. My PI is a new faculty member and was eager to take students on. Early on, we discussed future opportunities and I was offered a direct entry PhD position starting in May 2022. I am now having second thoughts since the work environment is not sustainable. My PI is unsupportive and expects their students to devote practically every waking moment to the lab/research. My PI went so far to say that they don\u2019t socialize with their child since they focus on lab work and expect students to do the same or go above and beyond. I.e. work-life balance does not exist in this lab. I don\u2019t think this would be a healthy environment for the next four to five years, but I feel trapped. For one, my PI thinks I am obligated to stay and that I owe that to them since they took me on in my undergrad when I had no experience. Also, they will likely not be supportive if I seek opportunities elsewhere, so I fear that a poor letter of recommendation from my PI will hinder my applications to other institutions. \n\nI enjoy the research I do, but I don\u2019t think I am well suited for the environment and student-advisor dynamic in this lab. I tried having a conversation with my advisor and I expressed some concerns, but they simply told me \"I don't know how well I have it\". \n\nAny suggestions?",

      "text": "Whoa, their response is bullshit. You should bail. There is still plenty of time to get applications together for fall 2022. When it comes time for LORs write them an email thanking them for your time in their lab and explaining that your think pursuing research at a different institution would be best for you. No need to make it about the crappy lab culture. Then ask them if they would be willing to write a POSITIVE LOR. If they aren't, then bail right now and try to get in somewhere else for the semester. But do all this over E-mail. If you have a conversation about it then follow up with a friendly email confirming the conversation. Manipulative people like to work in the dark. \n\nIn any case they're just be exploitative. If they want to work insane hours that's fine. They're new faculty and likely in line for tenure, which is nearly guaranteed job security. All you'll get is burned out. Also, I've noticed that people who brag about how much they work often don't really work that much.",

          "text": "Thank you for your response. You bring up a good point.  My PI will only talk face-to-face and often uses \"I don't remember saying that\" to dismiss any concerns. I'll use that approach and send follow up emails where appropriate.",

              "text": "Yeah, my former, super toxic PI did this as well. They claimed they \"didn't have time\" to write things down. The real reason was because a former grad student had an entire HR thing with them where they were just being utterly terrible in E-mail, so the grad student printed it all out and brought it to HR. \n\nDunno if it helps, but that PI eventually drove literally everyone out of the lab, has barely published, student reviews are terrible, they were denied tenure, and their contact with the University wasn't renewed. \n\nIf you're in a one-party consent state you can also record your face to face meetings with them. If they agree to a positive LOR and then try and sabotage you you'll at least have options.",

      "text": "Was in this exact same toxic environment when I was starting my master\u2019s. I left it on the FIRST week, found another advisor 2 weeks after, and it\u2019s been GREAT since then. I love what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m with an advisor who tries to help but also pushes me, and my labmates are fantastic.\n\nAs my new advisor said \u201cit\u2019s more about who you\u2019re surrounded with than the actual exact topic of the research. If it\u2019s in the same ballpark, you will learn to love it anyways, so don\u2019t stay with a group of people who don\u2019t treat you as an equal.\u201d",

The only students that ever stuck around were those that were only staying for a few years and could stick it though. \n\nYou should definitely get out of there, there are definitely other professors that would be willing to write you letters of recommendations too so don't let that stop you.",
