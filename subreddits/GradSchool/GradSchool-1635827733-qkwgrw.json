  "title:": "Is intelligence a required trait to get a PH.D.?",
  "text": "I know you guys get a million posts a day about grad students not feeling smart enough, and subsequently suffering from serious Imposter Syndrome. Most of the time, the conclusion of these posts is \"You're smart enough, it's okay to feel dumb.\" What about people who are actually dumb? Is it possible to go through grad school through pure force of will, or is some amount of intelligence a prerequisite?\n\nSome background info on me, I'm a pretty unintelligent student. It takes me around 4 hours of studying to get a 91 on a test while the majority who don't study get a >95. I'm not very insecure about this though, since I've been able to get through my academic career via an abnormal dedication of time. Is this something I can keep up in grad school, or do you need to be naturally \"quick\" to have a hope of surviving it? Thanks for your time guys.",

It was especially a thing among STEM students because we all are so insecure, anxious, have so much pride, and many of us are from cultures where academic perfection is an absolute must. \n\nIt got pretty toxic tbh, because some ppl started doing this intentionally to psyche other ppl out and get in their heads, and set them up for failure by making them feel like they are dumb. It's like the girls who like to be seen as effortlessly thin while being able to eat anything, where in reality they'll restrict or exercise it all off afterwards.

You have to learn what others have said on a topic, identify the strengths and weaknesses in their arguments, analyze their methods and evidence, and then stake out your own position in a way that moves the conversation forward. Intelligence helps in this process, but not as much as being persistent and consistent as others here have said, and picking a subject or area of study about which you care deeply. Self-sufficiency and the ability to work independently are also important, since grad school tends to be sink-or-swim, even if you do find good mentors, because they are too busy to take students by the hand. One last key thing I'll mention is knowing your weaknesses and working around them. For example, if you need more time to study, choose a graduate program that allows you that time, instead of one that eats it up with lots of TAing or too little funding, forcing you to work too much on the side.",

The idea that doing well or not well in grad school is somehow reflective of our \"innate\" intelligence is slowly (very slowly) phasing out with newer faculty who have more updated beliefs about intelligence, but sadly it is still the case that many of us either receive direct or indirect messaging that performance is tied to some kind of inherent trait. In addition to messages within the academic space itself, there is also the societal perception that advancing through higher education is about inherent intellectual abilities, rather than factors like persistence and  generational socioeconomic circumstances, despite much research highlighting the connection to the later group of factors. In any case, this is all to say that it totally makes sense you would ask this question and wonder about this, given all the messaging that goes around within academia and outside of academia, about academia. However, when people critically examine their personal experience, it aligns with the current empirical evidence that success in school in general is more about conscientiousness and perseverance, and socioeconomic circumstance, more than anything else. Unfortunately, this critical examination often doesn't do enough to push past the implicit messages about intelligence received on a daily basis, therefore creating imposter syndrome, among many other socio/cultural/political contributors.",

Fast forward 20 years now that I\u2019m finishing up requirements to enter a PhD program for computational linguistics people tell me I\u2019m lucky.\n\nIn your PhD program you\u2019re likely to meet a number of people who academics was just easy for them and they can absorb what\u2019s in a book like you can drink water.\n\nSeveral people who were also applying to the program are a part of the study cohort that we meet monthly to review the coursework, practice coding and arguments.  So I was initially quite intimidated as three of the nine of graduated from Ivy League, now several of them it seems like they don\u2019t know how to study unless there\u2019s a book to give them every step of the process.\n\nI\u2019ve been jokingly calling them bookboy because they don\u2019t seem to understand that a small percentage of what we need to learn is in a book but that\u2019s the only way that they were taught. To study the book the professor gave and only that book.\n\nI\u2019ve probably got dozens of Industry white papers, and hundreds of hours of seminar video that I found, in addition to nine books in my que totalling maybe 8,000 pages of existing research and none of this is specified by the professor. \u201cWhy are you reading/studying this\u201d is a frequent question and my reply is \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you reading it\u201d. If I\u2019m going to study computational linguistics then I\u2019m definitely going to be studying was widely considered to be the Bible of speech and language processing by Juravsky and Martin.\n\nSo you might even have an advantage because they don\u2019t have high expectations for you, when it comes time to produce results hopefully that extra study is going to blow their mind as far as what I can do. so I would recommend you dig much deeper into the almost into the bedrock of your subject. Then also find the top 3 to 5 experts in the world and email them like I did to find two of them emailed back.\n\nSo some intelligence is required to get a PhD but you\u2019re going to need a lot more persistence, improvisation, assertiveness and ability to make logically connected solid cogent well researched arguments.",

I don't know about the field you're in, but your time dedication might be abnormal in the sense that it was small, not long!\n\nAbsolutely distrust anyone who says they didn't study and got over 95% answers right. With \"not studying\" they may very well mean putting 4h of work into it, or more. Or, they may have gotten a lot of practice on that sort of exam at some point, which is \"studying\" in the end.\n\nFor the PhD... far more important than having some general intelligence is **the ability to execute it**. Reading content critically, synthetizing, producing new knowledge... but also, **planning**. Surely you don't need to be a project manager to start the PhD, but it is a complex, long project, so you could face it more like that rather than a test. And crucially, the related skills are something you may have already, or something that you will slowly develop.\n\nThe most important question to ask yourself: is a PhD a good step to get to your desired career? Good luck!",

      "text": "It was pitched in *Outliers* by Malcolm Gladwell (which is, as many know, flawed) that intelligence is only a sort of minimum threshold. Basically, you need to be \"x amount smart\" - that is, smart enough to be able to understand and manipulate the basic concepts in your field, but any boost in intelligence (e.g., \"higher IQ points\") past that is kind of more just gravy than anything else. Regardless of how you feel about the book, this is generally the case. You have to be of a minimum level of intelligence that you can gain the required knowledge, but one doesn't necessarily need to be any smarter than that to succeed.\n\nMany of the things that make someone successful, as people have pointed out already, go far beyond traditional intelligence, just as they would in any other field. Even if you had to work harder than others to get there, if you were ultimately able to get the required results in terms of academic performance, you're likely to be above the required threshold, even if it means you might have to work harder than others. But it's not like Nobel Prizes, for example, go to the smartest person - they go to someone who made the most significant contribution in that field. So while there may be a positive correlation, it's extremely loose, and once again, other things likely matter more.\n\nIn my own experience in grad school, I've observed that the PhD students who impressed me the most are not necessarily the \"smartest one\", but usually the most dedicated. It reaches a point, especially in the STEM fields, that the person who cares the most is able to actually expose themselves to more useful information than someone who might technically be more intelligent. Then, this exposure leads to more meaningful breakthroughs as that information is applied. Further, creativity in problem solving, which is important in research, is not really a measure of intelligence either.",

If you think intelligence is reflected through success in exams and tests, well, then that can be achieved through multiple ways - willpower, practice, hardwork, maybe even some weird medications and techniques.\n\nJust find your own way in life. As a researcher/scientist, be curious and honest to your thirst for knowing more. Everyone is dumb, and more they learn - the dumber they feel. Stop giving two fucks about intelligence - its a stupid, abstract concept which aids us in no way in our lives.",

The biggest factor is dedication. A good advisor can help you iron rough patches, but they can't do the work for you. The smartest person in my program didn't graduate. She is beyond a shadow of a doubt the smartest person I've met, but she works a full time job, and wasn't dedicated to passing. Burnout is real.",

Even if it takes you 4 hours of studying to get the information, you eventually get it.

I remember in grad school that a lot of the things we worked on were longer projects that took months as opposed to just quick assignments. \n\nThirdly, if you are asking if someone who TRULY lacked intelligence could complete a PhD, then I am saying, no they could not. You do have to have some level of intelligence to complete graduate level coursework. But YOU are certainly not lacking in intelligence.",

Mostly because people are always going to use degrees as a measure of intelligence so people are always going to assume that PhD==smart even though it's not really true. \n\nDegrees, including PhDs, are measure of persistence if anything. I also genuinely think the standards for getting a PhD have lowered- This will vary widely by advisor, department, program and school but I think there are so many programs and so many PhD students now that some of them have really lax standards. I'll be honest, I felt like my own program's standards were too lax. There were classmates who got degrees who absolutely shouldn't have imo. \n\nThe same can be said about undergrad degrees to an extent but at least there's some uniformity among most undergrad curricula. Like student A had to pass X amount of credits. Each grad program is wildly different from the other. Even within programs the rigor can widly vary from advisor to advisor. I knew a PI who wouldn't let their students graduate until they produced something Nature worthy. Even if they had a bunch of other publications. Then on the other hand you have a PI who was trying to graduate one of their students who hadn't published anything in 5 years",
