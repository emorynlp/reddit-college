  "title:": "Teaching myself stats and I'm not okay",
  "text": "It is time for the data analysis portion of my MS research. I have a general idea on stats and models I will be using, but the devil is in the details. I have zero R experience (primarily worked with excel in undergrad) and my uni has zero stats courses that would be applicable to my area. My advisor believes I will be able to teach these to myself proficiently. \n\nAny advice on how to proceed? Beginning with R or multivariate stat resources? \n\nI know I won't learn these all overnight, but I can't help the imposter syndrome flaring. \ud83d\ude14\n\n\n\n\nEdit: You all are great! Thanks so much for the resources being posted, I'll definitely need all of them!",

My problem with R is that the \"help\" is frequently significantly less than helpful if you do not have a programming background, so if you can watch videos I'd recommend that. I think another challenge to R isn't so much the actual doing of the stats, since there are so many packages there's probably someone out there who has a package for the analyses you need to do. In my experience, the challenge is having your data set cleaned and processed enough for R to not have a conniption. \n\nAlso, if your university has a statistics consulting center it might be worthwhile to check that out. I haven't had to use mine yet, but evidently we have one.",

Don't be afraid to tell them if you're having trouble. \n\nI wasted a lot of time struggling to solve problems on my own because I didn't feel like I could go to my advisor due to their hands off approach. Setting up weekly/twice weekly meetings was super important to helping things move along in my case.",
