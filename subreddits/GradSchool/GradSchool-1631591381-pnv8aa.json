  "title:": "Should I still email professors that have stated they are accepting new students in their labs?",
  "text": "I'm at that stage of my grad school applications where I'm sending letters to labs of interest that I'm hoping to get a position in if I'm accepted to the school. The template I wrote up essentially leads to the question 'I was wondering if you're accepting new students into your lab next fall'. However, I've come across a couple of professors who have explicitly stated on their sites that they ARE accepting new students. My question is, do I still email them so I can get my name on their radar? If so, what do I say? Or should I just not reach out to them?",
