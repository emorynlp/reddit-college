  "title:": "Considering dropping out, easily the most miserable time of my life.",
  "text": "I'm in my second semester as a graduate student of computer science. I was given early admission into the graduate program at my university for having a perfect GPA in undergrad. My advisor let me into the program without having finished my undergrad, so technically I have no degree in hand, and cannot tell employers that I have a degree in CS despite being this far.\n\nI was suicidal in my first semester of grad school, it mostly had to do with the difficulty of the classes. I was taking only two during that semester and still working on school for \\~60 hours a week. I contemplated suicide almost on a daily basis. I decided to keep going with the program because I kept hearing comments about \"it gets easier\" and the like, but this semester is at least 10 orders of magnitude more difficult, and I'm still only taking two classes. I spent 80 hours on the first assignment, where the professor said we could expect to finish it in an afternoon. Now, I have another assignment due in three days, that I've already spent over 40 hours on in a 4 day time period, and am approximately 10% of the way through it with a strictly hard wall of understanding I cannot cross. \n\nI don't understand. This can't simply be imposter syndrome or whatever everyone talks it up to be. I know I don't know as much as I should at this level, my peers are not struggling as much as I am. I have reached out to a handful of them, and these really are afternoon assignments to them. The complexity of the assignments are far above what I think is manageable for me, and honestly I'm considering dropping out over simply killing myself. Even though I know I'll be left with the debt of having gotten this far, with nothing to show for it unless I go back and finish the undergrad degree.\n\nI wanted to feel like this would pass, but there's just no way I can handle three more semesters of this.",

You can walk away from these things and come back to them when you're feeling more prepared, and you may find that you don't even want to.\n\nIf grad school is making you suicidal, it's time to stop grad school and urgently. Dropping out is a billion times better because once you kill yourself you can't make any choices any more. There is no debate there.",

I\u2019m making an assumption here, but I think I know exactly what you\u2019re going through because I\u2019ve been through it before. \n\nIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re dumber than everyone else. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re lazy. It\u2019s not any of those reasons. \n\nYou can\u2019t do your shit in a timely manner because right now your mental state is all over the place. Sounds obvious but it\u2019s important to tell yourself that over and over again. When you\u2019re chronically depressed your mind flips between a number of excuses as to why you suck. But at the root of it all, it\u2019s just because you\u2019re overwhelmed. \n\nI know it\u2019s cliche to hear, but therapy is key. Finding the right therapist is key. It was for me, that\u2019s for damn sure. There are probably other factors in your life that have led you this way, I know because that\u2019s how it was for me. \n\nIt\u2019s time to sort that out and forgive yourself for at least some of your past mistakes. Once you do that you\u2019ll notice improvement. Slowly, at first, but you\u2019ll see it. Two steps forward, one step back. \n\nIt does get better, and it does get easier. But you gotta take care of you first. There was a time when I dropped out undergrad with a 1.7 gpa. Now I\u2019m looking to finish grad school soon. \n\nIt\u2019s time to look inward and *take care of yourself first and foremost*.",

Keep in mind that the university let you move on to grad school with no undergrad degree bc they saw that the skills/grades you already have are already enough to vouch for you. In over 20 years studying and working at a university, I have NEVER met anyone who was allowed to do this, so you must be pretty extraordinary, whether you see it or not. In my opinion, you are too focused on degrees. Degrees don't matter that much, they don't always give an accurate description of people. I have met incredibly skilled/brilliant people with no degree and completely useless people with one or more degrees. Just focus on the work you love and are so good at. There's nothing wrong with you, you might be just suffering from burnout, probably due to the extremely high demands you make on yourself.",

Also it's not the end all be all - I know stories of folks who went to grad school after a couple of years working as a professional, and they are not to be looked down on any more than someone who went directly from undergrad to grad school.",

I highly suggest speaking with them, they can sometimes give you guidance on other resources available to you. Most departments are very understanding of student's academic pressures so I also suggest leaning on your professors and letting them know how difficult the assignments are. They often give you extensions when you ask for them. One thing that really helped me with my computer science courses was meeting with tutors and making it a priority to reach out to them on assignments. \n\nSchool isn't easy and I understand firsthand how difficult it can be to juggle everything. If you're feeling like you need a break, you certainly can drop classes and come back when you're ready. There's always a way to figure out everything and do what's right for you because you always have options.",

My instinctive response to your story was that maybe marks don't really translate into gifted prodigy? You were doing well in undergrad going at the pace that is set out for you in the program, maybe you were not ready for the jump into grad classes as your advisor thought? \n\nBased on the psychological and emotional breakdowns you've gone through, I'd say it is best to give yourself a break and go back to finish the undergrad degree. Don't push yourself too hard or feel bad about anything you lost because it was just an early trial. Maybe, if you really like it, you can go back to the grad program one day when you are ready.",
