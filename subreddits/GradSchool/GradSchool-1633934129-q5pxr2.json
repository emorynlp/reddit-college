  "text": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but here goes: \n\nI'm freaking out. \n\nI'm looking to apply for my Masters in Economics in UK and Europe. In May 2022, I get done with my 3 year undergrad. \n\nI started GRE prep in June with the hopes of taking it in August and then got diagnosed w a permanent spine condition. So everything especially prep for my masters took a back seat. \n\nAt this point, I can probably give the GRE and get a decent score along with my IELTS by the first week of November latest. I'm in the midst of getting my recommenders confirmed (which should happen by end of the week) and I need to get started on my personal statements. \n\nI graduate in May and don't really have a backup plan at the moment. Is it realistically possible for me to apply to at least 4 places (LSE, UCL, Oxford, Cambridge, Warwick) by November end? Is there anything else I need to keep in mind or consider?",

      "text": "Could you clarify where the November end deadline is coming from? I checked UCL, LSE, and Warwick and I'm not seeing a hard end of November deadline. \n\nI do think it's possible to apply by the end of November though if that is your timeline. Once you have one personal statement down it's usually pretty quick to turn adapt them for the other schools. Good luck!",

      "text": "That's certainly doable if it's within your energy and health limitations to find a few extra hours per week to be applying to graduate school (and fellowships) while finishing undergrad.\n\nI don't have specific advice for your proposed institutions, but application essays normally have quite a bit of overlap (personal statements) with a few institution-specific questions.\n\nBest of luck!",
