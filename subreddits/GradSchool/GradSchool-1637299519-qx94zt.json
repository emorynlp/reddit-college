  "text": "Basically the title, I\u2019m currently employed at a financial institution and am going to be resigning to work for an IT company soon and they are wanting me to get a couple of certifications like a CCNA, CompTIA A+, etc. Obviously I know it won\u2019t look bad when I submit my resume for grad school, but will it actually increase my chances or have no impact at all?",
