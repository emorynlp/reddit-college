  "text": "I\u2019ve been thinking about visiting my grandparents outside the US for a quick winter break vacation (haven\u2019t seen them in a few years, they\u2019re getting up there in age). \nI just started a completely online Masters program so being anywhere physically is not a worry for me. \n**Has anyone utilized VPN to keep doing your assignments and grad school work while being out of your respective country? Or did online grad school while traveling around?**\nTips, tricks, is it doable?",

They installed a special protected VPN on my desktop in the UK, which I can enable to secure my connection if I am using public wifi to connect remotely. \n\nNormally, if you need to use a VPN, it would be provided by your university. For example, during my undergrad, we had to install some software on our personal laptop that required to be connected to our uni server to access the licenses. Since this required us to be on campus, the uni made us install a special protected VPN (cisco) so that we could use the software from home.",
