  "text": "For example, I was thinking about scanning a math exam (with permission) to show off high level math skills. Is this a good idea? I could type out the question, steps, and answer, if that would look better. What about labs? Can I just include those? I have a few class projects I can add, but I want to capture some of my more technical skills.",
