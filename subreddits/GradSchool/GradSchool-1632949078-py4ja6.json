Research interest : Structural, transportation \n\nApplying  at : (intended program PhD)\n\nOregon state, University of nebraska Lincoln, \nUniversity of Wisconsin - milwaukee, Mississippi state, West Virginia uni, Ohio state, Uni of Missouri Columbia, Uni of kansas, michigan tech, uni of nevada reno.\n\nWhat are my chances of admission with funding? Actually I have some email connection with some professors aligning with my interest. Most of them have central policy system for civil engineering. They encourage to apply but do not want to advance talk before preliminary decision.\n\nI think Ohio state, Nevada reno may be bit tough for me. Hopeful of others. I have pretty good lab based research and project experience. Any suggestion is appreciated about chances.", "author": "JulioReese", "created": 1632949078, "retrieved": 1632951845, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "comments": {}}
