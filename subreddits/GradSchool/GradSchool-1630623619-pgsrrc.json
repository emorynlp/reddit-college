  "text": "Tl;dr : Does a later application due date indicate a less competitive program? Will they take me with no research experience?\n\nI am starting the application process for 2-3 masters programs in biological related fields. I am looking at an ecology program that has an application due date in December of the year for fall 2020. There is a big interview process during selection and many awesome labs to join with lots of funding. It seems quite selective.\n\nAt the same school, there is an entomology program that will accept applications until July 2022 for the fall 2022. They also are offering possible financial assistance to visit the campus facilities before/when applying. Does this mean that this program is much less competitive and I will have an easier time getting in?\n\nI had a 3.6 undergrad GPA and will likely have a decent GRE score, but I have no undergrad research experience. I don\u2019t want to waste time applying for a program I am very unlikely to get into. However, I also don\u2019t want to limit myself. I have been a science teacher since I graduated in 2020 so could that make me stand out as an applicant with a more unique skill set? \n\nAny thoughts or opinions on my above musings are appreciated. :)",

      "text": "Disclaimer: I\u2019m in an MPH Epi & Biostats program, not Bio. \n\nHere\u2019s my 2 cents: Apply anyway and apply for fee waivers, too. For what it is worth, I think you are possibly a strong applicant based on your teaching experience and GPA. And no, a later application due date does not indicate a less competitive program (at least in my experience. Often times the date has to do with internal committee meetings). And no, I\u2019ve had many colleagues get accepted to various STEM programs with no research experience (they were strong in other areas though, like you).\n\nGood luck!",
