  "title:": "perfectionism in research",
  "text": "Im doing my masters in applied linguistic and I have been having constant panic attacks over my analysis and general research progress.\n\nI spoke to a few people who remind me that theres rarely a perfect, error free research, even the best researcher has errors in their journals. I was also reminded that as long as I did my best, i didn\u2019t cheat, it is better to just complete my research rather than delaying and focusing too much on making it \u201cperfect\u201d. \n\nIn other words, my focus should shift from ensuring everything is perfect to just trying my best and move on with the research.\n\nHearing this made me a little bit calmer however I do need more reassurance. Is this sort of mindset okay for a masters student? what exactly is expected of a masters student? How do you guys deal with perfectionism?",

      "text": "I'm in a similar boat but for PhD. I'm in my last year and just realizing how much bad science gets published (it's scary actually). But! If you report everything as honestly as possible you are fine and this is why: you are interpreting data as it comes and making conclusions. Therefore, your publication is a summary of that data. Even if you missed something or drew a wrong conclusion that is ok, as long as it is all reported. Think of your work as a stepping stone- it may not all be perfect but presumably you are providing the community with new results. \n\nIt only gets bad by purposefully omitting data to skew or bolster conclusions.",

      "text": "One distinguishing thing about research is that it involves a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity. That is tough for people who need structure, and requires practice for those who are accustomed to a lot of structure. \n\nAt the same time, you need a high level of rigor in your inference-making. That means minimizing the uncertainties where you can. \n\nI suspect you are learning to deal with both of these challenges. Most people can't do it. Even the people who can, have to work hard at it. \n\nThere are practices you can use to help focus your attention, and analyze the risks of error. Those are good to learn in a masters program. If you don't like it, or really can't get the knack for it, then a PhD and research career may not be the most satisfying trajectory.",
