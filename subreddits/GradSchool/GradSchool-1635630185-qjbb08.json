  "text": "Hi all! I just had a quick question - I'm in the process of applying to grad school and I'm going to be emailing my professors to request a letter of recommendation but when writing the email, I'm a bit unsure of how I should mention that I'm applying to a few universities to a few very similar but a bit different programs. Most of the email templates I found just mention that I will be applying for X at Y university, that's why I don't know how I should put it. Also, these universities have different deadlines but the one I want to get into is later than others. \n\nI'd appreciate any advice!",

      "text": "It\u2019s common to apply to multiple programs (and common for different programs to have different deadlines) so I\u2019m sure the professors you\u2019ll be emailing are used to this. What I did was ask if they\u2019d be willing to write me a strong letter of recommendation, provided a list of the schools I was applying too, and said if so I could send them more information about deadlines. When they said yes, then I gave them a list of the schools in order of their deadlines and a little more info about the programs I was applying to (like the specific names of each program). If they have any more questions about it they\u2019ll ask you.\n\nWhen you do your app, most likely (all my apps were like this when I applied last year) when you put in your recommender\u2019s name/contact info, then the program will send an email to that LOR writer asking for the LOR (before the app is fully submitted). I\u2019d highly recommend doing this asap once you make sure your professors will write you letters, so give them as much time as possible. I did this all at the same time for each of my schools (so the professors each got several emails in a row from different schools asking for their LOR), and then send them a quick email to let them know I\u2019d submitted their info to all the programs.",
