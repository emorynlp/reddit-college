  "text": "If you use a google drive location for your group and/or collaborators, because of the traffic it brings in (e.g., multiple people downloading from multiple locations), google will sometimes flag it and will sometimes just delete everything with no backups.\n\nHad a scare two years ago where our entire group folder was locked out due to suspicion and we had to email their support to gain access again. The support mentioned that they (or the algorithm?) sometimes will just delete things and told us to be careful. Since then we now use a supercomputer database with 2-3  physical/cloud backups and nightly backup snapshots of the entire folder.",

One day they were all there, next day they were gone. And because I was syncing from my computer, **they'd disappeared from my computer too**. I didn't have a 3rd backup for a lot of it because most of it wasn't critically important (few things are), but it's still a real bummer to lose. \n\nI don't trust cloud services anymore. I don't consider them to be a backup, I consider it nothing more than an extension of the files on my computer so I can access things from different devices. \n\nMy backups now are:\n\n1. Computer\n\n2. Time machine / full-system backup\n\n3. Harddrive\n\n4. University server in 2 places (mostly for data too large to store elsewhere)\n\n5. Git for project files",

Having **two** cloud backups is no better than having **one**. You\u2019re still beholden to a rather capricious entity, just now it\u2019s two entities instead of one. \n\nAnd if you fall prey to the last two options then it\u2019s rather likely you\u2019d lose *both* accounts around the same time. If you\u2019re going to have 3 copies then only 1 of those should be cloud based. The other needs to be an offline version wherever possible.",

They range in capability and price, but you can setup a really cheap one using a raspberry pi that should be more than adequate for word docs, pdfs, spreadsheets, and PowerPoints. \n\nMine is a Synology DS1621+ with 6 12 tb iron wolf drives on a raid 6 system. I keep backups of my movie, comic, and music collection, my photos, and all my school stuff, organized by semester. I can setup limited permission accounts for other users like my friends (to share movies, music, comics, photos) and classmates/team members (to share documents).  It\u2019s accessible from any device with an internet connection and it has apps for iOS and android. \n\nIt\u2019s been very handy in class on article nights. Instead of needing to print out everything, bring a laptop, or load everything onto my phone or tablet, I can just access each article on my phone. When I work on stuff on my computer, I open it directly from the nas, and all saves update that version. Several times during a discussion an article from a previous class has come up and I just tracked it down from my phone, opened it, and could reference it directly. \n\nWhile my personal setup is probably overkill for most people, using a nas setup, especially a Synology one since they have such useful apps, is definitely worthwhile.",
