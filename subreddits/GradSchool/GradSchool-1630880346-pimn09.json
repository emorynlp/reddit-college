I took my first GRE this morning after studying over the summer with some Kaplan resources a friend passed on to me. It went better than I expected -- 160V and 157Q -- but I was hoping for a better Quant score, for sure.\n\nHere's my question. Is it even worth taking it again? I'm looking to apply to some musicology programs this fall, and I think if they look at scores they're going to focus on the Verbal and Essay scores. But I'm very nervous and I think I've put way too much stock into how much weight a GRE score actually carries, so I feel like each and every bit of my application has to be perfect. I have a summa cum laude GPA, one publication under my belt, and my recommenders have said some very enthusiastic yeses to writing letters for me. So should the other stuff on my resume offset the not-so-great GRE score? I really don't want to drop another $205 dollars on a second test, especially since I could use that money for application fees.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated, especially from music or humanities grads.
