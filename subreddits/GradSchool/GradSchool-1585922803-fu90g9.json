  "text": "I'm so behind on work right now. I just want to go to my office and grind out some homework and be productive, but I can't even go on campus anymore. I cannot get any work done at home. I can't focus, I can't study, I can't bring myself to do anything work related. I never had this problem when I was in my office daily. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? It's driving me up the wall. I'm sorry if this sounds like me griping, but I kind of just needed to say it.\n\nEdit: This post got larger than expected, so I'd like to say thanks for everyone offering helpful and reassuring responses! I'm glad I'm not the only one having this mental block at this time.",

My preferred workspace is the middle of my living room floor, on my stomach, with a laptop in front of me. I have a really nice desk and really nice desktop pc, but I honestly get less work done there. I don't know what it is about being at a desk that makes me not want to do actual work... I guess maybe because it feels more like work when I'm at a desk. I also go to sleep at ridiculous hours, and it's much better for me to be able to wake up at 3:00 or 4:00pm after a full 8 hours of sleep than it is to go to sleep at 8:00am and get up at 12:00pm to make the commute to the college. every day. I have more energy and feel more productive than I have since I was an undergrad taking night classes. fighting against your body's natural sleep patterns is definitely a good way to burn out quickly.",

Like others, I've accepted that I'm not going to do much work with all this going on, so I'm shifting my days a little to incorporate school work better. My office has daily check ins over Zoom which have been really nice. Any time before check in is work time. Afterwards, no more work, only school stuff. It's not perfect, but I need something concrete. I'm moving into a new house soon and that'll help a little because I'll have a place for work and a place for school work, but until then, I need more structure.",

It is OK that you keep waking up at 3 a.m. It is OK that you forgot to eat lunch and cannot do a Zoom yoga class. It is OK that you have not touched that revise-and-resubmit in three weeks. Ignore the people who are posting that they are writing papers and the people who are complaining that they cannot write papers. They are on their own journey. Cut out the noise. Know that you are not failing. Let go of all of the profoundly daft ideas you have about what you *should* be doing right now.

Caffeine and vitamins. I've been exercising to try to combat my excess glucose intake (just because I'm comfortable with my obesity doesn't mean I want to be MORE obese) but I find I am living off tea, pop and water. As for vitamins, ADD responds well to Omega-3, Iron and B12. Even without the condition it might still help you focus, especially if you are tired all the time.\n2. Cordon off your office from your bed. Is it a proper office? Of course not, but look at some of the things people who have had to deal with a bedroom/office combo. It could be as simple as grabbing a rug or fake plants to divide half your room so you can't see your bed from your desk.\n3. Make things accessible from your desk. Water dispenser? There.\n\nTry to get these things all at once with a few essentials so you don't get dirty looks for buying a \"\"non-essential\"\" during a pandemic. If you need it, you need it-just plan ahead so you don't do it very often.",

      "text": "For the first week and a half I was not very productive. I was basically just reeling with confusion at the huge shift. Lately I have made some changes that have increased my productivity, but it's still tough.\n\nKey factors to my unproductivity:\n\n-My university has not officially suspended research, but I have chosen (and have talked to my PI about it) to stay home and suspend my own research. At first I felt incredible guilt for not being on campus everyday. This guilt hasn't necessarily stopped, but it's improved since I  discussed things with my PI.\n-I worked really hard for three years to leave work at work and be relaxed at home. Now that mental barrier I've constructed is working against me.\n-I no longer have external structure. I struggle to organize my days at home because I have no external timeline to fit my work into.\n\nKey factors in my improvement:\n\n-I talked to my PI. We discussed how important safety is. We decided that as long as I maintain my cells and can continue my project once this is over, it's ok to delay things for now. I also brainstormed with him ways I could work on my research from home.\n-I got a new desk. Legit, my neighbor gave me an old desk. It immediately became my new workspace. Because this desk was new, I had no mental habits formed around it (ie: the couch is for relaxing, so I can't focus there). I was able to make a set of rules for this desk so that it mimics the work environment I had on campus.\n-I have made my own structured day. I start work at 10AM and make a task list for my work that day. I choose spend two hours either on research or teaching tasks. Then I take an hour for lunch. In the afternoon I switch to the other subjects and work on those tasks. At 4 or 5PM, I close my laptop, turn off my desk light, and push in the chair. Work is done. I leave it on that desk and don't touch it again until the next day.\n\n\nI hope this makes sense. I apologize for any weird formatting. I hope maybe some of my problems are relatable to others and that some of my solutions can help others.",

      "text": "I spent years subconsciously convincing myself that I cannot work at home, so I need to go to the office. This was an attempt to make myself to just go in every day, since there was nothing stopping me from staying at home and \"working\" from there.\n\nIt was meant to help me but now it kind of backfired. After years of basically not being able to work at home at all, I have to just flip a switch. It's been tough here too, so I can more than empathize.\n\nI'm sure others have told you multiple \"productivity\" techniques for working from home, including setting up a \"work-only space\" which is far away from your \"relaxation-only space,\" creating and adhering to rigorous daily routines, buddy systems with your colleagues/friends, etc. Any of these may work, or none of these may work. It's always difficult to put this stuff into practice, however appealing it may sound.\n\nHell, I have trouble staying productive in my *office* sometimes. Working from home almost feels like I'm fighting a losing battle. That said, frustrating as it is, there are always a couple of things you can try to do which may work for you.\n\nGrad school life is hard as it is. Here's an interesting document talking about life in grad school way back in 1988 at MIT (especially page 31-36): https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41487/AI_WP_316.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y. If you're like me, this would be very relatable to you already. This crap has been the norm for 30+ years now. When you add this whole global crisis to the mix, it's completely expected that your productivity will hit a significant low.\n\nThere's really not much advice that works for everyone, especially in grad school.\nI've been trying to do some non-work stuff life improvements like -- (i) going to bed and waking up at reasonable times, (ii) drinking a lot of water, (iii) taking walks (cautiously), etc.\nI've also set a target for working at least 1 hour a day. It's not much but it's something.\nI'm slowly making a dent on all the crap I need to do.\nBut I also know that the expectations for me from my department will change because of all this, so that makes me feel a bit relieved.\n\nYou're not alone at all and I'm glad you made this post. I've had an opportunity to kind of vent and also be comforted by this weird solidarity of unproductiveness by my peers. Let's hope we find our own way out of this rut eventually.",

The fact that you and others continue to believe that the grad experience is somehow exceptional or worse than being paid minimum wage while washing dishes, berated by a boss, and no upward mobility is a joke. Unfortunately, the average American has gone through worse times than a privileged graduate student (where the majority of graduate students still come from privileged backgrounds)\n\nContinuing to perpetuate this \"exceptionalism\" about graduate studies is what makes the general public distrust academics and scientists. Imagine pouring cement and hammering nails for 10+hrs with no upward mobility, never a possibility to join the middle class. And then seeing some student whine about how he's getting paid so little to work in his underwear from home to get a degree that will put him in middle class earnings.\n\nCome on now. Most of us are much more well off than the general public, or else we probably wouldn't have made it to grad school. Grad school still is and continues to be an institution for the privileged who most likely have never worked a minimum wage job. By pretending us grad students are in an \"exceptional\" position of abuse just widens the distrust between academics/scientists and the general public. The general public doesn't listen to us or heed our warnings because people like you believe they're exceptional in every way or form to a common American.",

I am not saying that grad students are exceptional cases when it comes to personal struggles; I am trying to say that it's normal to have struggles *even if* you're a grad student.

Grad school still is and continues to be an institution for the privileged who most likely have never worked a minimum wage job.\n\nYou're right. We're likely more privileged and well off than the average person. But telling that to someone doesn't make their problems disappear. It encourages them to hide their issues because someone in their position really shouldn't be whining *because* they're lucky.\n\nThis isn't a subtle difference at all. Minimum wage employees struggle everyday but it's something they, you and I openly recognize. Living pay-check to pay-check is absolutely a real struggle, and no one is denying that. But mental health issues for a relatively well-off individual is then cast aside as a non-problem *because* we recognize that others have visibly obvious problems as well.\n\n> It's not bitter medicine it's reality.\n\nThese aren't mutually exclusive. But using reality as a reason to sweep problems under the rug isn't solving the problem. A problem is likely going to exist even if you change vantage points. The bottomline is to help someone who is struggling, not show them why their struggles don't matter or compare. It's like trying to convince someone that their bruised knee doesn't have to be dealt with because someone else lost their entire leg.\nFirst aid will still help them, regardless of how terrible others have it.\n\nYou might say that first aid is a hot commodity and there isn't enough to go around, *given* that it could be used on someone else who lost a leg. But in this case, I'm talking about starting from even acknowledging that a bruised knee is painful to begin with, even if it might be orders of magnitude less painful than something else.\n\nTL;DR: You seem to have the opposite idea of what I am trying to say. You think I am saying that grad students or academics are special cases and they have to be dealt with in some special way. I am saying that grad students are *not special* and that we should acknowledge it's completely normal for them to be struggling as well. Everyone is entitled to have struggles; you being a grad student doesn't change that.",

Meanwhile, you have a blue collar worker with no upward mobility being just as berated as a grad student who will take it and say, \"that's life. It is what it is.\" They don't victimize themselves. It's just very difficult for me to take most graduate student problems seriously when most grad students have never had a minimum wage job or been in shitty non-academic position. Every American is dealing with this. And now, in a time of crisis, is when us that are privileged should be doing the best we can to not victimize ourselves and have empathy and compassion for those that are truly impacted by this pandemic.",

The well-meaning folks who told me that I'm \"smart so I'll be fine\" to comfort me only served to make it worse.\n\nI've since learned to recognize that a problem is a problem regardless or relative magnitude. Not looking at the problem doesn't make it go away. Even acknowledging it's a small problem is better than saying it's not a problem. There is something to fix; it may be an easy fix but it still needs to be fixed. That's about it.\n\nI don't know the sorts of grad students you interact with, but most of my colleagues are cognizant of their privilege.

At uni, the environment structures your routine by default, here you need to put in some thought into the set up, but it is possible.\n\nGenerally a good beginner strategy is to imitate your normal work schedule, as people above have suggested. Get up same time, put on work clothes, etc. Track the hours you work so your mind can't lie to you that you've \"done nothing\". Have an end point: if you normally finish at 5, then do that, close everything and switch to doing engaging home stuff. Jump on group chats after you are done for the day.\n\n\nSomeone in my department sent around an email saying that right now, we aren't working from home, we are trying to work while stuck at home during a crisis. Productivity can be expected to suffer and it's not shameful. So be nice to yourself about this :)",

Whenever I did this then (most of the time) a few days in a need for a nap would conveniently arise in the middle of the night, and I just started making that my primary sleep.\n\nLike it's not amazingly pleasant, staying up that \"late\" when your body is ready for sleep earlier, but imo it beats waking up earlier to adjust your schedule. Even if the nap thing doesn't happen (it wasn't every time for me) it's still a more pleasant, albeit slower, way to adjust your schedule",
