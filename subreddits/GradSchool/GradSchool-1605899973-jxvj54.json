I have a full semester-long project due on that very Friday. \n\nNow, I am not arguing that I can\u2019t complete it ahead of time. (Which is what I will end up doing.) However, fundamentally, I do not feel that professors should have deadlines or exams/quizzes assigned to dates where their university is actually fully closed. \n\nSome would argue that even having deadlines over a \u201cbreak\u201d in general isn\u2019t wonderful, but official closures when both staff and faculty are also off, is a no go for me. \n\nCall me \u201csalty,\u201d but this type of thing has happened to me multiple times now, and I\u2019m a bit frustrated. (Maybe it\u2019s just 2020 grinding down on my nerves... but .... as a grad student, I\u2019m already going to be in the lab working during these few days off. It\u2019d just be nice to be able to get a break from class work when there isn\u2019t supposed to be, you know, class.) \n\nEnd rant.", "author": "BiologyPhDHopeful", "created": 1605899973, "retrieved": 1632845836, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 402, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"gd4ilnz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jxvj54/professors_should_not_be_allowed_to_mandate_exams/gd4ilnz/", "text": "\u79c1\u306f\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u8003\u3048\u306b\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u540c\u610f\u3057\u307e\u3059", "author": "RedFlutterMao", "created": 1605999850, "upvotes": 1}, "gd33i8u": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jxvj54/professors_should_not_be_allowed_to_mandate_exams/gd33i8u/", "text": "Yeah like what's the difference between having it due right before or on the holiday?
