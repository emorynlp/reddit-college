  "title:": "Professors should not be allowed to mandate exams or significant assignment deadlines on a university holiday - fight me.",
  "text": "A bit of an odd topic, but for the 6th year in a row (out of 9 in higher education), a professor for one of my classes has set a major project deadline during next week\u2019s university holiday.\n\nOur university is fully closed (not just class \u201cbreak\u201d) on Thursday and Friday to observe the holidays. I have a full semester-long project due on that very Friday. \n\nNow, I am not arguing that I can\u2019t complete it ahead of time. (Which is what I will end up doing.) However, fundamentally, I do not feel that professors should have deadlines or exams/quizzes assigned to dates where their university is actually fully closed. \n\nSome would argue that even having deadlines over a \u201cbreak\u201d in general isn\u2019t wonderful, but official closures when both staff and faculty are also off, is a no go for me. \n\nCall me \u201csalty,\u201d but this type of thing has happened to me multiple times now, and I\u2019m a bit frustrated. (Maybe it\u2019s just 2020 grinding down on my nerves... but .... as a grad student, I\u2019m already going to be in the lab working during these few days off. It\u2019d just be nice to be able to get a break from class work when there isn\u2019t supposed to be, you know, class.) \n\nEnd rant.",

If we don't expect professors or staff to do any work over the holidays (if they decide to do any work, its up to them), then we shouldn't expect students to be trying to meet a deadline on a university holiday.

          "text": "I accidentally did this this term. Forgot when fall reading week was as I teach at two different institutions. The admin assistant kicked my syllabus back to me and said \"we just ask you don't make anything due over reading week\" and I was like ohhhhh riiiiiight\n\nAlso, if my students pointed it out, I would absolutely change it. Immediately. To something after that date. \n\nJust...everyone should try to make things as easy as possible. Why are professors doing this? Why would anyone do anything to make anyone's life harder? Even when there *isn't* a pandemic? It makes no sense to me.",

If we complain, the prof just shrugs and says to hand it in the Friday before reading week starts. I have taken exams on Easter Sunday before because only the Monday is a reserved holiday. \nI really hope that when/if I become a prof, I dont forget how shitty this is",

                  "text": "You can definitely make something due immediately after reading week. I mean, traditionally, the purpose is to use that week to catch up without the burden of classes. I don't know when it became a reason to go to Cuba for a week. When there isn't a pandemic, of course.\n\nI usually try to avoid doing that, nonetheless. Tests are always before and papers I try to keep a couple of weeks away from it. But often we don't really have a choice but to imply that, yeah, unfortunately, you may need to do some work. A week, especially in a half year course, is a lot of time and usually the learning objectives are already crammed. Time is a previous commodity when making a course syllabus.",

It wasn't a hard project, or one that required much. It did require everyone to present, everyone knew about it but she forgot to remind us. Come back from break, and she sits in the back of the class and we were all confused. Everyone forgot to do the project. Not one person.",
