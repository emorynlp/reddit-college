  "title:": "Landing an English TA position with a 2.89 GPA for undergrad?",
  "text": "My dream is to get my PhD and be a literature/creative writing professor, and I\u2019ve received a lot of high praise and encouragement in undergrad, some of which are on the graduate admissions board for my old university. The only problem is, my GPA doesn\u2019t accurately reflect my ability. I missed class a lot, forgot to turn in assignments, but whatever I did do usually got pretty high marks, I just wasn\u2019t a diligent student. I am starting to think this has been due to undiagnosed ADHD, and I\u2019m currently trying to get evaluated, so treatment and medication might help this a lot. I also kinda screwed myself over by forgetting to submit the paperwork for the few repeats I did, so my old failing grades are brining my GPA down.\n\nI\u2019ve also been struggling to find employment since graduating, so landing a TA position is very important to me. I need the work experience and the income. I\u2019m just worried that my GPA will hold me back. What\u2019s the likelihood I\u2019m able to be admitted and get awarded a TA position with a 2.89? Is there anything I can do to increase my chances, or is it pretty much hopeless?",

Most English departments see those as separate areas in terms of admissions for grad school. Then, to be a professor, you are most likely going to have to focus more exclusively on one or the other to achieve tenure.\n\nIf literature, American Lit? British Lit? Medievalism? Knowing that will help you to choose between programs, and also show that you have some kind of focus for graduate school work when writing a personal statement.\n\nSame with creative writing. What genre(s)? Most creative writers will be pitching themselves in their personal statement for one or two genres primarily. Not all genres. \n\nAnd to apply for a creative writing graduate school, you're going to have to have a very good portfolio of creative writing. Typically it would mainly be focused on the genres that you are saying you want to pursue.\n\nSo figuring all of this out would be the first step before you can think about applying for programs.",

This is totally not my wheelhouse so check in on that but I think that some professional experience in the field would benefit you greatly, in terms of navigating grad school, your field's expectations and \"how stuff works\" and finding a job after you graduate. You mentioned having a hard time finding a job and tbh I don't think a PhD in English/MFA in creative writing is going to inherently solve that issue in a few years. That's not to say that those are unemployable degrees but you need to know what you're getting into and how you plan to market yourself post-grad, so you can choose the right classes, work on the right skills, etc. Best of luck!",

Depends on the individual on which programs they get into.\n\n>This is totally not my wheelhouse so check in on that but I think that some professional experience in the field would benefit you greatly,\n\nYou probably want to reply to the original poster directly.

      "text": "Try working for a few years in a related field. You can also take courses at a local community college to show the adcomms that you can excel inside the classroom while doing other things to boost up your applications. Why do you want a PhD? What are some extracurriculars you do outside of school to get into the field? Worrying about the TA comes second after getting into programs. I would worry about boosting your profile in general! Good luck!",
