  "text": "Dear r/gradschool :\n\nBy this point in the semester, I know you\u2019re all feeling beaten down and ready to quit, which is exactly why I feel the need to write this letter to you all. \n\nI am, truly, the \u201cdumbest\u201d person in my program. I come from the lowest ranking university, I routinely score the lowest grade in the class, and I have the lowest GPA of my classmates. This is a fact of my life; one that has taken me years to feel comfortable with. But now that I\u2019m in my 3rd year of grad school, here is what I have learned:\n\n1. \u201cDumb\u201d is relative. I\u2019m the dumbest in a room full of people trying to get a PhD, I can live with that. \n\n2. \u201cDumb\u201d does NOT mean worthless. Your worth is rooted in who you *are*, not what you accomplish. \n\n3. Being charming and pleasant goes SUCH a long way. I\u2019m an American woman in a STEM department made up of men from China. They care about intelligence, and are pretty open about not liking Americans. And even I have found a way to get by, mainly by being charming. \n\n4. Own where you rank. Dont walk around like you know all the answers, because you don\u2019t. Nobody expects you to, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in school. \n\n5. Some professors will wish you were smarter. That\u2019s their problem, not yours. If they are unhappy with how much you know, it is literally their job as a professor to help you. \n\n6. Somebody has to be the lowest rank in your program. That\u2019s just a fact of life.\n\n7. \u201cThis person knows more than me\u201d is NOT the same as \u201cI should know more things than I currently do.\u201d Somebody being smarter than you doesn\u2019t take away from the stuff that you *do* know and *are* good at. \n\n8. You deserve a life outside of school. You\u2019re in grad school. It\u2019s ridiculous to punish yourself by never giving yourself a break because of how \u201cdumb\u201d you think you are. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for the things you think you lack. \n\n9. You don\u2019t owe your professors anything except what you\u2019re capable of. Your department saw your transcript. They knew who they were getting when they admitted you. You cannot be anything other than yourself, and if they don\u2019t like you, that\u2019s on *them* for choosing you.\n\n10. You know what they call the dumbest person to graduate with a phd? Doctor. \n\nAnyway, it really is going to be okay. And to my fellow dummies out there, stay strong! We\u2019re halfway through the semester!",

      "text": "This resonated strongly for me as well. White female in an Asian male dominated field. For a very long time I thought I wasn\u2019t that smart, I just worked hard. Now that I\u2019ve been out of my PhD for over a decade and worked in industry, I realize that there are a lot of ways to be smart. \n\n1. You don\u2019t need to know everything. Understanding and accepting that earlier in your career means you can be honest about your weaknesses AND your strengths. I now build highly functional and productive teams of scientists, which necessarily requires understanding strengths and weaknesses and creating balances. When people are honest about themselves, this is much easier. Remember: Individuals don\u2019t move products to market, teams do.\n\n2. Emotional intelligence, being able to read the room and get people to like you, is so much more important than being the best at something scientific. There will always be someone that knows more than you. HIRE THEM. You rise in industry with the EQ, you are \u201cstuck\u201d in the lab when you cling too much to your scientific expertise. Learn how to socialize. Learn how to be \u201cinfluential\u201d (which really just means when people like you, they listen to your opinions).\n\nI have so much more I could say on this topic. Just know that your future in industry is being solidified by the ways in which you practice socializing now. Good luck!",

          "text": "Be confident. Be fun. Look good. \n\nNow, I can\u2019t tell you how exactly to do those things, but here is what works for me:\n\n- DRESS WELL. I actually kind of hate the idea that what you wear shouldn\u2019t matter. Because I think it should. Now, I understand that dressing nice isn\u2019t an indicator of who somebody is as a person or what they\u2019re capable of. But honestly if enjoys the experience of looking at you, they\u2019re more willing to talk to you. The saying should go \u201cdon\u2019t *only* judge a book by it\u2019s cover.\u201d Because if the cover has awesome cover art, I\u2019m more inclined to read check it out. And if after a second look the book sucks, then I\u2019ll move on. But when you\u2019re like me, and you can\u2019t lure people in with your brain only, then looking good is helpful. \n\n- being fun does NOT mean being loud or obnoxious. It doesn\u2019t mean being ditzy. It doesn\u2019t mean being overtly *anything.* when I say be fun, I mean be lighthearted. You don\u2019t only have to talk about school. When somebody asks you a non school question, give a real, candid answer. Example: \n\nMy advisor: so what\u2019s new in your life?\n\nMe: I\u2019ve decided to listen to the advice of every hairdresser I know and stop washing my hair every day, and honestly it\u2019s amazing. my hair is so soft. \n\nnow, if I were worried about her thinking I\u2019m dumb, or if I wanted to keep things super formal, I would have launched straight in to research related stuff. So if your advisor asks what\u2019s new, really tell them. \n\nALSO at holiday parties, when professors bring their families, TALK TO THE FAMILIES. Everybody else is talking to each other. You really stand out to a professor if their spouse can\u2019t stop talking about how great you are. \n\n- being confident: this one is harder. I try to have go-tos when I\u2019m striking up conversation with people. I\u2019ve decided that when I feel uneasy and need to bring the tension in a room down, I give a compliment. Like \u201cwow I love your shoes\u201d or \u201cyour hair looks amazing like that.\u201d \n\nhonestly though, the better I dress, the more confident I am. Am the more confident I am, the easier it is to be fun and personal. And for me, the root of the confidence was when I started dressing well. I felt good about myself. I knew I was the best dressed in the room.\n\nAnd being well dressed is easy \u2014 look at the clothes you have, and look online for how other people would style that. So something with your hair And bam. Instant confidence boost. \n\nPutting all those things together, people like me and like working with me because they enjoy my company. And in academia, especially in a stem field with notoriously difficult people, this goes a long way",

We shouldn\u2019t waste our time trying to sugar coat our knowledge and talents so men find us \u201cpleasant\u201d to work with.\n\nThe nuance in all of this lies in our working definitions of what it means to be \u201cpleasant\u201d or \u201cdifficult\u201d - those terms, to me, are entrenched in misogyny because they are often used to describe women who don\u2019t fit the 1950s mold of how women should behave.\n\nI\u2019m not purposefully charming and I don\u2019t go out of my way to modify my behavior to appear more pleasant (hello anxiety producing task) - that doesn\u2019t make me an asshole or difficult to work with. I care about my colleagues and know how they wish to be communicated and we\u2019re very transparent about what works/doesn\u2019t work when it comes to our modes of communication.",

I literally run analyses on tests of cognitive abilities like language learning, intelligence, perspective taking, etc, so I know full well I perform below a lot of our test subjects who are comparable to me in age and education status.

There's so much to be said for people wanting to work with you.\n\nGetting things done in the world requires acknowledging others, collaborating, pulling your own weight.\n\nThinking you know it already is the biggest barrier to new learning too.\n\nKeep doing what works for you and define your own success!\n\nEdit:typo",

              "text": "The pressure to perform is intense and the expectations are very high. The more that you\u2019ve performed in the past the more that you\u2019re expected to perform in the future. My program had 75 applications for two spots, the other one in my cohort dropped out. So there\u2019s really no one like me in any of my classes. I also won a very difficult to get national scholarship that has catapulted the expectations on me. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t find my program particularly difficult and I am occasionally mystified by people that do. It\u2019s not fair but that\u2019s the reality of my experience. I frequently question how this is the case considering I have ADHD and am, supposedly, learning disabled (in reality I got two degrees before my diagnosis). \n\nThere are serious social ramifications for being the obvious talented guy in class. I\u2019m ostracized by classmates that are more normal. Friendships within the classes are pretty much a no go, it took a semester but I\u2019m over it now. In my undergrad degrees I made lots of friends but when you\u2019re in a classroom and running circles around PhD candidates they tend not to be pleased that they\u2019re being shown up. However, I\u2019m embraced by my lab mates and by other high fliers who know the feeling. It\u2019s a serious double edged sword and it can be very painful sometimes. \n\nOn the other hand, things just happen for me. Professors will cut me slack that they wouldn\u2019t give others. Classes that are firmly \u201cclosed\u201d will have a spot for me if I I ask. Papers that are, honestly, just okay will get an A+ when they are probably an A or A- (this might be more me being overcritical of myself, the other student work I\u2019ve seen is horrifyingly bad - from PhD level authors). Chairs of departments will offer me spots on committees that are otherwise elected positions. I\u2019ve already been told that I have a spot waiting for me at the PhD level, fully funded. Classmates are also somewhat aware that this is happening and get frustrated by it for sure. \n\nSo the saying that it\u2019s lonely at the top is true. I used to try to hide who I am but I\u2019ve given up since that was more painful than just dealing with people who are distant because of envy. Oh and being gay doesn\u2019t help either \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, especially in a school with a lot of international students. Every blessing is a curse.",

As much as my post sounds a little unaware (apparently) I\u2019m actually very good at understanding the motivations of the people around me. My background was in psychology and I was a teacher for 5 years, I\u2019m a pretty pro-social guy. That\u2019s part of the problem, when I figured out who was just trying to use me and then who was just weirded out by me, there wasn\u2019t anyone left. \n\nI mean grad school is smallish classes, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to find many people who are either equally as quick or who are willing to overlook our differences and work with me anyway. In undergrad, the classes were usually bigger so in each class I could usually find one other really hard working and quick person that was willing to work with me and had their own incredible skills to apply to the problem as well. I made so many friends in undergrad, at the Grad level the competition makes it no fun to be the guy that\u2019s getting the scholarship. Everyone just gets upset. In undergrad it was almost always my best buddy in the class and I competing for the one A+ available, it was fun, we always had fun with it and I was always happy (if jokingly jealous) if they beat me... mostly because it meant in owed them a beer. \n\nIn the lab, where there is very little competition, I get along with everyone. We\u2019re all brilliant in our own ways and the conversations are incredible. We\u2019re all bright minds working through problems, some of us are better at different aspects of the research so we rely on each other for our different skills. My usefulness comes from defending the minority view, being the voice of the perspective of teachers, and having the most wacky-weird-wait-that-might-work ideas. I\u2019m the guy that processes really fast (thanks ADHD) and thinks laterally naturally BUT is horrific at details, maintaining focus, and project management (THANKS ADHD - \ud83e\udd2c).\n\nThis is why I say everyone brings valuable resources to the table. At the grad school level we\u2019re working our brains to their limits, we discover really quickly what we are and aren\u2019t good at. What I suck at my lab mates are more than happy to pick up because I add value to our collective work in other ways.",

I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t suitably softened to make you feel sufficiently good about yourself. \n\nWas it the part where I discovered I have ADHD, that I\u2019m off putting to people because of my intellect, that I suffered horrible anxiety and ended up in therapy because I felt excluded. Precisely what was \u201cfull of myself\u201d? \n\nI\u2019m sorry my tale doesn\u2019t include me completely falling apart because I couldn\u2019t take the stress of my program. Maybe you\u2019d be more interested if you knew, as I mentioned in other posts, that my first degree was a B+ average at best, does that make me sufficiently humble enough for you? Or that my ADHD makes my life quite difficult sometimes but that I endeavour to look on the bright side (such as that my bizarre thinking makes me come up with ideas that are different enough to be valuable). Or that I literally broke my body due to anxiety in my second degree by tensing muscles; so much so that they are permanently damaged now(A+ average by the way, does that make me arrogant?! I practically killed myself fighting my ADHD to get that grade so I could have what I have now - I worked like hell yeah I\u2019m fucking proud of my achievements). Am I sufficiently humbled now for you? Should I continue tearing my shirt in contrition? Last I checked, that wasn\u2019t the question but enjoy the rest of the context. \n\nQuite frankly, the fact that I am a beloved and cherished member of my lab (which, thanks to a thanksgiving exercise in our last meeting, I actually have textual and audio proof of \u2014 hilariously), that my supervisor is pre-approving me into the PhD program because I did such a good job integrating myself and having something to contribute, that after a year of living in a totally new city I have a diverse set of friends who love me (and who I am meeting later for Turkey, which we can do because we\u2019ve been bubbled up since the beginning of this nightmare): these things speak volumes about who I am. \n\nThat the only thing you had to contribute was something hurtful speaks volumes about you. \n\nHappy thanksgiving.",

Many of the big brighter people you see are actually just incredibly persistent. Intelligence is important, but the ability to just keep poking and prodding until you can make things work is way more important for acceptance into research based programs. Good luck with apps.",

          "text": "I feel exactly the same way. It got better at the end but a lot of my undergrad was me just trying to get through it mentally. Plus my major was only recently offered for undergrads at my uni, and it was an absolute mess. I definitely don\u2019t feel like I was prepared for my field. Now I\u2019m going a different route, and I have experience in the field I want, but I still always have that feeling of not being prepared or enough. Writing my application essays has been like pulling teeth, I hate even looking at it.",
