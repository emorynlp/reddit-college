Lots of comments are saying that he needs to be told off or a talking to or that you should have a good come back. What this RA needs is to be reported to HR and your and his superiors, and subsequently removed from the field and disgraced for their sexist behavior. \n\nReporting someone for sexual harassment can feel harsh and heavy because it people\u2019s careers and reputations can be ruined as a result of this. However it is important to keep in mind that it is not the accuser or the report of sexual assault/harassment that stops someone\u2019s career. It is their behavior, their repeated harassment that ruins their career. This jackass has set themself up for failure, and remaining silent is just protecting him at the cost of your and your female colleagues\u2019s comfort, productivity, career advancement, and respect. \n\nPlease report him. A major role model for me in my field is Kathleen Treseder. Please look her up and read about her experience with sexual harassment.
