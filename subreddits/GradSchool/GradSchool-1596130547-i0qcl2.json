You earned the title no matter what anyone says, and you deserve to be called Doctor. Don't overthink things. You did it.

(Believe me, they (we) all made a ton of mistakes in grad school, in research, in teaching, and in academic \"social\" relations. So don't fret any of that by any means.)\n\nCelebrate well. Get together with family and friends (safely, of course) and make it a night to remember. \n\nAgain, hearty congratulations.
