I graduated recently and told her about what has happened since I graduated and how things are going now. \n\nShe responded with a very very short reply and didn't really say much about how she has been doing. Only that I will do great in school... Literarily 3 sentences...\n\nNot sure if that's just the case because she is busy or what... but kinda hurts when you respected a professor so much and she just kinda writes you an unmeaningful response like that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I expecting too much?

I respected one of my undergrad professors an unimaginable about. He was a lot of what I wanted to become. He was the first and last professor I ever wrote a thank you note to at the end of the semester my senior year. A month or two later I asked for his advice on selecting between two programs, detailing exactly what I want to do later in life (career wise) and the pros and cons of each program. He replied with a short, (I\u2019m paraphrasing here) \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have much knowledge of those programs.\u201d This dude is the head of the Analytics program and he doesn\u2019t know anything about Data Science or Comp. Sci.? Like hell, dude, the least you could do if give your opinion on which program would be more beneficial for my career. I didn\u2019t expect a lengthy response or anything.
