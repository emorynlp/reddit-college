Essentially, search for stuff you already know something about, and come to your zoom interviews PREPARED with a presentation to showcase the fact that you do, indeed, know what you're talking about. \n\nI defend on the 6th, and have a job already lined up for January 3. My thesis defense is going to be a nightmare, but I'm so ready to be done. Congratulations to you!",
