      "text": "Such a general question that it's practically impossible to offer any specific advice. As within different scientific disciplines, there can be different disciplinary conventions for writing scientific papers.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the genre of the discipline you're writing in, a good strategy is to look at some recent papers from the last 15 to 20 years that are doing something similar to what you want to do, and see how they're doing that.\n\nThere is a video and handouts that may help you here at the Purdue OWL. Particularly, the questions for genre analysis PDF  may assist you\n\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/graduate_writing/thesis_and_dissertation/genre_analysis_reverse_outline.html",

              "text": "I write about writing and do a lot of academic editing, one of the broad pieces of advice I often emphasize is to write like your are writing to wise morons; an audience that knows everything about your field, but nothing about your topic. This audience doesn\u2019t exist - but it will challenge you to include additional analytic signposts and handholds to clarify your argument. \n\nOften times writers have spent considerable time staring into the candle and find the edges blurring as they lose sight of the bigger picture. \n\nRemember to include previews and reviews and aspire to follow a structure that ensures each paragraph completes at least five tasks; 1) introducing the topic sentence, 2) developing the claim, 3) providing data to substantiate the argument, 4) explaining the reason that evidence is sufficient to substantiate the claim, and 5) transitioning to the next idea.",
