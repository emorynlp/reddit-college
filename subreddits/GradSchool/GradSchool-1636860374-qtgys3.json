  "text": "I'm in my last year of an engineering MS program.  One of my professors is actually the department chair and he hosts a weekly seminar that I attend which covers topics relevant to a field that I really want to go into after I graduate.  He has said that if anyone wants to get involved in said field that I should reach out to him.  Sounds like a no-brainer, but I'm completely freaking out about it.  \n\nFirst, I don't actually know what it is specifically I want to ask him.  It's something along the lines of wanting to know what kind of groups or projects I can involve myself with to help me get into that field after graduation, what opportunities are available to me, and so on.  The thing is, that's what the weekly seminar has been covering; there are actually so many projects and opportunities that I scarcely know where to begin.  I feel like I should be researching these things for myself so I have a better idea of what specifically to ask but I don't even know where to start there.\n\nAny suggestions?",

      "text": "It's great that you have this opportunity to attend such a relevant seminar! Researching these topics for yourself is a good place to start if you're unsure which direction to go. You could even just rank the topics/projects that have been presented already. However, if specific projects from the seminar already stuck out to you, it sounds like this professor might welcome a simple email saying, \"I got excited learning about topics XYZ in your seminar and would love to learn more about getting involved!\" Whatever your choice, this professor is inviting students like you to explore these topics so I imagine your enthusiasm will more than welcome.",

      "text": "He was vague when he presented the opportunity, which is really common for experienced people. He's not thinking about how newbies will have no idea what \"involved\" means.\n\nProbably he means that there are opportunities to do research on many of these projects, and he can help get you started on that. This might mean forwarding your email to the PI of your project of interest, and that PI will chat with you and see if you're a good match to work together. If so, the PI will tell you what background reading to do to get up to speed, and ultimately assign you minor tasks that help the project.\n\nIt's ok to mention in your email to the chair that you're not totally sure what getting involved would entail. If he has time, he would be wise to sit down and chat with you to clarify the process and help explore your interests before sending you to any one PI.",
