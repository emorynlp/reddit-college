      "text": "I think it depends. When you say \"coauthor\", do you mean that you will be included on the title of the book as an author? Like \"Fundamentals of Pickle Picking by Gherkin and Dill\"?\n\nIf so, then yes, I think that would help your application if the program you are applying to is one that focuses on writing. For research-based programs, textbooks and textbook chapters are not as beneficial as publications or empirical work, though. But having something is better than not having anything. I personally have never heard of a textbook that was coauthored with an undergrad student, but maybe it happens and I'm not aware of it. \n\nIf \"coauthor\" means that you will help with the writing, but will either get an acknowledgement or a brief mention rather than actual authorship, it still might be a good idea to do it but not if it involves so much work that it distracts you from other application-boosting endeavors. It could at least provide a writing sample, assuming this is something your desired program asks for as part of your application.",

      "text": "Yes because you would be providing a writing sample to many universities, coauthoring a book could be a pivotal sample that'll boost your application. Additionally, that same professor could write a recommendation letter for you, usually you'd need 2-3 with mostly 2 recommendations for an MA and 3 for PhD, you should definitely ask your professor for a recommendation letter as well.",
