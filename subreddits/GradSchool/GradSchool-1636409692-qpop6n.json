  "text": "My transcript is all over the place, I never knew what I wanted to do so I took a class in just about everything. I ended up in undergrad for 5 years and a GPA of 3.1. I graduated in 2012 so I'm returning after working for a decade. Should I mention this in my SOP? The minimum requirement is 2.5 for the program but it's very competitive.",

      "text": "No\n\nI would explain the transcript but not make excuses for or negatively address the GPA. You taking an eclectic mix of classes and trying new things in undergrad seems like an asset, and your time off since deciding to go back to school is so much more meaningful on an application than your GPA. Focus on the positive assets you bring to your application and don\u2019t make excuses for the negatives.",

      "text": "Yes! If there's a mitigating/extenuating circumstances section on the application, even better.\n\nI explained that as an undergrad, I got completely drunk on opportunity, overextended myself, and fucked up a lot of things. I found work that I enjoyed and increased my responsibility over the next ten years. I also did some post-bacc night school in my late 20s, which let me demonstrate that I could handle academic responsibilities now.\n\nAs long as you can give a compelling explanation for how you've grown and improved and why you're ready for school now, you should be fine.",
