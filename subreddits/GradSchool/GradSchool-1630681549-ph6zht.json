To be honest, I was extremely afraid when the delta variant started running rampant but everyone in my lab diligently wears a mask, is vaccinated, takes the pandemic seriously and everyone respects social distancing as much as possible. I also reached out to my graduate advisor (I'm a 2nd year) who genuinely listened to my fears and allowed me to take only research hours this semester instead of classes so I have been considerably less anxious. I also now solely wear KN95's indoors from a refutable source.\n\nI think if your PI could enforce masks in the lab that'll make you feel a bit better. Could you reopen that conversation with them and see what they can do to help?\n\n\\*Edit: I forgot to answer your question smh. I definitely debated quitting during the summer but thankfully my PI and graduate advisor are very likeminded and really care about making me feel comfortable. So I feel safe enough to continue.", "author": "saoriix", "created": 1630682646, "upvotes": 5}}}
