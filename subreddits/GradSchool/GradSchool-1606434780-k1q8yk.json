I cut out coffee cold turkey with few headaches. My productivity nose dived. I realized that I had to make real change in my life. Now I write every morning for an hour and do as little administrative work as possible (grading) after that.I am back to drinking coffee but my blood pressure is down and I don\u2019t think about work when I\u2019m not working nearly as much as I used to. I was addicted to being busy through coffee, but not actually accomplishing much. Now that first coffee of the day drives writing, and then I put it down.",

I cut down half of my scoops with 1/2 caffeine coffee and it took a week to stop being aggressive and angry at everything from withdrawal. Because of how bad that week was mentally I sat there for a month or two. Did the same thing, gradually decreasing my intake by 1 scoop of 1/2 decaff, finally switching to 50%decaff/50% half caff, just to keep my routine. With every dose change the first week was hell, I was going through withdrawal, and my blood pressure was dipping and going crazy at some points. Once I finally cut to a reasonable 2 cups a day max I was sleeping better, able to focus normally and have a cohesive thought,  and no longer having intense mood swings. It took a huge toll on me, changed my personality for a bit, and I do not recommend to anyone to drink that much caffeine.",
