  "text": "I'm looking for an app that can be synched across an iPad and Android phone, and ideally with my Windows computer as well. I use Google Calendar for general meetings (professional and personal life), classes, sports, everything that can be planned in a certain time period on a certain day. I'm lacking a good app for deadlines, class preparation, exam, prep for the class I TA, etc.\n\nWhat are you using to keep up to date with meetings and deadlines in both your professional and personal life?",
