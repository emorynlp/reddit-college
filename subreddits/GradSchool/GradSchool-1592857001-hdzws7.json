The last 4 months have consisted almost exclusively of thesis work. I was almost certain I was going to fail since the only contact I've had with my advisor was 2 years ago when he did my intake procedure. I didn't know if what I was doing was correct in any way, but figured I would get some pointers if I failed my defense. I'm the kind of persons who doesn't like to ask for help. \n\nI haven't been able to eat or concentrate on anything in the last 24 hours because of stress, and 15 minutes before my presentation I completely broke down and had a panic attack. My girlfriend luckily was able to calm me down and I was able to start my presentation on time, albeit with a trembling voice.\n\nAfter my presentation it was time for questions by the committee. After being able to answer all their questions in a manner that surprised even myself, they retreated for a few minutes to discuss my defense. Longest minutes of my life...\n\nThey called me back, and said the words I've been dreaming of for 2 years: \"congratulations\"!  \nMy advisor told me that they were quite impressed by my thesis and that I clearly had a good grasp on the matter. They even asked me to consider adjusting my thesis for publication in some journals and to consider working together in the future. I couldn't be more happy!\n\nDuring these last few years, reading success stories in this sub gave me so much motivation. I'm glad I'm finally able to share my own success story with you guys!", "author": "Gundosao", "created": 1592857001, "retrieved": 1632953731, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 473, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fvqpfe2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hdzws7/successfully_defended_today_best_feeling_ever/fvqpfe2/", "text": "Advisor doesn\u2019t have contact with you for 2 years, then suggests you work together in the future.
