      "text": "I'd just use the same page! I've occasionally seen profs rated for grad school courses, it's just that undergrad courses tend to have 100s of students and it seems like only about 1% of students rate their profs. Also in grad school if its a mandatory course its not like you get to pick your professor for the one course being offered. But I'll still check ratemyprofessor (or ask classmates) if a professor I don't know is teaching an elective I'm considering taking. So long story short I'm sure everyone will appreciate your warning on ratemyprofessor.",

Now she\u2019s being super passive aggressive in her videos to us (it\u2019s online)",
