I'm in my fifth year.", "text": "The title is the summary. I'm a fifth year graduate student working in a STEM field. Last week my advisor told me that the project I had been working on for the past 9 months needed someone with a different skillset and background than what I have. Also, that there were no other projects in the lab I can work on because of my academic background.\n\nThe surreal thing is....I'm not surprised.\n\nI've seen this coming from the start of 2021. For the past 9 months she has been mentally abusive to me. On the weekends, I would receive short story emails about how bad of a student I was. Small mistakes got amplified and held over my head for months. I would get scolded for defending myself if there was something about my data or reports that she didn't like.  I am not allowed to explain why I did something a certain way if she didn't like the way it was done. She offered little to know help on my preliminary examination last spring making me lean heavily on my labmates and other doctoral students. My exam came and went and I didn't pass. My advisor cited issues that were not part of my examination and how terrible the exam was. My retake is in October, Last week, early September, she decided to kick me out. Wouldn't even allow me to retake it.\n\nI've talked to the head of my department. I was told to not take things personally because she has a bad reputation and I should of known this when I joined her lab. The department head knows everyone in her lab is unhappy and that is common for 3 or 4 graduates students to want to transfer labs at all times. I talked to one of my committee members to explain the situation. They thought I did great on my preliminary examination and all I was being asked to do was re-write my introduction and  fixe the format of my proposal. After speaking with my committee member, it is clear that I was being gas lit on how bad the examination went.\n\nI'm just terrified. I don't want to master out but I don't want to start all over again. I was real close to the finish line and had it striped away from me. I'm not a bad grad student. I have a 3.9+  GPA, passed my qualifying exam on my first attempt and have a first author and co-author paper currently in review. However, I will admit that my progress on my second project has been slower than I wanted, but it's not like I'm not progressing on it.\n\nThe problem is, my department head is right. Everyone in my lab has sever issues with her. Lab alumni have issues with her. Other professors have issues with her. She's done to other graduate students what she's done to me. Everyone in my lab is terrified right now. If it can happen to me, then why can't it happen to them. I've had tremendous amounts of support from my labmates and other professors. I just don't understand how she is able to continue to have students with the way she treats her students isn't a secret within the department.\n\nI don't really know how to end this.

Many students who left the group had to switch to either another subfield, or an entirely different field in order to graduate, and many of them end up taking \\~10 years for their PhD. The wasted years were all because of her. I despise the fact that shitty PI like yours are so prevalent, yet nothing substantial is done to curb their behavior.

New prof was not abusive or unempathetic to grad students' work life balance, mental health etc.\n2. The new prof encouraged her to pursue a short project (which they both plan to complete in a year and get her to graduate.)\n3. Prof has a lot of industrial connections which she promised to help my cousin with as she completed her work (not something my cousin actively looked for but was a pleasant surprise).\n4. Future relationships and LORs - this was a point that stuck with me/haunts me.
