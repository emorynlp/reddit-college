However, I\u2019m having major second thoughts about traveling and attending a big gathering (even an academic one) like this especially with the pandemic still raging. \n\nWould attending be worth the risk?",

I know the conference I was scheduled to present at was changed to an online format last month. \n\nIt's honestly your decision on whether you want to go. Perhaps you could discuss it with an advisor or doctor. Could you look at infection rates in Paris? It may help you make a decision",
