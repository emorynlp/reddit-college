  "text": "I read the post linked on the sidebar about getting into grad school with a low GPA (I got a 3.27 overall at my 4-year) and I have some questions (but couldn't ask them there because the thread is obviously dead).\n\nThe poster mentions that the guide applies both to PhD and Masters programs so long as they are research-focused. But the poster also says that a student may need to take out loans to get more research experience if they don't have enough to apply.\n\nI have NO IDEA what this means. As a 4-year graduate, how would I use my OWN MONEY to do research??? Is the poster referring to doing a master's program using out-of-pocket money, getting research experience there, and then applying for a PhD after the fact?\n\nThe poster also says that if you have poor grades (B or worse) in core classes, you must take graudate-level courses and succeed in them to prove you're worthy. Again, how would I do this without first completing a master's program? I am in this boat with a few classes, and would like to remedy this but not sure how to do it now that I've already graduated. I don't know if I even could have taken graduate level courses as an undergrad - I went to a UC so policies were pretty strict.\n\nFinally, is there a clear separation between professional and research master's programs, or is it more of a spectrum? What's the best way to quickly tell how much research experience you might get in a particular program? If I got into a master's, for example, would research be baked into the curriculum or would I have to go out of my way to work under professors at the university?\n\nWhat I gathered from the post is that the best option for someone like me (mediocre grades, no research experience) is to try to get into a master's program and absolutely kill it once I get in. Also, try to annihilate the GRE to make up for my grades. Does this sound about right?\n\nThanks so much in advance to anyone that responds. I'm a first-gen college student so all of this academia stuff is really confusing to me. I'm not close with ANYONE that has been to grad school so I have no one to ask these questions to.",
