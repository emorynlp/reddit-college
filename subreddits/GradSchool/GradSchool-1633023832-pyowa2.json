  "text": "Hello, someone, please help ease my mind.\n\nI am currently a **junior**. I went from a **neuroscience major to psychology major/neuroscience minor** after **withdrawing from OChem 2**. I am aspiring to be one of two things: a **PA or a clinical psychologist**. I understand that these are both competitive fields. My academics up to this point have been sub-par (**3.4 oGPA, 3.0 sGPA**), but I have made substantial changes to my lifestyle and I am now **confident in my ability to perform academically from here on out.** I want to be a competitive applicant to both of these programs, but I need guidance. I have **no research, internship, or medical experience so far**. I am **NREMT certified** but still in the process of using my certification. What advice do you have for someone in my position?",
