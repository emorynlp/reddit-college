I went into knowing almost nothing about the technology or the software. Plus I got surprise funding in the form of a GRA position which I am totally grateful for but again- if it had been a job that I'd filled out an application for and interviewed I never would have gotten it. Its like arriving in a new country having only read about it and trying to live there immersing yourself in the language and culture.\n\nSo I got really behind and I'm working through the thanksgiving holiday to try and catch up. I've learned hard lessons about time and stress management (don't neglect self-care!). The thing is trying to live in this space and remembering we belong here. I'll tell you exactly like my advisors and people who have helped me said- If you didn't belong, no one would have written those recommendation letters, encouraged you when you though about leaving, and are rooting for you., like you said. I mean also only you know what you're feeling and can decide what to do, but hang in there. Thats the thing about this field to get that job we need to get through at least an MA. Is that what you are doing or you in a phd program? What is your focus?\n\nStick with it, you deserve and an Anthro 4 life!",

In a strange way, even though I wish we didn\u2019t all struggle like this, it does make me feel less alone. I\u2019ve felt too much like a \u201cbad phd\u201d student over the years, and I\u2019ve said that about myself when people ask me about my degree. It\u2019s not a bad thing to recognize our options, in fact, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not specific to doctoral studies, I\u2019m sure people on all career paths think like this as well.",

Sure long hours but a promise of more money to come and I loved my field. Stresses? Sure. Complaints, sure. But the reward is so much better than failure.",
