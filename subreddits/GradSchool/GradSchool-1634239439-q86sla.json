  "text": "I don't know what to do. I've experienced a tragic event this week. I should not talk about it online because it's a subject of active criminal investigation.\n\nI don't know how to handle this in the middle of the semester. I can't focus on my classes. I told my PI what is happening and she is very supportive. I have been excused from PhD stuff this week like meetings and whatnot. She said I should tell my teachers but I don't know what to tell them or even what I need from them. I'm in shock still. It seems to get worse at the reality of the event soaks into my brain.\n\nI couldn't participate at all today in a class that requires participation. I just couldn't get my thoughts together enough. I can't stop either crying or just... sitting there staring off into space. I thought I should email my teacher after class to tell them why I didn't participate but I don't know what to say. I don't feel like I can do the simplest tasks and suddenly everything is incredibly overwhelming. I didn't go to any classes this week until today and now I can't face catching up on lectures.\n\nI know the advice is to talk to my school's mental health services but I just... don't want to. I just don't want to. I have no idea what to do.\n\nIf anyone has advice, please tell me. I don't know what to do.",

      "text": "Tell your teachers exactly what you told us: \n\n\nDear XXX,\n\nI have been involved in a traumatic event this week that is part of an active police investigation. This has been quite a shock and I am currently unable to focus on my PhD coursework. I plan to continue with my PhD, but I need some time to get my bearings. My PI is aware of the situation. Can you please let me know what sort of accomodations are available to me? \n\nThank you on advance.\n\nXXXX\n\n \nObviously you don't have to use this word for word (but you can). If someone died, just tell them a close family member or friend died. \n\nYou are in shock. Crying and staring into space are normal. Needing to step back when a traumatic event happened is normal. Sending hugs your way.",

      "text": "You've experienced a traumatic life event. It seems impossibly huge and overwhelming.\n\nThat's ok. That's completely normal for the situation. Allow yourself some grace.\n\nWhat's happening might \"derail\" the next month, or the semester, of grad school. That's ok too. In the long path that will be your career, that time isn't going to matter. It sounds like your PI is being accommodating, which is great. You can figure out what the way forward looks like, assuming you're not thinking about dropping out entirely (which is also a fine and valid choice, but obviously the plan and who is involved will look much different).\n\nStart by taking some time off. Talk with friends and family you trust. Zone out to a TV show you like. Do an activity you enjoy. Order your favorite take out dishes. Find a way to best take care of yourself right now. \n\nWhen you're ready--or close to ready-- find a therapist. The school's counseling services is the easiest way to do this. They may also be able to connect you with therapists outside your school. Having someone else can help you process the event, help it seem not quite so overwhelming, and can help you figure out what actions to take.\n\nI had a tragic life event affect me when I was in grad school too (criminal case and everything). I did some weird things and had even weirder thoughts when I was trying to process it. I think I took a whole week off before I called university services to even start getting things together.\n\nYou can find your way forward, in your own time.",

It's just so awful to have this happen and have classes looming over me.\n\nWhen your tragedy happened, were you in classes? Did you drop any? I feel like I want to drop one of my classes that I was already having a really hard time in, but I'm afraid.",

              "text": "The semester had ended when it happened, so it was lucky in that regard.\n\nDefinitely explore your options re: dropping out of a class. Figure out when the drop deadline is, or what happens if you drop it late. You should be able to get information from whoever runs your program about what your options are, and any issues that may arise from dropping it. There is no shame in dropping a class, especially one that requires a lot of energy and focus you just don't have right now.\n\nIf you're not sure if you're going to drop, ask the professor about makeup work and if you can turn in some assignments late. Someone above provided a great email template for reaching out. Get the information you need to make the decision.\n\nIf you chose not to drop, make full use of office hours to get additional help. Not all professors are great with this kind of stuff, but many genuinely love to teach and will help you learn the material if you show up and put the work in.",

      "text": "Hey, without knowing much detail, it sounds like you\u2019ve experienced a serious trauma, and I am so sorry. Of course you can\u2019t focus right now! I\u2019m glad your advisor is being supportive. \n\nI can understand your hesitance to reach out to professors and explain. It sucks to keep talking about it, and you don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react. \n\nI think you may need some sort of leave or accommodations for health reasons. After having dealt with trauma myself, I realized that getting help from an expert on dealing with it is just as important as seeing a doctor if I break a bone. Mental healthcare is healthcare. \n\nI can also understand not wanting to reach out to your school\u2019s mental health services. First of all, that\u2019s a hard call to make. Sometimes it\u2019s the hardest part of getting into counseling, it\u2019s just so daunting to pick up the phone. I do think you need support here, though, so we should figure out how to get you some in a way that you are comfortable with. You don\u2019t necessarily need to even really talk much, but you should get the ball rolling on any potential accommodations. Accommodations feel like annoying paperwork, but they are there to offer you protection. \n\nDoes the counseling center have an email address you feel more comfortable using? Do you want a friend to walk you to the center in person, or sit on the phone with you while you call? I\u2019m happy to be on the phone if it makes things easier for you, just PM me and we will set up a time. I realize I\u2019m an internet stranger, but I don\u2019t want you to feel alone in this. \n\nDo you have a primary care doctor you could ask for documentation for accommodations? Does your insurance cover mental healthcare, so you can try to find someone who you feel is a good fit for you?\n\nIf you think that path is difficult or you don\u2019t know how to navigate it, I would reach out to your school\u2019s ombuds and ask what your options are. They\u2019re generally confidential and impartial, and there to advise you of your options rather than take direct action. I have had good experiences with the ombuds I\u2019ve spoken to. \n\nI\u2019m no pro at this stuff and I can\u2019t promise anything, but if you want someone to help you look into your options, let me know. It can be overwhelming, especially when you\u2019re already dealing with a life tragedy. \n\nThe next little bit of life will be taking things one step at a time. That\u2019s okay and to be expected. Be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to process it all.",

Reading your post made me tear up. And that's not even because I'm super traumatized or something... it's just a terrible habit when I try to talk about anything I'm really upset about.\n\nI hate counseling. I've tried before. I just can't be emotional around a stranger. I completely clam up and just can't answer their questions. Or in this case, pretty sure I would just burst into tears every time I tried. Everyone says how important professional mental health treatment is but I've never been able to get it to work for me...\n\nMy insurance is through the university so I would have to use their services... I don't have a doctor... I don't even know what accommodations I'm looking for. I don't know what kind of accommodations I could get for classes. I don't know what would help. I don't even know how my mental state will be like 2 weeks from now. I could be doing better, and then I would have made this big commotion...\n\nWhat is ombuds?\n\nYour offer to be on the phone with me to call my school's mental health services might be the kindest thing anyone's offered me. You don't even know me. So thank you so much. But, I know I can't make that call and be intelligable. It's going to have to be an email. If I can even figure out how to not hate therapy...",

      "text": "I think you've been given some good suggestions regarding wording of emails to faculty, so I just wanted to point out that you don't need to drop out. If an incomplete in your courses is not something you are willing to do, or think you would end up piling too much on your plate later on, you could consider a leave of absence rather than dropping out altogether. I don't think anyone would question why you'd need a leave of absence, and it could give you an extended time to process what you are going through while still securing your place in the program. If it gets to that point, I would have conversations about a leave of absence rather than withdrawing because, I assume, the processes and consequences are different depending on what a student decides.",
