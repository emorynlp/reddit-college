(Masters, engineering)", "text": "I started working with this professor in an hourly position the summer before grad school started.  My research is essentially a design project, not traditional experiment based research.  She got me a paid research assistant position this semester (my first one taking grad classes) and while I was initially grateful for it, I'm now wildly stressed out and unhappy beyond belief.\n\nMy school's engineering program has a thesis and non-thesis program, so if I stopped research I could just take more classes and be fine.  Money isn't too much of an issue, I would just lose my tuition assistance I get from research so I guess I would have to pay more unless I find a grader position or something.  I'm not sure if I would have to back-pay this semester since I got my tuition waived due to my research assistant position.  I just hate the concept of quitting, but doing this research job alongside classes is absolutely killing my mental health and I haven't even reached my first exam week yet.\n\nAnyone dealt with anything like this?\n\nedit: should mention that my classes are okay, I did my undergrad here and its more of the same.  Its just this research that's killing me, I'm not sure if I'm cut out for research.", "author": "AdmiralRofl", "created": 1632525963, "retrieved": 1632952052, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "comments": {"he97s7o": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puuz28/has_anyone_ever_quit_their_research_masters/he97s7o/", "text": "Very few people find resarch to be a satisfying activity.
