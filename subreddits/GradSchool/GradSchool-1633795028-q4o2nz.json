  "text": "I'm insecure about my PhD application because I don't have a super defined question, I only have areas of research I know I'm interested in. I'm also switching fields and have been out of school for about 5 years. Advice + words of encouragement are welcome.\n\n* **CURRENT** **AREA OF INTEREST**\n   * *Field*: Cognitive Science/Psychology.\n   * *Research area of interest*: The intersection between linguistic relativity and metaphor. I'd like to compare how speakers of different languages make sense/meaning of an abstract concept using metaphor.\n      * Research on time is really interesting to me, but there seems to be so much of it that I don't know if its worth applying under this topic...\n      * I'm thinking about exploring this intersection within the realm of how individuals make sense of emotions.\n      * Because I'm a Spanish speaker, I also thought it would be interesting to consider doing comparative work with Spanish + English because Spanish has grammatical gender, where English doesn't. But this is just a random idea that I've yet to fully develop/explore.\n\nAs you can see, I have a direction I know I want to run in (ling relativity + metaphor + abstract concept) and I've given it some thought but I don't have a very defined idea/project. I worry about how much this weakens my application. Along with my lack of relevant background. But I've made the decision that I will be applying this year.\n\n* **BACKGROUND**\n   * *Degree*: Anthropology, BA - 2016 (Cum Laude)\n      * Currently taking courses in Psychology at a community college and am contemplating \"formalizing\" this pursuit and getting an Associates Degree. Not sure if an admissions committee would care about this?\n   * *Research experience*: Linguistic anthropology, sociology, environmental science, biosocial anthropology.\n      * None of these experiences are related to what I'd like to do. I can maybe stitch a narrative together regarding how all of these required me to meditate on language in different ways but I'm afraid it would read like total bullshit.",

When my grand-PI started graduate school, he asked my grand-grand-PI what questions were important in the field and needed answering. He was given the keys to the library and told to read until he figured out. Eight months later, he did, and you will too. \n\nYou need deep exposure to a field to find out what is interesting and what needs answering. Be compassionate to yourself; no one knows what their PhD will look like before they start it. You have nothing to be insecure about.",

I'm sure neither of those things are terribly uncommon but I really feel the weight of them. \n\nBut I suppose my question now is, if it is okay to not really know what you'll be doing your doctoral research on, how do you \\*fake\\* the knowledge for your SOP? I'm sure everyone accepts that interests will change as you move through coursework, rotations, etc... but you also have to prove that you can critically think about a valid research question. Sometimes I feel like I am capable but I'm stuck in self doubt.",

      "text": "Idea #1: I don't know how things work in linguistics, but I'm in English literature. I'm also currently planning my PhD application, and was in the same rut as you. My suggestion is to start picking the most interesting of your two/three topics there, and doing a literature review. See what other scholars have said. Then create a specific research question, which *does not have to be the final question*. E.g. \"how can n-grams accurately describe the metaphor variation in English vs. Spanish?\" Then start doing it - break down the problem into 10 steps to see what you need to do to get your research done. If you hate it, switch to another research question and repeat until you find a topic you're OK with. Check the literature again.\n\nThis is how I managed to get a very good idea of what my research would be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIdea #2: Take 1 or 2 courses at the graduate level (doesn't have to be part of a degree, can be for a certificate or stand-alone) in a specialized part of linguistics that would be useful for your research. You'll get a lot of ideas about what research is hot right now in the field, plus how people *do* research (e.g. research methodologies). Good luck :P",

      "text": ">I worry about how much this weakens my application.\n\nI doubt as much as you think. Your research interests are more focused than some people who apply to PhD programs and if you can articulate why you want to research this and how it matches with the interests of the faculty you want to work with and the focus of the program, that's a big plus. I've literally heard of some people applying to PhD programs in anthropology because they \"like monkeys\".\n\nPsychology is highly interdisciplinary, so your background in anthropology isn't a big disadvantage. If you've taken upper division psych courses, that's a huge plus too. You may also consider taking the psychology GRE. In my Master's program in cognitive science, I had classmates with BS degrees in psychology, sociology, math, biology, education, as well as a bunch of other fields. Try to relate how your experiences in anthropology prepare you for a program in psychological science. \n\nPersonally, I think your research area sounds really interesting and I am sure there are programs out there that have a similar focus that will be a good match for you. You may have to look at some linguistics programs too, rather than just cognitive science, but it sounds really interesting!",

From there, I kind of started slowly reading abstracts in different fields that I thought might speak to my interests and when I *finally* stumbled on the work written by cognitive scientists/psychologists (it took a while lol) it felt like a homecoming. Like I finally found the people who had the perspective that clicked with me and how I wanted to explore everything. Then I started watching lectures online, listening to podcasts, and taking a psychology course here and there. \n\nI agree that my anthro background is an asset because I would be living in the intersection of cognitive and cultural psychology. Working with speakers of different languages is a priority to me. \n\nAnd thank you for your affirmation! I think the research sounds cool too lol. I intentionally cut out linguistics programs because I specifically want the psychology/cog sci training for my PhD, and opportunities beyond it. Maybe I'll broaden my scope though...",

I'm sure you'll get into a great school. If not, it's not the end of the world, just keep reapplying and focusing your applications.

                      "text": "Well I am a first generation college student, so that might play a role.\n\nThe first time I applied, I had no idea your research interests had to very closely match the research of the people in the department. That might seem obvious to some, but nobody ever told me that. Even when I applied, I think professors just thought I knew. I would have looked more closely at the faculty bios and stretched my research interests to fit what was written in the bio. If there are people who can read your SOP and offer to review it, take them up on it. Occasionally, faculty from the program you are applying to will offer to review your SOP.\n\nRound 2 was a life skill: Never put your education on hold for anyone, and don't sacrifice educational opportunities for anyone. \n\nRound 3 (final) cast a wide net and apply to programs you think you would be a good fit for, even if the program doesn't exactly match your background. My current PhD is not in the field I got by BS and MS in ,but it is related. It's an interdisciplinary program, so I can take classes in other departments and have those count towards my degree. In this program, I ended up meeting a professor in another department who was doing interesting research, and the bulk of my experience came from there. I really like that kind of research but never would have considered it had I not applied to this program. \n\nI don't have kids and am not restricted by an employer, so I applied to, iirc, 15 programs across the country. The first time, I applied to maybe 5 in my home state that were close to home. There's nothing wrong with that, but there are so many factors that go into whether a student is admitted that the admission chance is low. Also, if you don't get in, it's not the end of the world. I'd take the highest paying job you can find, and save up and apply to more universities the next year.",

                              "text": ">do you think it is okay if your interests are within their conceptual domain but aren't an exact match?\n\nMaybe. For a PhD program, typically your adviser chairs your dissertation committee and your dissertation committee is composed of experts in topics that you would employ in your dissertation. So if, for example, I wanted to research computational modeling of face perception and my adviser was a cognitive psychologist who did working memory research but not face perception research specifically, they may be *familiar* with it but they are not an expert in it and that might potentially pose a problem. \n\nObviously you don't want to lie, but if there is a link, even a stretched one, between what you want to do and what your potential adviser does, I would try to include that. Maybe it applies to your research interests in some way, or helps you to think about it a different way. Research interests can change once you've been admitted to the program, but you have to be admitted first. \n\nI also understand how intimidating it can be basically cold emailing people, but in my experience most folks are friendly. They know when application season is so they expect to receive emails from interested applicants. If they're not nice or rude in their emails, I take it as a red flag that the program is not professional enough for me. \n\nIf there is one particular program you want to go to, that's perfectly fine. You can concentrate your application efforts there, but even if you're an excellent candidate, there's still a chance that you may not get into your dream school, so then you may have to decide whether to accept an offer from somewhere else or to wait until next year and repeat the process, which is a PITA.",
