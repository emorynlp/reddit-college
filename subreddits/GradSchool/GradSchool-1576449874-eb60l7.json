I got my first pick for research labs and passed my classes with only minor hiccups. The lab had entered into a program to make compounds and send them out for bioactive testing, so we had a quota for so many compounds per quarter. We were constantly pushed to get numbers as well as produce innovate research. My adviser would regularly call people hacks, threaten people's careers via bad letters of rec, and would throw things around the lab when people under performed.   \n\n\nI was assigned to work under the new post-doc. I was chosen because no on else would work with him. He was openly nationalistic, racist, covert, obstructionist, and barely had a grasp of English. He refused to perform lab duties or participate in anything in the department that did not directly affect his research. I worked with him for several months developing methods and making compounds before going off the bench to prepare for my comps and oral exams (as was policy for the lab). During this time he took everything we worked on and with my adviser's knowledge, published without my name on the work.  \n\n\nAfter I passed my orals we went into grant writing mode. The post-doc again was not involved. I was asked to get results from the him and he ended up getting so upset at this request he ended up hitting me. I was later forced to apologize for upsetting him because I was the grad student and he was a post-doc.  \n\n\nI'm trying to put together my original line of research and move forward on publishing, but every group meeting where I talk about my experiments, this post doc says he's already done them. Any ideas I came up with or work I did was constantly sabotaged. Eventually we found out he was performing proposed experiments to get his name into everyone's work. He ended up having a shouting match with the PI and a fistfight with another post-doc because of this.   \n\n\nSo in my fourth year I lost my mind and had to take a leave of absence. I was in therapy and on meds, but no one seemed to really care. Both my grandfathers died within 6 months of each other. I got evicted from my apartment because the landlord pissed off the city. After I returned but the post-docs notebooks they were all in Chinese and in code so we couldn't read them. After another leave of absence I returned to leave with a 7 year Master's, my adviser promising that I could return in a few years and finish the program as another student of his had done. (BTW the post doc went on to another lab and pulled the same stunts and was fired within 6 months)  \n\n\nI taught for 2 years, which was a very rewarding experience for me. Any professional job I interviewed for always asked about the 7 year Masters. I tried to get back into the program, but was denied. I ended up starting a new program at a new university to try and improve my situation.  \n\n\nHere I was denied my first and second picks for lab. The lab I entered into had been closed for two years and everything was dirty. Again I got through classes fine, but struggled with research. My adviser refused to meet with me, refused to give me guidance, and refused to play any part in my graduate program. I coordinated primarily with the School of Graduate Studies to prepare me for my exams and make sure my paperwork was done correctly. I addressed this in my annual review of my adviser, but he forced me to change it to a positive review.  \n\n\nIn my 3rd year a capricious grading charge was brought against me by a student because of 1 point on a lab. I was found to be in compliance with regulations, but was put on probation because of the charge. Over my 4th year the department did nothing concerning assessing my probation status. At the end of the year I requested to be informed if I passed probation or would be terminated, but got no reply. After contacting HR the department had a meeting and said I was off probation, but admitted to not following the guidelines they had set.  \n\n\nAt this point SGS stepped in. They met with my adviser and he was unable to tell them what my thesis was, what his expectations were of me, or even what I had done in lab that week. A timeline was drawn up for both my graduation and my teaching assignments. My adviser met with me and said he would not comply with it. I met the goals for the first semester, but my adviser and the department did not. I gave him a negative review again and he tried to get it changed, but I stuck to my guns this time.  \n\n\nAt the beginning of this year I submitted another complaint. My committee met to discuss why things hadn't been done. My adviser said he knew nothing about a timeline or what I was doing. I then showed the e-mails when I was sending him my manuscripts and results. The committee was stunned. I had submitted a paper and it was accepted without his approval because he wouldn't respond to the e-mail. A new timeline was drawn up.  \n\n\nHe refused to comply again. Deadlines passed. I submitted an official grievance to the University. An investigation was held and he was removed as my adviser. When he was told this he came after me. The Dean personally stepped in. He determined the environment at the University was so hostile towards me it would be best if I worked elsewhere. I moved across state and wrote my dissertation with what I had done.  \n\n\nMy adviser was removed from research, removed from teaching, and removed from any other graduate committed he was on. He retired last month. He was not at my defense.  \n\n\nI defended this week and passed. One of my committee members cried during my defense. Now I just have to do the edits.  \n\n\nI have a entry-level job with low pay that I start tomorrow. I picked it because I like the people I will be working with. I turned down a better paying teaching position  because I did not like the people who interviewed me.   \n\n\nIf I would have known the things I know now about how a student deserved to be treated I would have taken action in my first program, but that was a learning experience. I was not the only one struggling in both situations. I was not the only one to leave the first lab, and the second program is struggling with low graduation rates. Never allow anyone to mistreat you, call you names, or ignore your needs even once because then it will happen again. Professors are not all-powerful, they have people above them and sometimes need to be reminded of that fact. You have every right to speak up and if you're told not to, then report that as well.  \n\n\nI couldn't have made it without a LOT of people helping me.
