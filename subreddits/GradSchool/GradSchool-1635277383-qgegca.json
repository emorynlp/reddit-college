  "text": "I have a Bachelors in Architecture Design but I've been working in Talent Acquisition for the past year and I absolutely love my job. I'm shifting to the US next year and I want to my Masters as soon as I settle down. But I understand that a lot of companies in the US wouldn't hire someone with a non-HR/business background for jobs that I'd be interested in. To stand out, should I do my Masters in HRM (Human Resource Management) or do an Executive MBA?   \n\n\nCould someone please help out, tysm!",
