So if you end up changling labs and are in a transitionary period, your funding is not impacted. In fact, I needed to change labs this summer (best decision of my graduate life so far!) and did not have a lab a little over a month. When I asked my DGS about funding, she said it would continue as I have guaranteed funding of 5 years and if I can't find a lab within a semester, then I'd be put on academic probation (switched shortly after).\n\nThis is a great development for MIT, but I think they eventually need to adop the guaranteed funding practice. My friend at MIT EECS PhD program was surprised to hear about my guaranteed funding, and I was surprised to hear that MIT, of all places, didn't offer him guaranteed funding at admission.", "author": "ceriolie", "created": 1613973998, "upvotes": 1}, "go9bbm3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/loy63w/mit_to_offer_guaranteed_transitional_funding_for/go9bbm3/", "text": "This isn\u2019t relevant to me, but it\u2019s *super* awesome to see.\n\nGood luck, genuinely, to anyone who\u2019s facing this kind of issue.", "author": "idcydwlsnsmplmnds", "created": 1613936399, "upvotes": 2}, "go92hby": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/loy63w/mit_to_offer_guaranteed_transitional_funding_for/go92hby/", "text": "This is not only great in the practical sense, but it also normalize the idea of leaving bad mentors.
