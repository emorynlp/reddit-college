      "text": "So, one thing I find really interesting is the fact that many programs at MIT still do not guaranteed funding for X (~5) years.\n\nAt many universities, STEM Ph.D.s give you a guaranteed funding of 5 years when sending out the offer letter. So if you end up changling labs and are in a transitionary period, your funding is not impacted. In fact, I needed to change labs this summer (best decision of my graduate life so far!) and did not have a lab a little over a month. When I asked my DGS about funding, she said it would continue as I have guaranteed funding of 5 years and if I can't find a lab within a semester, then I'd be put on academic probation (switched shortly after).\n\nThis is a great development for MIT, but I think they eventually need to adop the guaranteed funding practice. My friend at MIT EECS PhD program was surprised to hear about my guaranteed funding, and I was surprised to hear that MIT, of all places, didn't offer him guaranteed funding at admission.",

Proof of the institutional success is that MIT's efforts work at the undergraduate level; after several years of outreach, those offerings are really well utilized, and u'grads do a great job encouraging their classmates to seek help, and they do.\n\nHopefully this new offering is well-funded and that seeing people (be able to) leave an advisor serves as a red flag -- that future students avoid them and fellow faculty correct them.",

At my school, your old advisor is asked to fund you for two additional months while you look for a different advisor. But if that person cannot/will not or if you don't find someone else to cover you after that, then you're out of luck.\n\nIt's also hard to find a different advisor when you can no longer get any recommendation letter from your former one. If your department is on your advisor's side, you can be hit with reviews blaming you for failing to perform to standard, failing this and that, and rumors being spread that you're incompetent, difficult to work with, etc. Few faculty want to be entangled in that kind of political drama. So officially people may tell you that they can't take you because of funding, but unofficially you know that they absolutely have money and are looking for students but they're not taking you so they don't step on the toes of your former advisor and his/her allies.\n\nThere is so much power imbalance between faculty and their grad students that some protection for the students is really needed here.",

If the PI is able to pick up the funding, they are expected to, but if not, the department handles it. My current program told us to focus on the science, not the funding, while choosing a lab. \n\nIf you can't find a lab, you are given an academic warning and need to fix the issue within the next semester.

I went through change of labs this summer, and go to a program with one of those guaranteed funding offers (for 5 years). This is what my DGS told me.\n\nI am sure MIT's transitionary funding doesn't support the student forever, either. So I am not sure why the comment is not helpful.

We give students a full year to find another advisor if they need to move, and there is no penalty, either official or unofficial, for students who want to move.   How do you do more than that?",

Perhaps they shouldnt.\n\nFor humanities, this might be different because funding for humanities research seems very tricky. But at least for STEM PhD programs, I dont understand how other schools can offer guaranteed funding, but MIT, school that gets in a huge amount of research and training funding dor STEM, cannot. Just does not add up.",

I\u2019m talking about grad students who are not being \u201chired\u201d, and are only taking classes, doing clinicals, or doing student teaching. It\u2019d be great if they could get essentially fellowships, but this is not a situation where they\u2019re being hired.  \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that not all research projects are funded even in STEM. Profs often have pet projects that don\u2019t have any funding, or sometimes a prof is bad at getting money. IMO they shouldn\u2019t take on grad students to work on those projects or in those situations, but sometimes a student does really want to work on that, or sometimes profs lose funding for a project before the student finishes their degree. Those are situations where I think the department should guarantee funding even if the prof can\u2019t, I definitely agree. But I don\u2019t know that all departments are capable of doing that, even in STEM.",
