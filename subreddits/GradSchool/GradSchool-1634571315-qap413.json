  "text": "Hi folks. Kinda sad about this and I need a bit of help. \n\nMy advisor has planned an in-person workshop for us to attend and I'm kind of upset. It is less than 2 weeks from the winter holidays, I am high risk, it is in a low vax area and we can't require masks or proof of vaccination. It would be a super enriching experience and wonderful learning opportunity, I am a big part of the planning and relationship building involved. I am just sick with anxiety and nerves about being exposed to so many people right before the holidays. We would also have to fly there and back. I am really considering telling her for my own physical health and mental health that I can't attend, but I'm afraid she will be very disappointed in me and that it will reflect negatively in my thesis as something that I didn't do. Even if I get a booster and I stay masked the whole time, my advisor is insisting we hold a lunch with everyone as well, which is unavoidable to be unmasked during. We can't hold the workshop or lunch outdoors because the location has freezing temperatures and snow. And if I do just not attend the lunch, I'll still be around my advisor and lab mate in the rental car who would have been unmasked for the lunch... I am so conflicted about this. I really don't want to disappoint my advisor and team. Any advice?",

      "text": "Don't do the fieldwork. All the factors you mentioned (you are high risk, it is in a low vax area, v.v.) are red flags screaming for you to avoid them. Great opportunities may come up again (and I agree, this sounds hard to walk away from), but *if* you do get COVID, and then [long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html), you're going to suffer. You might not be able to breathe or even walk without help (so you wouldn't even be able to do fieldwork!)\n\nAvoiding this one-time disappointment is not worth your long-term health. Explain it to your advisor clearly (\"I am so sad to have to say no - I know you spent a long time putting this trip plan together. However, I am not going for these reasons... Thank you for understanding my decision. Please keep me in the loop with what outcomes we learned from this workshop, because I think it is important for me...\") Your advisor can't be disappointed that you put health first -  and if they are, that's a problem with them, not you.",
