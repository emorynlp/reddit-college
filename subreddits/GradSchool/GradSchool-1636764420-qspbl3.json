  "text": "Getting close to defending my dissertation. Even though I've had plenty of good times in the 6.5 years I've been a doctorate student, there's no denying I spent MANY nights and weekends of my 20s working and stressing and crying. If I go straight to a job after this without blowing off *any* steam, I worry I'm headed straight for a huge mental breakdown. \n\nThis is where you come in.\n\n**I need BIG ideas for hedonist indulgence post-dissertation. I know everyone's different but I want your most luxurious, self-indulgent, messy, extravagant ideas for post-defense fun.** Free or pricey. Self-destructive or beneficial. I'll take anything. \n\nThank you, in advance, for giving me something to look forward to. This subreddit has been so helpful in maintaining my last shred of sanity.",
