  "text": "Quick preface:\n\nThis is an online course. He has four units and unlocks them throughout the semester with all the assigned work and lectures included.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI'm wondering if I should contact my professor about the lack of grades? I know, that's annoying. However, he hasn't posted grades AT ALL this whole semester. He hasn't even graded our introductions from the first week of class.\n\nWe turned in work from unit 1 almost a month ago. Unit 2 is due soon, but there is no feedback from our previous assignments. There is no way to gauge if we're doing the work correctly or how to improve!\n\nNow, I want to reach out to him and ask him about this situation, but I understand that professors get busy, have emergencies, or get overwhelmed. I don't want to be the asshole. I'm just stressed because I am not doing as well as I'd like in his class, so an assessment of my previous assignments would be really helpful.\n\nHas enough time passed to be a little irked by this? Would it be appropriate and not eye-rolling inducing to send him an e-mail?",

      "text": "One month in is perfectly reasonable, as long as you are polite and don't harass him. Phrasing it in passive voice might make it sound nice and non-confrontational: \"Hi Prof X, do you know if grades will be posted in the next week or two? I am worried about my progress in the class. Thanks!\"\n\nRemember that if he is annoyed about this request, that is all about him and his relationship with his workload, and NOT your fault for asking the question. As long as you don't ask every other day about grades, you're not crossing any typical lines.",
