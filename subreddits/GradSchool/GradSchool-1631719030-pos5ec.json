I've been interested in a few of the programs in the states since they're fully online, which would make it easier for me to continue to work and support my family. \n\nI just wanted to know in terms of accreditation, registration etc. if it would be possible? \n\nThank you!", "author": "dontworrybehappy1995", "created": 1631719030, "retrieved": 1632844536, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcypueb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pos5ec/counseling_masters_in_the_us_able_to_practice_in/hcypueb/", "text": "Someone in the counseling stream can probably answer better, but from my understanding it is fine to 'cross over' like that.
