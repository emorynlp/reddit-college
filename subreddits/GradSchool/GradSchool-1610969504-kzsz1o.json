  "text": "I feel such a mix of pride and sadness and longing and happiness and disappointment. I know I've got to count my blessings - that I finished my degree successfully despite the pandemic - but god I worked my ass off for years and it feels a little sad that my celebration at the end of it all was to just open a package alone in my house. \n\nTo the class of 2020 - I hope we find success and happiness. How did you celebrate when you got your degree?",

My name was pronounced correctly! I then had fish tacos and beer for a graduation dinner with the people I live with. \n\nIt felt...strange. TBH, still doesn't feel like I have a degree. I know it happened... But it's like it didn't happen.\n\nEdit: I am the first in my family to earn a graduate degree, so I was very much looking forward to the graduation ceremony and to show my niece and nephew it can be done!",

There was plans of a lot of gin and giggles and I was really sad and deflated as well but it's better that they stayed safe and healthy, we'll see our friends again :)",
