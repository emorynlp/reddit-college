  "title:": "Submitted my proposal draft and feeling good about myself",
  "text": "After an entire summer of jumpy starts, shitty thesis ideas, and a lot of reading that went nowhere I finally submitted the proposal draft to my thesis advisor. Being shunted to only online work has been tough and my advisor has been very hard to reach. No one's fault really. I feel an incredible weight lifted from my shoulders. I know it is only temporary, but I am happy it is submitted. I can now focus on different avenues of my research and getting my hands on primary sources. Wish me luck!",
