  "text": "I've had a not so hot relationship with alcohol and many members of my family have struggled with alcoholism. Obviously, being a good neurosci student I would take precautionary measures.  But I'm not a good neurosci student and I thought I had a handle on things. For a while I was a \"functioning\" alcoholic and then, well, I wasn't functioning. I'm 12 days sober, not long I know but it's a milestone for me, trying to pick up the pieces of how I could be so stupid. But our lab is highly social and everyone likes to drink. I want to raise the opinion of not doing social outings (allowed where I am, to a limited party #) at bars, without raising massive red flags that I'm struggling. We don't have these outings often at all anymore, last one was months ago, but I want to be prepared for when things start opening up more. I'm extremely embarrassed and frustrated with myself so trust me when I say I know how unprofessional this is. I'm a nontraditional grad student (worked for many years after undergrad before going back to school) and that makes the pressure to be a good role model that much more intense because I'm like the \"mom\" of the lab group. I want to do good science, I love my science, and I want to be a good role model for my younger cohort, or at the very least, not be a bad one. I can't do that if I'm struggling with alcoholism. I have to do better than this.",

Doing what you did isn't easy but recognizing you need to address it is a huge step.\n\nMy only real advice is to think before you act. Ask yourself why you crave things. Why your triggers exist. What about them makes them tempting and how you recognize them early on, before you have a chance to act on them. To me it felt like learning to look further down the road when I was driving. I could anticipate my needs by anticipating what I was going to encounter at the next bend in the road. Life keeps giving you bends in the road but you can learn to look for them and anticipate them with *help and practice.* Seek out help from alcohol recovery groups.\n\nBest wishes brother or sister. You will still get your degree and you will have some really valuable life experience to share when the time is right.",

I honestly was in a very, very similar family, personal and social situation as you when in I was in grad school, with the notable exception that I didn\u2019t check myself before I wrecked myself. It wasn\u2019t until I ended up leaving the lab environment that I stopped drinking and feeling the pressure to. I\u2019ve started getting Virgin drinks or mocktails when we go out, but tbh, a lot of the time I find I just drifted away from the full social scene of drinking with lab mates. I realized it was a super toxic coping strategy for me and many others, and I\u2019m far happier without it than with. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out if ever you want to talk, or have a support for the hardships of grad school. I\u2019m also happy to help you find any resources in your area you might find helpful while working through getting to a safer and healthier place.",

Let me start by saying that any # of days sober is a big accomplishment and don't ever let anyone discount your achievement.  They don't know what you are going through.  They can screw themselves. \n\nI am 5 yrs. sober this April.  I was lucky enough to have quit drinking well before starting my program, but I feel for you.  I feel like it is the culture of grad school to \"have drinks\" with colleagues.  For my interview, my advisor and the post doc in the lab took my now lab mate and I out to drinks before the big cohort reception.  On several other occasions, I have gone out to lunch with the lab at breweries and such.  \n\nMy recommendation is that at first, just make up some excuse not to go out with them.  Eventually, you will get more comfortable going out to a bar and not drinking, but until then, it is too risky.  When I finally started going out to bars with people again I would order club soda with a lime because it looks like a cocktail and they are usually free, so you can drink all night for $5 (tip the bartender).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk to someone who has gone through what you are going through.",

It's a sub dedicated to its namesake where you will find a community of individuals who have chosen to stop drinking for every reason under the sun (e.g. alcoholism, other health effects, family history, wasted time, wasted money, wasted opportunities).\n\nIt is a supportive group that might prove useful in a time when you can't easily find similar support groups.\n\nI know what you mean about wanting to walk a delicate line with your research group. In my field, social drinks are expected more than even in my circle of friends (which says a lot), but I gave up drinking a long while ago. I find that in the professional sphere a polite No Thank You  with a kind smile has been enough. I deliberately don't lead about not drinking at all like some vegans with being veganism (you know what I mean). I simply decline and don't act like not drinking is a defining feature of my character. Thus far, it has worked and I haven't lost face with those whom I work.\n\nThe change from drinking to not drinking was gradual for me. I am not sure how similar it is or isn't compared to your binary, overnight flip, but I suggest finding tea in some form.\n\nI've also picked up sparkling water (La Croix, baby!). A colleague who noticed I don't drink discretely told me he doesn't like alcohol either. He's the one who introduced me to La Croix. We now refer to ourselves as the Sparkle Boys.",

Later on this can morph into \"I don't really like the taste of alcohol since I stopped drinking for so long.\" \n\nTo avoid alcohol/temptation overall, our lab started doing activities that didn't by default exclude our undergrad students and muslim/potential other religion-following students. In hindsight, we should have been doing so all along. Escape rooms, bowling, bbqs, soup and cake exchanges (as long as dietary restrictions aren't complicated), sober karaoke (!)... We picked a TV show to follow (Ru Paul's Drag Race) and went to someone's house/apartment weekly to order delivery and watch. Nowadays, we can play JackBox games online (one person shares the screen on Zoom, everyone plays on their phones) or other board game sites - Codenames is a good one... There, you're in your own home and can control what you consume. Obviously one can mix alcohol into a lot of these situations, but it's not the default and you can explicitly make them alcohol-free without too much effort or conversation.\n\nI wish you all the best in your journey. Grad school is a tough place to learn to be kind and forgiving to yourself. I hope you can find support in your colleagues too - you don't always have to be the perfect \"mom\" figure to be a good role model, and being vulnerable gives others permission to share their problems too.",

I think they appreciated that, and some even came out and said they were having similar problems. It helps to be \"out in the open\" with at least a few people. \n\nI would absolutely tell no one in my cohort about my alcoholism, but they don't need to know. However, if you aren't able to go out with your cohort without taking part in drinks, absolutely don't feel bad about not going. I was nervous about my first outing after starting sobriety but made it by ordering root beers and virgin margaritas (as many as I wanted!).

I got sober with the help of a collegiate recovery program at my school, and started going to peer support meetings both on and off campus (obviously in person ones aren\u2019t happening but there are tons of online options from all sorts of different fellowships). Does your school have a collegiate recovery program? Might be good to connect there. I was really happy to see I wasn\u2019t the only grad student who had this issue, and it really helped to be with other students in recovery regularly. \n\nThere are also a ton of recovery subs on this site. r/redditorsinrecovery is pretty active. Not everyone needs help with their addiction, but a lot of people do. It\u2019s really hard to get sober and it\u2019s a lot easier with some help, so I hope you find a good source of support! Asking for help is a pretty powerful way to be a role model, IMO. \nAnyway just wanted to share that I\u2019ve been there! Getting sober was the best decision I ever made, and it\u2019s made this round of grad school much better. Feel free to pm if I can be helpful.",

It's vague enough to be true for basically everyone (even if the medical reason is just \"alcohol addiction\", your labmates don't have to know that) and it will get people to (hopefully) stop asking questions or offering you drinks.\n\nAlso don't be afraid to say \"no\" if you don't feel ready to go to a bar yet! Missing out on a few social events won't make or break your relationship with your labmates-- but going to the bar before you're ready could have serious consequences. No one will be upset if you're just \"not feeling well enough to go out tonight\"!",

I'm a 33 year old grad student and I have some younger early/mid 20s friends from intramural sports -- I skip out on a lot of activities with them just because I absolutely cannot go to a music festival and drink for 3 days. Just nope.\n\nIs there anyone in the lab or in your program that is older, that you could be social with instead? Do you feel like you can't go to a bar because you will feel compelled to drink? Perhaps you could suggest you all get dinner first and then skip out on the drinks afterwards? I imagine they'll be sympathetic and try to accommodate you, but I also imagine they'd still like to be able to go to bars to hang out. I bet you could find a middle ground where you get dinner first and then you head home while they go out for drinks at a bar.\n\nAnd like others have said - congrats on sobriety!

Eating disorders, previous traumatic encounters in bars, family/personal history of alcoholism, financial stress, straight up not liking to drink).

You can (and will) do good science and be a good role model, even if you struggle with alcoholism. This is not a death sentence. It is simply another obstacle you have to work with. \n\nYou can always try to suggest other outings that are not triggering to you that other members of the lab would enjoy. Is there a good restaurant that isn't a huge bar scene? Can you go bowling or to a park? Working through the beginning of your sobriety journey during a pandemic is a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, you have plenty of time to get yourself to a stable place with alcohol while its still pretty much a no-no on group outings. On the other, you aren't getting as much exposure to places and events that could be your triggers. Pay attention to when your cravings come around- can you be around someone who is drinking if it isn't in a bar setting? Are there certain places you used to drink regularly that you need to avoid? If you can be in the room with drinking, you can always just say you're trying to save money and/or lose weight by not drinking alcohol, order something else, and call it a day. If you can't, and your lab is really into the bar scene and nothing else, you can always tell someone you trust and see if they can suggest doing something else too. \n\nYou're starting a super difficult journey, but you are a scientist, so difficult is likely something you can handle!
