  "text": "Hi. let me just preface this by saying that this is probably a stupid question to ask. I understand it differs from person to person but just wanted to hear what or how others think.\n\nI've got two offers of admission. One from UT Austin and the other from VT. Both are very well ranked and are great choices. Now that I have to decide, I decided to weigh up both options. \n\nUT Austin is better ranked, tuition is lower by around 9k per year, and seems to have a larger research funding (UT system as a whole has large funding). Side note: the weather in texas seems HOT for someone from a temperate climate \ud83d\ude05\n\nVT is slightly lower ranked, gets a good amount of funding, as per data almost 85% student are on assistantship. Also, I've got close relatives and cousins at 2-3hr from the uni. \n\nWould you suggest that the close relative factor is as important or is it something that shouldn't be of a concern? Im still a bit confused and just wanna hear what people think. Considering this subreddit consists people currently in grad school, though I could get a decent perspective!",

      "text": "What field?? It varies so much, in my field which is bio I get a stipend and tuition didn't play a part in my decision because I don't pay tuition. If you're in bio, the advisor you'd be working with is far more important than the rank of the school, but I'm sure in other fields rank matters a lot more.",

      "text": "Personally for me, none of this matters.  In grad school, who you work with matters more. \n\nSo which professors will you be working with?  Do they have more funding?  What makes their work stronger/more attractive than the other?  \n\nIf your only focus is by \"university status\", then it seems like you already have your answer.  You said UT Austin has better rank, cheaper tuition, and more funding.  But who is dictating that funding money?  Is the professor you're working with bringing that in?  How stable is your funding/position?  What good is having \"larger funding\" if you don't get a piece of the pie?",
