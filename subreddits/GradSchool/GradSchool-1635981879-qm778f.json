  "title:": "Confused about NSERC CGS-M application while in undergrad",
  "text": "I'm a Canadian citizen applying to a bunch of Canadian master's programs, but I'm currently doing my undergrad at a US institution, so there's not a lot of people around me I can ask for help. I have a bunch of questions about how this works.\n\nHow specific does the research proposal need to be? Right now I know a few areas in my field that I would like to study, but not really enough to pin down a specific project. Should this be more like a traditional proposal or is it ok if it reads more general like a statement of purpose.\n\nDo I need to have a supervisor confirmed/contacted? The application has spaces for this but is it ok if I leave it blank if I don't have anyone confirmed?\n\nWhat does it mean by \"year of the application?\" Would it be 2022 for this next application due in December of 2021? When the application asks how many months of graduate study I will have as of December 31 of year of application, should I be putting 0 because I'm still doing my undergrad or should I be putting the months of graduate study I will have by next December if I am admitted to a graduate program?\n\nLastly, does it hurt my chances of admission if I don't apply/don't receive a scholarship?\n\nI really would appreciate it if someone could help answer some of these questions, or point me in the direction of a source. Thank you so much in advance!",

      "text": "I might be back to answer questions later when ive got the time, but check if your university hosts some info session about NSERC applications.\n\nI remember in undergrad representatives from NSERC came by and answered all sorts of questions about the application process. Just yesterday i got an email from my uni about a Q&A session for the CGS-M application process at my current institution too.",

      "text": "I've held a CGS-M, but I had the benefit of staying at the same school after my undergrad and with my undergraduate advisor:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The proposal should be as specific as any other research proposal. Lay out a clear plan, brief lit review, and methodology. The kicker is that NSERC proposals are non-binding. Faculty propose flashy things all the time in their grant applications and then stick to what they've been doing all along. Especially for a CGS-M, treat it more as a test to see how well you can write academically.\n2. You should have a faculty member sign off. This is going to be difficult since you're an applicant without prior relationships with proposed supervisors who do not know you personally. Unless you've already made contact and have a general agreement with someone to advise you, this is going to be the hardest part. Most students in your position will apply for their CGS-M in the Fall of their first year once they've been accepted.\n3. Yes you should be putting 0 as your number of graduate experience. This part is intended for students who are applying in their first (or even second) year of their program, (see 2).\n4. This depends on how well funded your potential supervisor is. Some can afford a master's student no problem, but it's just a benefit for the both of you if you can get one. Other faculty members essentially require you to apply for external funding to be accepted. You need to discuss this with your potential advisor. Also, even if you applied, NSERC results are usually in April, well after or very close to when most people get accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the main advice is to reach out to potential advisors if you haven't already. If you click well, and they give you a soft-acceptance already, then you should think about writing an application together. Otherwise, just let them know that you're Canadian and that you'll definitely apply for it if you get accepted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso last note, hasn't the NSERC deadline passed already (lol)?  IIRC, the deadline is end of October.",

          "text": "Gotcha, thank you so very much for the detailed reply. I've only just started reaching out to potential advisors and will definitely keep in mind your advice. Not super familiar with academia so really appreciate the help!\n\nFor the deadline, on the website I saw it was December 1st? Not sure if it's changed or if I'm reading it wrong lol.\n\nOne last question: when school applications ask if I am planning on applying to so-and-so funding (like NSERC), should I say yes if I don't apply till next Fall if/when I'm admitted? Or are they only asking about this cycle.",

              "text": "I applied and received the CGS-M for my first year of my masters without having a confirmed supervisor, so it's definitely not required! It can be helpful to get someone in your field to read your proposal and make suggestions, but you don't need to put them on your application. You definitely won't be the only one in that position. You can also put on your grad school applications that you're planning to apply for NSERC. I don't think it will hurt because a lot of universities have a minimum amount of funding that they offer to their grad students. NSERC results probably won't have been released by the time acceptance letters are sent out, so they'll most likely be offering you an amount of funding in your initial acceptance letter, and that will come from supervisor/university funds if you don't receive NSERC, and it will come from NSERC+maybe other funds if you do. It can also show potential supervisors that you have a potential project in mind and that you meet the academic requirements to apply for NSERC (you have a high enough GPA, etc). If you decide not to apply for NSERC this cycle, then don't put it on your applications. \n\nI believe you're correct that the deadline for the CGS-M is December 1. The October deadline is for the doctoral award. Pro tip: finish your application a few days before the deadline and ask your letter writers to do the same, because the website always crashes due to high traffic right around the deadline. If you can avoid that stress, definitely do. Good luck!",
