  "title:": "My advisor didn't submit her letter of rec & the deadline has passed",
  "text": "Pretty much what the title said. I'm sick to my stomach today, she didn't send me any notice that she would miss the deadline, and doesn't even look like she ever opened the link. I first notified her of the deadline six weeks ago and sent her the link to submit 2.5 weeks ago. This is just the first of a dozen dissertation year fellowships I am applying for this fall, so now I'm worried this might become a pattern for much bigger fellowships (this one was only supplementary funding, the rest are all full years of funding). In all of the past five years she has never missed a letter deadline so I am also a bit worried about her like something happened, but also have this feeling of having my trust massively violated & feeling like it was my fault somehow. Maybe I should have reminded her more often or sooner -- but my other letter writer only submitted her letter the day of the deadline as well, so generally speaking things have been fine where I don't micromanage her and trust that she will get it all done in time. I am abroad for fieldwork right now so calling her with the time difference and tech issues (she only has a landline) doesn't feel possible -- the deadline was Friday night her time, finding a replacement last minute didn't feel possible, and it also would have looked bad to not have my advisor submit a letter.\n\nThe application won't even let me submit it without all letters included although I have emailed the program somewhat begging for them to let me submit and append her letter later. Not really looking for advice, more just feeling upset and can't really talk to closer colleagues because it feels unprofessional to say this and have it seem like I am badmouthing her to people that know me/her personally.",

      "text": "If she has successfully submitted letters for you many times in the past, then this is definitely not your fault. Something must have happened in her life that led her to forget the deadline or be unable to do the work.\n\n1. Get in touch with her and make sure she is all right. Tell her that you noticed she didn't submit her letter by the deadline, and you're concerned about if everything is ok. I guess you'll have to do this over email?\n\n2. Have a conversation with her about what went wrong. This means directly ask her some of your questions, like should you have reminded her more frequently? should you have submitted the request sooner? is she no longer comfortable writing you a recommendation? If she is your advisor, it's important that you're able to have an honest conversation about these factors, because your PhD advisor is expected to write you letters of recommendation for basically the rest of your professional life.\n\nP.S. I hope everything is ok with her, because it really is odd that someone with such a good track record would fail to submit a letter. And I hope everything works out for you with the application. Good idea to get in touch with them right away.",

It's hard not to internalize it as my personal failing, particularly when the application says over and over \"it's your responsibility to make sure your letters are received.\" I managed to get in touch with the fellowship office and they have graciously allowed me until Monday to get the letter in. It is worrisome that I haven't heard from her and it's been over 24 hours. I reached out to her again and I'm trying to reach colleagues who are in her grad seminar to see if something happened to her this week...I last heard from her about a week ago so it's not like she's been MIA. Worst case scenario I may have to email later today and see if another committee member can replace her last minute although it's not ideal to not have my advisor represented in the letters.",

              "text": "Oh good, so glad they'll give you a bit of extra time on the letter. I think people emphasize \"it's your responsibility\" on letters because so many students ask for a rec and then fall off the radar, thinking the ball is well out of their court. When in reality, getting the letter in on time is a shared responsibility between you and the prof, working together. In this case you and your advisor have a nice history of doing this dance successfully, so it's so totally reasonable that you didn't expect any change in how you shared the work! I guess you probably know this already, but no harm in repeating it to internalize it.\n\nHonestly, you're doing everything I would do in that situation, right down to contacting colleagues for more info on what's going on. This all sounds very hard. Hang in there.",

A week ago I was sleeping all day through the jet lag of flying 10,000 miles. Evidently my reminder 2.5 weeks in advance was not sufficient. All I can do is fall on my sword and apologize, tell her I will make sure to send her notifications on that schedule for the remaining deadlines. Her email made me cry a lot and blamed me for disorganization, but that's a conversation for my therapist I suppose. As this fellowship didn't require an advisor letter I managed to reach another committee member who already has a letter prepared for me and she already said she would submit one, so at least I will still be eligible for the fellowship and I just have to try not to think about how bad it looks to not have a letter from my main advisor.",

                      "text": "It is totally not your fault-- advisors can often be so disorganized. Mine writes wonderful letters but she ALWAYS does it the day before, causing me to lose it. SO here is my strategy in case it helps you. Hang in there!\n\n\n(1) First I give her a 1-2 month informational email with all the info and deadlines. I say in the email I will follow-up again.\n\n(2) This is key: I ALWAYS tell them 1-2 days before the real deadline in that initial email. Really. It isn't like the advisor is checking, 1-2 days is not enough to screw up their own personal scheduling, and giving them a 'fake' deadline ensures that even if they \"miss\" it, YOU don't get screwed over.\n\n(3) I follow up 1 week before its due in another email, specifically as an email reply to that first email I sent. That way have a reminder and have all the details, now in an email closer to the top of their inbox.\n\n\n(4) Say in either of the emails 'if you could confirm when it goes through the grant system, that would be great'! That means they will send you a confirmation email AND you have an excuse if you _don't_ hear from them in the hours leading up to the deadline to reach out and say nonchalantly \"Did you have any trouble with the submission? Just want to make sure it went through. Thanks for your help!\"\n\n\nApplying for grants truly sucks. Best of luck!",

Now I am auto scheduling reminder emails to send to her one week before the remaining deadlines!! Again for five years this has not been an issue, I really do think she is blaming me for her extraordinarily busy fall, which is hard because we are both having very tough times of it right now, but there's little acknowledgment of me finally starting my fieldwork 18 months delayed due to COVID being a major complicating factor in me getting my materials done as far in advance as she wants me to.",

It's fine to tell your advisor you'd like it submitted a day or two early, but the vast majority of automatic emails I receive tell me the actual deadline, and it always leaves a bad taste in my mouth when a student lies about this.\n\nI do recommend the regular emails: I ask students to send me a reminder a week out and 3 days out of a deadline if they haven't heard from me that I've submitted. From my perspective as a faculty member, I've got 50+ letter deadlines with different delivery methods to keep track of in the middle of most semesters, and it's easy to miss one that you think you've submitted. I always confirm with a student when I submit, but at least once a semester a student has entered my email address wrong and I haven't gotten the submission link.",

Again I sent her a reminder 2.5 weeks in advance but that was evidently too far in advance, so lesson learned.\n\nIf this were my first year all this advice in this thread would be more appreciated but I'm applying to final year fellowships, and there haven't been issues with her submitting letters nor with my communication about deadlines. I'm actually her only advisee right now (she is on other committees but no one else has her as their actual advisor), so this feeling of the amount of work I have to do to follow up with her multiple times -- even though yes, she is busy, and yes I understand it's my responsibility to stay on top of it -- feels overwhelming when I would think I am her main student priority (even if she has other research/teaching/service priorities above me)....ultimately it has never really felt that way, which is probably what's coming to the surface with all this right now.",

I know you do so much amazing work for me, and it's not fair to you. I promise to pay more attention in the future and write the letters several days BEFORE the deadline, and I will explain to the fellowship committee that it was entirely my fault it was late, and ask them not to penalize you.\"\n\nIs this ever going to happen? Is this just my perverted fantasy?",

Luckily in my case they submitted the letter an hour past the deadline and it was accepted.\n\nSince then I found [this suggestion](https://jeffhuang.com/less_stress_recommendation_letters/) basically to agree on a timeline with the letter writer in advance that has a 3 day buffer, and then I don't have to worry about it or send reminder emails. I just point them to the link so they know it's a legit idea.\n\nThe letter writers often agree to use the timeline because then they don't have to respond to my constant reminders (otherwise, they know I'll freak out when they don't reply). Anyways, this has completely solved my anxiety about asking for letters now.",

I think it comes down to a disagreement between the two of us about sending materials ahead of time. In a perfect world, yes I would have complete drafts of the grant applications 2-3 weeks before they are due to include with my reminder to her. However the reality of juggling teaching, article revision deadlines, now fieldwork, plus applying for multiple grants means I am usually working on materials down to the wire -- plus she does not accept \"working drafts\" as sufficient, everything needs to be fully written out, no bullet points, citations properly formatted, etc or else she won't look at it. My other committee members don't require materials ahead of time, aside from just a brief overview of what the fellowship is about so they know how to tailor their letters. The power difference between her and I is such that I don't really have much of a leg to stand on to request she waive her requirement for me to get all my materials to her weeks in advance.",

When I switched to another school, I couldn\u2019t reach out to her for another letter. Luckily, I knew someone from another department as I had been in their leadership program. I managed to get letter from her and submitted on time. I got accepted. When I informed my former dean about it, she suddenly replied and gave me some tips to survive in the grad school. Weird. Even if you have been prepared early, sometimes people can\u2019t follow up with your schedule. So I have to get backup in case. Always check everything and whatever pops up in your head like reaching out to other people whom you think can help you.",
