  "text": "I\u2019m in my last semester of an MFT masters program. Currently balancing classes, my client schedule, paperwork audits and making sure my papers are approved for comprehensive exams. I am seeing my own therapist but, I feel like I both don\u2019t have time for self-care and since many of my clients are at night, my schedule doesn\u2019t match with friends outside of the program. Not to mention I\u2019m seeing clients on Saturday because I need to accommodate availability. What I am most embarrassed about is I am not even sure I still want to pursue licensure. I have basically been seeing clients since the start of the pandemic. Wouldn\u2019t mind a pep talk",

      "text": "Hi! I'm a licensed mental health professional and in a doctoral program. I finished my master's three years ago. I was in a similar place in my final semester. FWIW, I think it's part of the process. I recall everyone else in my cohort feeling the same way. What you are doing now will not ever have to be repeated. What we do is so hard. Many counselors don't pursue licensure, and that's totally okay. Some people also took time between graduation and initiating the licensure process for self-care. Once you're done with school and been able to recharge, you may feel differently. You don't have to decide now. You're so close to the finish line! You got this! For context, while attending my masters program full-time and doing my internship (20 hours  a week), I worked a full 40 hours. Looking back, I have no idea how I did it and am so glad I never have to repeat it. Here I am in a doctoral program having deja vu, but I recharged my battery while getting my license. You are strong and capable and doing the dang thang. The world needs more MFTs! Keep your eye on that light at the end of the tunnel. Don't worry about the after. Focus on the now. One client and one day at a time.",
