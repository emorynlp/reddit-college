  "title:": "Here's a list of stuff that's worked for me in grad school. What's kept you sane?",
  "text": "I was making a guide for a friend starting grad school, and I thought some of my advice might be useful. I'm going into my fourth year, so I was thinking it might help some people going into their first years now. I'm sure more of it is specific to me and my field than I realize (I lean qual and I don't have a lab). However, I'd love for people to add on and help each other out. A lot of times, grad school is one of those experiences without a handbook, so maybe this will improve someone's well being while here.\n\nGeneral Philosophy:\n\n1. **Trust your capabilities, not your knowledge.** You are a capable person who will get through grad school and do what you need to do. You do not, however, know everything. There is an overwhelming amount of things you will never know. Don\u2019t fret about it. Especially in the beginning of grad school, it is far better to admit what you don\u2019t know than pretend to know it. It\u2019s okay to be wrong, too. Expertise will come naturally. You will suddenly have a huge amount of knowledge on an esoteric topic because you\u2019ve worked to do so. You\u2019ve got this, and will continue to have it. I think this mindset is one of the reasons I\u2019ve avoided the dreaded imposter syndrome (it also really helps that I have good advisors, I don\u2019t care what people think about me, and I\u2019ve faced all lot of adversity). Just because you don\u2019t know how to do something or don\u2019t know something yet doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t handle it.\n2. **Do not compete.** Everyone comes to grad school with vastly different academic backgrounds, levels of maturity, levels of financial support, and skills. Each person will specialize enough (hopefully?) that you do not have to compete with people in your program. Be genuinely happy for their successes. Share tips on how you got yours. You are not in grad school to win it. (Full disclosure: everyone in my department is fully funded. This may not be the case in places where people compete for funding).\n3. **A healthy amount of caring is good.** Your mental health is more important than a course assignment. Your article will never be perfect. Not everyone will like you. If you don\u2019t have a good amount of distance from grad school, you won\u2019t be able to grow. You should work hard and believe in your work, but not be so attached you can\u2019t take criticism, for example. I feel like I don\u2019t care about 15% and this works for me.\n4. **Be deliberate.** Each choice in grad school is a strategic one to get a career later. In my case, I go to a ton of professionalization seminars, try to hit two conferences a year, and got a certificate in a related field to try to be open to jobs. Your choices should help you further your career because grad school is a job. It\u2019s okay to mess up, but this mentality will help you later.\n5. **Be nice.** Be nice to everyone. You never know who talks to whom. Office staff usually have a lot of intel about grad students. A faculty member you don\u2019t work with might put in a good word. It\u2019s very possible there will be a couple of individuals you don\u2019t like and cannot interact well with (I have two). My advice is to avoid them, and engage politely when need be. When I came to grad school, I had no money and couldn\u2019t afford new clothes until about 6 months in. There were a few people who made rude comments about it. It was entirely unnecessary, and brought me way more stress than I needed. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n6. **Create boundaries.** Some people are very strict with this, like only working 9-5 or not checking emails on the weekend. I do this more on the fly by prioritizing stuff I need to do outside of work. This is much easier to do once you\u2019re no longer taking courses, and depends on your boss.\n7. **Remember why you\u2019re here.** I think everyone has at least one moment where they wonder if should drop out. My most significant one was my first year. I have dyslexia, and when I had a typo on a draft, a senior faculty told me to drop out because I would never learn how to spell. My mentors talked me out of it. I am here because I like the aspects of what I want to do and think my work is important. \n8. **It\u2019s okay if stuff changes.** It\u2019s totally fine if your interests change. You may not do a dissertation on what you came in to do. It\u2019s okay if your priorities shift. I actually gained a fair amount of weight my first two years of grad school because I was food secure and I sat a lot. I wasn\u2019t worried; a lot of the conditions of graduate school are not permanent.\n9. **Be able to explain what you do and why it\u2019s important.** Elevator pitches are really emphasized in my department. One instance on the way back from a conference a border patrol official asked me what I studied, and I was able to answer in one sentence. People want to be interested in your work without hearing everything you\u2019ve ever done. You\u2019ll also be married to a topic for a while at a certain point, so make sure you like it, and make sure you know why other people should care.\n10. **If you feel like complaining, channel it.** I don\u2019t like a bunch of the policies at my institution. I also don\u2019t think grad students are treated particularly well. I joined the grad student government and helped advocate directly to officials so I would feel so powerless. That might be an approach that\u2019s specific to me, though. Activism, mentorship, and other avenues might be more appropriate.\n\nMentorship:\n\n1. **Always ask.** Always ask about opportunities. This can be anything from fellowships to working with faculty to co-authorship to reading a draft. The worst someone can do is say no. This is not a good job for someone who cannot handle rejection.\n2. **Have more than one mentor.** Your advisor should be the captain of the ship, but it\u2019s good to have other people to lean on and learn from. You will have to build a committee after all. Plus, advisors are not infallible.\n3. **Find mentors that care about you as a person.** This is a best case scenario. You want a mentor that will go to bat for you. You want one who looks out for you and asks how you're doing. My mentors have invited me to holidays and got my mom a doctor. I always came from a low income background, so having mentors help me navigate that was crucial.\n4. **Find more advanced students.** Some of them will have very good, specific advice. A lot of them want to pass on their wisdom. Take this with a grain of salt, however. For example, I had a scandal in my department, so everyone who started the program before it had a very different experience than I did.\n\nTime management:\n\n1. **The matrix.** I got this from my advisor, who is good at time management. Sort your tasks into four quadrants like so:\n\nImportant and Urgent | Important But Not Urgent\n---|---\nUrgent But Not Important| Neither Important Nor Urgent\n\nDo box 1 first, and do box 4 last. 2 and 3 are more judgment calls. This stops me from checking my email 400 times instead of actually making a deadline.\n\n2. (not sure why this is showing up as 1, it should be 2). **Use a to-do list.** I use an app called Habitica because I like that it gives me daily and long term goals (also I earn cute digital animals, which is an incentive for me). Some people write them. Mapping out what you actually need to do ensures you know it, even if you don\u2019t want to do it.\n3. **Allow yourself to do other things.** Studies show that people who intend to work for hours uninterrupted do not do as well as those who schedule breaks. Have lunch with other grad students. Go to that job talk. The ability to show up is provided you can spare the time, but generally you have more time than you think you do, unless you\u2019re hitting a deadline.\n\nReading:\n\n1. **Reading is easier than not.** It is easier to have read and know things in a course, for example, than to pretend you know things. If you\u2019re meeting an academic, it\u2019s easier to have read some of their articles than to vaguely know what they\u2019ve done. Reading is a part of your job at this point. That being said...\n2. **Don\u2019t read everything closely.** Not everything will be of use to you. Focus on works in your subjects. If you need to skim, read the introductions and conclusions. Read the first and last sentences. Read enough to comprehend.\n3. **Sometimes you only have time for an abstract.** As I\u2019ve mentioned before, sometimes there\u2019s just too much knowledge to know. Sometimes you don\u2019t have access to the full article. Sometimes you don\u2019t need to know the methods, just the conclusions.\n4. **Pomodoro.** I use the Pomodoro method, which is 25 minutes on and 5 minutes off. This helps me quantify work I\u2019ve done and makes me feel more accomplished. It also ensures I don\u2019t rush the end of pieces. I was messing up my back from sitting for long periods of time, so this forces me to get up periodically.\n\nWriting:\n\n1. **Actually write everything down.** Do you know how many times I\u2019ve had a good idea while I\u2019m in the shower and I think I\u2019ll remember it and then I really don\u2019t? It\u2019s an embarrassing amount of times. You won\u2019t always remember. I remedy this by having a word vomit document for each project.\n2. **Write 30 minutes a day.** Some days you won\u2019t make it, and that\u2019s okay. However, most days you can fit that much, and you\u2019ll feel better about days you can fit more.\n3. **Track your writing.** It will show you how much your actually working and what work you\u2019ve done that day. It was cool to know my master thesis took 65 hours of dedicated writing (not including data collection and analysis).\n4. **Start writing term papers over breaks.** This one is a no-brainer. Breaks are not for relaxing in grad school, or at least not fully. Getting ahead is easier than trying to crank out 15-25 pages (about the normal length in my field) for three classes while grading finals.\n5. **Use resources.** There\u2019s no shame in wanting to improve your writing; in fact, it\u2019s part of your job. Looking for help is not a problem. Start a writing group with some friends. Go to the writing center. Read books on style. Get a software like Grammarly. Don\u2019t be embarrassed for trying to grow.\n\nEdit: I'm so glad this blew up! So much good advice in the comments. I feel like helping each other is really what this community's about.\n",

Breaks are not for relaxing in grad school, or at least not fully.\n\nA real solid break where you spend at least a week not working on any grad school is very important to do once or twice a year for avoiding burnout. It will hopefully re-energize and reinvigorate you so that you come back optimistic and determined. That break may not be spring break or winter break, but very few truly don't have at least a week to spare at the beginning or end of the summer. If that is the case you probably need better time management. \n\nA week chilling at home is great if you're low on funds, but consider getting away if you can. Booking a train, plane or bus ride or somehow making difficult to break plans helps ensure you don't keep pushing your break off indefinitely. \n",

What a PhD is in spirit is training for a career. It is intense practice and education for how to be a competent, ethical, and independent conductor of research in a given field. Hopefully a successful one too, but YMMV. \n\nOnce you recognize this, life in the PhD gets much, much better:\n\n* Worrying over the difference between an A and an A- in a field seminar is so much less important than mastering the regression techniques and/or process tracing method you need to take your project from nascent idea to proven results. \n* Worrying that you're \"not working hard enough\" isn't a problem if you treat your PhD like a job and hold yourself accountable to regular, set hours. Exceptions of course come up, but if you get into that habit of working when you are yourself most productive, and then \"turning your brain off\" at other times to engage in partnership/a hobby/friends, you'll be so much happier. \n\nIn short, if you treat this like the professional experience it truly is, you'll come out the other side a professional. Or so they tell me. Fuck, I should be studying for comps. Don't listen to me, I'm just a dumb almost-ABD.",

They are going through the same thing as you, and you can't imagine how much of a stress reliever doing this can be. During our first year in my PhD program, a group of us started doing it. At the end of the same class, every week, we would head out to a nearby pub. To this day, we still have a pint once in a while (we are all fourth-year now). Lasting friendships were created this way and we continue to be each other's support system. This is actually what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s a way to socialize, to support each other in our various experiences. It\u2019s a place to talk about how this prof is a jerk or that prof is a really good resource for this or that. For us, in our second, third, fourth year, it became a place to talk about our sometimes difficult relationship with our supervisor, our thesis that is driving us crazy, our ideas about dropping out. And how do you make this happen? You don\u2019t really know anyone in your class, you say? You take the lead and suggest it. None of you know each other yet; someone takes their courage and suggests it. Everybody will be like OMG YES I NEEDED THIS. Of course, some people don\u2019t drink. This is what non-alcohol drinks were made for. Trust me, it works. It breaks the isolation. Everyone needs that, especially in that first make-it-or-break-it year.",

          "text": "True; from my experiences as a soon-ish to grad PhD, it seems that new students (in molecular biology at least) tend to over-estimate their knowledge and competency.  I did it, almost every other student I mentored has done it.  It just seems natural that as you gain some knowledge of the field.  It takes hitting that first wall before you understand just how difficult this stuff is.  That wall is the first real level of knowledge.  And this is where the qualities of a good student really begin to stand out; once you realize what you don't know and don't understand, either about your field or the methodologies used to study it, you can begin to build a game plan for learning that information.  Don't know why you use this reagent instead of that? Time to go read.  The ones who are willing enough to take a step back and realize that they know very little are the ones who have jumped forward!",
