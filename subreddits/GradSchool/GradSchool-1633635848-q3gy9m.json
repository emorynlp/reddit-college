  "title:": "Bad English in papers",
  "text": "So the more I read papers the more I find instances of sloppy English and generally bad low quality prose. This happens especially with authors from certain countries but it's not unique to those.\n\nNow I'm not saying everyone needs to be a pro, I myself am not a native so I know the struggle and I'm far from perfect anyway, but I also think that there should absolutely be minimal standards. I know that my thesis got GRILLED by my supervisor, he literally picked it apart bit by bit to spot the tiniest mistakes or even just things that wouldn't sound quite right, and he even had me meet a scientific writing professor in order to get further insight. \n\nThis seemed overkill at the time because I thought, whatever, why would I bother, if the thesis reads half decently and people can understand the whole thing then it must be okay surely? But honestly now I realize just how tremendously it helped me build (or at least try to build!) a discourse that isn't just grammatically correct, but also enticing and professional, which makes me extremely proud. So many papers are written in a way that makes them look like the authors didn't put that much effort, which in turn invalidates their whole work. I'm sorry if your English is not great, but people need to understand that the way they write is just as important as the subject itself. \n\nAnd I'm not necessarily talking about big obvious flaws, but even smaller things like commas in the wrong position or \"important\" repeated all over a chapter. I think every journal should at least have some editor that specifically works on this and prevents papers with weak English to make it to the final publication. Am I wrong in this? Am I turning it into too much of a big deal?",

      "text": "I do agree that there should be a minimum standard, but in my opinion, that standard should be that you are able to effectively communicate. If you are able to effectively communicate in writing, then beyond that, I don't necessarily see the advantage of grilling someone about arbitrary grammar mistakes in a paper (unless it's for an English / Literature degree or something like that specifically). I know I might be in the minority in the world of academia, but that's just my opinion.",

      "text": "Funny I would argue the opposite in the sense that they OVERLY focus on having \u201cproper English\u201d.\n\nI can often tell when an article was written by a non native speaker. I\u2019ve noticed that non native English speakers can often write the most overly convoluted sentences that make it just a headache to read.  Like, it\u2019s grammatically 100% correct but just structure and vocabulary wise it\u2019s so clunky and unnecessarily complicated.",

      "text": "Not everyone has the means to write in perfect English or to pay someone to proofread their papers. Writing about science is hard, and writing in a foreign language is even harder. Imo the important thing is that the writing is understandable. Perfect prose is for novels. Judging scholars for this puts a heavy burden on them, and excludes diverse scholars. Then, it's a fact that when a language is a lingua franca, you're naturally going to find different levels of proficiency. In addition, there's not just English, but you have Englishes. So which variety is the perfect one for writing about science? I'll also add that sometimes reviewers ask native authors to have their paper checked by a native speaker.",
