      "text": "This. \nI lost my entire masters thesis and dataset (I\u2019m graduating in May) a week ago because my thumb drive had started randomly ejecting. I lost it while trying to back everything up onto an external hard drive as soon as this started happening. The thumb drive ejected mid-copy and broke/poofed all of the files. I did have a backup from two weeks previous and managed to piece ~60% of my project back together from different places, but I ultimately lost two weeks of my life in data, all of my resource-PDF hi-lighting/notes, and almost all of my lit review because I didn\u2019t back everything up weekly. My rough draft is due to my committee this Friday and I\u2019m grinding hard to rewrite everything while also tackling midterms. \n\nIf you know you\u2019re terrible about backing things up, put it all on a cloud! Any cloud! GoogleDrive, OneDrive, Box, whatever you have access to. Most of them have real-time, autosave features so any edits you do will immediately save in the cloud. Don\u2019t wait until your current storage device starts to act up to do something about it. ",

The nice thing about this is that I can access them from anywhere with an internet connection. This is nice because when we\u2019re discussing a reading in class, I can pull up my notes and/or review on my phone or any other device I have with me for reference. \n\nI also use it to back up my desktop, all my music and photos and my entire movie collection, plus a few from the local library. I can watch them through my Xbox, my computers, my phone, my tablet, or practically any internet connected display. \n\nMy specific setup was a bit pricey, but there are many more affordable NAS options from Synology and other companies. I prefer it because I don\u2019t have to rely on Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon, or anyone else to keep my data safe. If something goes wrong, I\u2019m pretty much the only one I can blame. \n\nIt\u2019s also nice because if you get a new computer, you don\u2019t need to migrate files, just install your programs. \n\nA quick note for anyone who wants to setup a NAS. Always use a RAID configuration for redundancy AND a UPS (uninterrupted power supply). It\u2019s basically a fancy surge protector with a built in battery. The main cause of drive failure is sudden power loss. The UPS prevents this, but not indefinitely. It does, however, give you the opportunity to turn the device off properly before the battery dies. With the RAID configuration, even if one fails, as long as you replace and sync it before another one fails, you shouldn\u2019t lose any data. Since mine has 5 drives, I can lose two drives before I lose data. It\u2019s also a good idea to keep a spare drive of the same type as the ones you\u2019re using, in case of drive failure. You never know what could happen while you hunt down a replacement. ",

I worked on a presentation with a colleague who used Google Documents exclusively. \n\nIt was such a pain, the web formatting for Google's applications are horrendous, it doesn't even look visually appealing in their own browser, let alone the formatting nightmare you get to deal with when you download it as a microsoft office file and try to work on it locally. \n\nAlso it goes even farther, my phone (currently using an iPhone) would be kept up to date as all of my OneDrive files are synced with the Files app from Apple and I can pull those files whenever I need to either for reference or to make some small modifications here and there. \n\nThe funniest thing though is my university ended up putting together a working group to see which would make more financial sense, pay for Google Apps OR Microsoft Office. They ended up choosing Google Apps. \n\nThe next year, they kept Google Apps (probably due to contractual obligations) and provided Office 365 to all students... \n\nThey could have, you know, just used Office 365 from the beginning and called it a day (and saved a few dollars).
