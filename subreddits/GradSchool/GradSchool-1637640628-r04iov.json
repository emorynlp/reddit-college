  "text": "Hi all. I have a slight confusion here. Many schools' application includes sections for me to input experience and employment, but I reckon they're already described in my CV.\n\nShould I just copy paste the same thing from my CV to those? (doesn't feel right)\n\nIf they should be slightly different, which one should be of more importance (with more details)?\n\nPlease advise.",
