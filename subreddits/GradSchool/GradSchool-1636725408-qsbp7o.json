  "text": "Is this normal? I'm so close to closing this chapter in my life and moving on to greener pastures. I have a good paying job lined up in an interesting field at a company that actually values its workers. The only thing left is integrating the latest feedback into my dissertation. However every time I try to sit down and do it, I feel a significant amount of hatred and repulsion at the task. It takes an enormous amount of energy to complete any thesis-related task. Worst part is that nobody seems to understand. Everyone just brushes it off as oh yeah just hang in there you're so close! But I just want someone to tell me that it's OK or something idk. Also how am I supposed to write a good conclusion to my thesis when the contents are like all over the place?",

If you have some time and all you need is to integrate feedback, can you take 2 weeks off and do absolutely nothing related to the dissertation? Perhaps go camping, visit friends or family, go to a concert or sporting event or both. Just completely put it out of your mind for a bit. And then come back to it with new eyes, and the final push will be easier than if you keep trying to struggle through it.",

It looks like you can spend the next 3-4 days letting it nap. \n\nYou\u2019ll get there, you made it this far.

I'm also finishing November 30th and each step I take closer to finishing my thesis I feel more and more stressed, when I feel like I should be more relieved at being so damn close to finishing!\n\nI need to edit my thesis and make it sound more professional and publishable than it currently is. Which I can do, but whenever I get the motivation to do it I get very self-critical and it's hard to have the confidence to spruce it up. \n\nI think the most important thing at this stage is to be kind to yourself, maybe practise more self-care than usual, because it's evidently a lot more mentally taxing than we thought it would be!",

It takes a supreme effort of will to finish something like a dissertation, especially your first one.  \n\nYou will be okay.\n\nA frequent hallmark of a good scientist or a good artist is hating their work -- that's because what makes you a good scientist or a good artist is being able to spot tiny flaws throughout your work, and then going in to correct them.  You can never *not* see those flaws, even when others can't/don't see them. \n\nYou're doing two things right now:  (1) demonstrating to yourself and the world that you can finish something, and let go of the parts of it that are ready (even if not perfect); and (2) satisfying six people that you are ready to move on.  That's it.  So let go of stuff, be satisfied that better is the enemy of good enough, and zip up your arguments as best you can (noting where you're leaving things hanging, so your committee knows that you know where the loose threads are).  \n\nIn three weeks, you're going to feel as exhausted as a mother holding a newborn.  But in four weeks you will be a different person.  You'll be a person that crossed the finish line and got that degree!",

But I've let go of perfection a while back for my own sanity. Even then it's really difficult, especially because tasks like \"fixing my conclusion section\" seem so vague and I have no clue how to go about it. If someone gave me a recipe I can just follow it and bite through the pain. But to ask me to be creative is something else...",

Anyone walking the length of the Pattern gets conferred certain magical powers.  But it is not as simple as walking along an ordinary line on the floor - it takes strong willpower to do.  Toward the end motion is described as agonizingly slow and requiring a supreme effort of will, with every step an effort like moving a mountain. But there is an end to it, and also the aforementioned magical powers.\n\nConclusions is where you not only sum up your works specific outcome, but also summarize how it fits in to the larger landscape of your field.

On the other hand, the best dissertation is a \"done\" dissertation. You can do this.\n\nA running semi-joke in my circles is this: \"You know what they call a PhD grad who had a bad/all-over-the-place/whatever thesis? Doctor.\" (PhDs are the standard in my field, so replace with a different degree/title as needed.)\n\nIf feasible, I'd suggest trying to contain your dissertation-related work to a few hours a day and just trying to relax/enjoy the rest of the time. That way you can just get that part of your day over with and hopefully enjoy the rest of it.",
