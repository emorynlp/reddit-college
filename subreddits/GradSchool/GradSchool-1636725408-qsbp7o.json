  "text": "Is this normal? I'm so close to closing this chapter in my life and moving on to greener pastures. I have a good paying job lined up in an interesting field at a company that actually values its workers. The only thing left is integrating the latest feedback into my dissertation. However every time I try to sit down and do it, I feel a significant amount of hatred and repulsion at the task. It takes an enormous amount of energy to complete any thesis-related task. Worst part is that nobody seems to understand. Everyone just brushes it off as oh yeah just hang in there you're so close! But I just want someone to tell me that it's OK or something idk. Also how am I supposed to write a good conclusion to my thesis when the contents are like all over the place?",

If you have some time and all you need is to integrate feedback, can you take 2 weeks off and do absolutely nothing related to the dissertation? Perhaps go camping, visit friends or family, go to a concert or sporting event or both. Just completely put it out of your mind for a bit. And then come back to it with new eyes, and the final push will be easier than if you keep trying to struggle through it.",

You can never *not* see those flaws, even when others can't/don't see them. \n\nYou're doing two things right now:  (1) demonstrating to yourself and the world that you can finish something, and let go of the parts of it that are ready (even if not perfect); and (2) satisfying six people that you are ready to move on.  That's it.  So let go of stuff, be satisfied that better is the enemy of good enough, and zip up your arguments as best you can (noting where you're leaving things hanging, so your committee knows that you know where the loose threads are).  \n\nIn three weeks, you're going to feel as exhausted as a mother holding a newborn.
