  "title:": "Program Content vs. Institution Reputation",
  "text": "Title is pretty self explanatory. What is more important when selecting a grad program: the content of the program of the reputation of the institution. \n\nContext: I would like to get my masters in Tourism Economics with the goal of working in tourism planning for developing regions internationally. I found a perfect program but the university itself is not well-known internationally. Unfortunately I can\u2019t find similar programs in more established universities. \n\nShould I go for this program or push for a program at a more recognizable university?",

      "text": "Content over pedigree. Personally, i think the only thing your institution\u2019s reputation helps with is networking. But that\u2019s never a guarantee. You, yourself, are more influential in your ability to network and use those connections than your school\u2019s reputation. It\u2019s much more important that the content and quality of your program is good and that it is a good fit and environment for you to develop and thrive academically.",

Many programs keep track of where their graduates end up. And if/who recruits at their institution. \n\nAlso, see if they're doing internships as part of their graduate program and where people are interning.",
