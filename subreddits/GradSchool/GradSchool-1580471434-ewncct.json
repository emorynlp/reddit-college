Start working towards gaining skills that you can use outside gradschool.", "text": "I randomly came across a documentary and thought it has some great information about past grad students' shared experiences when it comes to applying to jobs outside academia. \n\n\nCurrent students need to be aware that not all PhD and postdoc positions will lead to a job in academia or tenure positions. There are hundreds of thousands of graduates every year, there are just not enough academic positions.\n\nStudents often find themselves lacking the necessary (social) skills to portray the skills they have in settings outside academia. On the other hand, those skills are very much in demand in industry, however, most students don't know where to start looking for industrial jobs or how to apply their skills. \n\n\n\nLink to the documentary which has some great advice as well. I'm not associated with them in any capacity, nor this is a post to promote their work. \nhttps://cheekyscientist.com/cheeky-scientist-documentary-full-length/\n\n\n\n\nThe documentary mentions a list of job positions, among many other positions, that grad students may be more qualified for than others.

Project management. Communication. Writing. Etc. Etc. There's no reason why anyone who had been working in industry the whole time you were in grad school wouldn't have also developed those skills. And they have the relevant industry experience on top of that. Which is significantly more important to employers. At the end of the day they just care if you can do the job and not be a dick about. The real issue is that academia is so academic niche. There's so many people working on things that are completely irrelevant outside of academia. Then they think that they can go get jobs doing something either completely different or similar but not exactly what they worked on for their PhD. Just because they have a PhD. Because they're smart and they can learn on their own. There are *some* companies/organizations who are more open minded in the sense that they are willing to teach someone the job they think has potential. But a lot places aren't like that. They just want someone who can do exactly what they want and has the experience to prove it.\n\nAll these organizations that are charging desperate grad students hundreds of dollars to join with the promise of help getting a job are scams. And these \"consultants\" that are becoming popular- my school would hire career consultants to come give presentations occasionally. Those are largely scams too. They're just people trying to profit off naive, desperate students and the abysmal job market.", "author": "stathicus", "created": 1580515660, "upvotes": 13}, "fg4vs7i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ewncct/theres_a_whole_life_outside_of_academia_start/fg4vs7i/", "text": "That's all very nice but what about us Humanities grads?

If you're driving your own project, you have project management skills (especially if you're helping an undergrad or younger grad student/postdoc, and you get the added bonus of supervisory skills). You also have initiative, and can work independently. Writing grants, papers, summaries, designing posters and power points... all communication skills. Asking your PI to help you underserved how grant budgets are devised, and how your project costs fit into the lab budget are now budgeting skills. Have involvement in a collaboration? That's team work.\n\nAnd ultimately, your entire existence is to be a problem solver.

They\u2019ll hand out some contacts and will most likely take you out for coffee - they always need bright people. Got asked if I was interested in internships and what not within < hours of first contact\n\n\n2) Scientist consultant: this one I\u2019ve been doing for 3 years on the side. Good money, looks amazing on your resume and puts you in contact with a huge number of execs. Again, technology commercialization office and your local angels investor pool - start as free for first 3 months or so as you\u2019ll need loads of guidance. Money will substantially beat ANY gov issued grant as you\u2019re pulling in > $10k/y over stipend.\n\nNumber 2) opens the path towards the majority of other doors. I current got 2 fellowships almost directly as a consequence of that and I\u2019m being shortlisted for another right now - I only applied to 1, they just straight up asked if I wanted to take a shot at the others. Beyond that, it seriously increases the quality of my work and morale so much knowing that I kinda have something going on towards my post-grad career.\n\nDO NOT TELL ANYONE YOURE DOING ANY OF THIS. I only talk to my advisor to get permission. In general, people are super supportive and you can all help each other out. Unfortunately if you happen to have even 1-2 toxic people in your department they will bring that shit up to the dean because it\u2019s technically not allowed. I got a nice and politely worded letter telling me to stop and STFU from the office of research. Not nice. Other PIs might also put pressure from your PI to force you to quit since they don\u2019t want their students to do this stuff. As much as PI isn\u2019t perfect, I\u2019m blessed to know that he\u2019s on my side regardless of who says what. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m by far not the brightest person around. I just know that beggar can\u2019t be choosers and so I end up applying for anything and everything regardless of what it is. I got rejected so many times. The one time that I got accepted for a small fellowship, things started to snowball hard. You really have to grind this out, it took me a year of constant effort to get off the ground.
