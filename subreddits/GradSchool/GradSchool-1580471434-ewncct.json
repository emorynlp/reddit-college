  "title:": "There's a whole life outside of academia. Start working towards gaining skills that you can use outside gradschool.",
  "text": "I randomly came across a documentary and thought it has some great information about past grad students' shared experiences when it comes to applying to jobs outside academia. \n\n\nCurrent students need to be aware that not all PhD and postdoc positions will lead to a job in academia or tenure positions. There are hundreds of thousands of graduates every year, there are just not enough academic positions.\n\nStudents often find themselves lacking the necessary (social) skills to portray the skills they have in settings outside academia. On the other hand, those skills are very much in demand in industry, however, most students don't know where to start looking for industrial jobs or how to apply their skills. \n\n\n\nLink to the documentary which has some great advice as well. I'm not associated with them in any capacity, nor this is a post to promote their work. \nhttps://cheekyscientist.com/cheeky-scientist-documentary-full-length/\n\n\n\n\nThe documentary mentions a list of job positions, among many other positions, that grad students may be more qualified for than others. I'll just list them here:\n\nR&D scientist \n\n\nTechnology assessment and alignment manager\n\n\nR & D project manager\n\n\nQuality assurance and quality control \n\n\nHealth economics and outcomes research \n\n\nApplication scientist \n\n\nMarket research analyst\n\n\nProduct manager\n\n\nCapital equipment specialist \n\n\nMarketing and communications specialist \n\n\nQuantitative analyst \n\n\nEquity research analyst \n\n\nClinical research coordinator \n\n\nClinical research organization employee \n\n\nCompetitive intelligence analyst\n\n\nBusiness development manager \n\n\nBusiness analyst \n\n\nScientific consultant \n\n\nScience public policy advisor\n\n\nScience ethics advisor\n\n\nGrant facilitator\n\n\nHealthcare informatics technologist \n\n\nBusiness intelligence analyst\n\n\nData scientist\n\n\nOperations research analyst\n\n\nRegulatory affairs\n\n\nMedical affairs \n\n\nMedical science liaison \n\n\nClinical research associate\n\n\nIP lawyer\n\n\nPatent agent or scientific consultant \n\n\nTechnology transfer officer\n\n\nPatent examiner",

I dont care about your personal journey. I care about what hard and soft skills you bring to the position that will help our company succeed.  \n\nAt this point you are no longer resume building. You are career building. A job isnt a learning opportunity. You will learn, but we are paying you for you know and can do.  I know you will move on at some point, but if you talk about your NEXT step in the interview you wont get to take THIS step. Ive had too many talented PhDs with good CVs fail to understand how work actually works. \n\n\nNot every PhD in industry does this but every PhD Ive seen struggling in industry does this.",

      "text": "The whole \"transferable skills\" bandwagon is bullshit. Project management. Communication. Writing. Etc. Etc. There's no reason why anyone who had been working in industry the whole time you were in grad school wouldn't have also developed those skills. And they have the relevant industry experience on top of that. Which is significantly more important to employers. At the end of the day they just care if you can do the job and not be a dick about. The real issue is that academia is so academic niche. There's so many people working on things that are completely irrelevant outside of academia. Then they think that they can go get jobs doing something either completely different or similar but not exactly what they worked on for their PhD. Just because they have a PhD. Because they're smart and they can learn on their own. There are *some* companies/organizations who are more open minded in the sense that they are willing to teach someone the job they think has potential. But a lot places aren't like that. They just want someone who can do exactly what they want and has the experience to prove it.\n\nAll these organizations that are charging desperate grad students hundreds of dollars to join with the promise of help getting a job are scams. And these \"consultants\" that are becoming popular- my school would hire career consultants to come give presentations occasionally. Those are largely scams too. They're just people trying to profit off naive, desperate students and the abysmal job market.",

This is why I was reluctant on posting the documentary link, because it leads to a website promoting services which I don't necessarily agree with. \n\n\nThe message that I wanted to highlight is exactly what you said. In addition to what you mentioned, some students' work is not even reproducible outside research environments. The main goal is publishable results, instead of reproducibility of results or the future development of research into anything useful. It's acceptable to publish results with 40-50% error margins in academia, whereas industry standards range below 5% error.  \n\n\nInstead of students being fully focused on lab work and publishable results, which often limits their skillset, they should also be looking into the job market early on to develop skills they will need in jobs.",

You also have initiative, and can work independently. Writing grants, papers, summaries, designing posters and power points... all communication skills. Asking your PI to help you underserved how grant budgets are devised, and how your project costs fit into the lab budget are now budgeting skills. Have involvement in a collaboration? That's team work.\n\nAnd ultimately, your entire existence is to be a problem solver.

They\u2019ll hand out some contacts and will most likely take you out for coffee - they always need bright people. Got asked if I was interested in internships and what not within < hours of first contact\n\n\n2) Scientist consultant: this one I\u2019ve been doing for 3 years on the side. Good money, looks amazing on your resume and puts you in contact with a huge number of execs. Again, technology commercialization office and your local angels investor pool - start as free for first 3 months or so as you\u2019ll need loads of guidance. Money will substantially beat ANY gov issued grant as you\u2019re pulling in > $10k/y over stipend.\n\nNumber 2) opens the path towards the majority of other doors. I current got 2 fellowships almost directly as a consequence of that and I\u2019m being shortlisted for another right now - I only applied to 1, they just straight up asked if I wanted to take a shot at the others. Beyond that, it seriously increases the quality of my work and morale so much knowing that I kinda have something going on towards my post-grad career.\n\nDO NOT TELL ANYONE YOURE DOING ANY OF THIS. I only talk to my advisor to get permission. In general, people are super supportive and you can all help each other out. Unfortunately if you happen to have even 1-2 toxic people in your department they will bring that shit up to the dean because it\u2019s technically not allowed. I got a nice and politely worded letter telling me to stop and STFU from the office of research. Not nice. Other PIs might also put pressure from your PI to force you to quit since they don\u2019t want their students to do this stuff. As much as PI isn\u2019t perfect, I\u2019m blessed to know that he\u2019s on my side regardless of who says what. \n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m by far not the brightest person around. I just know that beggar can\u2019t be choosers and so I end up applying for anything and everything regardless of what it is. I got rejected so many times. The one time that I got accepted for a small fellowship, things started to snowball hard. You really have to grind this out, it took me a year of constant effort to get off the ground. This consistency is actually what gets you noticed. Stability is also not a thing.",

              "text": "The key is to find people with problems, bring them potential solutions and show them that you have at least a good idea of the trade off of the stuff you\u2019re proposing. How you find them is unique to your individual situation, but I recommend to stay away from people in your own field. \n\nThe way I got into it was that I got wind of a posting of a program over in the liberal arts. I just brought a bunch of potential approaches to the table that were backed up by papers I found. As in, I came into the room with a stack of papers. A lot of these were funky, but they were different and a guaranteed smash hit if it works. I did not have the  knowledge or any of the skills required to actually carry them out, but that\u2019s where my research experience came in and I learnt those on the fly. It worked (barely) but people loved it and I pitched immediately with a follow up project on how to improve it. After that, words of mouth helped me big time. \n\nTo be clear, this was the one that worked. I also tried numerous different approaches that failed miserably and embarrassingly. Some of the bad ones include writing technology development proposals to F500 (they laughed me out), pitching to angel investors (I got destroyed), pitching to my own department (I got scolded), running my own project (I got funding but it failed) etc. You really never know what might stick - you just have to try them all. Your ego will be bruised and as I said, I was grinding at it 10h/week for a whole year before anything came to fruition. Realistically, if you want a straightforward and surefire approach I can\u2019t give you one because I failed a lot.",

I was just having a conversation about this earlier this week. \n\nSoooo many people  get stuck on the grad school hamster wheel, losing sight of the need for soft skills and simply being able to function in a variety of settings.\n\nI will be on the job market soon, so I will definitely be watching this!",
