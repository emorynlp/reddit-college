I held a baby and rocked it to sleep with my left arm and typed most of my papers and master's thesis with my right. It's obviously slower, but it keeps the work flowing.\n\nI also used any method I could to have texts read to me whenever possible. It's worth investing in (or pirating ;) ) a copy of Adobe Acrobat. It can scan image PDFs into readable text. It has a text to speech function. You can also sort PDFs to a word document, and create your own ebook that you upload to Google play books, which has great text to speech tech. I used this method to free to time in my day. I listened to readings while I cleaned the house, did dishes, laundry, dinner, took the baby out for walks, etc. While at home, I would leave a copy out for me to make notes on when needed while I was listening and doing housework.", "author": "strykerace1985", "created": 1553225733, "upvotes": 12}, "ej3au68": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/b3wykj/baby_grad_school_achievement_unlocked/ej3au68/", "text": "Finished my program at 9 months pregnant.

If you're nursing, protect your time to pump or feed. Let that time be work-free. It'll help reduce stress. Know it is ok to come home from work and be mom.
