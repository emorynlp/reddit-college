Sometimes if my friend or SO is going out to a store or for an errand I\u2019ll go, but I never hang out with people during the week. I\u2019m just too tired and I have to get up extra early for the commute. However, I have plans or do something fun almost every weekend. Either going over my friends or actually going somewhere. \n\nIs anyone else like this? It\u2019s probably different if you live in campus because everyone is closer by, but my friend is having a campfire now with some of our other friends and idk, I have no desire to even hang with groups of people during the week until Thursday/Friday. I\u2019m also the only friend out of my original friend group in grad school", "author": "SnooWords4107", "created": 1632795248, "retrieved": 1632843928, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hejrkr2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwwb6p/dae_only_do_fun_things_or_friend_activities_on/hejrkr2/", "text": "I still don\u2019t do much during the week, and I\u2019m a post-doc.
