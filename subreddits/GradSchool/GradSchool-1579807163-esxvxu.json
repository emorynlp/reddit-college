I'm looking into applying to PhD programs in my mid- late 20s because I'm burning out of the workforce grind and my job and want to just go back to being a student again. I miss learning new things.

If I get too overwhelmed, I don't get anything done. So I will take a day off and do nothing. I \"waste\" a whole day of work, but I'm so much more productive/not on the verge of a breakdown, that I do way better work when I come back.",

I went in on Wednesday but all I got was through emails.  \n\nI'm not coming off a conference schedule like your's, but I finally finished my first project and I'm waiting for some feedback on the paper.  The bossman says he \"likes the first half\", so that;s positive, but I'm still waiting on feedback (going on week 3) and i'm struggling to get motivated to work on prj #2.  \n\nI'm thinking of going to the store and getting a giant poster paper to do a mind map/outline thing to just get something on paper.",
