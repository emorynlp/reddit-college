I was doing the applications just because that's the thing expected of us.\n\nAlso I feel like I've been trying so hard to \"play both sides\" and it hasn't worked. Applying for postdocs while looking for work outside of academia just wasn't working.\n\nIts also frightening to say outloud, \"I dont want this anymore\". Theres also a risk that I won't even get a non academic job. And I, personally, am very risk adverse. That's why I wanted tenure; so noone can fire me! But I have to be real with myself too.\n\nGrad school is hard.

This post really makes me want to just not even apply for postdocs because I am pretty sure at this point I want to go into industry. I definitely do not want to be a professor, but I think a postdoc could be fun. Also, I feel a bit stuck and obligated to apply to this one fellowship because I was internally nominated by my school and I literally took other people's spots and I don't currently have a job lined up. But I don't feel like having to deal with both job hunting in industry and academia. That sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nFor my own sake, I am going to try to go through the pros and cons here\n\n**pros of a postdoc:**\n\n\\+ learn new things from new people and perspectives (but a job also has this benefit)\n\n\\+ get to live somewhere new temporarily (ok covid might ruin this, and again with job hopping this is also possible in industry)\n\n\\+ i am more confident now in my research abilities than i was throughout grad school\n\n\\+ i know more about what i want to study versus at the beginning of grad school\n\n\\+ i feel like i don't know anything and i need to learn more before i go into a job (i think this reason is BS because I am going to feel like this no matter when i start a job)\n\n**cons:**\n\n\\- money lol\n\n\\- work life balance is horrible\n\n\\- i'm just delaying my ultimate career choice in industry because I don't like change and I know what I'm getting with a postdoc but a postdoc will just slow down my career in industry\n\n\\- if i'm honest with myself, i'm just not that passionate about research and what i do so i am probably going to be miserable\n\n\\- writing bs papers that don't help anyone versus working in industry and have immediate tangible effects/changes\n\n\\- if i \"fail\" at a postdoc, does that hurt my chances of getting good industry job", "author": "doubleaxel1951", "created": 1604594249, "upvotes": 1}, "gayzgnz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/jmpizd/i_just_withdrew_all_my_postdoc_applications/gayzgnz/", "text": "Congrats, stay as far away from academia as possible.
