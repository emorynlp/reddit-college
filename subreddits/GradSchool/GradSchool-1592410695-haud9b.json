  "title:": "[Update] to Just found out that my advisor died",
  "text": "Previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/ekxq7t/just_found_out_that_my_advisor_died/)\n\nI graduated! After my advisor died in January, I spent about two months being redirected around academic advisors and chairs in two departments about what could possibly happen for me before I gave a presentation to my committee updating them on what I had done since my general exam. They decided that I had made adequate progress, and combined with my work in my master's project before switching lab groups I could write a dissertation. A member of my committee became my third advisor and we had some ideas for a few more experiments or modeling to round out the project, but the department was not willing to fund me in summer quarter, and Covid-19 closed all the labs I needed to use anyway. So all of spring quarter was writing up my results and preparing a defense, including an introduction that attempted to tell a story combining both of my projects, as well as TAing (thankfully the easiest class in the department to do so). Then I defended last week and I'm a PhD! Not the most proud of how it turned out but hopefully I can find a job this summer somewhere in renewable energy. Thanks all!",

Your department thought well enough of both you and your deceased advisor to make sure you could continue. (That is not always the case.) The next steps are as hard, sometimes harder than earning the doctorate, so take some time to relax, regenerate your body and your soul, and look hopefully into the next phase.\n\n**CONGRATULATIONS AND BEST WISHES.**",
