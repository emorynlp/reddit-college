I really struggle with ADHD and school, and this is no exception.\nI started a new medication for it and it has been horrible and made homework almost impossible.\nI feel like I can\u2019t study or do the confusing assignments without having a panic attack.\n\nIt honestly feels like I won\u2019t make it this term. Maybe I\u2019m being catastrophic.\n\nHas anyone been through this and out the other side?",

      "text": "Would you possibly be able to get accommodations through your university\u2019s disability office for ADHD, particularly if it\u2019s an issue of figuring out the right medicine at the moment? You don\u2019t have to use accommodations permanently if you don\u2019t want them (but they\u2019re certainly there for a reason if they help regardless) \u2014 but I get and have gone through finding the right meds not being a fun process. I can\u2019t imagine dealing with that during the school year. If the side effects are unbearable, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your doctor instead of making yourself miserable. Best of luck!!",

      "text": "I suggest looking into academic accommodations if you have an official diagnosis. Hopefully your school can provide good counseling services as well. Medication can help sometimes but figuring out skills that work for you will be very useful. I recommend listening to the podcast \u201ctranslating ADHD\u201d. \n\nAlso, maybe post on a few ADHD subreddits (I think there\u2019s one geared towards school but can\u2019t remember the name) for more targeted advice. ADHD and school is challenging but I hope you can make it work!",
