It was a complete non-issue. Asking why I was leaving grad school took maybe five minutes of my interview.\n\nThis is the job I would have gone for after completing my PhD, and I got it with the same salary. They\u2019ve already assured me that if everything works out they\u2019d be happy to help me do a PhD when the world returns to normal.\n\nAnyway. I know a lot of people are freaked out like I was. I just wanted to share how well it worked out for me despite how totally helpless and despondent I\u2019ve felt as a COVID PhDropout.

If this is the case, it may make little sense to remain in your PhD.\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves in academia was the pressure imposed on all of us to *remain* in the PhD path and to never drop out.
