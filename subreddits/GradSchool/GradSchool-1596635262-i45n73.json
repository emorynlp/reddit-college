  "title:": "I'm weeks away from being a 5th year PhD student in biochemistry. Along the way, I've observed a pattern of how each year of grad school goes.",
  "text": "Obviously everyone's unique, but I've definitely noticed this pattern among my peer group. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. (Also, take with like 75% facetiousness) \n\nFirst year: Overwhelmed, excited, \"freshman eyes\". Rotations and classes keep you from getting much done.\n\nSecond year: Bright-eyed and bushy tailed, you work a ton, but get basically nothing done because you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThird year: Grad school depression hits. Constant existential crisis, consider leaving grad school because you start wondering what the point is. Don't get much done because you're sad.\n\nFourth year: You get over the hump, but fall into \"I don't give a shit anymore\" valley. Not crying as much anymore, but also not getting as much done because the apathy is strong.\n\nFifth year and beyond: Apathy turns to spite. You're so ready to be done and get the hell out of here, you get more work done in three months than you did in the entire first four years of your PhD. Not enjoying it anymore, but you drive yourself purely off of the energy of \"getting back\" at the hellish experience of grad school. Then you graduate and beg everyone to please not call you \"Doctor\" because it makes you uncomfortable (maybe that last part's just me lol)\n\nPlease present alternate timelines in similar snark in the comments. We can do this, y'all!",

But strong people learn to embrace the suck, embrace the challenge and overcome. That's what's awesome about grad school: everyone faces that same sequence in the first 3 years, and who you are as a person and what you have learned about adversity determines how you respond.",

If every person is coming here for an occasional vent, then it does look like everyone is drowning in self misery but it could just be that grad school is hard and a bunch of people need that at once. \n\nI also wouldn't say that splitting people into strong and weak is very supportive.

It's commonality is merely an indication that our society and educational system do not seek to cultivate resilience and mental toughness as attributes. Science is simply a hard discipline which requires hard people, doesn't build them for it and so no wonder you would see brokenness as a result. People who have been in the military, certain sports, or who have faced significant adversity in their lives have had this cultivated. Most who have excelled at school to the point of reaching grad school have not had these hardening experiences. It is a muscle that can be build and improved.",

For those students, it's like someone dropped a full time job on top of everything they did their first year, except with double the learning curve. You do all the same stuff AND also you get to be a therapist (for the first time) 20 hours a week, which is honestly super scary and intimidating AND you get to learn another job for your funding (also 20 hours a week), which can ALSO be scary and intimidating, such as teaching your own undergraduate class for the first time. \n\nIt's a hard year.",

So my timeline is like this:\n\n\nYear 1 - Uncertainty about future, heavy course load and rotations (five in all).\n\n\nYear 2 - First time teaching, adapting to new lab, working on projects but not really because it\u2019s early days and I don\u2019t know shit. Our candidacy exams happen in Spring of 2nd year. After months of studying, last minute panic driven experiments to produce preliminary data, passed the candidacy. \n\nYear 3 - Was relaxed at passing candidacy until PI drops bomb. Says he never really liked the project which I took to candidacy. Wants me to start from scratch. So i did. \n\nYear 4 Fall - Frustrated, depressed. Nothing is working. Long days teaching and longer days in lab with little usable data. \n\nYear 4 Spring - Things finally looking up, experiments working. Then Covid!\n\nBasically that\u2019s where I am. The average graduation time in my lab is 6.5 to 7 years. The last student who just graduated took 8 years. My PI is very insistent that every student has their sole project. So usually students don\u2019t publish until their 5-6th years anyway since it\u2019s always a single author paper. I\u2019m really lost and PhD and worn me down. And I\u2019m only approaching year 5. I really want to get out. Fingers crossed.",

My PI is also very insistent that we all have our own projects, so students in my lab also don't publish a first-author paper until literally 90%+ of their dissertation research data is done, and it's usually in the last year or the year after leaving. He's all about the big, huge storyline. I'm crossing my fingers that things continue to just go smoothly without a ton of irrational stress and don't get worn down much more than this. The real world is a bit terrifying, especially now, but I also don't want to be a student for much longer. I deserve better pay than this!",

Crazy clients/owners who think they know better than you and insist you use outdated treatments because \u201cthat\u2019s how they\u2019ve always done it\u201d. Rampant sexism, especially in certain specialities, affecting all manner of things from pay to getting stabbed in the back by coworkers. My sister is a large-animal vet specializing in racehorses and has literally had people scream at her, publicly, that the only reason anyone uses her as their vet is that they just want to fuck her. Then there\u2019s the whole \u201cmed bikini\u201d debacle recently.\n\nNot to be a downer but the suicide rate is disturbingly high in veterinarians and it\u2019s really something that needs to be discussed more.",
