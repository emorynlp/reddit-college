Along the way, I've observed a pattern of how each year of grad school goes.", "text": "Obviously everyone's unique, but I've definitely noticed this pattern among my peer group. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. (Also, take with like 75% facetiousness) \n\nFirst year: Overwhelmed, excited, \"freshman eyes\". Rotations and classes keep you from getting much done.\n\nSecond year: Bright-eyed and bushy tailed, you work a ton, but get basically nothing done because you don't know what you're doing.\n\nThird year: Grad school depression hits. Constant existential crisis, consider leaving grad school because you start wondering what the point is. Don't get much done because you're sad.\n\nFourth year: You get over the hump, but fall into \"I don't give a shit anymore\" valley. Not crying as much anymore, but also not getting as much done because the apathy is strong.\n\nFifth year and beyond: Apathy turns to spite. You're so ready to be done and get the hell out of here, you get more work done in three months than you did in the entire first four years of your PhD. Not enjoying it anymore, but you drive yourself purely off of the energy of \"getting back\" at the hellish experience of grad school. Then you graduate and beg everyone to please not call you \"Doctor\" because it makes you uncomfortable (maybe that last part's just me lol)\n\nPlease present alternate timelines in similar snark in the comments.
