  "title:": "After months of research into graduate programs, I keep getting very disheartening messages",
  "text": "I am looking at some programs in environmental toxicology and/or microbiology, and have found some very interesting programs in environmental science that would allow me to potentially research political implications of industry inconjunction with toxicology surveying. \n\nHowever, Im reading through the various faculty, reading some of their work to get a feel for who might be in my area of interest, when I get to this message:\n\n>PLEASE NOTE: UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT ADMITTING STUDENTS FOR THE MOMENT, DUE TO NEW SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT FACULTY TAKING PRIORITY IN CHOICES. THE DIVISION OF SOCIETY & ENVIRONMENT HAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE SLOTS PER YEAR DUE TO CAMPUS FUNDING CUT-BACKS AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE GRADUATE STUDENT FUNDING PACKAGE FOR ALL STUDENTS.\n\nTo be clear: this man works at UC Berkeley.\n\nTo be clearer: I am *not* a competitive applicant.\n\nI got my bachelors 7 years ago from a low ranked state school, 3.2 GPA. Only 1 year of research experience, and it was not based in a lab (ArcGIS and survey data management). I am struggling to find letter writers because now all my past supervisors dont speak English (I am in Japan) and its been so long since I was in school. I have a nice GRE score, I think (164V, 158Q, 5W) but no one is taking those this year anyway. \n\nMy strongest aspect is, I believe, that I am quite clear on the type of research I am interested in. And, I believe I can navigate research spaces quite well when it comes to the actual science.\n\n\n\nBut seeing something like this is making me shut down a bit. Is there even any point? What am I even doing here?\n\n\nBeing out of school and entirely on my own in this, I have had no choice but to basically go through journal after journal, reading papers and then looking up authors, then looking up their schools, the requirements, the departments, the deadlines-- I must have looked at at least 30-40 schools by now, just within the US. As a result I am exhausted, and now my brain is full of too much information to sort through it all.  \n\nFinally I decided it is probably best to just start trying to talk to actual people. I sent email after email to admissions committees, to no response. So now I am looking at actual researchers, in my field, doing research I am interested in, and then... this. \n\n\nShould I even *bother* to email this guy? Or any of these people? \n\nIt's not even so much that I think I'd get in here as it is I wanted to pick their brain but now it's like... I feel like I'm bothering them, really.",

      "text": "This professor is describing the situation at many leading schools. Grad students at these schools are fully funded, but that means only a few students are admitted so that there is enough money to support them all.  They way this particular department has decided to allocate funds means that this professor is not eligible this round. \n\nThe short answer is to take the message literally, and not ask whether they are taking students. Find a different professor who can meet your educational needs. \n\nOn the second question, should you send random emails to faculty. The answer is of course, no. But you should send *targeted* emails to faculty you think would be good to work with. What is it about their work that excites you and that would allow you to pursue the research of your dreams after compelting this program. \n\nApply only to schools where you have a sense that there is a fit. Ask for a fee waiver if fees are a hardship. Most schools respond to legitimate requests.",

Should I even bother to contact the other labs I saw, which are in his same department that is apparently undergoing budget cuts? \n\n\nFor example, I have tried contacting researchers regarding their research, to perhaps ask for access to papers that I can't get outside of an institution and ask questions I have about what they do, but I've been getting absolutely stonewalled. I imagine it's stress from covid, but I don't know, maybe I'm doing something wrong. \n\n\nif they aren't responding to my requests, do you have any advice on how to make my emails look more legitimate? \n\n\nI'm trying my best to determine a best fit, but I'm no longer in school or even the same country and have no connections, so it's basically just come down to googling which isn't really giving me a complete picture. The previous experience of being ignored, plus by bad experience in undergrad and general nerves is just really psyching me out.",

If you can describe what is exciting to you about their work, you may get some good suggestions. They may also know about someone good who was recently hired somewhere. That can be a good opportunity.\n\nPeople are busy, and get more inquiries than they can respond to. Don't take the lack of response personally, hard as that is. Once you start getting connected, more connections will be easier to make.",

              "text": "Ok, that\u2019s what I wanted to make sure\u2014that a PhD was really required for what you wanted to do.\n\nThe dirty little secret of grad school is that there are a lot of graduate students and not enough jobs for them all, and yet departments take on more students so they can make more money. It\u2019s actually very responsible of this school to limit spaces and to guarantee funding\u2014it will save time, money, and frustration for students who would have been admitted, gotten the PhD, and then not been able to find a quality job. \n\nIf you still really want to pursue a PhD still, then I\u2019d continue looking even if that program isn\u2019t a good fit. Try looking for programs in your field rather than just looking at publications from professors (although that\u2019s a good method too!).  Some of them will have some openings. However, admittance will always be competitive even in the less well-known schools, so you\u2019ll want to prepare for that possibility. \n\nI\u2019m not super familiar with your field but there is another thing to consider\u2026 what if you got a more generalized degree and then just did your research on that specific niche topic? If that\u2019s at all a possibility, then you can expand your search to other programs with similar overlapping focuses (Biology? Environmental sociology? Conservation science?). I\u2019m truly not sure what those related fields might be, but I\u2019d consider it. For example, in my field some people really like demography and there a few programs that specifically look at that\u2014but most people who do demography actually go into a sociology, public admin, public health, or even criminology program and then just specialize in demography. Consider talking to someone in your field regarding whether that\u2019s a potential option for you.",

Who do I talk to?? I don't know anyone! \n\n\nI don't hang out with academics. The few I have met in the past are dismissive/condescending, or cagey about their research or their path to getting there. I don't work with academics either, I work with engineers and sales people. \n\n\nI would LOVE to talk to someone in my ideal field, but other than just emailing random people from schools I probably wouldn't stand a chance at, I don't know what to do. \n\n\nI am of course going to keep looking. But WHERE? Where does someone like me fit in? \n\n\nBeyond cold calling like hundreds of people until I finally get a reply, I don't really see any other path for someone like me. I'm sorry, I'm unloading on you. It's just, It's been fucking years I've been working at trying to find just the slightest toe inside the door and I get absolutely NOTHING in return. In my experience, schools literally don't return your emails about grad school unless you're emailing from a .edu address.  It's like I'm screaming into the void. \n\n\nHonestly I have half a mind to just go visit a campus next time im in the states and just sit outside a fucking office, but that REALLY makes me seem unhinged so idk?",

Two thoughts there: I\u2019d still reach out to them and see what they think (what other fields might they see as potential targets for this work?), and if you do apply I\u2019d still ask them for letters and then just hire a translation service to translate them for you. \n\nBeyond that, I do sympathize with your frustration, so don\u2019t feel bad about unloading here! Not having a close advisor is a disadvantage and I\u2019m sorry that you have to deal with that. \n\nThe only other option is reaching out to others. Maybe consider reaching out to generic sources\u2014are there subreddits geared toward environmental science? You could ask what kinds of degrees could be useful to help pursue a career in that field and see what they recommend, and then expand your search based on their recommendations. \n\nMy overall advice is don\u2019t give up just yet. Spend some more time considering possibilities and if you do come to the conclusion that it won\u2019t work then that\u2019s ok too\u2014you may still find another path you enjoy or even that leads you back to this same work. But maybe you\u2019ll also get lucky and find a path to grad school now! Don\u2019t spend months on this, but do spend some more days and even weeks looking since this is such a long-term focus anyway.",

I can't even speak to more than one person, or else I may lose my job. \n\n\nThat besides, I am maybe not being clear, so I do apologize: I know what degree I need to get. I can even identify who I need to work with, if I find their profile or their work through the literature. I know exactly where I want to go to do the work I want to do. \n\n\nMy problem is there are 100s of schools with 100s of different labs and I have no idea what I'm worth. Each application costs like $50-60 or more as well. Many places recommend being in touch with a graduate advisor prior to matriculation. This was my initial conundrum: do I just send out random emails from my entirely unaffiliated email address? Do I, what, attach a CV that's primarily made up of me working as a hotel maid? How do I elucidate that I have keep up my studies since graduation, if that necessitates explaining that I only gained access through illegal downloads? \n\n\n\nAnd I don't know, I just think if I could actually speak with someone I could make my case and show I belong there just as much as anyone else who has the perfect pedigree, but it's like people won't even give you the time of day unless you're an 'insider'.

      "text": "I mean yeah, you're going about this from the hardest route possible probably.  The end goal is a Ph.D., but I'd consider looking into M.S. programs.  This would allow you to bring up your GPA and get yourself into the competitive position that somewhere like Berkley requires.  This would allow you to make connections with people in your field.  There are a variety of MS programs, some that require research advisers, some that do not.  \n\n\nIf you're particularly worried about admissions in this route, backtrack to locations that are easy for you.  Maybe your hometown, where you did your undergrad, or somewhere you think you would enjoy living.  I don't know if you follow academic twitter, but there's alot raging about emails like you said right now and its pretty split.  Alot of faculty won't respond because they get too many, but even more so faculty won't respond unless you have applied.  Its a time-cost benefit for them, not great for anyone else though.  \n\n\nAdditionally, make some lists.   Start an excel or something, organize the information you said you're swimming in, something like; 1) University, 2) specific program, 3) PI, 4) location, 5) field of research.  Prioritize it, and start there.  Identify easy and free resources that could make you more competitive, are there additional free courses on Coursera you could take?  Are there funding opportunities that you don't necessarily need a university for?  E.g., if you can get the NSF GRFP people will be happy to take you as you're already paid for.  15 hours is alot of time to look at the school, but what do the people that are getting in look like on their CV's?  \n\n\nIn my mind, I would strategize like this; 1) start some free courses on topics related to your field, but also on things like R and MATLAB (or similar technical skills). 2) Identify thesis/non-thesis M.S. programs, prioritize and reach out to graduate coordinators (they're kind of obligated to respond). 3) Identify some funding options (NSF GRFP, even applying and not getting it looks good), and either straight up apply if you can, or mention in emails that you intend to apply.  \n\n\nObviously, a MS is not always required to get into Ph.D. programs, or to be competitive. But it sounds like it could be beneficial.",

But one of them met with me to talk about my interests and then connected me with the person who wound up being my advisor. My advisor actually tried to get me to work with someone else first but then agreed to take me on.\n\nSo, yeah, the process sucks. It isn't an ego boost or confidence builder, but any means. But I think emailing professors directly and then asking for recommendations of other people if they say no can be really helpful.
