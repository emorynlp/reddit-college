  "text": "Sorry just need to rant. I got an email that contained this  a few minutes ago: \n\n\"If you do not make these changes your name may not be on the paper. If you do contribute there may be a question whether you will be at the 1st or 2nd place\". \n\nI wrote all 20 pages of the paper, I solely did all the experiments. Currently there are only 2 of us on the paper, my advisor and I. I did 100% of the work so far. Now he says if I don't make the changes he wants to make, he will find someone else to do them. The changes he wants to make are absurd, make no sense in the field I am publishing in, and some changes are borderline unethical. \n\nI want to leave but my uni requires me to get my advisor's signature to change advisors which is going to be impossible at this point because I'm his only publishing student.",
