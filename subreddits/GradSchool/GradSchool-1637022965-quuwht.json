  "title:": "Feel a little guilty asking online sites to review my essays for grad school",
  "text": "I started grad school in September and have been feeling very frustrated and disappointed in myself because I failed my first course in my MBA programme. I\u2019m working full time so I really try my best to juggle work and school but it looks like I need to try harder. One of the comments my tutor shared with me was that my writing style is too descriptive and I need to be more analytical & critical. \n\nI will be submitting another assignment next week and would love to submit my essay to one of those online sites that review your essays (to see if my writing style has improved). But for some reason I am having second thoughts because I wonder if that would be considered cheating. \n\nHas anyone ever received help from sites that review your essays or papers while being in grad school? And how did you feel about it?",

It's cheating when they start writing the essay for you, making corrections for you, formatting things for you, things like that. But you say that you already *have* a tutor, so I dunno what you could get out of this website that your tutor isn't already giving you. \n\nIf I were a betting redditor then I'd bet against this being above board because \n\n1. You are considering paying for this even though you already pay for what should be essentially the same service from a tutor and \n2. Every website that offers to help students cheat for money *says* that it just offers tutoring and study resources and\n3. You're asking if this is cheating on an online forum, rather than asking your fellow students or faculty, who are more familiar with your institution's policies\n\nI *suspect* that you've described what the website if offering in the best possible terms. But obviously I don't *know* that. If you really think they're just offering to review your essay and give you pointers then you should be comfortable asking your instructor if using the website is okay, and you shouldn't feel embarrassed or worried imagining it becoming common knowledge that you used the service. That's probably the test you should be applying. Imagine those scenarios and if they feel like disasters then you should probably avoid the site.",

          "text": "Okay I see what you mean. The site only offers reviewing and feedback so I was just wondering if it would be okay to use their service. \n\nThe thing is I\u2019m studying for my degree online and to be honest, I feel like the tutors could put in a little effort into showing us how to critically write our papers. The last time I graduated from school was in 2016 when I attained my bachelor\u2019s. So my writing is very rusty. \n\nI did send my tutor an outline of what my essay will entail and I\u2019m awaiting her feedback. Also I will take your advice and ask my tutor  if I may use the site. \n\nThank you for your response \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe",
