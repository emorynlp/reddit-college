  "text": "Recently started a PhD and applying for fellowship. I have two potential references from my Master's (different institution) that I know would provide strong letters but I am wondering if selection committees would prefer to see at least one referee from my current PhD committee. My current supervisors (at an overseas institution, therefore less familiar with SSHRC) have known me for a shorter period of time. Would it raise eyebrows at all to not have a current committee member as a reference? Am I overthinking this?",
