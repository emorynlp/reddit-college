But since February this year I have met every deadline I set for myself/with my advisor. I have actually followed through on every date and submission, and now my thesis is in ON TIME- this is even when my advisor has not responded to anything at all on time. I'm super proud of myself, especially because as of January I wasn't sure I was going to make it through or graduate at all. \n\nOh, AND my advisor loved what I wrote. That's also a big deal because in December she told me she didn't see this coming together. \n\nYAY!", "author": "mollymayhem08", "created": 1620954910, "retrieved": 1632845911, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 366, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gz4vd4f": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nbwsen/posting_my_win_i_submitted_my_ma_thesis_on_time/gz4vd4f/", "text": "here's my plug for r/MastersThesis!
