My supervisor has given me the task of creating a mutant but I have been unsuccessful so far. She just switched my project so I'm characterizing an already created mutant instead. \n\nBut I find it so difficult to care about any of it. I don't even want my masters degree for myself anymore, I just don't want to deal with feeling like a failure if I drop out. I don't want to be stuck working a dead end job for the rest of my life if I drop out.\n\nI've struggled with depression before, but never this bad. I have almost daily thoughts of suicide and the only thing stopping me is that I know my family and boyfriend would be upset. \n\nAnother student in the lab should have graduated a year ago but our supervisor has continued to add more tasks that she must complete before she graduates - I'm scared that this will happen to me too. I don't know if I can even do another year let alone more. \n\nI'm worried that I'm going to kill myself eventually if I keep trying to do this, but I don't know what else I can do without feeling like I failed myself and my family.", "author": "keh2143", "created": 1632233119, "retrieved": 1632952148, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "comments": {"hdqxjnt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psjej3/feel_hopeless_and_suicidal_but_dont_know_where_to/hdqxjnt/", "text": "I am also struggling and kinda depressed but I know keep thinking of I am a failure/joke is completely useless. I need to and will make some changes to comfort my brain so that my emotions will not be out of control again.\n\n1. Identify your depression sources and then get rid of them! - your lab/supervisor is definitely the biggest one, and there may be some others like tight financial situation, etc. That another student should have graduated a year ago is a red flag. Talk to your supervisor about your concern, if she\u2019s not supportive, switch to a new lab ASAP. Before the switch, ask your classmates, seniors, faculties to know which PI is good enough to help you graduate even in a new research area for you. \n\n2. Be relaxed, your second year just started and you have enough time to complete a master thesis which is not necessary to have successful  results and new insights. You can do it!", "author": "Technical_Coconut_80", "created": 1632248512, "upvotes": 1}, "hdqmmoj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psjej3/feel_hopeless_and_suicidal_but_dont_know_where_to/hdqmmoj/", "text": "Ok first of all I want to say I'm very sorry you're struggling with depression. Even if the work already is difficult (which I'm sure it is!), it's going to feel even harder when you are struggling with your mental health and it can turn into a vicious cycle. You are definitely not alone and it's not your fault that you feel this way. I have struggled with severe depression before and I'm speaking from experience, it is extremely debilitating and terrible, but it can get better. \n\nI saw that you're already in counseling which is a great start, but have you considered medication? I'm not saying everyone needs medication to handle their depression, but it helped me immensely when counseling didn't. Just because it's your brain doesn't mean it's not a medical issue and you shouldn't be ashamed of it the same way someone with diabetes shouldn't be ashamed of needing to take insulin. Again, I'm not trying to say you need it, just that it's a good option to consider with your doctor because depression is a serious medical issue, especially since you are suicidal. Also I'm not saying that situation has *nothing* to do with depression, but you can be depressed even if everything else about your life is perfect. When it's this serious, I think it needs to be treated and that leaving grad school may not help you fix it. As another commenter pointed out, at the very least you should let your counselor know you haven't been seeing an improvement. \n\nAs far as the grad school side of it, do you have a committee? In my program, my committee is supposed to be the check that prevents advisors from keeping their students from graduating. It's not a perfect system, but you might want to talk to a committee member or someone else you trust about your concerns if you think your advisor is going to take advantage of you and prevent you from graduating. You should have a plan for your thesis by this point and if you don't, I'm not trying to blame that on you, it's something your advisor/committee should be guiding you on. It sounds like your advisor might not be amazing, but I also think you should let her know that you're struggling with your health. You can be vague about it if you think she won't be understanding, but she may not even be aware that you're struggling. She might be willing to take some stuff off your shoulders temporarily or help you if you need to take time off.\n\nLastly, please remember that you are a person, not a failure. Struggling with your mental health doesn't make you a failure, dropping out of a program or taking time off doesn't make you a failure. If people try to make you feel like you are a failure for those things, they're not worth listening to. We all have different struggles and depression is a very difficult one to deal with.", "author": "KiwiTheKitty", "created": 1632244008, "upvotes": 2}, "hdql2i8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psjej3/feel_hopeless_and_suicidal_but_dont_know_where_to/hdql2i8/", "text": "I just want you to know you are heard and I am here.
