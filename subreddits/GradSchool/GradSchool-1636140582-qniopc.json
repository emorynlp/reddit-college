  "text": "I'm going to be applying to a few top 10/top 20 departments for my postgrad, mostly in the UK, USA and in Amsterdam, and I was wondering what the general attitude towards inoffensive tattoos in some of these universities? I'm in the social sciences and am considering getting a music-related tattoo on my right bicep. Would this be a bad idea?",
