  "title:": "Missing Fellowship opportunities due to mental health",
  "text": "I'm a first year PhD student with a masters degree. In the last few weeks I've absolutely cratered and am working on getting things together slowly and sustainably rather than trying to force myself back like I've done before. Probably undiagnosed PTSD. Anyway, I've gotten a strong support system in place with my university including the mental health office and office of disability. But due to this it looks like I'm going to miss fellowship applications this cycle, which looks like my last. How much of a setback is this career wise?",

      "text": "i burned out hard the last 1.5 years after the death of my father + covid (and getting screwed over by my **married** joint advisors). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey (my advisors) constantly told my my career was fucked because i lost productivity.   \n\n\nAt the end of the day, It doesn't matter. Even if it is a setback, you will find yourself again. You wont be a good PhD student because you got and applied for fellowships. You'll be a great PhD student because when life got tough you found a way forward. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I will say is that my coping mechanism of the past was to push through hoping things would get better in my life. Like \"ignore the pain, shut up, and get working\". Typically this worked, but eventually it caught up to me. I agree with u/HalfEatenPie that papers and citations are king, so if prestige is your motivator, let publications, good results, and academically sharing the work you love drive you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats my best advice anyway, and good luck :)",

I'm guessing for you it took a while to get to a good place again and I'm working on that for myself, but that doesn't make these deadlines go away. Thank you for sharing. I'll get better and focus on the things that matter the most",

      "text": "Is this really a setback?\n\nHaving a fellowship is nice but you don't need one every single year.  I mean most of the time you get more money than a regular RA/TA-ship but even then you get eaten alive by taxes.\n\nShowing that you can get fellowships or having at least one or two I think is good enough.  After that, I believe publishing papers is more important.\n\nRemember that papers (and citations) are king in academia.",
