  "text": "I know this is more of a IT support question, lol, but google didn't give me an answer so here I am.  I'm writing my literature review, and I have been using Mendeley Desktop and Mendeley Reference Manager.  I am very new to Mendeley, so don't know all the options.\n\nFor my Lit Review, I am going to end up with about a paragraph summarizing each one.  I would like to store the paragraph directly in Mendeley and then maybe have it export to Word.  Is this possible?  I can start writing directly in word, of course, I just thought it would be nice to have my paragraphs linked to their respective sources within Mendeley.\n\nYes, I've added the Mendeley MS Word add-in, so in my Word doc of my Lit Review, each paragraph will have the source cited.  I just was hoping to store my draft paragraphs in Mendeley (no, I don't know why, I just feel like its a really good idea, maybe I'm wrong?).  Is that possible?",
