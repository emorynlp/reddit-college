  "text": "So I plan on reading the book but I always like to read a section and then find a summary or spark notes of it and read that after to keep it fresh in my mind.  The book I'm on is Norton Anthology American Literature 9th Edition 1820-1865.  Is there a site someone can provide that will have summaries of the text or main points?",
