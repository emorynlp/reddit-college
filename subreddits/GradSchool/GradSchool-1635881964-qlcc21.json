  "title:": "Will getting a humanities masters just for my own enjoyment look bad on a resume?",
  "text": "BLUF: I just want to to know if I\u2019ll be seen as a stale or less hirable for normal jobs if I spend a year or two on what\u2019s effectively a vanity masters.\n\nI wanted to to be a Medievalist more than anything. Playing with ideas and data about law and state formation in a period I just enjoy studying and getting to teach history courses seems like the dream. I researched enough to know the state of the job market, but I thought I could beat the odds once I was done with my first contract in my first job. I had a 4.0 in undergrad, already received stellar letters of rec, everything. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s possible anymore. There was 1 job opening in the whole country that would have looked at me with my planned degree path this year, two if you stretch job descriptions. \n\nI guess COVID exacerbated existing academic trends and the only jobs for historians and people only want to hire ethnic studies scholars. My logical side told my it was time to shelf that decade running dream. I cried a lot. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with my life now. But I have the support/funding and I still want to get a masters in history just for me. I just have to at least do the masters and have a taste of the research and specialization I really want.\n\nI figure I\u2019ll do it, find an unrelated job with good work-life balance and decent pay and throw myself into non-career goals. But will the master\u2019s hurt my prospects for a normal job? I know a lot of people see the humanities as a waste and may view that year or two as a dead end gap.\n\nIt hurts so bad guys.",

      "text": "If you're worried a degree will make you overqualified, just don't put it on your resume. Your resume isn't a CV and doesn't have to include everything about yourself. In fact, it should include everything; it should only include things relevant to the position you are applying for.\n\nWith this being said, if you take the year or two off, you will have to be able to explain that gap in your resume. If you don't plan to use the degree for your career, I would suggest seeing if you could do it part time so you can continue to work and progressing your career.",

              "text": "Again, I would suggest seeing if you can do this degree (should you choose to pursue it) part-time if you don't think you'll be able to use it professionally. Even working part-time or on a contract basis will help to keep away questions about what you were doing. But choosing the right type of work is going to be crucial. If you want to work in academia, working at Walmart is going to look the same on your resume as if you just didn't work during that time.\n\nPerceptions on gaps in work history varies wildly by country and field. For instance, industries where new technology comes out rapidly, like computer science and programming, may view it less favorably than other industries.",

And that you can write well.\n\nThis is 2014 data, but people often believed the same thing about humanities degrees then\n\nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/01/22/see-how-liberal-arts-grads-really-fare-report-examines-long-term-data\n\nSo it can be more of a struggle at first to find your spot in the workforce. But by mid-career, people with humanities degrees are often as successful as people with professional degrees.",

      "text": "You only have to get over this hurdle once; after that it's all work history and experience. Don't sweat it. Use the time in the MA to research adjacent fields -- apply for a museum fellowship or internship, dive into pedagogy, see if you can get some editing or publishing work. Apply to programs with affiliations to research institutions or with opportunities like the above. Learn to market the skills you'll develop (self-directed, independent work; presentation skills; maybe even teaching!). An MA doesn't have to be a \"waste\" even from the perspective of a hiring manager, especially if you go into it with your eyes open and prepared to take advantage of opportunities.",

Just some thoughts. I think you should go for it. You never know what opportunities can arise from passion.",
