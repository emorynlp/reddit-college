      "text": "The slides should have limited information. The attendees will focus on your talk only if they are not busy reading the slides. You should be excited and pumped up about your topic. One method speakers use for example - inspirational speeches is to think of an inspiring moment from their life. This is done few minutes before they are on stage. This changes the tone of the speaker as they feel the raw emotions. You can lighten up the atmosphere by starting out saying something relevant but light hearted. That breaks the ice. Also the slides can be made more exciting by adding relevant images. Record your voice and see how you can modulate your voice when you ask a question to the audience. It can be a rhetorical question but it will not bore the audience.",

      "text": "There are already great tips in the comments posted previously, but one thing worth noting: try not to rush through the topics. See what can be cut out and focus on the \"meat\" of your proposal. Tone is very important, as is eye contact with your audience. It's okay if you need to read from your material a bit, just try not to do that all the time (most people will, and it really sets you apart in a good way when you don't read it as much)\n\nAbout tone: what helps me is to approach the presentation as a narrative, adopting a more conversational tone. If there are questions, I build up to them and present them as such, variating the tone not only for that, but for the proposed solutions that will follow. If your topic is really serious, like a disease or a natural disaster, you can still do that, but avoid getting too pumped because it may seem disrespectful.\n\nAnother thing that's been helpful is to establish a segue between one slide and the next. You don't need to do that for every part of your material, but at least between sections. For example: you just finished presenting you research question and will now move to the methodology. Instead of just changing the subject, create a bridge, such as: \"and how do I plan to tacke that issue? \\*next slide\\* well, my methodology is...\"\n\nI'm an introvert and I hate HATE my voice (vocal fry ftw), but these tips help me all the time to do well in presentations.",

In that case, a clear structure is imho more important than tone of voice or eye contact.\n\n(And time yourself in a realistic setting, it's unreal how slow it is to demonstrate something on a slide.)",

In the initial presentation I made I elaborated on the topics and it sounded better because I was not jumping from one brief fact to the next. It took 15 minutes to get through the background on that one.\n\nThe presentation is supposed to focus mainly on the experiments, a large part of which is the hypotheses and expected results. I don\u2019t think I can memorize this as it is about what effect different fatty acids or fatty acid ratios will have on metabolism and gene expression. I need to say: when fatty acid A is increased and fatty acid A:fatty acid B ratio is increased and the subject is exposed to treatment C and D then this may happen to metabolism, and this to gene expression. Then repeat for B, then for when switching from A to B (because in all situations the expected outcome is different). I also have trouble getting enthusiastic about talking about it when I am trying to economize my words.",
