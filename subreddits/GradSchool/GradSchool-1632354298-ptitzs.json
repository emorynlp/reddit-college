He said that although I had some decent work, he was mostly disappointed with my process and some of the conclusions that were drawn. And while I agree with him that it definitely was not my best work (it was probably some of my worst honestly), I really felt like I missed out on a proper grad school opportunity.\n\nFor context I really only had the means to begin experimental work once the pandemic happened, then we all got locked down at home and I couldn\u2019t get to go in an entire summer to do any work which was stressful on top of dealing with my own poor mental health and family issues, and I really did not reach out as much as I should have during the process to make sure I was on track. My supervisor did say that I should\u2019ve reached out to him if I was having a hard time, but I have a difficult time being vulnerable with someone who\u2019s basically deciding whether or not I get a degree.\n\nSo even though I passed, I feel like I really don\u2019t deserve it and that things could\u2019ve gone differently had circumstances been different.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way? Should I just be thinking a pass is a pass at this point?\n\nEdit: Thanks yall for the comments, I\u2019m feeling a lot better after pulling myself together after my defense.
