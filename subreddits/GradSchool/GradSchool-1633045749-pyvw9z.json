  "text": "Long story short, my husband is going to grad school next fall. We will have a 3 yr old and a 1 yr old by then. I\u2019m just new to all this and we haven\u2019t looked too deeply into fin aid, but is that enough to live on? Or will i need to work? Doing the math, working with two kids in daycare will not bring in a ton of extra cash unless im making a ton, which I don\u2019t know if i will! But I will obviously try my best to find a good job. I have a BA so I\u2019m sure i can work something out but I\u2019m still stressing. How has anyone else made this work?",

Most of the time, I'm home with my kids (2 and 5) and the housework and school work and teaching whe my husband works 2 jobs.\n\nI'm tired. But, I try to be efficient. I read when I wait in car rider lines. I sit outside and let me kids play while I work on papers. I stay up late occasionally. I multi-task (today I watched a documentary while I did laundry and dishes). I use voice activated software to record thoughts to turn into short papers, and my kids get screen time when I zoom into class. I never watch TV, and when my family does, I usually read or work on a paper. I always hammer out 1-2 books over breaks. I annotate well and review material as needed. \n\nAlso, to be brutally honest, my classes haven't gotten that hard or time consuming yet since I am getting a degree in a field I have been in for 10+years. And, I read fairly quickly. So, most of time goes to my kids and house, then the classes I teach, then the courses I take.",

My university offers decent funding for student parents, it covers a good portion of the cost of daycare, along with some money from a city program. You're basically at the point where you'll need to make massive use of university and government resources, from food stamps to childcare.",

Also, family help or low cost childcare is a most. Unless your partner has a good income as a student with many benefits/ family money/ you planned this and put money aside for this, being a stay at home parent is not very sustainable with a studying partner .",

      "text": "Totally depends on what kind of program he's looking at. Most PhDs are funded - you don't pay much, if any, tuition and receive a stipend, but it'll be in the $15-30k  range (in the US). Master's programs are less likely to be funded through the program but they can be. You can look for fellowships (thru the school or external), but they are competitive. In general I'd say it's going to be tough to live off just his salary, assuming he has one with his program. A friend of mine supported 2 kids and her husband on her PhD stipend when he was laid off and they managed but it was extremely tough - they couldn't afford a car or much beyond basic needs. Look into all your options while applying and what kind of support each program offers",
