  "text": "I'm a first year in a PhD program for Organizational Science and research topic of interest is gamification. I have 4 projects due in less than 4 weeks. Out of all the projects that I have to do, the only one that really has me stumped is creating an experiment for my quantitative methods course. But I seriously cannot think of a decent, feasible, and meaningful research question. :( \n\nAny recommendations or advice on developing a RQ for your research interest? Please.
