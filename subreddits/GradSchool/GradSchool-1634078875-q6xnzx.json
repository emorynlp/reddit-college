  "text": "Hi all. So I'm in the process of applying to a Master's program, and was told to keep the message to my potential supervisor as short as possible. \n\nI've tried making it shorter, but there are certain things I feel are necessary to communicate:\n\n1. My name, academic background, and that I studied abroad and wish to apply at the desired university.\n\n\n2. Ask if he's taking in new graduate students in the spring semester for the desired program and that I'd be pleased if he would agree to supervise me.\n\n3.Why I'm interested to work with him, what my research interests are and why. (This part was the longest) \n\n4.That I've attached my CV and english proficiency report in the email.\n\n5. That I'm certain that under his supervision I will gain the needed experience and knowledge to pursue my determination. Thank him for his time, and, wish that he would contact me if he has further questions. Finally, that I hope to hear from him soon to further discuss my research proposal. \n\nThese were 400 words. Is that too much? What should I exclude? \n\nThank you.",

      "text": "Yes, that is like a 1 -2 page word document. Imo, emails should be short, something that would put James Joyce to shame. \n\nI would just introduce yourself, indicate that you are interested in the program and that their research is particularly interesting to you, inquire about whether they are accepting new advisees, and offer to have a short chat to explain more about your past experience/future interests if they have some time. \n\nI can't imagine what you wrote based on those 5 things that would be 400 words. It sounds to me like each point you have could be 1-2 sentences max. For example,\n\nSubject line: Accepting new advisees for \\[semester\\]? or something similar\n\n\"Hello Professor Dill, \n\nMy name is Robert Gherkin and I am particularly interested in the process of prepared pickle preparation at Cucumberland University and intend to apply to the PhD program in Pickleology in the upcoming semester. I am especially interested in your research in quick picking pickles and am wondering whether you are taking on new advisees in the coming semester. If you would like to know more about my background, I have attached a copy of my CV here, but would also be happy to chat more about my research at Breadnbutter University if you have some time. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nRegards,\n\nBob Gherkin\"\n\nBe sure the subject line is specific and not just \"Hello\" or something random AF. This person doesn't need to hear your whole life story or why you're particularly passionate about the process of prepared pickle picking. You can expand it a little if there are some *key* details you think are important, but I would not ramble. \n\nIt's kind of implicit in the fact you want to apply to the program that you are at least more than passingly interested in the subject. If someone sent me a 400 word email, I would skim over it. Ain't nobody got time for that. If they are accepting new grad students, they will probably exchange a few more emails over the next several days/weeks. If they are not, you would have wasted so much time composing that manifesto only to hear they are not accepting any PhD students.",

What you've written is something you could bang off to 100 profs without much thought. If it landed in my inbox I wouldn't bother opening the CV attachment let alone replying.",

I can't imagine why you even bothered writing such a stupid response. \n\nIt was just an example, not something OP should write verbatim because I'm not interested in drafting someone else's email. If you disagree, then you should include your own example. \n\nIn the future, maybe avoid making stupid comments that don't provide any meaningful insight to anyone. Nobody cares that you disagree. If you have constructive advice, include it. If not, piss off.",

                  "text": "I offered 3 very specific bits of constructive advice: add a) work/accomplishments, b) research idea, c) how the idea links with the prof's work.\n\nGood profs get 100+ similar emails requesting to be someone's supervisor every year, and what you have written amounts to spam - it doesn't show that you are in fact interested in that particular professor or that you have given any thought to why they might want to supervise you or why you would be a good fit together.\n\nPeople look here for advice, and I would hate for someone to write this kind of email and have only 2 in 5 profs respond. A good email elicits responses from even the most well-known profs in their field. If you don't like my advice, don't take it. But surely I hope others will.",

Almost every professor I wrote to replied with interest /wanting to chat more, so that length is not too daunting or off-putting.  Profs can manage it. Broken into 5 paragraphs it's very easy to read. Try to cut yours down but don't fret too much.",

Specifically, you would want 1-2 sentences for:\n\n* introducing yourself *very* briefly:\n   * which program you're applying for\n   * most recent degree/the one you're currently pursuing\n   * your current work position, if working\n* asking if he is taking students in the coming year\n* mentioning a few research interest intersections\n* requesting a meeting to discuss further\n* mentioning that your CV, SOP, and other documents are attached\n\nThis should come out to 100-200 works, in my experience. \n\nNow, you'll notice that I mentioned attaching an SOP. *This* is where you can put all the extended fluff about your background research interests. Making it an attachment instead of the main body of the email allows the reader to get to the point and decide if they want to read further. Some will happily make time to meet with you without that extra info. \n\nKeep in mind that a lot of such emails ultimately go ignored and possibly unread. A longer email from a stranger is far more likely to be ignored. I find that my shorter cold emails (\\~50 words) tend to receive more and faster responses.",
