  "text": "Hi all. So I'm in the process of applying to a Master's program, and was told to keep the message to my potential supervisor as short as possible. \n\nI've tried making it shorter, but there are certain things I feel are necessary to communicate:\n\n1. My name, academic background, and that I studied abroad and wish to apply at the desired university.\n\n\n2. Ask if he's taking in new graduate students in the spring semester for the desired program and that I'd be pleased if he would agree to supervise me.\n\n3.Why I'm interested to work with him, what my research interests are and why. (This part was the longest) \n\n4.That I've attached my CV and english proficiency report in the email.\n\n5. That I'm certain that under his supervision I will gain the needed experience and knowledge to pursue my determination. Thank him for his time, and, wish that he would contact me if he has further questions. Finally, that I hope to hear from him soon to further discuss my research proposal. \n\nThese were 400 words. Is that too much? What should I exclude? \n\nThank you.",

      "text": "Yes, that is like a 1 -2 page word document. Imo, emails should be short, something that would put James Joyce to shame. \n\nI would just introduce yourself, indicate that you are interested in the program and that their research is particularly interesting to you, inquire about whether they are accepting new advisees, and offer to have a short chat to explain more about your past experience/future interests if they have some time. \n\nI can't imagine what you wrote based on those 5 things that would be 400 words. It sounds to me like each point you have could be 1-2 sentences max. For example,\n\nSubject line: Accepting new advisees for \\[semester\\]? or something similar\n\n\"Hello Professor Dill, \n\nMy name is Robert Gherkin and I am particularly interested in the process of prepared pickle preparation at Cucumberland University and intend to apply to the PhD program in Pickleology in the upcoming semester. I am especially interested in your research in quick picking pickles and am wondering whether you are taking on new advisees in the coming semester. If you would like to know more about my background, I have attached a copy of my CV here, but would also be happy to chat more about my research at Breadnbutter University if you have some time. \n\nThank you for your time.\n\nRegards,\n\nBob Gherkin\"\n\nBe sure the subject line is specific and not just \"Hello\" or something random AF. This person doesn't need to hear your whole life story or why you're particularly passionate about the process of prepared pickle picking. You can expand it a little if there are some *key* details you think are important, but I would not ramble. \n\nIt's kind of implicit in the fact you want to apply to the program that you are at least more than passingly interested in the subject. If someone sent me a 400 word email, I would skim over it. Ain't nobody got time for that. If they are accepting new grad students, they will probably exchange a few more emails over the next several days/weeks. If they are not, you would have wasted so much time composing that manifesto only to hear they are not accepting any PhD students.",
