  "title:": "My first paper just got accepted after only one round of review!! And they will feature it as an Editor's Pick on the front page of the paper website!!",
  "text": "I am super excited and wanted to share something positive about grad school (: The reviewers were really constructive on the first draft and the comments on the second draft meant so much because i worked super hard on this paper. I started writing it in October last year so it took over a year to write and get accepted. I don't think that many people will read it but the fact that the reviewers/editors thought it was good means so much to me.\n\nReviewer #1 (Comments to the Author): \n\nThe authors have done an excellent job responding to my previous concerns and the revised manuscript is much improved and will provide an outstanding reference for investigators in this area. Nice work! \n\nReviewer #2 (Comments to the Author): \n\nThank you for your careful attention to my earlier review.\n\nEdit: If you want to read the paper message me! It isn't online yet cause it just got accepted last week but I can share the title. Don't want to post it here cause I don't want to doxx myself on this account",
