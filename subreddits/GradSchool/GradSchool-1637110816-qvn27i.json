  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nMy husband and I have been talking about trying to get pregnant and start a family. I am currently in a Master's in Education program with about a  year and a half left. I know there is never a convenient time to have a baby so I guess I was more looking for advice for anyone who has had a baby during their master's program and how did that go for you? Do you wish you had waited? My thought process around this is that if I wait until I graduate, I just feel like a school will not want to hire a pregnant woman and I don't want to wait to start a family for another two years.",

      "text": "Not quite what you asked, but I\u2019m currently pregnant and in an MEd program. Not sure if you\u2019re doing full time or part time - I\u2019m doing part time while working full time. It certainly hasn\u2019t been fun, but it\u2019s been doable. I\u2019ll have about a year and a half left when baby\u2019s due, so I plan to take the summer off and get back to it with lots of support from my partner. I\u2019m hoping I can keep the pace of 2 classes per semester, but I\u2019m open to scaling back a little, at least initially as I adjust to parenthood and all the new things to juggle.\n\nFor various reasons, this was the right time for my partner and me so I didn\u2019t want to put it off. It will suck, but I\u2019ll be so happy to have both my degree and my baby in a couple of years.",

      "text": "I got pregnant with my son during my last year or so of undergrad, and then \\*started\\* my Masters when he was around 4 years old.  I took a break for several years but at that point I was already 1/2 way through the program and left with a 3.94 GPA.  I know that doesn't exactly answer your question but I think the point I'm getting at is that you CAN have children while you're in school, particularly if you have a loving support system.  There is no truly convenient time to have a baby, but the baby is worth the inconvenience.  You and your husband can figure out the details as you go.  \nOh, and I know several women who have been pregnant and had babies during their Masters.  It's not easy, but it can be done.",
