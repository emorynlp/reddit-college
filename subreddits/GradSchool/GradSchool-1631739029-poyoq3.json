Only the orientations and the zero week have happened yet. I had to start online because of the visa delays, etc. in my country due to covid. My uni is doing the hybrid teaching mode. Out of 15 people in my cohort, 12 are there on campus already - hanging out, getting to know each other, figuring out the 'basics' of adjusting to a new place, visiting places, posting photos, etc. \n\nI guess it's right to admit that I'm feeling a little jealous but also I'm just worried about me moving in the middle of the term. New country, new language, new sorts of food, lots of new people, just new everything basically. I feel like I won't get enough time to get adjusted to the new surroundings plus I won't really have people with me doing things for the first time in the city, exploring 'new' stuff because almost all the people at the uni would have already gone through all that by then. I feel like it'll be a lot to catch up and I won't have enough time. \n\nEverything's just moving too fast. I haven't even had the time to sit down and just sort and clear out stuff from my undergrad degree which I finished a few months ago (did 1.5 years of it online, not the best thing tbh) because of the whole rigmarole of visa, exhaustion from uncertainty and loneliness, dealing with the idea of having graduated online and that it's over with no real goodbyes and everything. Things just drifted apart in the end and I haven't been my best self in these circumstances. So grad school felt like a good escape from the whole covid situation in my country. And I just miss people my age, talking about ideas, doing spontaneous things, etc.\n\nI'm expecting to get my visa confirmations by the end of October. The term ends in December when I'll have a week of holidays. I'm thinking maybe I could travel then, but it seems like too late and I don't want to miss out on stuff. I feel like I'm just always gonna be 'behind'. I know I shouldn't be too worried about all this but I don't know how to feel really. \n\nPlus figuring out online interaction, mic on/off, video on/off, getting conscious about looking at your own face when you talk or just feeling weird about having your face on display in front of the whole class, insecurities about talking in English, and generally feeling like an impostor isn't really helping. I get super anxious with online settings and small talk, so idk how to make the best of what is currently available. \n\nThe cohort seems really wholesome tbh + the professors as well. My family is also very supportive generally which all just adds to the guilt about not being grateful for what I have. Also, I'm finding most of the courses exciting but a little too tiring which is normal for grad school, I guess. I need to work out a schedule but I don't know if I'll survive. I don't know if I'm capable of handling all this workload.\n\nI wrote a lot, I know. Really needed to write this. If you have any advice, or are going through similar stuff, do let me know! Any little practical tips are highly appreciated. Anything from your side will probably help deal with this experience which is apparently very universal but also very lonely. Thanks!
