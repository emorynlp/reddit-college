  "text": "Hello everyone. Has anyone taken a course where you expect it to be one way and it ends up being completely opposite? One of my courses this semester is an elective and turned out to be this way. The course is also one of those where there is significant more work to be done than my other two courses combined. I\u2019m not against having significant amounts of work for a course that I am interested in and passionate about learning - but this course does not interest me in the slightest. Have you dealt with this before? Is dropping the best option so I don\u2019t waste credits towards something that will never interest me? It\u2019s already past the refund deadline, so I would get my first W (withdrawal) for a course. The money isn\u2019t a huge factor in dropping, but getting the most out of the courses I take is. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt and stuck with it for the past 5-6 weeks, but I\u2019m at the point where Im not really motivated to try and make it work anymore. I am aiming to graduate in May, but with this hiccup I would have to take 4 courses next semester (if I dropped).\n\nThank you for any advice!",

      "text": "I've dropped two courses, without shame whatsoever, for similar reasons. The first was a class that ended up being way more work than it was worth. I took it because I was interested in the overall concept and the online syllabus had some readings specifically related to stuff I want to look at, but the professor assigned 150-200 pages of reading a week, every week, and I knew with my schedule that was not going to happen. Many of the other topics were not at all interesting to me, so I dropped it. \n\nThe other one was also way more work than I was prepared for, but it was also a stats class and a method that wasn't going to be immediately useful to me so I dropped that. If you have to take 4 courses next semester in order to graduate, that sounds like it is going to be *a lot* of work and I'm wondering whether it might be worthwhile just to force yourself to stick with it to lighten your load before you graduate, or think about a wintermester (if available) course so you aren't stuck taking 4 classes in one semester.",

          "text": "Thank you for the reply! Very good points. I\u2019ll definitely check and see if I can take a winter mini-semester class. If not, I can afford to push back graduation to mid summer and take a class during summer session 1",

              "text": "I think both of those are reasonable. I personally would strongly encourage you to consider other options besides taking 4 classes in one semester. I don't know what your program is like and maybe 4 classes would be doable for you, but for me 3 classes was pushing it due to all the reading and writing involved. I think if I took 4 classes I would probably die because for my program that would mean between 500 and 800 pages of reading every week!",

                  "text": "4 classes at once would definitely be rough, I\u2019ve tried it once before (my second semester) and it was extremely difficult. This time around it would be 4 electives at once since I\u2019m done with my core studies, but all it takes is one to be extremely time consuming to throw the rest out of wack.",
