  "text": "This is my first term of grad school. I\u2019ve been struggling the whole time to stay on top of things. My mental health is bad.\n\nApparently I asked my prof too many questions for help with assignments (like how to write something). And I just feel so incompetent and incapable.\n\nNot to mention, I got some upsetting news from my doctor the other day which made things even worse.\n\nAnyone have ideas on how to navigate these sorts of issues? I could use some ideas",
