  "text": "This is my first term of grad school. I\u2019ve been struggling the whole time to stay on top of things. My mental health is bad.\n\nApparently I asked my prof too many questions for help with assignments (like how to write something). And I just feel so incompetent and incapable.\n\nNot to mention, I got some upsetting news from my doctor the other day which made things even worse.\n\nAnyone have ideas on how to navigate these sorts of issues? I could use some ideas",

      "text": "It's far better to ask too many questions than not enough. Grad school is a pretty big step up from undergrad at least in my experience and can be a bit humbling in terms of what's expected of you. It can take a bit to really get into the swing of it. Go talk to your supervisor and be honest with where you're at. They've heard it all before (and have been there themselves) and are there to help you out however they can.",
