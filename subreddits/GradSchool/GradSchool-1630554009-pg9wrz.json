  "text": "I applied, and was accepted, for an M.S. in microbiology and immunology because I thought that what I actually wanted to study wouldn\u2019t pay me enough money or that my choice would disappoint those who trained me in my undergrad. I realized I was in the wrong program when I couldn\u2019t answer why I I was in the program and that I would come home crying almost every single day because I didn\u2019t understand any material no matter how much I read or took notes. I\u2019m planning on switching to wildlife biology and if I don\u2019t make bank so be it, I\u2019d rather be happy and poor than going down a path that ends with me killing my self out of misery in a few years. \nI wanted to write this post because I couldn\u2019t find anything online on how to know you were in the wrong program, and hope it\u2019ll help someone else in the future.",

Op, thank you for being strong enough to know yourself and where your passion is!\n\nOthers reading this, be brave enough to know your passion, or to at least carve out a niche to study something that you find to be \u201ctotally awesome!\u201d The best programs involve that thing that you find yourself saying, \u201csorry, I just find it *really* neat/cool\u201d after an accidental 15 minute lecture\u2026\n\nbest luck to everyone here!!",

      "text": "I agree. If that program you were originally accepted is is not interesting you, I do think finding a program that interests you will be worth it in the long run. Even though graduate school is not the same as undergrad, I feel you should have right to change it to something more suitable",
