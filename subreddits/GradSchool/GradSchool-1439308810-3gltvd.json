  "text": "I'll try to add a positive post to the sub, since sometimes it can get a bit dreary in here.\n\nI'm about to start the fourth year of my PhD and for the last three years, I've been funded through a fellowship that I brought with me into grad school.  My advisor didn't receive the grant he was hoping would pay for me to finish my PhD, so it was looking like I would have to TA for the remainder of my degree.  \n\nEach summer, my advisor sends me to a collaborating lab to accelerate progress on our projects.  Working with other scientist is so much easier when they are down the hall instead of across the country.  This summer, my advisor joined me for a week at the lab I was visiting. On Tuesday he tells me that in two days, I'm going to give an hour long seminar to everyone in the lab (~20 people), showcasing what we've been working on the last year.\n\nI've given several short ~13 min talks at conferences, but never an hour long talk to a group of scientists who specialize in the same narrow field as my project.  To top it off, I only had a couple of days to prepare.  Luckily, I had a short presentation already prepared from a conference a few weeks back, and I was able to expand enough to bring the time up to an hour.  \n\nThe talk went very well, with a lot of constructive discussion that has since yielded some promising results.  I found out a few days later, that my talk was actually a pitch for more funding.  My advisor conveniently left that information out.  The head of the lab had come to my talk and was interested enough to make available $80,000 over two years to finish my PhD.  I apparently don't charge as much as Hillary Clinton, but not a bad speaking fee.   ",

I work in Atmospheric Sciences, specifically on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), aka weather forecast models.  If you want to get more specific, my research is on Data Assimilation, which is where we incorporate all of the observations into the model.  It's all about trying to come up with the best guess as to the current state of the atmosphere.  Even if you have a perfect model (which we don't), unless you have a perfect initial state, your forecast will have errors.  My current project is working on a new data assimilation system for the Navy.",
