  "title:": "Can anyone share their process for conducting literature reviews?",
  "text": "This is something that a simple Google search can reveal a lot of results for, but they don't feel very substantial, especially for the sciences. I am currently not only trying to prepare some literature for a dissertation literature review, but also for a departmental presentation, and this is always the sort of thing I've really struggled with because it feels difficult to prepare a cohesive narrative once you get past the general themes (i.e.; describing a biological process but then getting into specific areas of research on a dizzying number of different systems). Endnote and annotations are only getting me so far...\n\nIf anyone has any specifics, I'd love to hear them.",

      "text": "I just started a literature review. My course had it broken down into two sections. First, is an annotated bibliography of 8 scholarly sources around a general topic i.e. Information Literacy.\n\nAfter reading, citing, and summarizing each source. You should have a better idea about your topic and start to formulate your own inquiries. I\u2019m new to grad school, so take my advice with a grain of salt.",
