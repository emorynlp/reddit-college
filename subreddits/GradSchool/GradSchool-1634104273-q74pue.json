                      "text": "Its all good, one never knows on social media. I prefer to ask rather than assume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I gave my first undergrad presentation in a physics course(I think it was modern physics lab where we had to create our own experiment) other students thought I was crazy for answering a question from the prof with \"I don't know, I never looked to deep into that specific area\", but I didn't give a fuck and I didn't let it stress me out.\n\nFast forward to a presentation I gave in a summer grad cosmology course, I literally had a slide that had an artist rendering of the world on the back of a turtle floating through space. I reasoned my way into it being a possibility(albeit unlikely) that it could be true using basic logic and concluded with something to the effect of \"when it comes to theoretical anything there truly is no limit to what is possible\"... I was having fun and didnt give a fuuuuuccckkk\n\nI got high marks on both presentations and As in both classes.  Now, in a phd program, I see all of the students scrambling to play the academia politics and i just sit back and laugh.  They ask things like, \"dont you want to join this community or that community or get paid to be a TA?\" .. and I'm like.. NNOOOOOOPPPEEEE i get paid way more to private tutor and its on my own terms and i dont have to kill myself so a prof can focus on THEIR research.  Also, since I'm doing theory type work I don't need to be part of a big lab.. all i need is something to write with/on and i'm good to go.  At the most a discussion group, which I hardly think is worth exposing myself to the rigors of trying to be a TA while pursuing my phd lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsince you mentioned going into industry(which i assume to be private sector?) I will say this though.  Towards the end of my undergrad I was headhunted by an investment company that had a little over $1 Trillion AUM as an Investment Portfolio Data Analytics intern.... I was excited because it seemed cool and the interview made it sound like was going to be able to play with a lot of data.  turned out to be a glorified spreadsheet warrior and running tasks ad hoc from portfolio managers and client facing people.  I quickly automated most of the spreadsheet tasks with python, since everything came in the same format, and freed up  A LOT of time..  so much so they didnt think I was actually working and had a \"performance review\" hahahaha.  Then i started digging into things and pointed out some flaws and was quickly met with criticism by one of my \"mentors\" who was basically a senior position for my intern position.. who had an MBA.. and was told \"you just dont understand the 'logic' behind the data parser... blah blah blah....\"  I kept voicing my issues saying this thing was going to keep breaking because of it but i was shrugged off as the intern.. eventually, a week or so later the software team out of India came back with a report over a group meeting that such and such was causing a bug and it was leading to issues.. everyone in the meeting stared at me... it was the same bug i found...  I resigned my position about a week later..\n\ntldr for this little rant... you may find yourself hyper-efficient when you get to industry.. and may actually become bored with it..  academia is a glorified pissing contest..  but in a way it does keep you sharp. just do you and let everyone else worry about being a hater",

I'm planning on going into industry as well, unless someone dumps a tenure track position in my lap.  I think i'm going to make sure I stay up to date in the area of my phd though. Personally, I think it would feel empty to go through all of this to get an industry job that isnt in line with your phd and then not stay up to date on your own.  I love theoretical physics, but i'm not playing the post-doc, publish or perish games.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck to you!  enjoy the lifelong R&R moving forward!",
