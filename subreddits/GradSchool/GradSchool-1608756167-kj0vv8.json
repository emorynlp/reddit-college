I wanted to share my experience as one example of age-diverse programs. I also do not mean to offend anyone by my use of \"older\", I couldn't think of a better word unfortunately. Bottom line, any age is a perfectly acceptable age to further one's education. I appreciate everyone's contributions to the post, and thank you so much for the awards! <3\n\nI want to preface this by saying that this is not in response to any one post, rather the plethora of posts I've seen this year about people asking (among several things) if they are \"too old at X age\" to apply for grad school. I'm also definitely not the first to comment or post about this. **TLDR: No, you're not \"too old\". If you want to apply, then apply!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSociety has a funny way of portraying education in a linear, progressive fashion. You graduate high school, get your Bachelor's (or your country's equivalent), get Master's, then PhD/other professional degree if your intended career merits it. Boom, boom, boom, then you become a researcher/professor/etc. and make *all* the money. (*laughs in humanities*)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth is that *very few* people actually follow this direct progression in their education. At my undergrad institution, the MA and PhD program of my field has a diverse group of students. There were folks in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, people who already worked full time, people with families. My current institution's PhD program (the one I'm in) is mostly composed of people in their late 20s and 30s. Some are married, some single, some married with kids. Many are international students with MAs from non-US institutions. Students come from different socioeconomic backgrounds. There are only two people, including myself, who went straight to the PhD program from undergrad. We are the *exception*. If anything, older students are in a better position having more life experience, figured out the US tax system, and generally know how to \"adult\" better than younglings like me. Not to mention, older students who have also done a Master's have had the opportunity to better focus their research interests and get a feel for graduate school before jumping into a PhD program.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigher education has no age limit. Not one single person will care that a 30, 40, 50+ year old is in their class instead of someone in their 20s. If your age is the only thing holding you back from submitting those apps, take it from this sub: ***submit those applications***.", "author": "greensleeves97", "created": 1608756167, "retrieved": 1632845301, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 585, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"ghz9jsx": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kj0vv8/in_the_most_gentlest_way_possible_no_you_are_not/ghz9jsx/", "text": "I know this is an old post, but how was applying as an older student?
