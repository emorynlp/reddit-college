  "title:": "No, our department is not a \"family.\" It doesn't matter how many times you say it while harassing overworked and underappreciated grad students for volunteers.",
  "text": "This morning, all within an hour, our department sent out three emails calling for volunteers. Was it a simple task? Sure. But this isn't the way to get us to want to help when many of us already avoid going into the department as much as we can.\n\n9:05AM-\n\"Is anyone (those of you with offices in [building] who might be here right now) available to help me carry some boxes from the [buildings] breezeway up to the Grad Lab by way of the elevator?  They're flat and bundled up so just carrying 1 bundle isn't too much of a burden.  Let me know ASAP.\"\n\n9:40AM-\n\"I realize that many of you may not be on campus or might be in class or something like that.  I've refrained from going office to office to look for volunteers because in years past I could put out a call for assistance and folks were eager to help. Some of those folks later became faculty members in our own department.  Not for that reason but it showed that they were folks who saw the big picture and knew what it takes to succeed and how to be collegial. Am I trying to guilt you?  Why, yes...yes, I am.  I've become very skilled at it. I've not heard a peep from any of you it's disturbing because I've been seeing that trend over the last few years. Like I said, I get it...some of you may not be around or may be in class but this will only take a few minutes of your time and 'many hands make light work.'\"\n\n10:04AM- \n\"NEVERMIND.  The boxes have been brought upstairs and help is no longer needed. I was trying to save the contractor guy who delivered them (he brought one load upstairs and then had to leave in order to meet a sub-contractor over at [building]) came back and brought them upstairs.  It would have been a nice surprise for him to come back and see that it had been taken care of.  I was actually on my way down to start carrying up a bundle at a time taking the shortest route possible instead of having to roll them all the way across the building, up the elevator on the [department] side and then roll them all the way back to our side of the building like he had to do with him not being familiar with the building.\n\nI've started to hear from several of you who have let me know that you are not on campus or are in a meeting, etc. and I appreciate that.  My point in all of this is that we pride ourselves on calling our department the [department] Family and it's been that way for a lot of years.  Families help each other in all kinds of ways and this was something that would not have taken much of anyone's time if there had been 2 or 3 volunteers to help me.  All this to say...when a call goes out for a helping hand, consider lending one. That is all.\"",

That is the contractor's problem, not the department's problem. The contractor is not part of the \"department family\" so this bullshit doesn't even apply in that twisted logic either. \n\nIdk, if it were me, I would contact someone in charge and let them know this email exchange made me uncomfortable.
