  "title:": "UX Masters - Should I consider grad school for UX/HCI?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a fresh grad, fortunate enough to get a full time job. It pays relatively well and has decent opportunities for career progression. However, it\u2019s not a role that suits me and I don\u2019t see myself staying long. \n\nI have a bachelor in engineering, took a few UI/UX design modules and now I\u2019m keen on pursuing UX design and research. I\u2019ve read up on some people advising against masters for ux, but I would prefer to study as an international student in another country as ui/ux is not big in my country yet. \n\nAnyone have any suggestions? And possibly able to answer my questions?\n\n1. Will it make a difference if I choose an Asian school vs a Western one? \n\n2. Anyone have advice for doing masters in Seoul?",
