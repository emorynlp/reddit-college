  "title:": "Failed my first midterm and I\u2019m losing confidence",
  "text": "First year in a math PhD. I have a masters already but it\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve gotten that. I\u2019m back after being in the workforce for a bit and it\u2019s honestly been draining. I am constantly stressed and overwhelmed. I feel like I\u2019m not understanding what\u2019s going on. I feel like I\u2019m losing my initial motivations for coming back to school. And worst of all, I feel like this is deteriorating my mental health. I meet with a therapist regularly so I already have that resource, but despite it, I feel like grad school is slowly making me lose every fiber of confidence I have in myself. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to move forward.",

      "text": "I am feeling lost in grad school as well. I am in a masters program, so much different than for you, but a lot of people in my program came immediately from an undergrad degree in the field or took the prerequisites right before the program. I took the required prerequisites in undergrad but I did not major in the field and I did not immediately go into my program, so I feel like I started behind by not having that information fresh in my mind. It\u2019s taken a toll on my confidence. \n\nI did start medication and therapy which has helped. One thing I\u2019ve been trying that has helped a bit is setting small goals and checking them off. Doesn\u2019t have to be anything big or even school related (I have some related to health/finances), but just writing a checklist of productive things and crossing them off helps remind me that even though I\u2019m not performing at a level I may be proud of, I\u2019m still putting in effort that I can see at the end of the day. \n\nAlso, remember that your health is most important. Of course you want your Ph D, but if you are able to continue living comfortably at a job with your masters salary and the Ph D is causing you immense distress (and/or you genuinely do not think you can catch up with the course content) it may be worth considering leaving the programs.",

          "text": "Thank you for sharing! I\u2019ve tried not to compare myself to how others are doing and it\u2019s definitely hard not to sometimes. But yeah, it feels like I have a lot of catching up to do and my first term here is just going to suffer because I\u2019m not at the level I need to be yet. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get there eventually if I can stick to it, but I need to prioritize my mental health. Yesterday was definitely a low point and I hope I don\u2019t have too many more of those, but if I do, I\u2019m going to have to make some tough decisions. Thank you again for sharing and for the advice! Tried that today and actually got quite a bit done. We\u2019ll see how the next few weeks go.",

              "text": "Glad to hear you got quite a bit done! Hopefully you're feeling better about yourself and can take a bit of time to do something that makes you happy. Prioritizing your mental health is so important. I've had multiple phases in life where I thought I was not performing well and needed to be productive 24/7, but the phases in life where I have grace with myself and take time away from my work are the ones in which I get the most and best quality work done. It really helps, for me at least, to stand back and acknowledge the work I am putting in rather than dwell on how I should be doing better - but this is a mental battle I am still actively working on. Hang in there internet friend.",
