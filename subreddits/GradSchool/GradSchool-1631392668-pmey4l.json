  "text": "I'm reading my thesis now. I literally graduated last year, yet it all feels foreign to me. Did I actually just write that? I can hardly understand what the whole damn thing is about. I can't remember half of the sources listed for the life of me even though I must still have those on my computer somewhere. I can't keep up with the logical flow. I even got good grades and reviews at the time so theoretically I *should* have put hard work into it.",

Luckily, I'm already well into my post-gradschool career in a very relevant field and am very happy at this point. It's going to take me a lot to willingly \"go back to gradschool\" somehow.",
