Graduate school is about skill building, and you're primarily working towards becoming an independent researcher (which is bogus for those who aren't trying to become a PI/leader). In becoming an independent researcher the biggest challenge is learning about yourself in not-fun ways. You have to doubt everything, you have to learn to be okay with being wrong a lot, you have to accept their is no right way or answer, and you have to learn how to feel confident in yourself and your work even when no one else is and later on you'll even have to be confident even when no one else understands what you are doing.  \n\n\nCurrently the PhD is set up not for you to learn about the expansive knowledge of the world and to apply it to something cool, but rather for you to learn something new and share it with everyone else so that it can become part of the expansive knowledge.

And who knows maybe you will be one of those lucky few whose discoveries open up a new are of unexplored questions.  \n\n\nWhile doing your PhD you may want to look into doing an industry internship to see if you like applying your skills more than creating new knowledge.  \n\n\nGodspeed.", "author": "DeleteriousMutations", "created": 1632858350, "upvotes": 3}, "hemsh26": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/px3nva/my_spark_is_gone/hemsh26/", "text": "TALK TO YOUR PEERS.

My closest friend in my unit was one year ahead of me, and she told me that the year before I got there was by far the best year she'd ever had (and of course clarified that that wasn't to do with me, ha!).

A conversation over the water kettle would turn into a collaborative poster idea for a conference, and people could rubber ducky out their ideas rapid fire. However, all of our advisors were later-career and considering retirement, so took fewer students. My year was smaller, and those later-stage students left were deep into their theses so had no time to chat, are were often not even in the offices while away writing.
