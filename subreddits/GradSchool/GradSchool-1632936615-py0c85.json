I sent an email to the organizers but didn't hear back.\n\nI feel like my advisors think I'm stupid, and now they have more reasons to think that I am stupid. Please give me stories to cheer me up.",

Conference presentations are nice but aren't as important.\n\nThis is one of those situations that I'd say don't stress about it, if you get flack for it then take it on the chin, and move on to writing the paper.",
