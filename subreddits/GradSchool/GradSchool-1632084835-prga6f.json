My advisor has told me that this policy has been voted on to change in the last month and there is potentially an opportunity I could transfer from my masters into a Ph.D. Program. This could cut 1-2 years off my schooling and my Ph.D. research would just be an extension and more in-depth look at what I\u2019m already doing for my master thesis. \n\nDoes anyone care that I wouldn\u2019t have a masters?", "author": "state_absolute", "created": 1632084835, "retrieved": 1632844131, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 11, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdl23c2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/prga6f/does_academia_industry_care_if_i_skip_my_masters/hdl23c2/", "text": "*maybe* it depends on the field, but I've never heard of it mattering.

Having a PhD suggests you've already achieved a masters level education and continued from there, even if you don't officially have a masters.

They only award the masters if you leave prior to finishing the PhD and are in good standing with the program.", "author": "Unlikely-Name-4555", "created": 1632085136, "upvotes": 21}}}
