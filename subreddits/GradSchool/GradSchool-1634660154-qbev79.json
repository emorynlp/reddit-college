  "title:": "Had no relationships with professors during undergrad to write me a letter of rec for grad school",
  "text": "I graduated with my BA last summer and am interested in applying to grad school. Upon my research, a ton of the schools I\u2019m interested in require 1-2 academic references. I didn\u2019t have any sort of relationships with my professors and have no clue who to ask. I could just ask a professor who I had for three semesters and got all As in their course, but I also know it wouldn\u2019t be a strong letter of rec because we didn\u2019t have a relationship.\n\nAnyone else run into this problem?",

      "text": "For my grad school the letter of recommendation wasn\u2019t an actual letter, it was a form. It had yes no questions and questions where they would rate you on a 1 to 5 scale. Basically like a survey. Do you know if your school does that? If so, then it wouldn\u2019t really matter if you didn\u2019t have a super personal relationship with that professor.",

How about presentations?\n\nIf so, do you still have copies of them? \n\nProvide a digital copy of them to the professor when contacting them about a recommendation. They will be able to look at your documents and your test grades and comment on your work as a student.\n\nThat is what recommendation letters are about. It's not about your personal relationship with a professor. It's about the work you did as a student.",

              "text": "Yep. That will do it.\n\nAnd this is not unusual. Often there are shy students in s class who don't talk with the professor much who are the best students.\n\nNow, if you submitted any of these assignments in paper, and they wrote feedback on the final version with your grade, scan that in. So they can refresh their memory on what they wrote on your paper. Don't just send them a digital copy of what you wrote that doesn't have any of that feedback (unless that's all you have).\n\nAnd you just need to pick a few. Don't send like 20 items. lol \n\nProbably best if they're not all from the same class, since your professor would want to be able to speak to your performance across all three of your classes. Big projects would probably be better than smaller assignments. Projects that counted more towards your grade and required more work.",
