Departments often will not admit you unless they have a supervisor for you, no matter how impressive your CV/transcript is. It's really good to identify these potential supervisors, introduce yourself through email, and write in your statement of purpose that professor X has expressed interest in supervising you etc.\nIf your topic is particularly niche, I would definitely recommend choosing based on which school has a supervisor you'd want to work with!", "author": "anxiousoverthunker", "created": 1630971808, "upvotes": 1}}}
