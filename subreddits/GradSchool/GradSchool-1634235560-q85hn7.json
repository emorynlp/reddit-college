  "text": "I am debating my exit pathway for my Masters in Education, and wondering if anyone has heard of or done a thesis exit by way of auto-ethnographic research?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of the examples I have come across are ethnographic research conducted on groups other than the individual, or more project base. I am in a unique position in my life and wondering if anyone has been successful in having the school approve an approach like this.",
