  "text": "Currently struggling with writing my first sole-author research article and I'm feeling a little stuck. I have various notes about different things that I want to add, but I feel like my literature review and discussion sections are really short. The sole author article is a major step for my PhD, and some of my cohort members have been saying their papers are 40+ single-spaced pages, while mine is currently 17 double-spaced (part of this is def imposter syndrome).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you know when a research article is ready for submission?",

Either your peers actually have two (or even 2.5?) separate papers smooshed together, a la a thesis that they haven't figured out how to cut up yet, or they've padded and the whole thing and it's likely garbage. Or can't write clearly and concisely worth a damn, in which case it's still not good.\n\nI know saying \"don't worry about them!\" doesn't miraculously make that happen but seriously, polish up yours - it sounds like you've done the bulk of the work - and do ya thing.",

Ask another person, ideally who understands enough of your field but is not an expert (a senior grad student or postdoc is Ideal) to read it and give feedback. You want to have a clear story, not write your whole dissertation in one paper. A lot of the time, in academia, egos get in the way of quality work, and it becomes a competition over stupid things, and number of pages is one of them.",

      "text": "Further to other advice, look at papers that get published in your field that you think are good but also of a similar level to what you're planning. How long are they? How many different aspects of a problem do they cover? How much of it was useful? Is there a single narrative/story they are telling? What depth of analysis are they doing? Do they mention a bunch of things to leave to future work? Generally, a paper states a tractable interesting problem, then tries to solve it. If you've solved it then you're done. If you didn't quite solve it but have some interesting results, then you can adjust what the stated problem is and still be done. I don't know anything about your field but presumably you have an academic advisor; they should be helping you with questions like this so that you're making the best use of your time and avoid problems at the review stage.",
