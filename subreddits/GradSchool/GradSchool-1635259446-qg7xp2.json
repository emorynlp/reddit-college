If you can't dumb down your research enough that anyone can understand a surface level general idea then you don't understand it well enough. The better you can explain your research and why it matters in a general sense to *anyone* the better off you'll be.",

She was a board certified surgeon and ER physician, professor of medical ethics, and generally one of the smartest people I have ever met in any context. She would relate my focus of neuroscience with non-brain diseases in a way that was super insightful and helpful. Or she would bust out some St. Thomas Aquinas. Or Telliard. She was my role model. She passed during my first year, but she was the first person I told when I got into my program. She always wanted another doctor in the family and was willing to settle with a neuroscientist.\n\nSorry for the heavy story. She's just been on my mind today.",
