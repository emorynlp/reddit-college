It\u2019s common for these papers to lack clarity as to how this paper fits in with prior literature and as to why this paper is a contribution beyond showing known results with a new dataset (I\u2019m not referring to papers done for the sake of replication, which is important in and of itself). Often lit review sections will be long and meandering without a unifying thread and without actually securing the present study in the extant literature. Another sign is making generic statements to the tune of, \u201cThis is important with important implications, and future research should look into this more,\u201d without providing clear implications or future directions. It makes sense that grad students spend so much of their time and learning on the data, methods, and results sections, and then tack on the lit review and conclusion as more of an after thought. It\u2019s a skill to meaningfully tie that work into the broader literature, but it\u2019s not a skill that\u2019s always taught. \n\nI always give pointers to the authors and recommendations to the editor for R&R.",

I certainly don't (and want it to remain that way).\n\n>the papers I get often sound like they were written by early-stage grad students.\n\nThis is often a combination of three things. (1) Grad students in STEM coming in with abysmal (if at all existent) writing skills and (2) Academic mentors not taking the time to teach them some basic skills, methodology and guidelines to write a decent academic paper, and (3) Senior members of the team not taking the time to proofread, edit and critique drafts of the paper before submission (I know many people who think they'll do this when the initial reviews come in).\n\n>is the bulk of the modern science writing industry just grad students  being peer reviewed by grad students, writing for an audience of...grad  students?\n\nI mean... on one hand, you do want the PI to let the students \"own\" their papers and projects, so to speak. It is a wonderful feeling to go from having no idea about a subject to become quickly immersed in it and the relevant literature. That being said, your advisor and collaborators know the field and the big picture way better than you, and should properly guide and vet the learning and the scientific process. \n\nSadly, the pressures to publish / produce is what leads a lot of PIs to take way more than they can chew, be super hands off and let their students get lost. And it is a shame.",

It makes it harder for them to assess the paper properly. And it makes it likelier that you'll recommend for rejection or major revisions.\n\nAs I said: it is a darn shame PIs don't spend more time mentoring their students on what makes a great paper, and teaching them how to get there. I always ask my students to step back from it and try to read it like it's someone else's paper they're reading, and once again, as if it's someone else's paper they're reviewing. Are the ideas and contributions clear? Does the approach make sense? Etc. A good paper is one that makes you go 'oh wow... that makes sense. I wish I had come up with that.'",

But I also agree that this is more common with postdocs, the reason I heard for this is that people should first publish to learn that side of the process before reviewing manuscript of others.  \nI'm not sure why a lot of scientists choose to break confidentiality instead of either rejecting and suggesting their trainees as reviewer or just approaching the editor that another person will be involved, my guess would be that the editors would rarely complain and actually might be happy to know another name they can reach out to. Because while not disclosing the ghost writer might seem like a crime without victims it has moral implications as the actual reviewer never disclosed possible conflicts of interest and never officially agreed to anything.

Maybe some grad students don't feel like their advisors contributed much that was helpful to their dissertation, but those are unfortunately just grad students who had shitty advisors. My advisor (and the rest of committee) may not have contributed much to the actual writing of my papers, but they definitely contributed a ton to the science.

Some articles definitely assume way too much background, but there's a huge difference between \"what do you mean you don't know this concept that is only actually written down in some 1960s article?\" and \"pop-media\", and the former is where the problem actually is. Generally speaking grad classes fill in a lot of that void, but with that strategy you're assuming schools do things right and that nobody too far away from your subfield tries to read your articles.\n\nLike, low hanging fruit example, you cannot even begin to meaningfully talk about Jahn-Teller distortions if you don't know group theory. Basically everything in my field (molecular spectroscopy) is similar. If you don't know group theory and enough linear algebra to work with the matrix schrodinger equation, you're toast and no amount of analogies can help you understand the average paper.",

Part of the PhD is and should be focused on writing and communication. Most academic writing is terrible and overly complicated. People pump stuff out shit for publications and shit writing gets published. We could increase scientific literacy (and scientific reproducibility and accountability) SO MUCH just by requiring a better level of writing. A lot of scientific articles are lazy writing. It takes practice and skill to be a good effective scientific writer. \n\nSorry that was sort of a tangent of your question.\n\nThat being said, if you don't need a PhD for the job you want, don't get one.

Nobody assumes the PI did all the work, and I've at least personally never seen a PI take first author on a paper that had students in authorship (occasionally I see collabs that PIs had with other PIs).\n\nIn general, I'd say while I can see how you'd get OP's impression, it's not really accurate. It's just rare to go to a talk on something your PI is ACTUALLY interested in, so it's hard to see how much they truly know.\n\nAnd some bosses are put at last author by default when in reality they shouldn't have any spot, but that's a whole can of worms.",
