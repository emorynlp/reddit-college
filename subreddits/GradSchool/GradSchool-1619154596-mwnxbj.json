Some professors / lab leaders do conduct themselves this way. Some don't. I certainly don't (and want it to remain that way).\n\n>the papers I get often sound like they were written by early-stage grad students.\n\nThis is often a combination of three things. (1) Grad students in STEM coming in with abysmal (if at all existent) writing skills and (2) Academic mentors not taking the time to teach them some basic skills, methodology and guidelines to write a decent academic paper, and (3) Senior members of the team not taking the time to proofread, edit and critique drafts of the paper before submission (I know many people who think they'll do this when the initial reviews come in).\n\n>is the bulk of the modern science writing industry just grad students  being peer reviewed by grad students, writing for an audience of...grad  students?\n\nI mean... on one hand, you do want the PI to let the students \"own\" their papers and projects, so to speak. It is a wonderful feeling to go from having no idea about a subject to become quickly immersed in it and the relevant literature. That being said, your advisor and collaborators know the field and the big picture way better than you, and should properly guide and vet the learning and the scientific process. \n\nSadly, the pressures to publish / produce is what leads a lot of PIs to take way more than they can chew, be super hands off and let their students get lost.

But I also agree that this is more common with postdocs, the reason I heard for this is that people should first publish to learn that side of the process before reviewing manuscript of others.  \nI'm not sure why a lot of scientists choose to break confidentiality instead of either rejecting and suggesting their trainees as reviewer or just approaching the editor that another person will be involved, my guess would be that the editors would rarely complain and actually might be happy to know another name they can reach out to. Because while not disclosing the ghost writer might seem like a crime without victims it has moral implications as the actual reviewer never disclosed possible conflicts of interest and never officially agreed to anything.

Maybe some grad students don't feel like their advisors contributed much that was helpful to their dissertation, but those are unfortunately just grad students who had shitty advisors.
