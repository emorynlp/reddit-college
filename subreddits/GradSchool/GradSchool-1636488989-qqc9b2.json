  "title:": "DIY PhD in a wild west department",
  "text": "A few years ago, my advisor hand-picked me as a PhD student out of one of his undergrad classes. Throughout the last few years he constantly told me to just sign up for research credits because no one cares about classes and I'd just do them all at the end after I publish all of the amazing papers he thinks I'll publish (3 years in, no paper). He repeatedly told me not to worry about deadlines and requirements because things work differently on paper. Ok.\n\nLo and behold, the school has been emailing him warnings every term about me not registering for classes and making progress towards my degree. He never said anything to me. So here I am, head down, deep into my research project, and suddenly I get an email from the grad school saying I have a registration hold and if I can't register for classes next term I'll be removed from the program, so I've effectively been expelled. Why? I didn't hold my Qual exam before the deadline. I honestly didn't even know what a qual exam was at that point. Thankfully I was able to get an extension... and then three more because my committee couldn't be bothered to respond to scheduling requests months in advance. Finally I get my qual done -- home free for a bit.\n\nThis whole time I've been registering for 501 Research because my advisor says I can't register for 600 level credits until after my prelim. Seems reasonable. So I accumulate \\~100 credits -- only 15 of which count towards my degree. I'm meeting with the school's general graduate advisor about something and he goes \"why the hell do you have 100 credits in 501?\" Turns out I could have been registering for the 600's this whole time, and I need >60 of them to graduate. Thankfully I can convert them with a petition, but what the hell?!\n\nMy advisor told me several times that I'd get an MS with my qual, as if there were no other requirements. Cool. Guess what? Nope. I had to petition for a change of major to add the MS, submit all these forms to the grad school with very specific deadlines, starting a term in advance, and I didn't have enough coursework to grab that degree when I had to do the qual. So here I am two terms later with the required coursework. Has my committee approved my MS program of study? Lol no. My MS defense is in 2 weeks. My advisor is MIA. The requirements to prepare for my MS are scattered around the school's website. Many of them are currently impossible for me to meet without a time machine... and yet, we are going to push ahead and pray because the school wants to hire me next term and I need the MS. \n\nIt would be cool if he actually -- you know -- advised me, ever, during this entire experience. Even for my research, he basically just threw me onto a project with zero actual guidance or support. I've begged him to team me up with another student because I've been working from home, alone, with no contact with other humans in my department for three years and I am super burned out and depressed. \n\nIs this a normal experience?",

      "text": "This is a particularly bad case, and your advisor is willfully (if not almost maliciously) negligent, would be my first opinion.\n\nMy second opinion is that your advisors a fucking know-nothing chode who *you let fuck you*.\n\nMy third opinion, which is a tough pill to swallow\u2014I know, because I made a similar mistake\u2014is you should have been on top of your own requirements and not just taking your advisor\u2019s word for everything. Particularly when it seemed so obviously out of line with the normal process. There is likely a (graduate) student handbook, and I can not tell you how many times I went through that fucker over my grad school experience. ESPECIALLY when coming up on milestones.\n\nIt sucks that there is zero accountability for this kind of shit. There should absolutely be federal requirements for a mandatory seminar, yearly or bi-yearly, for advising faculty to make sure this does not happen. I almost lost funding at one point because of a similar situation. \n\nDo you have email record of all this terrible advice he was giving? Any paper trail at all? The biggest pisser here is that they\u2019ve very possibly wasted months or years of your life, even if the department somehow makes it better. And there is nothing you can do about that.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty lesson in life, but even if you think an advisor/boss/coordinator\u2019s job is to watch over you and keep you on the rails, they may not see it this way. Or worse, they could be completely wrong and after all, it isn\u2019t their life they\u2019re fucking with. So if you have resources like a employee/student/company manual, be familiar with that shit and how it applies to you. After I learned my initial lesson, you had better fucking believe that I had been in communication about my class reqs with the Grad Chair before I even had the first draft of my dissertation done. So to anyone but OP and I reading this, take our experiences and learn from them.",

You need to be on top of your own shit in graduate school and make sure all your boxes are checked. No one else will do it for you.\n\nIt\u2019s a cheap lesson. Be cautious going forward. I wish you the best.",

      "text": "Doesn't sound normal to me, but I'm lucky (hate to use that term) to be with an advisor who meets with me regularly and gives me solid advice on the grad school requirements as well as my research/academic progress. Your advisor sounds like he 100% does not know what he is doing nor how to advise a PhD student. I'd keep in close contact with your grad dept chair and bring this all up with them. Don't let your situation hit rock bottom before seeking help! You need to keep advocating for yourself! Hope things get better for you!",

      "text": "This is not remotely normal, and I would consider it to be extremely negligent on the part of your adviser. Like, it's so shockingly stupid that if he were a private sector employee he would have been fired.\n\nI don't know your adviser and I'm sure he's special in his own way, but honestly he sounds like a moron. Unless he got his PhD from a diploma mill, I can't imagine what kind of ignoramus would think that you can get a PhD just from research credits because it's highly unlikely that's how he got his PhD.  \n\nI'm also a bit flabbergasted that nobody else noticed that this was happening. In my department, we have to submit a progress report every semester that lists what we have done, what we are doing, where we are in the program, and what our current timeline is, so situations like this would be absolutely impossible. \n\nIf I were you, I would search for all records of communication with your adviser and get a new one ASAP. This incompetent buffoon wasted 3 years, and you don't really want to spend another 8 years working on a PhD. A lot of people place a lot of responsibility on grad students to stay on top of their bureaucratic shit, but tbh I think it's just shifting the blame for institutional negligence and inefficiency. It's easy to blame a grad student for being lazy, but it takes work to overhaul a system that clearly is not functioning. Also, not everyone is familiar with the bureaucracy of academia, and program requirements may be inconsistent across sources of information. \n\nThings like this are a great illustration of why there needs to be more accountability in academia. If it were up to me, this guy would be fired. At the very least, he should be banned from advising students, but even that I think is lenient considering he basically profited off your cheap labor all these years and left you nothing to show for it.",

I hope it is not normal. \n\nFor others looking at this finding to kind of familiar, there are resources to look into.\n\nA lot of research advisors don't keep up on the school requirements. That is often the responsibility of the director of graduate studies or a staff person with the program. \n\nAs others have said, there should be a student handbook with all the rules.",
