  "text": "I'm a current grad student at U of T and have a bit of money to live on but not enough to get me through two terms without seeing a dime. I am wondering when we start to see any money coming out with respect to our funding packages. Do they do it monthly, every term, at the end of the year?\n\nThis is just adding to the stress I already have and I would like if even a little bit of it can be softened.",

It was ridiculous.\n\nYour adviser should be able to answer this question because so much depends on the institution and your appointment, assuming you have an appointment. When I was a RA, I was paid every two weeks. When I was a TA, it was once a month. My RA appointment was ongoing, but my TA appointment was semester by semester, so even at the same institution I had two different pay schedules depending on what appointment I had a given semester.",
