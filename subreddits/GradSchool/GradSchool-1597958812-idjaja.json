I update him mostly on email regarding data and flow, then just meet him when I hit a big roadblock/dead end. I always remind myself that knowing to show-up is one step closer to solving the problem. I recognize that my boss is a problem solver/focuses a lot on solving the negative things than giving compliments, which is helpful because my expectations are set too. In case he doesn't give compliments, it's not that I am not doing things correctly. Try to find out how your adviser works around people/former gradstudents and adjust your expectations.
