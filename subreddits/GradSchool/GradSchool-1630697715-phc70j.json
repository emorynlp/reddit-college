I'm 19 years old, and I'm an undergraduate senior taking grad level courses through a special program. Because of this, I'm just feeling a lot of pressure right now. I can't get it out of my head that everyone expects more of me and only me. \n\nI know there are a lot of TAs who are experiencing similar things, but I just feel that when *I* make a mistake, it's failure. And I don't want to make mistakes because I know it will impact the students, which isn't fair to them. \n\nFor example, one student has already expressed their discontent with the grade I gave them for an assignment. When they showed me their draft last week for feedback, I told them it looked great but to address one issue, then I later said that it wasn't specific enough and was missing important details when I actually graded their assignment. I've been trying to get better at how to grade assignments, but I'm not sure if I'm doing a good job. Actually, I kinda feel like the worst TA ever. \n\nI just keep making mistakes, and it's been really hard trying to not let that affect me.

I'm happy to look through your work, and answer any SPECIFIC questions you have, but the point of looking through work is not to provide a guaranteed grade, it's to help those that are really, really missing the point of the assignment.'

I have a little checklist for when I make a mistake in front of an audience. You can use it if you want.\n\n1. Say thank you to whomever pointed out the mistake.\n2. Offer to fix the mistake in the moment.\n3. If I can't fix the mistake in the moment then offer to fix it later.\n\nIt's incredibly basic, so modify it to your own preference.\n\nYou can't prepare for every possibility but you can prepare (a little) for making mistakes.", "author": "HerndonMath", "created": 1630706730, "upvotes": 2}, "hbhjypj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phc70j/i_feel_like_i_keep_making_mistakes_and_i_dont/hbhjypj/", "text": "The fact that you care so deeply and are reflecting on your own TA journey is proof enough that you are not the worst TA ever! Far from it in fact! \n\nAlso, speaking from experience as a TA multiple times, some students really do think or at least try to push or persuade not so subtly young TAs about grades. I remember also once in an office meeting with a student, the student telling me the grade I gave them did not reflect their work and that I MUST change it or there would be hell to pay. \n\nAlso, we are all learning at every stage of our professional and teaching journeys. Making mistakes is part of the learning process. So it is important to acknowledge our mistakes, but also not beat ourselves up for it because it is perfectly acceptable to give ourselves space to grow as human beings. \n\nLastly, we are teaching and learning amidst very anxious and urgent times and everyone is on edge. So all your feelings (and even our students) feelings are very much valid and \"normal\" (I use this word with extreme cautiously!). \n\nI will send you as many good vibes and energy as I can to make it through the semester.", "author": "GeneSafe4674", "created": 1630699528, "upvotes": 5}}}
