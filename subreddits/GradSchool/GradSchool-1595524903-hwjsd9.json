  "title:": "Vent: I am so tired of professors treating us like bratty children when we are asking for basic COVID precautions",
  "text": "Our university is acting like they are being so generous by giving us 2 N95s for 12 weeks of working with COVID-19 populations. We have suggested a myriad of different options such as we could condense the days, instead of going twice a week for 12 weeks do a \u201cboot camp\u201d style where we go every day for two weeks straight to reduce movement and cut down on the length of time we have to be on site or hybrid or pushing the population portion to next semester etc. \n\nEach option has been met with an eye roll and a comment that it would be soooo much work to try to create any other options for us and their funding is limited. Meanwhile we are all fully paying (private!) tuition and the university owns the sites we will be working at. It is so frustrating. \n\nThey are acting like we are 18 and don\u2019t know how the \u201creal world\u201d works. We are on second or third degrees and some of us have doctorates  in other fields and all have excelled and are peers to many of the professors. Is anyone else experiencing dismissive professors or administration? How else can this be approached and dealt with when they are being so resistant? Literally the dean of the school told us that \u201cno one is holding a gun to your head to get you to come here\u201d when are are just asking to explore all options for safety.",

Their plan is themed \"Return To Learn.\" Full COVID testing, but no significant social distancing measures. No money offered if you contract COVID on campus.\n\nThese cocksuckers are desperate for funds --> they should name it **\"Return to Earn.\"**\n\nThey even hosted a \"town hall\" meeting, which a fellow student aptly called a \"circlejerk\" where these *unwanted* *unavoidable* *unfortunately* *un-aborted* fetuses came prepared with general questions that were of no use to us students, and took turns \"jerking\" each other off with said questions.\n\nTheir top priority is to get our asses on campus to justify the extraction of more money.\n\nI am appalled at the lack of concern for student safety. This virus is devastating, even healthy individuals are never the same again after recovering from an attack. WE, the people who fund these cheap-ass no-brain cunts should be first priority. All they do is sit in front of a computer planning their next looting operation to extract funds, or chatting with each other or scheming new policies to fuck us up over a cup of coffee. Then they hide behind the university's reputation and promulgate how lucky we are to be here, just so we feel a little better while they rape our asses with a spiked-iron rod.\n\nI'm tired of this bullshit. Education seems more like a business than an academic institution that prioritizes student safety and learning. Take care, man/woman.",

From what I understand, they think that nobody is doing any work when they stay at home, so we all need to come in. It's absurd to me.

It\u2019s obvious when professor go off brand and say things like \u201cif you have the option to go month to month with your lease that wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea\u201d. But they are also the ones with the most advocacy power. The director of the program is one of our professors and she reports directly to the dean and isn\u2019t willing to advocate for us. We\u2019re also trying to do all of this work and negotiation via zoom and they are limiting our channels of communication to the point that they have even started turning off the chat feature in zoom. It\u2019s absurd.",

Maybe I\u2019m still reading it wrong? \n\nI understand your frustrations though, because again that\u2019s happening to us. I went attended a zoom conference where professors were able to ask questions to various people on various committees. They gave half answers, laughed off serious complaints, and turned off chat because it was \u201cdistracting.\u201d My power to change the situation is zero, as much as I wish otherwise. I\u2019m trying to get answers for my students, but I can only give them answers that I\u2019ve adequately had answered. I\u2019m working wit undergrads in a normal class setting though, so again maybe that\u2019s different than for you.\n\nI do recommend checking out r/professors, and even just consider lurking for a bit. We\u2019re making many of these same complaints as you and feel powerless to get our voices heard or to force the administration to change. It doesn\u2019t help that our administration is literally being forced to do certain things by the state government that doesn\u2019t consider any of the on-the-ground issues. It\u2019s definitely a less than ideal situation for everyone.\n\nI still sympathize with you. Your situation sounds super problematic. Especially if I\u2019m reading it right and you\u2019re working with covid patients?",

Very few programs around the world involve *any* classes at the PhD level, mostly just the US (and a couple others), but even then the classes are only for a short time and aren\u2019t 100% of the work that PhDs are doing.\n\nAny complaint from a graduate student should be assumed to be a complaint about the program, the department, and the university. Not classes. Treating PhD students like undergrads is part of the problem - we\u2019re not undergrads, we do far more work beyond classes, that work is often the same as faculty (sitting on committees, teaching, doing research, mentoring undergrads), and so we shouldn\u2019t be spoken down to like 18yos who are whining that they can\u2019t have parties anymore.",
