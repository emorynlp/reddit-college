We have suggested a myriad of different options such as we could condense the days, instead of going twice a week for 12 weeks do a \u201cboot camp\u201d style where we go every day for two weeks straight to reduce movement and cut down on the length of time we have to be on site or hybrid or pushing the population portion to next semester etc. \n\nEach option has been met with an eye roll and a comment that it would be soooo much work to try to create any other options for us and their funding is limited. Meanwhile we are all fully paying (private!) tuition and the university owns the sites we will be working at. It is so frustrating. \n\nThey are acting like we are 18 and don\u2019t know how the \u201creal world\u201d works. We are on second or third degrees and some of us have doctorates  in other fields and all have excelled and are peers to many of the professors. Is anyone else experiencing dismissive professors or administration? How else can this be approached and dealt with when they are being so resistant?

From what I gather on Reddit, the administration at my university is made of shit-fuckers who don't know jack fucking shit. Their plan is themed \"Return To Learn.\" Full COVID testing, but no significant social distancing measures. No money offered if you contract COVID on campus.\n\nThese cocksuckers are desperate for funds --> they should name it **\"Return to Earn.\"**\n\nThey even hosted a \"town hall\" meeting, which a fellow student aptly called a \"circlejerk\" where these *unwanted* *unavoidable* *unfortunately* *un-aborted* fetuses came prepared with general questions that were of no use to us students, and took turns \"jerking\" each other off with said questions.\n\nTheir top priority is to get our asses on campus to justify the extraction of more money.\n\nI am appalled at the lack of concern for student safety. This virus is devastating, even healthy individuals are never the same again after recovering from an attack. WE, the people who fund these cheap-ass no-brain cunts should be first priority. All they do is sit in front of a computer planning their next looting operation to extract funds, or chatting with each other or scheming new policies to fuck us up over a cup of coffee. Then they hide behind the university's reputation and promulgate how lucky we are to be here, just so we feel a little better while they rape our asses with a spiked-iron rod.\n\nI'm tired of this bullshit.

Not exactly the same as your problem, but in the same vein of treating us like we're know-nothings: my PIs have made it publicly known to the lab that they want everyone to come in, even though many of us rely on the metro as our main route of transportation and are risking our health by going. From what I understand, they think that nobody is doing any work when they stay at home, so we all need to come in. It's absurd to me.
