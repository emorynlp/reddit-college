Because it's social sciences and most of my students aspire to graduate school, they'll need to learn that when they apply for grants and send papers off to publications, formatting is important. If the assignment specifies two pages, double spaced, times new roman, do that. Do not shrink the margins to .25inches, get creative with line spacing, use a smaller font, just so you can squeeze garbage into two pages. Work on refining your thoughts and creating a coherent essay instead. \n\nWhen people turn in poorly formatted homework, the message they are sending is that \"this is only for a class grade, so this is not really that important\". However, bad habits are hard to break, so it's better that they learn good habits now so it creates less work for them in the long run. They might end up working in a lab where the PI is very detail oriented, precise, and wants to see things annotated in a specific way. If they're used to just turning in whatever they want, formatted however they want, they're going to have a tough time and PIs can be much less nice than TAs.
