  "text": "There are two kinds of students I love:\n\n1. The people who do everything mostly correctly, with neat handwriting and a clearly laid-out assignment\n\n2. The people who don't bother to hand anything in\n\nEveryone else can go to (varying levels of) hell. \n\n - Graphs that look like they were drawn with their feet while their eyes were shut. \n\n - Pages stapled upside down and out of order. \n\n - Just random tidbits of an answer without any actual words to describe what's going on, invariably always *really* close to the correct answer but not the actual correct answer. \n\n - Randomly switching conventions or signs. Or both.\n\n - Instead of putting the actual units, just writing \"units\" after the number. \n\n - Forget about significant figures, everything is to the nearest whole number.\n\n - Throwing out the notion of writing left to right and top to bottom, and instead just slotting parts of the solution into any space on the page. \n\nI feel pretty slighted that I obviously spend more time marking some people's assignments than they spend working on them or writing them. All so that they could earn 0.05% towards their final grade. But now I know why they pay us so much: if they paid any less, no one would do it. ",

      "text": "I teach writing, so completely different, but I actually started taking points off for not following the formatting guide we give them. Because it's social sciences and most of my students aspire to graduate school, they'll need to learn that when they apply for grants and send papers off to publications, formatting is important. If the assignment specifies two pages, double spaced, times new roman, do that. Do not shrink the margins to .25inches, get creative with line spacing, use a smaller font, just so you can squeeze garbage into two pages. Work on refining your thoughts and creating a coherent essay instead. \n\nWhen people turn in poorly formatted homework, the message they are sending is that \"this is only for a class grade, so this is not really that important\". However, bad habits are hard to break, so it's better that they learn good habits now so it creates less work for them in the long run. They might end up working in a lab where the PI is very detail oriented, precise, and wants to see things annotated in a specific way. If they're used to just turning in whatever they want, formatted however they want, they're going to have a tough time and PIs can be much less nice than TAs. ",

I was letting people out early if they finished.\n\nAbout 10 min till the end of class I walked up to check on them again and I asked, \"So where do you feel you are having the most trouble?, How can I help?\"\n\nOne of them replied with \"We just don't do math very well, I don't like it and its not my thing.\"\n\nI replied with \"I see, math can be hard but it does get easier with practice, what are your majors if I might ask?\" \n\nOne of them replied \"We are both accounting majors.\"\n\nIt was at this time that I suggested they should practice more math, because if they wanted to be accountants they would need to be better at it. I also suggested that making errors in your math is one thing, but making errors with other people's money is an entirely different issue.\n\nThe assignment btw... was how to convert orders of magnitude between one another...  so moving kilometers to meters and such..\n",
