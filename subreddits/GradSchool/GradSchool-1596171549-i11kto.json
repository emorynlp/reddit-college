I actually saw myself and smiled. I have never felt this intelligent. Strong. Sufficient. Worthy. Bright. I made it. I finished my masters program. That determined but scared little girl who dreamed of being a teacher...who took no bs, did what it took, wouldn't give up. But I'm not a little girl anymore. I'm not held back. I'm not what they thought I was...only meant to be a wife and mother. Years of quitting, feeling inadequate, listening to their voices. Leaving a verbally and mentally abusive cheater. Moving into my own place amidst the chaos of that, covid, and my program...I actually did it. I took my time and worked awhile, but I made my dreams happen.", "author": "SelectShirt6", "created": 1596171549, "retrieved": 1632845835, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 406, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"fzx7e71": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/i11kto/i_did_it/fzx7e71/", "text": "F yeah, great job.
