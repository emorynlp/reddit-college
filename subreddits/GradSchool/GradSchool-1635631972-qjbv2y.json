  "title:": "2 months in my PhD and already found a nice result to publish, should I be discreet about it?",
  "text": "I started my PhD 2 months ago and I've already came up with a result that my advisor really liked, so he wanted me to write a paper about it for one of the top conferences in my field. I was so excited, so I told all about this to another 1st year PhD student in our research group but he seemed little bumped out. I forgot most PhD students don't come up with something that's worth publishing in their first or even second year and it gets stressful for them. Now I'm hesitant to share my excitement. Everyone in our research group seem really nice and supportive so I don't want to make them stressed out or jealous. Do you think I should be discreet about the paper I'm writing?",

      "text": "Awesome. I wouldn\u2019t hold back because of jealousy concerns, however, I would advise caution, but more with regards to sharing results prior to presentation or publication - you could get scooped (dependent on the nature of your finding). Also, in all humility, you could discover pit-falls in the validation/writing process, so you\u2019d do well to only discuss with people you fully trust have your best interest in mind. I recently \u201clost\u201d a paper by sharing very early results, which were then handed to someone in our project (but different uni) for political reasons\u2026.",

Because honestly, I feed off of other people's excitement in my department, their accomplishments push me to be more enthused about my own research!",

          "text": "Yeah, they should make sure to celebrate with people who actually want to celebrate with them\n\nThe random PhD down the hall whose only connection is that they work in the same building isn\u2019t the sort of person you\u2019d invite to your party, so they probably aren\u2019t the sort of person that OP should be bragging to. If they have a neutral or negative response to the news then they aren\u2019t the right people to be telling. OP should probably focus on PhDs who are their friend and their friends outside of their department and outside of academia. The question is always \u201cwould I celebrate other things with this person?\u201d\n\nAlso depends on culture though. I understand Americans brag quite a lot and it\u2019s seen as a more socially acceptable thing to do (even if it makes other unhappy), but in some other countries bragging of any kind is a massive social faux pas and OP would be expected to be \u201chumble\u201d.",

You don\u2019t tend to hear such open self-congratulatory talk either. \n\nSo while it might be appropriate in some parts of the US to tell everyone ad nauseam about that huge promotion or book deal or other good thing that you\u2019ve achieved (or to make a social media post about it), in other places you\u2019re expected to not mention these things and to downplay them if others mention them. It\u2019s certainly a factor in Australian culture, and I think Sweden too. Usually a part of Tall Poppy Syndrome.",
