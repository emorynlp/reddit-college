  "title:": "Is it considered \"burning a bridge\" if I quit my masters and get a job instead?",
  "text": "I know that obviously it doesn't look the best on the supervisor from the school's side of things if their students don't complete the program, but is this enough of a 'hit' to my supervisor as to be considered \"burning a bridge\"? In Canada if that matters (maybe there are cultural differences in different countries). \n\nI'm also in the process of applying for some other thing that would require a reference (not a letter, but at least like a phone call) from my supervisor, but I've come to realize that I don't really want to be doing this masters, and the only reason I'm doing it is for this reference for this other thing, which seems absolutely ludicrous to me.\n\nI guess what I would LIKE to hear in the comments is that quitting the program isn't a severe enough transgression as to make my supervisor not provide a reference, but what is the reality?",

      "text": "I think it depends on your relationship with your advisor and why you\u2019re leaving. If you\u2019re less than a semester into the degree, I wouldn\u2019t expect a letter. If you\u2019ve already finished your research, it seems a waste to let someone else swoop in and publish a paper with your data, but I can imagine you established a rapport with your advisor and they would be willing to give a reference.  \n\nAs for feeling like your master\u2019s is a stepping stone, that\u2019s completely normal. It\u2019s a good way to make connections in hopes you\u2019ll break into the part of your field that you actually enjoy. Good luck with everything!",
