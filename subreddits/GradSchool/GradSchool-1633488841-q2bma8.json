  "text": "I honestly can\u2019t even imagine it. Grad school seems so fast paced and a constant stream of information and reading, I can\u2019t imagine how they would have time to do all that without instant access.  \n\nSo, please correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but they would\u2019ve had to go to the library, find relevant journals to their topic, sift through the papers to find what they\u2019re looking for, read it, take notes, redraw figures maybe, then look through it all later to piece it together? And the thought of having to manually write hundreds of citations... Sounds wild. Maybe it\u2019s just my zoomer brain that can\u2019t imagine the world before the internet haha.",

And I've heard a bit about it.\n\nShe didn't live near the main campus, but drove like an hour or two to another location for lectures (it was specifically a distance program so the lectures were lumped together). When she had papers to write, she'd call the library on the phone and work with the librarian to figure out what sources she needed, copies of which were then mailed to her.",

When I was a kid our school did not have computers so we were told to use note cards. The lined side would be for citation information and the blank side would be for notes. Obviously we weren't writing research papers, but I'm sure people had similar systems before the internet. I think it also depends on how far back you wanted to go because photocopiers have been around for awhile so you could probably photocopy whatever you needed. \n\nI think manually sifting through the journals would have been a pain though. I don't know about anyone else, but I hate the way the pages make my fingers feel after awhile. It's why I don't read physical newspapers--the sensation of it makes me want to throw up. \n\nBut the plus side is that you could graduate with your PhD and have 3 publications and secure a job as a TT faculty right after you graduate. Nowadays, people are *applying* to PhD programs with 3 publications.",

There are some papers examining citation density and breadth in thesis papers that support this (I read them in my scientific pedagogy class and I would try to find them but I\u2019m on my phone, it\u2019s late, and I\u2019m not up to the task)",

What you're describing is how the famous old organic guys did it so then all of their students did it the same way, but it's hardly the only way to do it. Plenty of fields where outside forces are the bottleneck so you have a lot of time to work on this stuff in your free time while you wait for stuff to be machined or suppliers to get your orders in.\n\n> How do you get presentation training?\n\nGraduation requirements and conferences. Any idea I have will also probably cost more than my yearly stipend so I'll have to convince my boss it's a good idea before I can do it.\n\n> How do you get defense training?\n\nMy data is lines and there are 20,000 reasons why that line could be not real or not showing up even though it should be. There is no need to hammer in defense training because you're never going to get signal two days in a row if you don't understand all the shortcomings of your instrument.\n\n> How do you get analysis training if you don't actually do it and defend your analyses to peers and professors?\n\nThat's not actually a relevant skill in my field beyond what I said to the previous answer (aka proving that your signal is actually signal). There are very, very few instances where there's actually wiggle room for interpretation. You either reproduced your spectrum or you didn't. You typically do other experiments to disentangle peaks that are potentially ambiguous, and if you're not capable of doing that experiment you just say the peak is ambiguous and could be this or that.\n\nWhich granted, this is a very instrumentation focused point of view where there's not really much point in defending your case because either your instrument works or it doesn't. If I'm being honest though from what all my synthesis friends have told me, journal club is almost entirely hazing for young students and shitting on other labs for ego reasons for older students. I'm not convinced it's really useful with how every lab I've ever seen does it. I don't need to have my boss make me read a paper to read the literature, and if he comes across something I in particular should read he'll pass it along.",

      "text": "My advisor actually described this to me once as a generational difference between scholars (he's like 15 years older than me, so I found that interesting as he was saying that he and I were in a different scholarly generation from my other committee members). Be warned, I think I'm gonna go off on a little bit of a non sequitur. \n\nPreviously basically all academic information was heavily gatekept. Not necessarily intentionally (though not completely unintentional), but it meant that at least in my field (international relations), older scholarship was determined by how much information you had in your head and you could construct grand theories because if you had enough knowledge you could put together patterns and ideas that no one else had thought to try. Or you could just be really successful as a smart generalist because you could contribute meaningfully to lots of debates by virtue of being really erudite. \n\nNowadays, there's no more low hanging fruit and having breadth of knowledge is less valued since it's so easy to quickly access (superficial) knowledge. So the burden is on new generations of scholars to attack problems differently--grand theorizing and/or being a \"generalist\" in my field is much less common, and it's more common to highly specialize in a specific issue area, region, or methodology, and dig really deep to be an EXPERT and make a necessarily narrower contribution.\n\nThere's also a ton of pressure to develop unique insights which is SO MUCH HARDER now that it's possible to know instantaneously that someone else is working on your same problem and/or making or has already made an argument you want to make. There's a great example in my field of a book & a really influential doctoral dissertation -- both published in the same year by authors who, to my knowledge, had never met nor realized the other were working on the same topic. I think they even address it in their respective prefaces, like, 'oops I guess someone else is literally working on the EXACT same argument as me lol.' \n\nTo be clear these are arguments about the causes of WWI being related to a specific set of bureaucratic-political pathologies which led to offensive warplanning which itself made deterrence more difficult--so it's not like they were both making arguments about something super broad lol. This was SPECIFIC! But it wasn't an issue back then like it is now... I can't even begin to make an argument with out having the inkling that nothing I'm saying is original. It's a different world though -- now it's about HOW you make the argument, and how you transcend the limitations of others who have done the same as you before. Total different ballgame. \n\nAll of that said my advisor basically said the same thing to me -- it's just really hard to have a huge original idea anymore. They just don't exist. So you find meaningful problems to work on that are manageable and mid-range (grand theorizing no longer valuable, but you also don't want to get TOO narrow) and if other people are in that same vein as you, it's good -- more work to engage with. And you might get sniped but you just try to improve on what they're doing. \n\nIt definitely seems patently obvious to me that these dynamics can't be unique to my field, but I obviously don't have the experiences to back that up.",

Makes sense that it would be hard to find an angle nobody\u2019s thought of before.  \n\nThe problem in my field (molecular bio/plant genetics) is that you either have to get very specific on an experiment, or do more and more to distinguish yourself. Like your field, all the low hanging fruit has been picked off 50 years ago. In the 60\u2019s you could make an entire paper about \u201cless water in the soil makes plants grow slower\u201d. No shit lol. Now you have to either go super specific, like entire papers on one single gene, or do way more experiments, like \u201cwe measured height, weight, physiology, global gene expression, protein abundance, etc. which identified gene x as an important regulator, so we made a mutant that over expressed this gene to increase growth by 5%\u201d. That would\u2019ve been a Nobel prize 20 or 30 years ago, but is the bare minimum to get into a mid-tier journal today.",

              "text": "Fascinating. Yeah every field has its challenges. For my field, I think 2 things make it hard. \n\nFirst, there is no \"joining a lab\" where your PI has a large project and you jump in, do a ton of hard work on their behalf, and write up a dissertation based on your side project. For us, we are 100% solo. My work has nothing to do with what my advisor does, he just advises me on how to do good political science in general, but his work is on international trade and UN politics, whereas I work on WMD nonproliferation. So it means I have to come up with my own project, my own theory, methods, etc., etc., and he just gives as much general advice as he can. Some people probably have an easier time of this and get advisors whose work is closer to their own, but it can be a crapshoot like what happens to me. \n\nSecond, kind of to your point, the data is super scattershot. So, yeah some data is out there and you just have to comb through, build a spreadsheet/dataset, run tests and analyze. My work is more based on qualitative methodologies, but sadly sometimes getting access is straight up impossible. I'm in this mess right now where I \\*really\\* need my government to pull its head out of its ass and approve any of my gazillion FOIA requests so I can write one more chapter, but as it stands that's not looking likely. Meaning I'll have to adjust to come up with data, and it'll be less interesting as a result (i.e. I can interview the people involved with the event in question -- assuming they are alive -- which is fine, but not as good as seeing the physical documents, memos, etc.)\n\nBut yeah I remember being in coursework and having a ton of dope theoretical ideas and once I got done with comps my advisor sat me down and explained the harsh realities haha. Such a bummer that research is not the grand glorious thing we all hoped when we were younger and fresh-eyed.",

In my very first lab job, as a high-school student who didn't know how to do anything more useful, some days I would just get a list of articles from the grad students and postdocs, then spend the rest of the day in the library finding each article in an actual printed physical journal issue somewhere in the stacks, and bring it to the library's copier. At the end of the day I'd come back to the lab with all the article copies. I quickly learned you don't get to skip copying the extra page of References.\n\nBut actually that time in the stacks gave me a deep impression about science. I'd be necessarily flipping through lots of articles other than the one I was looking for, and I realized each one represented years of someone's work, and they had no idea who in the distant future might come back to this page of this issue of this journal to cite them, and it might be no one, but regardless the article is permanently there for all to find. No matter how esoteric, it's a certain kind of immortality, which gives us meaning and purpose in our lives.\n\nI don't get this same feeling from browsing journals online. Even though I know it represents the same hard labor and permanence, the form just looks too similar to off-the-cuff blog posts or outdated-by-next-week thinkpieces that could disappear from human history next year without anyone noticing.\n\nNow I'm actually tempted to go browse the shelves in a library, but in 2021 even the librarians will think I'm a weirdo.",

So, I had a fairly solid handle on all of the let\u2019s say 12 major journals in my field (eg biomechanics) thanks to days skimming hardbound journals down in the stacks. Sit down in the aisle and thumb through every volume; pay attention to the lit cited and hop around following the paper trail, then photocopy a bunch. Now, with the explosion of online journals, there are maybe 50 journals that publish my field. I find it near impossible to keep up with particularly given the high rate of low yield, highly auto-cited, overly incremental garbage that seems to be the way now. Helping my students navigate this is challenging to say the least, but I have good goggles (I think so at least) for understanding academic lineages or lineages of ideas that help, I hope.",

You did spend a lot of time in the library, though, and every library had coin-operated xerox machines so you could copy relevant articles and take them home.  It was a pain spending hours at the xerox feeding it dimes though, especially when there was a line of people doing the same thing.  You\u2019d start with a recent article, ID the relevant papers to find from its citations and work your way back.\n\nAs for typing, we hired typists to do the final draft of a thesis or dissertation.  It was a popular way for student spouses to make some money.  It was about $200 in the 70s to type a 150 page thesis.  For regular papers in the early 80s we used word processing (dot matrix printers) even then, in early PC days.  It was light years better than typing.\n\nI also did some programming using a card-reader.  That worked, as long as you didn\u2019t drop the cards.  In case you did, you\u2019d hand-number each card sequentially so you could RE-order if necessary.",

However, I don\u2019t have my sources so take these next parts with a grain of salt. Graduate degree programs were much rarer to go for. However, both a BA and any Masters program was less intense than they are now. Not to diminish the achievement of getting a degree back then, but a BA in Business now covers the same and more content than an MBA back before the internet. The internet added material to each class, each course, and each program. Increasing the amount of material that colleges deemed worthy knowledge for the degree. This is also why higher level math is taught earlier on in primary school. Not much earlier, but earlier. Degrees are much more intense now because more people have access to it them. For example, I\u2019m pretty sure my mothers BA in English didn\u2019t require around 120 units like my BA in Psychology. Note: 120 units is the average required units for a degree including general education. \n\nBefore the internet: Obtaining a degree had more external obstacles to overcome making it difficult.\n\nAfter the internet: Obtaining a degree has more internal (class requirements, knowledge testing, material taught etc.) obstacles to overcome making it difficult.",

Look through the handful of important journals to your field for relevant stuff, check out textbooks for the things that I'm expected to know that aren't really my field, have a notebook as a \"citation manager\", and do experiments. I don't just thumb through journals now but that's not really different from my current workflow. The biggest quintessential digital thing that I use is documentation for labview, but pre internet programmed instrumentation control like that wasn't a thing. Granted this also means that I would spend a lot less time automating things which would change the workflow significantly.\n\nThe biggest change is that I would be expected to diagonalize like 30x30+ matrices by hand. There was a bit of an era where punch card computers did that, but there was a pretty long era where that kind of thing is something you just did by hand.",
