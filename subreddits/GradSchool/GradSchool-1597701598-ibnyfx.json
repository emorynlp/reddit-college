I did well and was able to publish a few papers. Unfortunately, at the end when I was working on my thesis I had a change of heart and did not want to begin a PhD with the same PI. I had many reasons: mental health, stress, and finally this was not the research I originally wanted to do. So I got in touch with other potential PIs and emailed my advisor and explained my reasoning. My hope was he would have a discussion with me and we can plan my leave.\n\nThey took it personally and removed me from the lab, group meetings, and individual meetings. A lab get-together was held for another student who was also leaving but not for me. And then essentially I was character assassinated in a lab meeting (which I was not invited to). I felt very cut off from everyone. It turns out they also didn't talk positively about me to other PIs who got in touch with them, so I lost some opportunities. \n\nDuring the past few weeks, I worked on my thesis revisions and was able to finish them. I feel the thesis is much better now. My thesis reader said \"very thorough\" and \"very good work\" but I have no one to share this with. In addition, I am wrecked with anxiety about my future. Somehow I was able to land an interview with a PI I have previously wanted to work with. The lab feels like a great fit for me, and he has (verbally) agreed to take me on - in fact they said \"even if you don't have the blessing of your advisor, I'll still take you on as it wouldn't be fair to you otherwise\". I'm still working on paperwork, but I am so anxious that my advisor will try to block this opportunity or something else with go wrong.\n\nI had wanted this to be a happy moment but I'm so uncertain about everything.", "author": "MachineVision", "created": 1597701598, "retrieved": 1632953342, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 550, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"g2i8vht": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ibnyfx/i_finished_my_ms_but_have_no_one_to_celebrate_with/g2i8vht/", "text": "Your PI sounds like the major professor I had when I was doing course work before comps.
