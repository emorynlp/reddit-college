  "text": "I\u2019m in stats and I had to retake it twice in undergrad. This is by far my worst subject by a long shot. This is also my first semester in grad school and the first class I\u2019ve taken here.\n\nI failed my first exam. I got a 66 despite going to weekly office hours, and having a strong study group. I get 90s on my assignments but my grandmother passed away towards the final weeks before this exam and missed a week \u2014 arguably my mind was a bit distracted. My grade overall is now a C+ which brings my stats overall GPA down to a 3.4. I\u2019ve been in tears over the fact that I very well could fail stats again. I\u2019m wondering if this is salvageable and if anyone\u2019s ever failed a grad class.\n\nI\u2019m almost debating dropping out because I\u2019m so embarrassed and feel absolutely stupid. I\u2019m one of the only ones who failed and it feels like it was a mistake even getting in.\n\nTIA for any advice \ud83d\ude2d",

Currently a candidate and still, nothing came of it. I\u2019ve known some who \u201cfailed\u201d two classes, they\u2019re still fellow PhD candidates to this day. \n\nYou got this. It\u2019s not the end.\n\nEdit: I guess the advice of \u201ctake a make up course, don\u2019t give up, you\u2019re not the only one, you can put this behind you, all is not lost\u201d is too extreme for some, hence the downvotes. How unfortunate. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",
