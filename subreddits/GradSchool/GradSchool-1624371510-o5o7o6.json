It's a high stress environment and you can get kicked out, and along with that there can be a whole lot of isolation.   \n\n\nAll that takes a toll. I didn't realize how much it was taking a toll on me. A lot of my flaws worsened/heightened in that stressful environment, and I didn't realize how much I was rationalizing all that away. It took me going back to therapy again to gain proper perspective.   \n\n\nI'm a lot better now, but if I didn't have that realization I might have gotten worse. For anyone who is on the fence, I definitely say try it. Even though it's a time commitment, a clearer and less anxious mind makes working and doing research much easier too.", "author": "Astsai", "created": 1624371510, "retrieved": 1632953312, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 586, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"h2r2lp7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/o5o7o6/for_people_who_havent_gone_to_therapy_yet/h2r2lp7/", "text": "So much this.
