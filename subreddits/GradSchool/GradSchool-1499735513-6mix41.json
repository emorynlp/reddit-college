About a year ago, I started a list of quick tips to get out of a funk. I hope that it helps some of you! Let me know your tips as well!*\n\n\nDo you have a **hard time going to bed/waking up** on time?\n\n- Don't work past 10pm (or within 2 hours of going to bed). You need to give yourself some time to settle down before bed. Read some fiction or watch a mindless show/movie. Try to avoid just browsing the internet which can lead to you staying up later than you planned (the story of my life).\n\n- Don't do any work in your bedroom. You need to separate work from rest in your head. When you go to your bedroom, you should feel relaxed. \n\n- Use an alarm clock. Don't keep your phone next to your bed. You don't want to be bothered though out the night with the constant buzzing. This also helps with getting up in the morning by avoiding procrastination (\"the morning scroll\"). Also, don't hit snooze!\n\n- Aim to sleep at least 7.5 hours/night. I've heard multiples of 1.5 hours are ideal, but no idea if this is true.\n\n- If you're sensitive to caffeine, switch to green tea in the afternoon. It's better for your teeth as well!\n\nDo you have a hard time **feeling 'present'**, **mingling with people**, or **thinking about things that aren't your thesis research?** (I find that these are all inter-related.)\n\n- Make sure to get enough *positive* social interaction every week. For example: department coffee meet-ups, pick-up football games, board games, etc. Going to the pub can be positive as well, but keep in mind how much you're spending/drinking.\n\n- Make sure that your entire sense of meaning isn't coming from your thesis work. Make sure to have hobbies outside of your work. Have some interesting things to talk about with your friends. Nurture your natural curiosity!\n\n- Consider trying Mindfulness meditation. I was skeptical, but I think that it helped (even though I don't do it any more).\n\nDo you have a hard time with **procrastination?**\n\n- Make to do lists! Create a hierarchy of tasks by breaking each task into manageable chunks. It then becomes much easier to chip away at projects.\n\n- Try to do something *slightly* more productive with your time (e.g., improve your programming skills on CodeAcademy, DataQuest, etc.). This is good as long as you don't spend too much time on this...\n\n- Uninstall social media from your phone (e.g., reddit, facebook, etc.) and only subscribe to healthy/positive subreddits.\n\nFeel like **your project is going no where?**\n\n- Set up weekly meeting with your supervisor to make sure that you're making steady progress\n\n- Again, make to do lists!\n\nJust **feeling down** in general?\n\n- A lot of this can be physical!\n\n- Check your posture. Are your shoulders rounding forward from being at a desk all day? Imagine there is a string coming out of the top of your head that is pulling you up. Stand tall and proud. Also, check the ergonomics of your desk.\n\n- Smile more! It sounds bad, but you actually can fake it until you feel better.\n\n- Get in early. Aim for getting in everyday by 9-9:30am. You can feel productive without doing anything by just showing up on time.\n\n- Make sure you're listening to *positive* music. \n\n- Try taking vitamin D in the winter.\n\nAre you **putting on weight?**\n\n- Avoid morning snacking by having a whey protein shake with breakfast. They are good for feeling full.\n\n- Alternate meat/vegetarian days. This also helps save money and the environment :)\n\n- Bring lunch whenever possible.\n\n- Stop buying sugary drinks and candy! It's just wasted money anyways.\n\n- Track your progress on MyFitnessPal.\n\nFeeling **unattractive?**\n\n- Make sure you're taking care of yourself!\n\n- Personal hygiene:  Brush twice a day, floss at least every few days, wash your face before bed, moisturize, shave every other day, sleep more, get regular haircuts, etc.\n\n- Appearance: Don't have to spend too much money, but don't let your clothes get too ratty. Focus on classics that don't go out of style.\n\n- Fitness: Aim for exercising +3 days a week. E.g., pick up football/touch rugby, weight lifting, running...\n\nGeneral health related habits:\n\n- Keep in touch with friends. Make lunch dates, movie nights, play sports, etc.\n\n- Read! Aim for 1 book every 2-4 weeks, but don't turn it into work. Make sure that they're entertaining for you (doesn't have to be intense non-fiction or literary classics), but they shouldn't be trash either... I enjoy sci-fi for a good mix of entertainment and content.\n\n- Try to limit multi-tasking. It often feels like we should multitask, but it often isn't very efficient and just stresses you out even more.\n\n", "author": "qtc0", "created": 1499735513, "retrieved": 1632846462, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 272, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"dm6lngv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/6mix41/staying_healthy_during_your_phd/dm6lngv/", "text": "All excellent advice, but the \"listen to positive music\" bit is funny to me because I listen to the most depressing shit ever...

In my program, I just didn't have time to manage all this stuff and do the work that I needed to do. So, don't beat yourself up if you need to grab take-out a couple times a week, you have to cancel a get-together with a friend, or if your gym routine falls by the wayside for a bit. You'll find your way back eventually.\n\nOne thing that did help me a lot was trying to find ways to use even little bits of time constructively. If I knew I had 15 minutes between meetings, I would send an email I had been procrastinating on or edit one of the figures in my thesis. You can easily knock out little stuff like that and it helps to shrink your to-do list as a whole.", "author": "harleys_sequinns", "created": 1499788036, "upvotes": 6}, "dk2p118": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/6mix41/staying_healthy_during_your_phd/dk2p118/", "text": "Several of these are, in reality, luxuries.

Great list!\nTo add a couple more things,\n\n- Block social media app notifications. Set a schedule to read and respond your emails. Use the \"do not disturb\" option on your phone at night. Basically, don't think you have to be connected and available at all times. \n\n- Not everyone can have their work space apart from the bedroom, but there are some strategies. I have an imaginary line on my bedroom that separates \"bed area\" from \"desk area\". I positioned the furniture in a way that I can't see the desk from bed unless I try. Maybe I'm too methodic but it helps me disconnect.\n\nI'm not the best example of keeping perfect mental health during grad school, but I found out those things recently and they certainly helped me.", "author": "viralatas", "created": 1499775049, "upvotes": 6}, "dk24xsa": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/6mix41/staying_healthy_during_your_phd/dk24xsa/", "text": "This is a fantastic list! To do lists are key. A lot of the time I make a list, expand on it, then expand on that, then I can just rewrite it with a cohesive structure. I planned, planned, planned, then rewrote - it seems like I never really did the work. \n\nFitness and hobbies are also great. Having a goal or a challenge outside of work is very important for your work/life balance. Don't just go home and reddit until bed, do something that will make you feel accomplished in your personal life. \n\nI have one thing to add for the procrastination section:  \n- Commit to 5 minutes of work. For instance, write down some ideas of what to do next, lay out what the problem actually is, or try to solve a small problem. Once you get started working, you tend to keep your momentum. If you don't, that's fine too. You only committed to 5 minutes and you achieved it, so don't feel guilty! (Also, never feel guilty. Feeling guilty isn't a productive use of your time. You could be doing something for your project or for your self in the time that you would have been feeling guilty.)", "author": "beck1670", "created": 1499746556, "upvotes": 21}, "dk23gfv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/6mix41/staying_healthy_during_your_phd/dk23gfv/", "text": "Thank you so much!
