  "title:": "Older doctoral students- career change CV question/advice",
  "text": "Would anyone here that has applied to grad school as an older student/making a full career change be willing to send me your CV used for grad apps (or helpful articles as I am failing to find any)? Seriously struggling here and most likely over thinking. I worked across the digital media landscape for 15+ years, including my own consulting business for 7 years after helping build a startup that almost killed me\u2026all the while raising my son on my own\u2026and without a bachelor\u2019s degree. Fast forward- I\u2019ll be graduating this spring (Psychological Science) and applying for fall 22\u2019 PhD programs in School Psych. Struggling how to visually tie it all together. Thanks for reading and kudos to all of you who have successfully survived the grad app process. To say it sucks is surely and understatement. \ud83e\udd13\n\nSigned,\n\nProud single Mama (my son graduates college one year after his dear ole Mom) with some serious writer\u2019s block.",

      "text": "Hi and congrats!\nHave you sat down with any of your professors along with someone from your writing center?  If not, those are you best resources to help craft your CV \n\nA full career change will mean that your CV should really only contain things school and psychology related. They won't care about your previous career unless it's psychology related (research).\n\nMy resume and my CV are totally different documents. There's nothing from my resume on my CV as it was a full career change.",

          "text": "Thank you so much! Love your insight and glad to hear there are more of us out there. So appreciated. I have not sat down with any but myself as of yet (thanks Covid!) as my University is a bit slow on the re-opening. I think that is exactly my problem thus far. I will make an appt. with the career/writing center for sure. \n\nOne of the schools I want to apply to (top choice) states to include all your jobs since HS on your CV/resume for uploading. Uhhh, no way. Did you supply your resume as an addendum by chance? Or did you leave this out completely?  How did you allude to your career change and relevant skills that carry over?\n\nDigital media requires some pretty heavy data analytics and in my case, the ability to translate them into layman's terms and get buy in...which is pretty relevant to school psychology. Also, the ability to be a trusted liaison across numerous departments, sellers/buyers. Reminded me of the ability to be a liasion between teachers, students, parents, administrators, the community.",

              "text": "No problem. \nYes, set up a time to meet with someone in the career center to work on your CV.  They should have virtual office hours.  You should really have conversations with your psychology professors and academic advisor.  You\u2019ll need letters of recommendation and the prefer them from your professors in psychology. \n\nI did not go all the way back.  I addressed the change of career in my personal statement and kept it short. No, I did not attach my resume as an addendum.  They really don\u2019t care about your past career.  Focus on what you\u2019ve been doing in undergrad to prepare you for a PhD in school psychology. \n\nPsychology PhD programs are more concerned with what have you done to prepare for doctoral studies.  Classes taken, grades, research experience, research interests, poster presentations, published articles.  You CV needs to showcase this, not what you did in another career.",

I\u2019ll be meeting with a post doc friend/advisor soon as well. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like a breath of fresh air not having to worry about intertwining my former career. That had me so stuck when in reality, all I want to focus on is what I\u2019ve done to prepare for grad school.",
