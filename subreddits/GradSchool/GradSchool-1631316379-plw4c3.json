Seriously struggling here and most likely over thinking. I worked across the digital media landscape for 15+ years, including my own consulting business for 7 years after helping build a startup that almost killed me\u2026all the while raising my son on my own\u2026and without a bachelor\u2019s degree. Fast forward- I\u2019ll be graduating this spring (Psychological Science) and applying for fall 22\u2019 PhD programs in School Psych. Struggling how to visually tie it all together. Thanks for reading and kudos to all of you who have successfully survived the grad app process.
