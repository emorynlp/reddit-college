I plan to attend it so I will accept the offer. I have been talking to a couple of professors and the coordinator and they have said that MS students usually find it easier to find funding closer to the start of semester. I was wondering, if I pay the fee for this semester and receive an assistantship, will the fee be refunded or credited for the next semester? I'm slightly confused with how assistantships work because I've read different things online, so I wanted to know from someone who might actually be on one currently.
