  "text": "I contacted at the end of July about 4 weeks before the start of my first semester of grad. I worked really hard to get here and have a terrific financial package. Despite being vaccinated, it happened anyway to my complete surprise. The lingering neurological effects continue to do this day. The result is basically not being able to do the sane way, if at all. \n\nI'm wondering if anybody else has experience dealing with the effects of long covid during grad school. I want to hear your experiences.",
