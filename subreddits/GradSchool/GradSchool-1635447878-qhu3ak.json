  "text": "The PhD program is less than 10 years old so I will chalk up to just general inexperience. And this is just a rant as I do plan on taking fewer courses in the future.\n\nBut the full time status of a grad school in my state and country is 9 hours. The department really pushes that students take 12 hours of course work instead. This is on top of teaching 2 courses or being an assistant for the equivalent amount of hours.\n\nWork itself isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s just that coursework itself if fairly small in the grand scheme of things but take up so much time that it\u2019s impossible to plan around it. Meanwhile, the courses themselves suffer b/c of overcrowding. \n\n\nThe sheer number of classes needed to be taken is fairly high but the amount of courses are limited.  (This is young program) So classes are incredibly full while more than half the students are uninterested\nin the particular subject or faculty. Meanwhile, things like conferencing and publishing are much harder. I can\u2019t even attend conferences because I have class five days a week and I can\u2019t afford to miss more than 2 days in a row. \n\nThe very fact that I have to prioritize the mere butt-in-seat attendance over conferencing is insane. And all because there\u2019s not a single free weekday.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s entirely too much work, even on the grad level. 12 hour courses + 15 hour work demands that usually exceed that anyway is ridiculous. Increased coursework just fell more like a sabotage than a benefit.",

      "text": "Coursework is often heavy at the beginning of PhD programs, depending on the field. In my experience, the first year is heavy coursework with on-boarding into research projects/rotations, the second year is more coursework but a bit lighter, then years 3+ are no coursework and 100% research (in addition to teaching/other funding obligations).\n\nGoing to conferences and such is more common after the coursework is done because it's at that time that a PhD student/candidate is actually integrated into the research enough for attending conferences to be productive. Going to conferences as a first year, although not that rare, is uncommon in my experience unless you have shown some incredible research potential or progress.",
