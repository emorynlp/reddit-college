  "title:": "Do you consider literature review a form of research?",
  "text": "Context being I'm in one of those notoriously productive online debates and am arguing that calling reading papers on a topic is not under the same heading as research. From my perspective that's a definition that we tell high schoolers to make them feel better about their science class. While half asleep I decided to respond, admittedly unclearly, to a post lambasting the idea that we should discourage the idea that reading things on google is research. \n\nMy argument was essentially, no it's not research, but you could reasonably call it literature review. Ignoring the questionable quality of the vast majority of sources people who perform \"internet research\" use. \n\nSo I'm asking the community is a literature review a form of research under your personal definition. \n\nIf you say yes it is research, I'll concede defeat and that my personal definition is not used by the wider community. If you say no, I'll wave my flag and proudly proclaim I've won the internet. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qg9u98)",

And without a really strict definition I can google mood lander hoaxes and generate new ideas, predicting future hoaxes.

      "text": "Research means a systematic investigation, so I would consider a literature review (a real one, not a google search) to be research. Part of the point of a lit review is to systematically go through existing knowledge, analyzing and synthesizing it in order to find gaps in knowledge. It requires a fair bit of critical thinking and analytical skills, so a good literature review should not be undervalued. \n\nPersonally, I don't see the value in gatekeeping things like this and I don't really see what purpose this conversation serves. If anything, it seems like it's an excuse for people to feel superior about what they do because what they do is \"real\" research while what others do is of lesser quality. \n\nA google search can be research, but that doesn't mean it's the same quality as an academic literature review. A McDonalds Hamburger and one prepared by Jacques Pepin are both hamburgers, but presumably vastly different in quality. Trying to define what a hamburger is to exclude McDonalds hamburgers would be an extremely puzzling thing to do. Why not instead focus on what constitutes a good literature review and what constitutes a bad one?",

For example if Mcdonalds started offering fancy sounding meal like say \"Bourbon Pecan Chicken\" (I googled for fancy dishes and it looks lovely) and a person offered to take you out for it as a very special dinner, not specifying the restaurant. You might be justifiably peaved when you pull up to the golden arches. \n\nFor the same reason, I believe it is technically correct to say googling around is research. It lends an air of unearned credibility to research of lower quality. My personal definition which I'll concede turned out to not correspond to the one in most peoples heads attempts to create a split that removes unearned credibility. Such that it doesn't gate keep performing experiments, gathering data, and drawing conclusions to academics, but doesn't allow google searches to sound as credible as a degree in a topic.",

If not, at least they should know some basics like: research by an expert in the field is more valuable than a non-expert, and to check the hierarchy of evidence to see the differences between different study types.",

One kind of tool might be performing experiments; another might be critically reading other researchers' papers. Of course, just googling papers would not count as research in the same way that gathering your reactants to make a reaction is not research either. That might be only the starting point of research, but not research in itself. That being said, most people overestimate the value of experimental work because it takes so long or it's such an effort or it's so expensive.
