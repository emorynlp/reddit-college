  "title:": "quick question about Phd Application",
  "text": "I'm currently a visiting undergraduate researcher at a school for comp sci. I read somewhere that it seems to raise eyebrows to the PhD admission board that if a student has no letter of recommendation from a research experience from a professor of that given research project/experience. Well, I'm unfortunately on that boat at the moment since my advisor won't give me one, and was wanting to ask should I just not include this experience on my resume when applying to a PhD Program?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a top school that's the thing, six months at a school for research with no letter of recommendation just seems like I'll be scraped. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. On a personal note, the thing is that I've been meeting the professor's requirements but he's really passive aggressive and I've gone beyond what is asked of me and it's still not good enough :/, just for more information. I asked about the letter and he ignored it completely, literally mentioned it numerous times. It's definitely out of the question.",

              "text": "Oof that\u2019s really rough, definitely not your fault though. This is definitely a hard situation. I\u2019d say if you have other research experiences that you get an LOR from, not having one from every single one won\u2019t necessarily be a red flag. I think you should still include the experience at least on a CV, even if you don\u2019t focus on it much in an SOP.",
