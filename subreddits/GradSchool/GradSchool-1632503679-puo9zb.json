But she's been through some awful shit so far and is struggling with everything y'all post about: burnout, a not-totally-supportive supervisor, extensions, momentum to finish the last little bit, etc.\n\nI know my sister really well, but is there anything that y'all as PhD students would appreciate in terms of being cheered up? I can't finish writing the thesis for her, which is the biggest thing I can think of to help her, but is there anything else I can do? What would y'all love to receive?", "author": "making_mischief", "created": 1632503679, "retrieved": 1632952047, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"hebb24u": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puo9zb/how_to_cheer_up_phd_sister/hebb24u/", "text": " How can i subtly forward this post to my sisters? :D", "author": "doornroosje", "created": 1632634655, "upvotes": 1}, "he6u5bo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puo9zb/how_to_cheer_up_phd_sister/he6u5bo/", "text": "1- Fun snacks that are relatively low cal and in line with their tastes.\n\n2- Cards.

When I was finishing up on mine there was a day when I was planning out my schedule for the next year, and it hit me that there would be a day when it was a year after my thesis defense. Something about that was really satisfying and I've shared it with friends since who also find it helpful. I'm 3 years post defense now and still cringe at the pain of my thesis work, but feel proud that it's something I did that's over. People are impressed when they hear that I got a PhD, and for the most part I get to reap the benefits even despite the voice in my head that says it wasn't good enough. \n\nGetting a PhD is a great thing to *have done*, but a horrible thing to *do*.
