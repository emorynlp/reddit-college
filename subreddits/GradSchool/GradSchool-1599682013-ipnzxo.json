Eventually you will find a method that works for you and keeps your tasks efficient. They say if you want something done give it to a busy person, because they'll find time to get it done. This is definitely how grad school is. However, be sure to fit in leisure and activities that support your mental health.

Devote your attention to this task without distraction. \n* Decide *a priori* how relevant the paper is to your research. If it's for lab journal club, treat it as highly relevant. If it's for a class the treat it as lower relevance. \n* For low relevance, read the abstract carefully, look at the figures, and their descriptions, if necessary to understand. If you get the story, you can move on. If you don't get it, skim the results section to see if it can help you make sense of their narrative. Skip the introduction, methods and discussion unless there's something that catches your eye. Write the narrative in your own words either on the front page, or beside the figures. \n* For high relevance, do the above first, and the read the whole damn paper. The methodology section becomes super important here. Take copious notes. Go through the author's logic piece by piece. Think about whether there are alternative explanations that fit the data. Identify the gaps in knowledge. Then read it again, but this time think about how it relates to your own research. Take more notes. \n\nYou will forget what you've read. But you will hopefully remember your notes and why you wrote those notes. \n\nNot all papers deserve the same degree of attention to serve your purpose. You can churn through a lot of papers relatively quickly by just getting the gist of it and moving on.\n\nNB: you really need to read a lot of papers first before you get a feel for understanding a narrative from the abstract and figures alone.
