  "title:": "Balancing School and Work",
  "text": "I'm having a really difficult time balancing both my school and work lives. To preface, I didn't actually want a job until I graduated but life happened and I was offered an interview. I'm currently working part time while enrolled in my remote Masters program part time. But I barely have enough energy to function. When I get off work, I am too exhausted to start my school work. I'm in my last two semesters and I can't quit being that I'm so close to the finish line. I try to spread my work out during the week since it's due on Sundays but I can't. I never have enough time in the day. Plus, I have a final paper that due in a month and I haven't started. My professors give us busy work that we end up making A's on. I'm not really upset at that but how can I possibly devote time to my final?\n\nI wish I could quit but with 5 weeks remaining in the semester until Christmas break, it's pointless. I'm extremely burnt out, I feel stuck, and overall fed up. I feel like no one in my family sympathizes with what I'm going through because they think I'm capable of doing this. Truth is, I'm not. I don't eat, sleep regularly, work out just so I can get my work done. All of this came at a sacrifice. I don't have friends, I spend my weekends sleeping then doing more work. I'm miserable and it feels like no one cares. I have no morale. Nothing to keep me going. I'm running on E constantly with barely a support system.",

      "text": "I'm in a similar situation. Are you able to book any time off from work so you can focus on school? A month before your final due date seems still quite some time away, though I understand a month can go by quickly when you're so busy. Are you comfortable with reaching out to your professors to let them know of your busy schedule so that they know of this ahead of time, and possibly request extensions or any other alternative options? \n\nMy professors have been much more empathetic and flexible in light of the pandemic.",
