  "title:": "Another reminder that graduate school is not worth your life.",
  "text": "I think I've found evidence of someone, who was otherwise very accomplished, who took their own life due to not completing a PhD.\n\nI've had at least two therapists have reminded me that the academic system (at least in America) is toxic and broken in many ways. Being a graduate student can make you feel small and powerless. Successful researchers can be rude, pernicious people. If you're getting suicidal urges, for goodness sakes, seek help. In America you can call 1-800-273-8255 to speak with someone, and your campus most likely offers mental services. Please, please take advantage of this.\n\nIf you do need to resign without your degree, it's ok. You \"wasted\" time and money? You're in good company. In america, student loan debt happens. It sucks, but at least it isn't personal. You don't need a piece of paper and extra letters behind your name to be a great person. You can still thrive, you can still succeed, you can still lead a happy life.\n\nI'm not good at motivational speeches, but I hope the message is getting through without being too trite. Graduate school isn't everything, it's not worth harming yourself over.",

I used to have this idea in my head that most businesses were toxic. I think that mostly came from being married to an executive.\n\nBut I have since discovered it's not the nature of the business that makes it toxic. It's the people running it.\n\nA university can be toxic, so can a church, and so can many businesses. Governments can be toxic too. (I give you Argentina as an example, or, on a state level, California.)\n\nOne solution I don't think many grad students consider is the possibility of taking at least some of those credits earned and finishing at a different university?\n\nThis is hard to do, I know, and expensive, but if you really need that Ph.D. for your field, it's better to move 5,000 miles away and complete it in a different country, if need be, than be suicidal. \n\nI do think it's that feeling of being TRAPPED in a toxic system that can lead many to despair.

Thankfully the barrier on the bridge discouraged my attempt... (and the fact that I went numb with fear)\n\nAt the end of the day, I just hope that I can accept that I am not perfect and that it isn't the end of the world if I do not get an amazing publication out of my graduate studies. I feel as though I'm so worried about failure that I'm not able to problem solve and take necessary risks in my research and this has prevented me from doing the best work that I can. Finishing up my M.Sc, I hope I can take lessons from this experience and use them to inform a more effective approach to my PhD.\n\nFor anyone struggling with suicidal urges, please do not hesitate to seek whatever help you can at your institution. I regret having wasted two years of my life wallowing in depression before finally getting the help I needed. I'm not out of the woods yet, but I feel that there is finally some hope for the future.\n\nEdit: On another note, I think using journal has been incredibly helpful for putting my fears and emotional turmoil in perspective.",

You need hobbies and friends outside of the lab, these are the things that will remind you that there is so much more to life than grad school.",
