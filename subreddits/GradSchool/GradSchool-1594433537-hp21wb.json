  "text": "After weeks of horrible sleep and anxiety, and constantly thinking about how my work is meaningless, too simple, going to be torn apart, it all went well! Just got one kind of confusing question from one of my committee members, but overall everyone said they enjoyed my talk! 5 years of work summarized in 45 minutes! \n\nIf there's one thing that I could have told myself pre-defense, I would tell myself to prep a little less, sleep a little more, and have a little more fun at my (virtual) defense.",
