She wasn't in my grad school cohort but she was a year ahead of me in undergrad and studied the same subject, we were basically attached at the hip, started a student association together. We were still very close after we went to do our MAs and PhDs in different cities. She died v suddenly due to complications 12 days after giving birth to her only child in Jan 2019. I didn't grieve properly and my work suffered for about an entire calendar year. I didn't talk about it, and I didn't go to therapy consistently. She wouldn't have wanted that, but I struggled to reach out for help. Please, get help, embrace and deal with your grief. Your friend would want you to take care of yourself. It's ok to have days when you cry, when you can't work. One thing that the loss of my friend taught me was to make time for myself. I used to be a workaholic and I think I'm not anymore (or at least less so). Take the time. These things do take time.
