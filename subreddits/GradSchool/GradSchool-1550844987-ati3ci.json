Thesis was then sent to 2 external reviewers, one of whom completed the review within the given timeframe and the second one ended up pulling out at the last minute so a replacement had to be found. I recently got both final reports back and learned the following:\n\n- Reviewer #1 submitted the report in early December. He/she thought my thesis was excellent and recommended a pass with no amendments required and showing significant contributions. \n\n- Reviewer #2 pulled out mid Dec, but my university only learned about it in Jan because of the 3-4 weeks summer break. \n\n- Also mid Dec a paper was published which literally destroys another paper that was published 2 years earlier, which I used as reference and would ultimately lead to my most interesting findings (you see where I'm going...)\n\n- Mid-late Jan my university finds a replacement reviewer #2, who submitted the final report this week. He/she thought that my thesis would have been excellent, if it wasn't because the most significant bits of my analysis are garbage as I apparently don't even really understand what I'm writing about. Recommended major revise and re-submit. \n\n- I've now been left to fully reanalyse 1/3 of the experimental results presented and then rewrite ~1/4 of the bloody thesis, which they somehow expect me to re-submit within 8 weeks. All while I'm also working full time because *of course this should be an easy pass with only minor corrections if even*, at least according to my supervisor. \n\nThis has to be every PhD's worst nightmare. I *know* that it always was mine... \n\nI'm not even staying in Academia, just let me graduate and I promise that chapter will never see the light of day again...
