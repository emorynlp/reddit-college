  "title:": "Every PhD's worst nightmare just became true",
  "text": "So I'm a PhD candidate and submitted my thesis for examination in Sep/Oct last year. Thesis was then sent to 2 external reviewers, one of whom completed the review within the given timeframe and the second one ended up pulling out at the last minute so a replacement had to be found. I recently got both final reports back and learned the following:\n\n- Reviewer #1 submitted the report in early December. He/she thought my thesis was excellent and recommended a pass with no amendments required and showing significant contributions. \n\n- Reviewer #2 pulled out mid Dec, but my university only learned about it in Jan because of the 3-4 weeks summer break. \n\n- Also mid Dec a paper was published which literally destroys another paper that was published 2 years earlier, which I used as reference and would ultimately lead to my most interesting findings (you see where I'm going...)\n\n- Mid-late Jan my university finds a replacement reviewer #2, who submitted the final report this week. He/she thought that my thesis would have been excellent, if it wasn't because the most significant bits of my analysis are garbage as I apparently don't even really understand what I'm writing about. Recommended major revise and re-submit. \n\n- I've now been left to fully reanalyse 1/3 of the experimental results presented and then rewrite ~1/4 of the bloody thesis, which they somehow expect me to re-submit within 8 weeks. All while I'm also working full time because *of course this should be an easy pass with only minor corrections if even*, at least according to my supervisor. \n\nThis has to be every PhD's worst nightmare. I *know* that it always was mine... \n\nI'm not even staying in Academia, just let me graduate and I promise that chapter will never see the light of day again... I'm so fucking done with grad school!!",

Just add a sub-chapter where you explain the brand new results disproving the old stuff and do both analysis's, one from your old perspective and one from the perspective that the new work is definitive. The work will be stronger for it and you don't necessarily need to re-write much, just shift what you have around and add some discussion",

I don't have a ton of experience responding to paper criticism, but I know more than once my advisor and I looked at a comment and said, \"Nah... beyond the scope.\" Then we crafted a response saying it was a good comment, but not necessary for the goal of the study, which is limited for whatever reason. Oh, and we added a line to the limitations to bring it up (rather than re-do everything). Or sometimes the reviewers have a preferred analysis method that you just didn't use and that's just the way it is.\n\nSo, yeah, I would first itemize the recommendations with an estimate of how much it would change things to do that and how much time it would take, and then talk to your advisor and committee and see what needs to actually be done to address each comment, one by one.",

One of my special interests is religion, both modern and ancient, and there were people even in classical Rome who believed that religion was harmful- with the primary example of Lucretius (not that he was an atheist per se, he just believed the gods lived far off and didn't care about humans). I take your point at atheism not being a \"belief\" in the typical sense, but I am not sure I understand how you look at their arguments as if they were actions. I'd love to read any sort of peer reviewed papers you have about this as well. Feel free to PM me.",
