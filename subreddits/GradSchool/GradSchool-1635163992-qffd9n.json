  "text": "I\u2019m a CS undergrad and Sorry for asking in gradschool subreddit but r/college didn't have any answer, so im having to ask here. In my college people usually do their final year thesis as a group of three. I'll have to start it in a semester so i\u2019d like to start choosing partners from now on. I am looking for doing something great that\u2019d have a chance of getting published. \n\nit\u2019d be super helpful if you could share your advices and/or any experience on this.",

      "text": "Generally speaking, for publications especially done during your undergrad, you would be working with a professor on some research. Your final year thesis doesn't usually result in a publication, unless it is groundbreaking work... I've also never heard of working in groups on your final year thesis, as it should fulfill your specific graduation requirements, at least that's what it looked like in my case. If you have more specific questions feel free to reach out. Best of luck!",

Someone who you enjoy bar hopping with my not be some you enjoy writing a paper with.  But like everything, it depends.  \n\nNo matter if you pick friends or not, treat this like a job and start a contract with your teammates.  There are probably template contracts online, but a minimum set of questions for each member:\n1. How much time can you commit each week to the project?\n2. What other responsibilities/conflicts do you have this semester? (This can be major events, like a wedding,  difficuly courses, or maybe a full time job)\n3. What do you personally want to get out of this project (CV builder, fun?)?\n\nIt's best to set a commom understanding of where everyone is at for the start of a long project and set expectations accordingly. You can also periodically assess to see how everyone is doing.  Good luck!",

Find an advisor : redditors can provide some tips/tricks but a dedicated advisor will help guide you in picking a topic and helping you set milestones.\n\n2. Read literature reviews : these collections of works will provide a jump start to understanding the state of whichever subfield of cs you're interested in.\n\n3. Read previos student theses : Find a great thesis and a \"meh\" thesis. These can be guideposts for comparing your thesis against. What do you like/dislike from each? What should you emulate from each? Etc.\n\nGood luck",
