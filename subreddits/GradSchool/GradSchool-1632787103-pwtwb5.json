  "text": "I always try to keep in mind that I'm pursuing a PhD, so my basic knowledge on a topic I teach may be more solid than my students, and I always try to consider that. But lately I've noticed some troubling trends in my students since returning to in person classes. \n\nFor example, I've had multiple student tell me things like they don't know what temperature water freezes at, don't know the pythagorean theorem or how/when to apply it, just super basic things that most take for granted. I suppose for brand new students, MAYBE I could understand, but these are mostly mid-program Mechanical Engineering students, so it just... seems really odd.\n\nHas anyone noticed anything similar?",

Probably just there because their rich parents made them do it so the future company manager has some kind of professional title next to his name in the door plaque. However, these are the people that most likely fundamentally finance scholarships because they be repeating every course they get into, and thus funneling more money into the university.\n\nAs a TA for a first semester course, I've been left speechless at the frequency of these kinds of students. Maybe it's not that they are dumb, it's more like that they are unwilling to lift a finger to do anything related to their academic studies. Example: they had an assigned reading for the week of Chapter X of Book Y. They're asking me where is the book uploaded in the virtual classroom (it's not uploaded because of copyright regulations) like an hour before the reading quiz, then they seem unwilling to go the library or buy it. Then a classmate gives them the PDF, and now they're asking in which page of the book does Chapter X. As in they were unwilling to download the book and open the boomarks to go directly to Chapter 3. They're so helpless, and it's getting annoying at this point. This is even more stupid considering how allegedly hard it is to get into college in general. Makes no sense to me.",

There are books for the GRE and GMAT(FOUNDATIONS OF MATH is the book name for GMAT) that summarizes high school math. Sometimes they don't need to really redo the math but just properly going through a book like this can make you realise what pitfalls you had. Let that student you know   \n\n\nMany math teachers just grade and say it's right or wrong. Even when they demand that steps are shown they don't look through the paper, see where you went wrong and see if there can spot any pitfalls. They really don't. So many students will come into UNI and learn about PEMDAS there.",

And I've even been extremely lucky, by not having much impact from the virus - but many people around me have lost family members, jobs, or financial support from their family who themselves lost work during the pandemic. Pandemic depression has been a huge issue in my field, and many people are suffering so hard from all of it that they are having trouble producing output at their jobs - even seasoned professionals.\n\nIt is extremely likely that this is where most or many of your students are at. People think students are young so they don't need to give a shit about the pandemic - well students don't exist in a vacuum, probably every single one of them has relatives and family members, whose health and life is important to them, and whose financial support they may rely on. And being isolated in your room with virtual classes and no social support for an extended period will leave many dysfunctional.\n\nIt's really hard to activate your brain to remember some formula you haven't used since 7th grade, when you have been completely isolated for the past year in constant daily danger of death of you and your loved ones and financial ruin. It's basically a state of PTSD, with all the decreases in brain function associated with it - and still compounding, as the pandemic and its effects aren't over yet.",

          "text": "Thank you for this post. I think it's very easy to pick on undergrads, only to then casually tell your beer buddies how you struggled to calculate a concentration the other day, or had a total brain fart and ran a gel backwards, or completely forgot about the existence of an entire project you half-finished a couple years ago, as if those are fundamentally different things. I think less experienced people in particular might be less aware of the toll various stressors take on their productivity and functionality. When you're more familiar with what you're capable of, you _feel_ it. We're now teaching a largely traumatised population, while not doing so great ourselves, for the most part. I don't know about your profession, but we were certainly not prepared for dealing with mass trauma in my line of work... I mean, yeah, they could try harder and pay attention more, but the angry emails in my inbox suggest I might also not be on top of things myself, and when a conversation gets honest, it becomes apparent this is perhaps more the norm than not nowadays.\n\n\nI also feel a lot of guilt. Didn't lose my job, been living in one of the few jurisdictions where the government took the pandemic seriously, barely know anyone who actually faced the viral monster in question. Knowing that the majority of people did not have these privileges, through no fault of their own, weighs on your soul. So many tragedies were completely, utterly preventable, and unnecessary. And to uncover more and more how the very core and foundation of our society are rotten, that every single one of our professions is at some level based on destructive exploitation of someone or something. Like, fuck, that's not very inspiring material to have in the background as you work, eh? I bet many undergrads are feeling bits and pieces of this too, except the younger ones might not even have the skills to figure it out yet, they don't really have a baseline.\n\n\nLastly, those blaming students for taking shortcuts must have either never worked anywhere or forgot what it was like ;-) If the shortcuts exist, and enforcement is weak, people will use them. Just peek in the kitchen of your favourite restaurant, or watch a construction site for a few minutes... (note: don't actually do that) If society weren't so fucked up that some of the children in our undergrads' pre-university classes were literally going hungry, maybe better enforcement would have been in place. But the way it is right now, the whole thing is an unsolvable moral clusterfuck pushed upon our overwhelmed teachers. What were we expecting?",

So, I took unimportant classes and spent my time slacking off to ameliorate lmao. e.g. I refused to take biochem online. I'm lucky that all of my lower-div stuff was in person. I'm not at all surprised that people don't know shit after online schooling. I also think the pandemic made softer students. When I took gen chem I nearly threw up the morning before my final. I had to take all of my finals a week early bc of an internship I would be doing. But I pushed through it, still got straight As, and it made me stronger. Now everyone is worried about in-person 'testing anxiety,' for example (Yeah, right. You don't have testing anxiety, you don't have to ascribe a pathology to every negative feeling you experience. You're just human. Push through it). We haven't had to memorize anything. We haven't had any real time constraints on our tests. We haven't been forced to juggle classes with research and clubs. Maybe I'm just a callous person but it seems the only way to fix this is not by making things easier, but by forcing them to grow and be uncomfortable. I really, really, really hate when teachers make things easier. It really bothers me. I understood and respected why things were easier during the pandemic. But now that we're in person I don't think it's the time for that. I don't want an A if, in reality, I'm a B or C student in that class. People need slaps in the face and my fellow classmates are so vocal that teachers are now softening their curricula. And looking back at it, all my best classes so far were the ones where I got wrecked. When I eventually TA in grad school I'm not buckling for any of the moaning (not that I won't be fair).

If, up to that point, nobody ever bothered to impress upon them that water freezes at 0C/32F/273K and that that knowledge is more than just a Jeopardy question (Because realistically all most people ever need to know is \"freezer + water = ice\") it's not a total shock that the student remembered it long enough to put it on a test and moved on.",

It\u2019s normal to be nervous, but these responses seem larger than in the past. \nI also agree that the past year and a half I guarantee most undergrads have been getting by by cheating/taking exams with other people so they didn\u2019t retain much information. And now that probably leads to increased nerves and anxiety now that they have to go back to the old way\u2026",

And it's not just my personal experience, as it's also known to be a thing with trauma and other mental health issues generally.\n\nObviously I can't know exactly what's going on with your specific students, but I think that it's thoughtful of you to notice that things seem off and it's reasonable to think that the pandemic might be a factor. We've collectively been living in survival mode for a year and half and have been surrounded by illness and death; the mental health impacts shouldn't be underestimated.",
