He seems like a nice enough guy and he's got this pretty awesome looking plant on his desk.\n\nI - trying to be cool and wanting to make a good impression - strike up a conversation about said houseplant and how it really looks like this plant called [samphire](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/glossary/samphire), which is a salty plant that grows in marshes and is often eaten with fish (side note: it's delicious). He seems interested in my plant conversation.\n\nThe fuck-up occurs when my putty-like post-bioinformatics brain decides that it MUST know if this plant is samphire.\n\nSo what do I do? \n\nI eat some of his plant.\n\nIn front of him.\n\nIt was not samphire, but was just a regular houseplant.\n\nI then wished him a good weekend and left, apparently thinking this was a normal interaction.\n\nI just went in there to drop off some cookies and it hit me like a flashback.\n\nThis poor guy just started here and within his first week a weird PhD student has eaten his desk plant.\n\nsend help.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold! I\u2019m glad I could make you all laugh!
