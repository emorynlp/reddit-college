  "text": "Sorry for the cynical take. I have severe burnout from constantly applying to various jobs and PhD programs since the fall 2019 application cycle. \n\nCurrently juggling four projects between two postdocs in a field I have no interest in whatsoever, while trying to apply to about 12 PhD programs (Hail Mary attempt), after working for half a year neurotically on NSF/NDSEG - itself all following on the heels of a 0/8 strikeout application cycle and a full year of formal unemployment post-graduation (STEM, multiple pubs).\n\nI\u2019m just so done with all of this. I\u2019m burnt out to the point where I was balling my eyes out (fully clothed) in the shower a few nights ago. I\u2019m a guy. I\u2019m beyond exhausted and really questioning why I\u2019m even bothering to put so much time and effort into this futile pursuit. \n\nEDIT: Already seeing a therapist.",

      "text": "This seems like as good a place to ask as anywhere. Americans, is this normal for you? I'm a Canadian PhD student and it wasn't anything like this for me and my colleagues.\n\nEvery PhD student I know emailed their prospective supervisor and determined there was funding beforehand and a research topic they were interested in. They sent over transcripts and other paperwork directly to their advisor so before they even applied they got the A-Okay from their advisor that if they applied they would 100% be accepted.\n\nMy grades in undergrad and masters weren't anything to write home about and I only had one paper in the process of being published in my masters, but I got accepted to all three universities (including a top 5 university in the country) I applied to and never once figured I would be turned down.\n\nI'm only asking/writing about this because clearly what OP is doing isn't good for their mental health at all, and yet they seem convinced it's mandatory.",

          "text": "Your experience was very similar for me in the US except we weren't given any assurances we'd be accepted. You sent an email to potential advisors to find out if there would be funding and if the potential advisor would be interested in working with you and was taking students that year. Usually you just sent a description of your research interests and your CV. Some people would go visit programs and potential advisors before applying but this isn't universal. I spent less than a month working on my applications.   \n\nI had no masters (applied as a senior in undergrad), an honors thesis that was unfinished, no papers, one tiny local conference presentation, a great GPA, and okay GRE score when I applied. I got accepted into the only 2 PhD programs I applied to with full funding, both well regarded in my field at R1 schools (archaeology doesn't have program rankings like some other fields do). I wasn't confident I'd get in to the PhDs, but I was 100% confident I'd get into the MA program I was going to apply to (got my PhD acceptances before the MA application was due). \n\nThis does not sound normal or healthy. And I'm confused how OP is doing two post-docs without having a PhD anyways. I was never burnt out. Was barely anxious except when my undergrad advisor ended up in England with minimal internet access due to his father's death the week letters of rec were due.",

              "text": "I should clarify that I\u2019m presently working as a full-time research assistant of the hospital. I\u2019m not doing two postdocs, the postdocs are my mentors at this job. \n\nI should probably also state that the field I\u2019m applying to is neuroscience - which is highly competitive. Schools get something like 300 applications for about 12 spots or less. Average GPA of admits tends to be around the same level as that of medical school (3.7). I have a 3.2 and it\u2019s nearly three years now since my graduation, which I\u2019ve been told should work in my favor considering I\u2019ve been working in academia for most of that time (just working, not school). Most people don\u2019t have a masters when they apply - that\u2019s usually something given as an \u201cincidental degree\u201d after you pass generals at the end of second year.\n\nMany have told me not to bother with outreach to professors and regard it as a waste of time: they get far too many emails from prospective students and typically just wait to see who the committee selects for interviews before they engage. Critical context here is that all programs for neuroscience are fully funded. This all having been said, I regard NSF/NDSEG as pretty much my only shot at getting into a program given that my application is unlikely to make it past the initial weedout due to a sub-standard GPA.",

          "text": "I\u2019m not in grad school. I can\u2019t quit my regular job. My burnout derives mostly from applying too much for too long. Quitting won\u2019t solve that. In fact I\u2019d argue it would likely make things worse as it would add a large amount of financial stress to the top of this mix.\n\nRegarding grad school itself, the way I view it is, given the steep competition I describe >[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/quqnw5/people_currently_applying_if_you_dont_already/hku58vb/)<, I very much think that if I\u2019m not willing to undercut my own health to get admission, then there\u2019s definitely someone who will. And that person will almost certainly outcompete me on every relevant metric of evaluation: papers, letters, experience and responsibility, grades\u2026 etc. \n\nNow I want to be very clear: I neither enjoy nor condone this. Academia is brutal enough as is without explicitly incentivizing burnout behavior, but I do think this is where selection pressure trends towards (in a macro sense, US specific). Everything is trending toward ever more credentials and qualifications. Why would grad school not? And if it is, then one of the only ways for a committee to demand that is to implicitly select for people that burn themselves out chasing a dream that they want more than anything else in the world (and thus more than other applicants in the pool).",
