  "title:": "PhD student, I've made many mistakes, is it my fault or the fact that I'm so unsupervised?",
  "text": "Hi all, I'm a second year PhD student in molecular biology and i have only 2 more years to go.\nIn the past year I've made so many mistakes, from common lab mistakes to bigger ones that led me to re-do a lot of stuff and it's stressing me out.\nI usually briefly discuss my protocols with my PI and or lab manager, but it mostly comes from me, they've never asked me to - on the other hand I know a lot of my peers can't even pick up a pipette without consulting deeply their supervisor. Even at the beginning, my PI told me to do a big experiment with cells, and I had to be the one to ask if he could look through the protocol. I'd never done cell culture before! And he took a look briefly and that was it.\n\nThen a while ago I did some experiments with a new protocol that the lab manage gave me to adapt to my needs. I adapted it, asked her and the PI if it was ok, they agreed. I even presented methods and results in a lab meeting. Then lately I've done some more of these experiments and they haven't worked out as well; I told the lab manager and she said \"don't worry it might be the cell batch or the reagents\". Then I figured out a part of the protocol was wrong. I told her, she replied \"ah of course you shouldn't do that\" like she'd never seen the protocol before.\n\nMaybe I am in the wrong here, it's my project after all and I should have realized sooner - I didn't, probably because the experiments were working well. But I feel like if either of my supervisors had really looked through the protocol I wouldn't have made the mistake. It just feels like a waste or money, time, reagents, energy, and it's taking a toll on my mental health too. I've had to redo so many experiments and every time I figure out some new mistake, it's tiring.\n\nSo my question is, is it normal to be left so unsupervised? I can appreciate the freedom, but at the same time I could do so much more if I didn't lose so much time and money on these mistakes...\nI feel like I have so little guidance, they agree on the protocol, then i make a mistake, then I realize it, I tell them and they're like \"ah yes that is obviously wrong\". Why tell me so late then??\n\nI should add, they're both super nice and have never been angry about my mistakes, and I've made a lot. But I also worry I look stupid in their eyes, because of course when these things happen and I explain the issue, they don't remember seeing the protocol so for them it's always obviously my shortcoming and wrong decision, though they have never put it that way.\n\nEdit to add I've only had 4 months of experience in molecular biology before starting the PhD, I come from neuroscience/psychology. So it's not like I've had 5 years of university in biology, just a few not hands-on classes. This is new to me and maybe that's also why I'm struggling to do things right.",

All in his own in our lab, and we used to have one to one meeting with the PI, which were not as helpful as a traditional lab meeting. \n\nIt's your call really. Some people appreciate autonomy and believe it's the  way to be trained to be independent scientists. But you run the risk of low productivity. I have similar publications to my cohort in the other labs. But I see PhD students on Twitter bragging about their CNS papers. Obviously, it wouldn't happen without a heavy investment of money and time from the PI and other lab members.",

          "text": "Well, I haven't properly spoken to my PI since late June. And lab meetings are mostly about common lab stuff, what to buy, what to solve etc and not me and other students' work. Per grad school rules I should have a one to one meeting every week.\nMost of the students I know meet with their supervisor much more, that why I feel I am not so supervised.\n\nI have 3 years total for my PhD and I don't know how I will manage to get enough results, while I appreciate learning how to be independent, as you say, lack of training also means low productivity.",

              "text": "From what you wrote, I wouldn't worry about you (I mean a little stress is always good). You showed initiative and willingness to learn and test new things. You'd be fine.\n\nBut, you need papers to graduate and to get a job. I recommend that you clearly communicate your concerns to the PI. Two years is not plenty of time, but is also the right amount of time to (start), and wrap up a very good story. Whether you'd decide to continue on your project or start new ones, you should write a detailed proposal, including a background, a hypothesis, a list of experiments and experiments design, and (timeline), similar to R01 grants. Send it to your PI and ask for her feedback in writing, and follow up with her as much as you need. Spend 10 days - two weeks on this and don't worry about your bench work progress. Believe me, It would save you a lot of time. You can also use this proposal to apply for any available internal or external grants.\n\nYou are underestimating your experience. Self-Motivation and independence are very valuable skills and will help you a lot in the future. I'd rather work with (or hire if I am a PI) someone like you, even with less publication, than your peers who need a babysit every step on the way. This would be very much appreciated when you apply for postdocs or industry positions. But, you need to think of ways to documents this autonomy. Writing that proposal is one way. Designing a project that is a little bit different than your PI's work is another. Initiating collaboration with another lab is also a good way to demonstrate your independency and to help you with your new project. All that would be documented in your PI's recommendation letter. I did one of my rotations in a small gene therapy lab. The senior PhD student at the time pitched an idea related to metabolism, but address the same question they work on in the lab. With the PI approval, he started a collaboration with another lab and ended up with a good paper. That student graduated with okay papers, not anything about IF of 8, mid-tier program, but was immediately hired to a big lab in Harvard. He's applying for industry PI positions now (three years in postdocs).",

      "text": "I was in a similar position, I started my PhD with zero cell culture background, fresh out of undergrad. I was handed a bunch of cells and a 15 year old bioreactor and told to make a PhD out of it. I contaminated a LOT of cultures for months. Eventually I had someone watch me work and they figured out what I was doing wrong. But for months, my PIs just told me to keep doing it again and again and called me stupid behind my back. I almost quit.\n\nTo a point, a big thing you learn from a PhD is how to figure out how to learn something when there is no one to teach you. However, if your PI wants their lab to succeed, it is in their best interest to make sure you succeed as well. And the way to do that is through mentorship that they are not providing you. This sounds sadly normal but that doesn't make it ok.\n\nThe thing that turned my PhD experience around was finding mentorship outside of my PIs. I became extremely close with a postdoc in the lab, and he 100% saved me. I also reached out to anyone I could find who did similar work: grad students and postdocs in other groups, previous members of my lab group who had graduated and were willing to help, industry collaborators, and vendors. Those are the people who reviewed my protocols, helped me troubleshoot, gave input on my experimental design and results.\n\n(I was shocked to find vendors who were so willing to help. I bought an AKTA during grad school and the technician who did the install taught me how to run the thing. I just hung out during his install and asked questions. I strongly recommend making friends like this, it has helped my career immensely.)",

If you get it wrong do some library work and figure it out. Do another experiment,  design another experiment, read some more papers. Figure out what went wrong and correct it. This is the meaning of \"Have conferred upon u/Thr1w1w11 Having demonstrated ability by original research in (insert your science here) the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy....etc.\" Have you asked your fellow grad students for help? you learn from your peers. Of course they don't remember the protocol it's not their research it's yours. And it IS your shortcoming and wrong decision! It's your experiment! YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR RESEARCH! If you fuck up it's your problem. Sleep faster, do more experiments, read more.\n\nGot it?\n\nOh and no one said it's a four year degree, 5 more like it, more if you don't get your research to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds a little harsh but it's not. I never really spoke to my PI about such things. Talk to fellow grads in your lab. read more papers, go to the library, figure it out. (The librarian had to kick me out of the science library when i fell asleep and she closed at 2 am. Once she locked my ass in the library and campus police had to let me out....)",

Now turns out he's decided to do it differently (to avoid the problem I'm having) and didn't even think once about telling me. When I asked, he said ah yes I figured that out months ago. Thanks?\nI am slightly annoyed because I asked multiple times multiple people, in the meantime others figured out the problem, most likely discussed it with PI/supervisor, and NOBODY told me. I figured it out on my own and that's good. But would it have been so bad to tell me hey be careful about this because it didn't work for me?\n\nBtw it's 3 years.

When I asked, he said ah yes I figured that out months ago\"\n\nDid you ask this colleague? I say these things not because I'm being an asshole but because, as evidenced by the above quote, you didn't exhaust all your research possibilities. That's not a bad thing and certainly lessons are learned over and over again because of this when they \"could\" be avoided but the point is that your're there to learn. You cannot learn by doing everything right failure is part of it. Just pointing out that it is ultimately YOUR responsibility. Your adviser and lab guy probably gave it a cursory glance and didn't read ever single word of your protocol, i would do the same. I would also assume you did complete research and decided on the best course of action....\n\nIt seems by your statements that you are blaming your colleagues for your failure when ULTIMATELY it is YOUR responsibility. An analogy I use in my lab is this \"if you get a bottle of reagent from a lab mate and use it with the understanding that it is a certain substance at a certain concentration and your reaction doesn't work because a parameter was wrong who's fault is it?\" #1 it is your fault for trusting someone other than yourself! the first rule of research is that you cannot trust anyone other than yourself to do the experiment the way you want it done. and THEN you really should be questioning your ever single step to assure that you did it right yourself!\n\nThe lesson is that it is your responsibility to ensure your experiments are run correctly. More importantly it is your responsibility to ensure that you got valid data from your experiment to draw your conclusions. If there is ever any question in your mind as to the validity of your outcomes you should reevaluate and repeat the experiment.\n\nI don't know how else to state it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the future when you have employees this becomes clear. This is also why there are micromanaging advisers. Then some of us just let you fall on your face to teach you the lesson again.",

I was given the PhD thesis of a person that did the same experiments and he wrote he just put them in darkness for 1 day directly and that's it. I asked the lab manager, she said that would not be ok, and to follow the original protocol (1 day light, then darkness). I also told the PI I wanted to do it like this. Since I didn't see any effects of this day in light at first, I thought it wasn't a problem. Somehow now I see the effects, and the lab manager acted like it was obvious, when she was the one to 1 send me the protocol, and 2 approve it when I asked about it. But now I'm scared to look like the one who randomly decided to do it like this.\n\nI'm not saying it's only their fault or that they should 100% have caught the mistake, just that sometimes when they don't catch stuff like this (which I clearly stated multiple times to them and in presentations) it is painful (for me, them, budget), and it feels like they don't pay so much attention to what I say. They're the experts in this whole light-induced thing, I've just started working with and understanding it.\n\nI've only had the lab tech show me how to do cell culture and how to use one machine.

      "text": "Hi OP - I have been in my PhD program in molecular biology for approximately 8 months and I am going through something similar to you. I am mostly left to my own devices and have been mostly solo planning the experiments, troubleshooting etc. Hence, I really do understand your stance right now about feeling unsupported or left alone. My PI however is very supportive in the sense that whenever I think I need advice, I should ask him, but he is a person who does not tell you what to do. I think that this is probably the most important part of training in a PhD - to learn how to become an independent researcher.\n\nIn this sense, I think we can find some commonality here - it is very very very common to make mistakes. I've made big mistakes, small mistakes, even STUPID mistakes such as knocking over my media or not being able to recover a 600$ vial of cells properly. This is part and parcel of the process - and its not easy dealing with mistakes. I myself struggle when it comes to making mistakes that I think might be obvious to others but then I feel stupid when I actually identify the problem and with all these thoughts in your head, it is easy to lose yourself in it. But if you think about it, this is the process of a PhD - you learn how to own your project, make your mistakes and move forward. The best way to learn is to make your own mistakes, this is true not just for your project progress and planning, but also for technical skills. You have to fail western/facs etc a certain amount of times before you understand the shortfalls of certain things you're doing, and then you learn to overcome, optimise and perfect it. This is the mindset I am trying to push myself to have whenever I make mistakes, big, small or silly but honestly its not easy.\n\nSo take care OP, and take comfort in the fact that you are NOT alone. \n\nIf you wanna have a chat just drop me a dm, because I think you and I are in very similar positions.",

I'm currently studying a reaction which depends very much on pH value. But I thought that keeping initial pH value between 7 - 8 would be ok. However, after I had already prepared and measured all those systems, my thesis advisor told me that pH cannot be that different, that the difference must not go beyond 0.20 pH units. So I did those experiments again, re adjusting the pH value, but I will keep the other systems to show how pH affects the reaction because now I have two identical set of systems with different pH values. So those experiments will not be a waste of time (they took me several weeks!!!!). I hope you can do sth of the sort with your data.",

Supervisor was a very nice person, extremely hospitable and had a warm, mentor-like personality. However he did not supervise his students at all really. Most of his lab was actually comprised of undergrad students (he had one MSc student but I just assumed he didn't want to take on too many grad students). Having no experience in cell culturing, IHC or animal work, he threw me into the deep end and basically told me to CREATE my own protocol using some papers he recommended I look at and our own project's specific goals. I basically created a protocol which was a mish mash of what other people had success with in similar experiments, but obviously because my experiment was novel and using different tissue, there had to be differences and I basically went in blind. I told him we needed a few IHC kits that totaled to a few thousand, he just said \"sure, whatever I'll buy them\" without even looking at my protocol. The funny thing is he didn't have experience with this type of staining and referred me to the lab technician down the hall, who helped me learn how to carry out the protocol I made.\n\nOh boy, let me tell you my protocol did not work. At all. I reconfigured it so many times and I basically went 3 months with no results. Caused me a lot of stress and it wasn't until the very end of the year, when I was finishing up at the lab, when I FINALLY got something semi-serviceable thanks to the help of my cell biology professor. However, I was left empty handed with no results and a half-baked protocol that didn't stain perfectly to show after nearly a year of work (okay I spent the first 6 months helping out on other projects but when I got my own... sheesh).\n\nThe whole experience really turned me off from wet labs so I promptly left after a year and moved on to dry lab stuff. My old PI still remains a positive point in my life (he wrote me some excellent reference letters and is overall still an amazing person), and most importantly he taught me how to conduct independent research, how to figure out stuff on my own without someone holding my hand through it all. That was his goal in the beginning, he wanted to create research students that were independent and motivated to be curious on their own volition. He never really cared about the results (he's an older fella with a 200k+ salary, tenure and chair appointment so he was more so into teaching and coordinating at the time), he only cared about making his students autonomous researchers. I appreciate him for that.\n\nNot really sure if this story helps at all, but I wanted to share the silver lining I learned from that experience. This is the stuff that makes you into a great researcher and scientist.",

      "text": "First off, I wouldn't beat yourself up too much. Certainly there are benefits to doing it right the first time (the time, energy, cost, as you mention), but there are also benefits to doing it wrong - sometimes that is how you learn better. There is a lot to learn by doing, and a lot of getting it right is getting it wrong first. \n\nIt sounds like your advisors generally have your back (which is great!), but don't have the time to do the work alongside you, which is a common enough occurrence I think. They are expecting you to be the expert at the protocol, which isn't an unfair ask for a PhD student, but at the same time you should be free to ask questions if you don't understand a part of it. I'd like to think it shows initiative on your part, and identifying problems is the first part of problem solving. It might be worthwhile to slow down a little on conducting experiments, and really get a good grasp of the protocol and make notes of anything that seems off or wrong or that you don't understand. Make a point of discussing this with your advisors before the next experiment, and then hopefully you can avoid any silly mistakes. \n\nI personally believe that there is less wrong about making mistakes than there is about not attempting to correct them. You're cognizant of your shortcomings in this type of research (lack of experience), but that improves the more you do these experiments and learn about your project. Don't get down on yourself because you aren't doing it perfectly every time. As for your lack of supervision, try to nail down a time to talk to your advisors specifically about things you would like more supervision on, and see where that goes. It could be that they like what you're doing and trust you enough that they feel that you don't need more supervision, or they could be unaware or checked out for one reason or another. From my personal experience, a lot of times it is a combination of the two - my advisors have been super busy with other things and thus don't have the time for me, but trust me to do what needs doing and figure it out. It's a bittersweet feeling, and can definitely contribute to intense imposter syndrome when I feel like I'm letting everyone down.",

What you can do in the future is ask to go over the protocol with you PI/Lab manager via conversation. Your PI and lab manager are human so they might miss things that they would catch if you talked through the process. Also, consider getting input form other grad students. \n\nThe most important question I would be asking is if your work environment is toxic. Like, when you make a mistake are your PI and lab manager blaming it on you specifically or lack of training? Grad school is notorious for toxic work environments but if it's somewhere where you feel like you can make this mistakes without getting yelled out, that's great.",

When we graduate, we can use these big picture skills we learn to get our next jobs. However, it is a hard line to balance between helping a student learn and letting a student flounder.",

Yes, he was the PI, but that doesn't give him license to abuse his researchers. Now I'm working in a lab where I'm a part of big projects but my actual work and writing is largely unsupervised; on top of this, my new PI wants his researchers to have more freedom and the ability to choose what they want to do and how they want to attack a problem (within limits, of course).   \n\n\nHaving done research four \\~5 years now, I can confidently say that learning the possible mistakes you can make is part of the job. Messing stuff up hurts (big time), but it teaches you a good lesson at the end of the day. What might help with you, if your PI is attentive/nice, is to sit down with a summary of what you've tried and what has worked/not worked; and try to discuss a better plan moving forwards. I've tended to find that PIs want their researchers to make mistakes, but there becomes a point where they want to be looped in and help try to make some headway.   \n\n\nPhysical science is hard, but the payoff is incredibly rewarding. Just know that you're not alone, even the best researchers have hit these types of problems before. Best of luck to you!",
