Even at the beginning, my PI told me to do a big experiment with cells, and I had to be the one to ask if he could look through the protocol. I'd never done cell culture before! And he took a look briefly and that was it.\n\nThen a while ago I did some experiments with a new protocol that the lab manage gave me to adapt to my needs. I adapted it, asked her and the PI if it was ok, they agreed. I even presented methods and results in a lab meeting. Then lately I've done some more of these experiments and they haven't worked out as well; I told the lab manager and she said \"don't worry it might be the cell batch or the reagents\". Then I figured out a part of the protocol was wrong. I told her, she replied \"ah of course you shouldn't do that\" like she'd never seen the protocol before.\n\nMaybe I am in the wrong here, it's my project after all and I should have realized sooner - I didn't, probably because the experiments were working well. But I feel like if either of my supervisors had really looked through the protocol I wouldn't have made the mistake. It just feels like a waste or money, time, reagents, energy, and it's taking a toll on my mental health too. I've had to redo so many experiments and every time I figure out some new mistake, it's tiring.\n\nSo my question is, is it normal to be left so unsupervised? I can appreciate the freedom, but at the same time I could do so much more if I didn't lose so much time and money on these mistakes...\nI feel like I have so little guidance, they agree on the protocol, then i make a mistake, then I realize it, I tell them and they're like \"ah yes that is obviously wrong\". Why tell me so late then??\n\nI should add, they're both super nice and have never been angry about my mistakes, and I've made a lot. But I also worry I look stupid in their eyes, because of course when these things happen and I explain the issue, they don't remember seeing the protocol so for them it's always obviously my shortcoming and wrong decision, though they have never put it that way.\n\nEdit to add I've only had 4 months of experience in molecular biology before starting the PhD, I come from neuroscience/psychology. So it's not like I've had 5 years of university in biology, just a few not hands-on classes. This is new to me and maybe that's also why I'm struggling to do things right.", "author": "Thr1w1w11", "created": 1631716308, "retrieved": 1632844242, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"hd126jm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/por9ts/phd_student_ive_made_many_mistakes_is_it_my_fault/hd126jm/", "text": "You have lab meetings and you call yourself (Unsupervised)!

I was handed a bunch of cells and a 15 year old bioreactor and told to make a PhD out of it. I contaminated a LOT of cultures for months. Eventually I had someone watch me work and they figured out what I was doing wrong. But for months, my PIs just told me to keep doing it again and again and called me stupid behind my back. I almost quit.\n\nTo a point, a big thing you learn from a PhD is how to figure out how to learn something when there is no one to teach you. However, if your PI wants their lab to succeed, it is in their best interest to make sure you succeed as well. And the way to do that is through mentorship that they are not providing you. This sounds sadly normal but that doesn't make it ok.\n\nThe thing that turned my PhD experience around was finding mentorship outside of my PIs. I became extremely close with a postdoc in the lab, and he 100% saved me. I also reached out to anyone I could find who did similar work: grad students and postdocs in other groups, previous members of my lab group who had graduated and were willing to help, industry collaborators, and vendors. Those are the people who reviewed my protocols, helped me troubleshoot, gave input on my experimental design and results.\n\n(I was shocked to find vendors who were so willing to help. I bought an AKTA during grad school and the technician who did the install taught me how to run the thing. I just hung out during his install and asked questions. I strongly recommend making friends like this, it has helped my career immensely.)", "author": "lionlament", "created": 1631753072, "upvotes": 4}, "hd0pga7": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/por9ts/phd_student_ive_made_many_mistakes_is_it_my_fault/hd0pga7/", "text": "You are there to learn and solve your own problems.

I am mostly left to my own devices and have been mostly solo planning the experiments, troubleshooting etc. Hence, I really do understand your stance right now about feeling unsupported or left alone. My PI however is very supportive in the sense that whenever I think I need advice, I should ask him, but he is a person who does not tell you what to do. I think that this is probably the most important part of training in a PhD - to learn how to become an independent researcher.\n\nIn this sense, I think we can find some commonality here - it is very very very common to make mistakes. I've made big mistakes, small mistakes, even STUPID mistakes such as knocking over my media or not being able to recover a 600$ vial of cells properly. This is part and parcel of the process - and its not easy dealing with mistakes. I myself struggle when it comes to making mistakes that I think might be obvious to others but then I feel stupid when I actually identify the problem and with all these thoughts in your head, it is easy to lose yourself in it. But if you think about it, this is the process of a PhD - you learn how to own your project, make your mistakes and move forward. The best way to learn is to make your own mistakes, this is true not just for your project progress and planning, but also for technical skills. You have to fail western/facs etc a certain amount of times before you understand the shortfalls of certain things you're doing, and then you learn to overcome, optimise and perfect it. This is the mindset I am trying to push myself to have whenever I make mistakes, big, small or silly but honestly its not easy.\n\nSo take care OP, and take comfort in the fact that you are NOT alone. \n\nIf you wanna have a chat just drop me a dm, because I think you and I are in very similar positions.", "author": "daniellcl49bm", "created": 1631733600, "upvotes": 6}, "hcziot6": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/por9ts/phd_student_ive_made_many_mistakes_is_it_my_fault/hcziot6/", "text": "If you feel undersupervised, try to learn about protocols from the Materials and Methods section of papers in your research area.

Supervisor was a very nice person, extremely hospitable and had a warm, mentor-like personality. However he did not supervise his students at all really. Most of his lab was actually comprised of undergrad students (he had one MSc student but I just assumed he didn't want to take on too many grad students). Having no experience in cell culturing, IHC or animal work, he threw me into the deep end and basically told me to CREATE my own protocol using some papers he recommended I look at and our own project's specific goals. I basically created a protocol which was a mish mash of what other people had success with in similar experiments, but obviously because my experiment was novel and using different tissue, there had to be differences and I basically went in blind. I told him we needed a few IHC kits that totaled to a few thousand, he just said \"sure, whatever I'll buy them\" without even looking at my protocol. The funny thing is he didn't have experience with this type of staining and referred me to the lab technician down the hall, who helped me learn how to carry out the protocol I made.\n\nOh boy, let me tell you my protocol did not work. At all. I reconfigured it so many times and I basically went 3 months with no results. Caused me a lot of stress and it wasn't until the very end of the year, when I was finishing up at the lab, when I FINALLY got something semi-serviceable thanks to the help of my cell biology professor. However, I was left empty handed with no results and a half-baked protocol that didn't stain perfectly to show after nearly a year of work (okay I spent the first 6 months helping out on other projects but when I got my own... sheesh).\n\nThe whole experience really turned me off from wet labs so I promptly left after a year and moved on to dry lab stuff. My old PI still remains a positive point in my life (he wrote me some excellent reference letters and is overall still an amazing person), and most importantly he taught me how to conduct independent research, how to figure out stuff on my own without someone holding my hand through it all. That was his goal in the beginning, he wanted to create research students that were independent and motivated to be curious on their own volition. He never really cared about the results (he's an older fella with a 200k+ salary, tenure and chair appointment so he was more so into teaching and coordinating at the time), he only cared about making his students autonomous researchers.

Certainly there are benefits to doing it right the first time (the time, energy, cost, as you mention), but there are also benefits to doing it wrong - sometimes that is how you learn better. There is a lot to learn by doing, and a lot of getting it right is getting it wrong first. \n\nIt sounds like your advisors generally have your back (which is great!), but don't have the time to do the work alongside you, which is a common enough occurrence I think. They are expecting you to be the expert at the protocol, which isn't an unfair ask for a PhD student, but at the same time you should be free to ask questions if you don't understand a part of it. I'd like to think it shows initiative on your part, and identifying problems is the first part of problem solving. It might be worthwhile to slow down a little on conducting experiments, and really get a good grasp of the protocol and make notes of anything that seems off or wrong or that you don't understand. Make a point of discussing this with your advisors before the next experiment, and then hopefully you can avoid any silly mistakes. \n\nI personally believe that there is less wrong about making mistakes than there is about not attempting to correct them. You're cognizant of your shortcomings in this type of research (lack of experience), but that improves the more you do these experiments and learn about your project. Don't get down on yourself because you aren't doing it perfectly every time. As for your lack of supervision, try to nail down a time to talk to your advisors specifically about things you would like more supervision on, and see where that goes. It could be that they like what you're doing and trust you enough that they feel that you don't need more supervision, or they could be unaware or checked out for one reason or another. From my personal experience, a lot of times it is a combination of the two - my advisors have been super busy with other things and thus don't have the time for me, but trust me to do what needs doing and figure it out.
