  "text": "Very old school, but I know there are a lot of spaces where non-traditional looks are still frowned upon. Have you guys had negative feedback? Positive? Any specific experiences colored your disposition towards it all? Do you think your discipline influenced how it\u2019s perceived? \n\nI\u2019ve got a full sleeve, palm tattoo, nose ring, and a split tongue, and my chest piece peaks through my collar. Most people don\u2019t notice the tongue, but I\u2019ve gotten a few negative comments towards the tattoos through my grad school experience so far. I know what my professional plan is and was mindful of that when I got these so I\u2019m not too pressed about it. But was just talking to my gf about dying her hair and I\u2019m curious what other experiences people have had.",

No one has ever said anything rude or made any sort of comment about them, but I also don't think they'd dare. I don't think I come across as much of a pushover. \n\nI think tattoos, hair dye, and most piercings are now well-accepted and no longer taboo in the vast majority of fields/institutions. I've seen this question asked a million times over the years in different subs and I can't recall a single time someone said they had been negatively judged beyond maybe 1 weird comment from a super old dude no one really respected anyway, but even that seems rare. Body mods (beyond small-medium stretchers) are a different kettle of fish, and I think the split tongue could be really off-putting to some people so I would expect some comments or negative feelings for that. Tattoos are common as mud, split tongues are exceptionally rare.\n\nEdit: I just checked, and I think tongue splitting is actually **illegal** in much of the UK, that's how taboo it is. So yeah, you'll almost certainly see some pushback for that one on the international stage, even if they don't say it to your face.",

My job outside of school is in my field (PM for a Tech Company) and there are lots of women and \"alternative\" looking people like myself in my actual real-world experience of this career, so that reminds me that school is just the \"academia\" side of my chosen path and doesnt last forever. The world has become way more open-minded and understanding even in the last 10 years or so. Im in tech and live in CO so it's probably a little more accepted here than a more conservative state or customer-facing field/major. What you look like has absolutely nothing to do with your technical ability or professionalism, so I just embody that and work hard. I think as time goes on- the \"old school\" or \"traditional/modest\" way of looking/dressing will become the minority. I know a surgeon that has a full sleeve of tattoos, bright red hair, and piercings. I think if you are feeling the negativity just remember that its always better to express yourself than to try and fit in- people like us are the exact reason that it is becoming more accepted and we get to be a part of that non-judgemental mindset shift that can only make the world a better place. But I definitely understand the struggle and these things dont change overnight.  \n\"Never judge a book by its cover.\"",

      "text": "I\u2019ve got visible tattoos and had no issues with them in grad school, on the job market, or now in my tenure track position. I know people in my university with dyed hair too, and it doesn\u2019t get much attention tbh. I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019ve encountered with facial piercings or a split tongue so I can\u2019t speak to those, I\u2019d assume the split tongue would get more negative attention just because it\u2019s much more uncommon. \n\nRealistically I don\u2019t think 99% of people care. But there will be some people who do. The only time they really matter is if they\u2019re on a search committee and you\u2019re trying to get a job. So that can suck but do you wanna change everything for that one person, or just find a different place where it\u2019s not an issue? That answer would probably depend on what the job market looks like for your field.\n\nKeep in mind you can always tone things down while on the market. Cover all tattoos. Take out piercings. Dye hair a more traditional color for a few months. I personally would just because why take the chance? Then get the job and do you.",

I am young, female, and have a number of face/neck/wrist piercings.\n\nEngineers: Think it's cool\n\nSocial scientists: Have had several male professors email me after/during conferences to tell me they don't like them, have had a faculty member comment that \"no one will want to learn from someone who looks like me\" in a public meeting, but most people also just think it's cool. In my experience hair colors and tattoos are pretty common compared to unusual piercings or body mods. Universally all students think it's cool.\n\nLaw school: All the active lawyers I've worked with have not cared or think it's cool, never had a problem in court & juries seem to like it actually, but I had a law prof who insisted that \"I could have been beautiful if I hadn't done that to my face\" and who introduced me to other people saying \"Look at what she's done to her face.\"\n\nSo YMMV I think, but I'm not taking out my piercings any time soon and it didn't affect me negatively on the academic job market at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: grammar",
