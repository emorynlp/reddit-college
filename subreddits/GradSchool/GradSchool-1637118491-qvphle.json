  "title:": "How to tell if your advisor is micro-managing?",
  "text": "This is my first semester in graduate school and I am starting to get so annoyed by my PhD advisor. He is micro-managing every aspect of what I do. For instance, when he ask me to show him my work, he begins to criticize me as my program font size is too large and want me to decrease the font size so I can see better. In addition, he will nitpick on other things like today, he email me to say 'subtract off' instead of 'minus off' during our email conversation. I have even raised up this issue to him and he say it is important to raise ourselves to high standards and that I should not expect him to praise me. But I do not want him to praise me and I just want him to stop micro-managing me?\n\nIn addition to all that, he also try to control how I learn things - for instance, when I make notes in the form of comments in the code he will tell me it is a waste of time. As for myself, I feel like I learn best independently and having a heavily involved advisor is suffocating.",

      "text": "**Commenting your code is absolutely not a waste of time.**\n\nI felt very micromanaged my first year as well ( definitely not to the degree that you're describing tho). Now I'm in year 4 and I feel like my advisor doesn't remember that I even exist lol. Over time my advisor came to trust that I could handle things on my own and stopped constantly checking in. Also, once she took on more grad students she just had less time to micro manage me. Unfortunately for you, your advisor just sounds very anal and you might just have to deal with it as best you can. Try to just let it go and maybe meet less often if possible so that when you do meet, you have bigger fish to fry and he won't have as much opportunity to micromanage. Best of luck.\n\nand again, **Commenting your code is absolutely not a waste of time.**",

          "text": "Thanks I am trying to take graduate school as a positive experience as I still have at least 4 years here and I hope it gets better with time. Also, here it doesn't seems like micro-manage is a deal breaker and thus maybe, I should try to bear with it?",

              "text": "Whether or not something is a deal breaker depends completely on you. These micromanaging micro aggressions may build up to be a macro problem. Or you and your advisor may just learn to work together better. It's your first semester, so I wouldn't write him off yet. If you have committee members or other professors involved in your work maybe try leaning on them for guidance.\n\nGrad school is what I would consider a type two fun. It's rarely a super positive experience while you're experiencing it, but if you stick it out it's worth it in the long run. To me, a huge purpose for going to grad school is to prove that you can persevere through hard times. And the times will only get harder from here. So do your best to have a good working relationship with your advisor, but also, buckle up and get ready to persevere.",
