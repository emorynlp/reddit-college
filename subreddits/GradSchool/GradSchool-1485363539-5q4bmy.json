The executive order to stop issuing visas to Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, and Syria means that a lot of our friends, labmates, peers, and colleagues may have to make some very difficult choices; many of them are on single-entry visas, so they may have to choose between seeing family and continuing in program, and that they may not be able to attend conferences and other professional events. Know they're going through a lot, and be kind.",

So I know someone studying particle and nuclear physics but he is a British national, so he is on multiple entry visa. My field is tangentially related to biotechnology in a very, very remote way, but I am a Japanese national and I received multiple-entry visa. \n\nThe DELAY at the embassy/consulate, however, as well as the issuance of the visas, are completely arbitrary and totally up to the immigration officer. The sensitive fields pertain to the delay, not the issuance of the visa. The school name also plays a huge role, as well as the programme; PhDs have an easier time gaining entry than, say, a language school programme. Harvard would have a better chance than No-Name-University School-of-Pottery. Basically, if you get a total jerk as your officer, you're out of luck. You can present yourself as totally harmless with strong ties to your home country and still get denied (remember, the officer doesn't supply you with the reason, nor is the officer obligated to). On the other hand, if you get an officer who's nice or too lazy to deny you, you can get your visa without complete set of documentation. You'll need your I-20 or equivalent and admission papers and yadda yadda, but you might not be required to show your bank statement to show that you have ties to your home country.\n\nKeep in mind that I renewed my visa last year, when Obama's face was still on the wall. It was already difficult to get visas then. Postdoctoral work can fall under F1 if the timeline is continuous and you are in STEM (the list somehow includes mathematical economics and social psych, so who knows what STEM means to the government).

It's a huge risk, because whenever you renew, there's this scenario running through your head, of \"what if I leave all my stuff here, then get renewal denied?\". \n\nFor those of you who want to see what sort of hoops we have to jump through, check out the [PhD comic strip](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1033). \n\nIt's a dumb system. Incidentally, those of us coming into the US have trouble getting a driver's license as well (need insurance to buy a car, need a car to get driver's license, need a driver's license to get insurance... or some similar cycle).\n\nIf any of you have a friend in this sort of dire strait, please be supportive of them and remind them that the DSO is there to help you.
