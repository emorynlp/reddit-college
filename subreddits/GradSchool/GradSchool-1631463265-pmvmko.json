You lightly socialize with others, make small talk and attend meetings. If you want to meet with supervisors, you should schedule a meeting beforehand or ask their availability. Really depends on if your supervisors have an \"open-door\" policy as well. For socialising, it will be pretty easy and you will find that it is good for mental health to meet people in person. You get to learn a lot more than you would compared to online meetings.", "author": "givemeyourdonut", "created": 1631536138, "upvotes": 2}}}
