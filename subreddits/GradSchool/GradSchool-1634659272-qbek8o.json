  "text": "So I have been debating whether I should change my thesis PI for a while by now but I don't know if I'm just being weak (ie I might still fail after changing to a new lab) or whether it will work better for me if i change my lab. I'm currently a second year STEM student who's joined this current lab for almost a year. My PI is a new PI so I joined knowing that they will be ambitious and pushy but they were really nice during the rotation so I ended up joining anyway. But now there are times my mental health is worsening because of them after I have joined the lab. They are always in the lab (pretty much everyday, including the weekends) so sometimes when I leave the lab early like before 6.30 p.m. they will get mad at me. they also get mad easily and they will yell at people. Whenever they get mad (even if it's not directed at me) I get bad anxiety and chills and I couldn't focus at work at all. I used to look forward to go to the lab every day and now I dread going to the lab.\n\nBut I didn't seriously consider changing labs until I talked to a former rotation student about it. They mentioned that they weren't gonna choose my PI because they feel like my PI doesn't really teach you stuff even though they are constantly in the lab, they just expect you to work. Then it kind of makes me understand the crux of the problem - I don't feel like I'm being mentored in this lab as this lab also hasn't gotten any postdocs or senior students. I understand that doing a PhD should be my effort and input but I also would like more mentoring at least in the beginning of my study, plus it gets lonely sometimes too since I'm their first student and it seems like they aren't trying to get new postdocs or students.\n\nI think the reasons why I'm still staying in this lab is that I really do like my project and I don't want to cause troubles and it's a few more months till my preliminary exam as well. Also, I'm not sure if these things are just normal in every lab and the problem is just me and changing lab will not change anything.\n\nAny advice would be great! Most of my friends are not in the STEM major and it's been unhelpful talking to them about my situation.",
