  "text": "I had a supervisor who would often put ominous messages as the subject line of their emails. Things like \"Call me now\" or \"Let's talk today at noon\". I've never had my heartrate spike faster and my fingers type out an email quicker than after getting one of those emails. After many years with them, I came to learn that was just the way they communicated, and it's even a running joke among the new students. Still, I can't help but wonder if he knew what he was doing and just kept doing it anyway, because, frankly - it worked.",

It was in my Higher Education in American Society course, and my professor was briefly going over the 1970s. On one of the presentation slides, there was a picture of John Travolta. Out of seemingly nowhere, she went on and on about how pretty much everybody was attracted to him back then, and then she paused for a second, laughed to herself, and told us about the lesbians for John Travolta Facebook group. I have no idea if it\u2019s still up or not, but I know a few people in my class did look it up after she mentioned it.",
