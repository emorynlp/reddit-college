  "text": "Title basically says it all, I graduated from my masters program (MA and MLIS) in May with no publications, presentations, or awards. I'm currently job hunting and looking at all the sample CVs from recent grads in my field that include long lists of publications and presentations it feels like I'm kinda screwed on the job front. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(I was involved in conferences, but on the organization/committee side of things since my anxiety and mental health issues prevented me from putting myself forward to present.)",

Are you looking for the same jobs as those recent grads you're comparing yourself to? \n\nStrong organizing skills will definitely be a great asset. You're really only in trouble if (1) you really want a job that requires skills you haven't demonstrated, like paper writing, and (2) you can't find a way to explain how the skills you DO have will help you be successful in that job (despite your lack of the specific skills in item 1).\n\nIn cases like this, there are usually several skills you have that you're not considering useful or important. You're probably better than you think!",

              "text": "Great!  Best of luck!  \n\nI'd recommend bouncing ideas or getting your resume reviewed by your university's career services and/or a more senior graduate student who has industry experience and/or someone who has been on the other side of hiring.  Re-organizing each document for each job you're looking to apply for.\n\nThe important message your resume should say is \"I can do the task you need me to do effectively and completely\".  While there is an \"easier\" and \"a bit harder\" way to approaching careers, it's not very linear in any capacity.  So I wouldn't focus too much on \"what am I lacking\" but rather shifting your perspective to \"what's unique about my experience\" that you can then market to an employer as a \"This is why I'm better and this is how that skill is an asset at X.\"  \n\nSoft skills are a major asset in any client-facing areas.  It means you won't embarrass your boss.",
