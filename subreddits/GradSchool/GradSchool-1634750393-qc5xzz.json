  "text": "Searching for a laptop <$800 that will last me a few years. Need to use Microsoft office, R programming, and potentially qGIS software.\n\nBonus points if it is able to run high-graphic games.\n\nI've used Lenovo in the past and unfortunately not a great experience. \n\n**Recommendations for my senerio or any general laptops useful for grad students? Thank you!",
