  "text": "Does anyone know a good place I could host digital artwork, specifically for more scientific/research-based audiences? I have some drawings I've made for my own presentations because nothing similar exists online, and it would be nice to make those available for others to use somehow. I just don't know the best way to make those public/easily found. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!\n\nWould also be cool if there was a place to see what people are requesting for digital drawings in research to have a hobby/side gig doing those for other researchers.",
