  "title:": "How to get rec letters when its been awhile since you graduated undergrad?",
  "text": "So I graduated undergrad in 2018, and I have now decided that I want to do grad school. Reason I didn't decide before was because of financial and personal reasons that pertained to my family. I'm just wondering since it has been quite awhile, will any prof write a rec letter for me? Should I ask my boss instead or the organization I volunteer for? I'm a bit confused on what to do. If anyone has any advice that would be great.",

      "text": "As long as you have experience working with the Prof (doing thesis under him or work on his lab), they won't mind writing a rec letter.\n\nYou usually are asked for more than 1 rec letter. You can get the others from your boss / org. you volunteered.\n\nDepending on the nature of you grad school, you may want to have more rec letter from Profs / bosses. If it is a research based degree (Mphil, PhD), more Profs rec letter is better. If it is a professional degree (MBA, JD), rec letters from bosses / volunteering are better.",

      "text": "2018 isn't too long ago imo, you should definitely reach out.  When I emailed mine, I attached 1-2 papers I wrote from courses I had with them for a little refresher. Also provide brief detail about the program and why it interests you. Be concise.\n\nMost schools ask for 2-3 letters so reach out to the # of recommenders you need but be prepared to have back up options.\n\nOne prof who I had 4 classes with and spoke with frequently only didn't want to provide a letter because she felt it should've came from a supervisor. She said she'd do it if I had nobody else. I did have a second supervisor (first supervisor already said yes) but was afraid he wouldn't remember me as we only met like 2-3 times and most of our contact was by email. I reached out to him though after getting that rejection, and he replied/agreed the next day.\n\nMy third reference was from a prof that I hadn't been in contact with for maybe 4-5 years (1-2 year gap contact with the ones above) but he remembered me and was the most excited to hear from me. He did ask for more info than the others though (ie. What about him or his courses would've helped with my application/how they relate to my grad program--I guess because there was such a long gap this explanation helped him fill in details for the letter about what he should speak to)\n\nUse work/volunteer as a last resort. It can feel awkward to email profs after so long but providing refs is part of their job.",

I\u2019d say ask those teachers who you had the best relationships with so they\u2019ll remember you and be willing. 2018 isn\u2019t too long ago though so you\u2019ll be fine!",

I worked in the writing center for one of them and another I wrote some articles for.\nMy advice: even if you think they don't remember you, chances are they will vaguely, so write your own LoR, and they'll probably sign it for you since they're probably super busy anyway.",

Particularly if you have copies with their grade and feedback. That will refresh their memory on your work.",
