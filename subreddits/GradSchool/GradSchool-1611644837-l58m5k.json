  "title:": "It's hard to feel excited about finishing your PhD when it mostly means losing your health insurance and (sort of) stable income...",
  "text": "Humanities PhD student here; just wanted to put this sentiment out there because it's been kinda bumming me out.\n\nI know that finishing a degree is an accomplishment no matter what and that I'll eventually figure out job stuff (whether that ends up being inside or outside of academia). And a big part of me is ready to be done (not least because living on a PhD student stipend/teaching salary isn't really sustainable long-term).\n\nBut a smaller part of me feels like I'm just losing what little stability I had in order to embark on a not-very-promising future... The academic job market is particularly bleak this year (for obvious reasons), and a friend who has been trying to explore options outside academia was told by our university career services office not to expect much in the current climate. It's also pretty likely that whatever health insurance I get next will be significantly worse than the student health plan I'm currently on. It definitely gives me a little more clarity on some of the unconscious reasons I've put off finishing for as long as I have.\n\nAnyway, if anyone has gone through similar thoughts/feelings and has commiseration or advice, I'm very open to hearing it. I'm trying not to let this totally suck away my motivation, but that can feel pretty hard at times. Thanks for listening :)\n\nEdit: Thanks for the thoughtful replies! It's helpful to know I'm not alone in this feeling and to hear some constructive strategies that have helped y'all.",

I am likely to happier, healthier and weathlier as a result. That realizations kinda set me free.\n\nApply for the academic jobs. Then sit down and make a list of how you would like to spend your days. Make another list of the skills you have, research, writing, people, working independently with minimal supervision over long periods of time, writing collaboratively (if that is something yall do in your field), doing all of the online-remote things...  Look at those 2 list and think of jobs that need your skills to do what you want to do. \n\nUniversity career services be damned. You find jobs that fit both lists and make the case that you are qualified for those, because you are. \n\nFor me, if I end up in academia that is great. If not, it is probably better. \n\nYou are more skilled and talented and qualified that you know. You will find something. Just expand what it is you are looking for. It is going to be alright.

You're valuable. I am in the 5th year of writing (humanities PhD), and have a medical condition that is super expensive to treat. I get insomnia from worrying about a lack of health insurance, let alone a lack of what little financial stability I have as a student. Truth is, presenting, teaching, conducting original research, writing and arguing ideas in a manuscript-length document, grant writing, etc etc all of the balderdash that occurs in our programs can work in your favor for jobs that are probably a lot less stressful and more financially rewarding than the typical professorship. It's all a matter of confidence and knowing how to sell yourself. Don't box yourself in!",

If you are coming into the market with a very specific idea of what you want (e.g., traditional professorship) you're much more likely to be disappointed.  If you enter the job market with an eye toward finding your personal Next Big Thing, you are more likely to find fulfillment.  I know theater people who thought they'd end up on stage, who ended up (happily) teaching; I know archaeologists who thought they'd end up teaching but now do original research for a private firm; and I know physicists who became quants on Wall Street, gave that up, and now work for Big Tech doing AI work.  My point is that happiness and fulfillment are where you find them, not necessarily in the \"most obvious\" endgame you've probably been carrying.    \n\nThe world is your oyster.

          "text": "To anyone reading the above comment, be careful: not all grad students can be covered under COBRA. Whether a grad student can be covered by COBRA depends on the type of plan the university offers to students, and whether it is an \"employer plan.\" The COBRA option may or may not be connected to whether the university considers grad students employees; it's more if grad students are covered under the same health insurance plan as staff, or whether students are under a separate \"student\" health insurance plan.\n\nAs one university states: \n\n>The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) is a federal mandate requiring employers to offer extension of health care benefits to their employees after termination of employment. The Student Health Program is not an employer plan and therefore, COBRA is not available.\n\nEven if COBRA is an option, be mindful of the cost to you since it includes both the premium an individual would pay *and* the premium that would normally be paid by the employer during employment. Definitely compare with getting a new policy.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm just a student who looked into this a bit because I have insurance through my school; I'm not anyone with special knowledge of how health insurance works. YMMV, but check on all of this (and maybe call your insurance company) before insurance lapses.",

Easy to sign up, I actually have vision and dental, and my doctor is now closer than ever before. Plus, no monthly costs. I think for many people who are graduating Medicaid might be the best option, if you are eligible. I suspect a lot of jobless graduates will be, but I think the rules vary from state to state.
