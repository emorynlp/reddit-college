And a big part of me is ready to be done (not least because living on a PhD student stipend/teaching salary isn't really sustainable long-term).\n\nBut a smaller part of me feels like I'm just losing what little stability I had in order to embark on a not-very-promising future... The academic job market is particularly bleak this year (for obvious reasons), and a friend who has been trying to explore options outside academia was told by our university career services office not to expect much in the current climate. It's also pretty likely that whatever health insurance I get next will be significantly worse than the student health plan I'm currently on. It definitely gives me a little more clarity on some of the unconscious reasons I've put off finishing for as long as I have.\n\nAnyway, if anyone has gone through similar thoughts/feelings and has commiseration or advice, I'm very open to hearing it. I'm trying not to let this totally suck away my motivation, but that can feel pretty hard at times. Thanks for listening :)\n\nEdit: Thanks for the thoughtful replies! It's helpful to know I'm not alone in this feeling and to hear some constructive strategies that have helped y'all.", "author": "possiblegirl", "created": 1611644837, "retrieved": 1632953823, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 417, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gkvexc1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/l58m5k/its_hard_to_feel_excited_about_finishing_your_phd/gkvexc1/", "text": "I am not looking forward to my health insurance going up 4x-5x the current cost and possibility of the quality of health insurance diminishing by >9000% :(", "author": "Chemie_ed", "created": 1611696814, "upvotes": 2}, "gkuwuil": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/l58m5k/its_hard_to_feel_excited_about_finishing_your_phd/gkuwuil/", "text": "I just wanna say thank you for asking this question because there are so many helpful and reassuring answers to your question.

Then sit down and make a list of how you would like to spend your days. Make another list of the skills you have, research, writing, people, working independently with minimal supervision over long periods of time, writing collaboratively (if that is something yall do in your field), doing all of the online-remote things...  Look at those 2 list and think of jobs that need your skills to do what you want to do. \n\nUniversity career services be damned. You find jobs that fit both lists and make the case that you are qualified for those, because you are. \n\nFor me, if I end up in academia that is great. If not, it is probably better. \n\nYou are more skilled and talented and qualified that you know. You will find something. Just expand what it is you are looking for. It is going to be alright.
