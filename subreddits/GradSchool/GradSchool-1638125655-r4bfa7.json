  "text": "YOE: about 4 years in industry (1.75 years at a huge biopharm and 2.25 years at a startup) with some (2 years part-time in two labs) undergraduate research experience\n\nLast year, I applied to school XYZ for their Ph.D program in the biosciences, but I was not admitted to their program or called for interviews. Instead, I was offered admission to their Masters program for biochemistry. After talking to them, I did not want to move across the country to take in-person classes (while COVID cases were going up across the nation), pay high tuition, and spend 2 years before earning a Ph.D. I decided to defer my acceptance from Fall 2021 to Fall 2022 citing that I needed to complete the projects I am working on in industry.\n\nNow, I am applying to the same school again for their Ph.D. program. I really want to earn my Ph.D. (preferably without a masters) at their school for a number of reasons (great faculty+research and other departmental program). This year, I have addressed most of my shortcomings and actions I have taken to make me a more competitive applicant.\n\nMy question is whether I should address that I deferred my acceptance to their masters program last year? What would be a convincing reason for now applying their Ph.D. program and forgoing my deferment? Or is better to not mention the masters deferment at all, since it would be another admissions committee?\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!",
