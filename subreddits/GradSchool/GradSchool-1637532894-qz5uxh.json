  "text": "Hey all, bit of a weird question! So, I\u2019m currently in the first year of my PhD program and am focusing on robotics and autonomy in a lab dedicated to space robotics and stuff.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve become incredibly interested in ocean robotics. In the last few years, I\u2019ve been reading about the field and have realized it\u2019s this beautiful combination of complex autonomy and control and, more importantly, contributing to scientific exploration in a variety of fields I\u2019m really interested in. I\u2019ve always been interested in climate science, marine biology, and planetary geology, and this seems like a perfect way to blend what I\u2019ve learned in the classroom to help scientists in this field. Stuff like the new Orpheus AUV, autonomous exploration and sampling, and multi-robot exploration are amazing to me and I\u2019d really love to focus my studies and career toward that.\n\nThe trouble is, I have no idea where to start? My advisor doesn\u2019t really know much about this field (and doesn\u2019t really\u2026 well, \u201cadvise\u201d anyway), and I don\u2019t have any contacts who work at Woods Hole or MBARI or anywhere similar. \n\nSo my question is this: how do I go about networking with strangers in a field I don\u2019t have any direct experience with and learning about what\u2019s out there and making progress in a field separate from my advisor\u2019s _without_ seeming super weird in emails?",

      "text": "Search for papers in your field. Contact the PI or first author. I don\u2019t think it is weird. It is very common in academia to reach out to new labs, start with a collaboration etc. Your advisor should help you once you identify the labs.\n\nInformally - you can use LinkedIn. Ask politely that you need help learning about the field. I am sure you will get positive responses",
