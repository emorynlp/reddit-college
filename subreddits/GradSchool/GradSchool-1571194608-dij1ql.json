Overall, my advisor is a very challenging person to work for, he has far too many grad students, he does zero training, and offers no support. I mentioned this here the other day, but when people graduate in our lab, it is in spite of him, not because of him.\n\nSo that's my experience. One good and one not so good.",

Sure, there's 14 hour days/100 hour weeks that kind of suck, and while my committee members have been extremely supportive they sometimes still say shitty stuff, because they're people too, but overall I've learned a lot, grown a lot, and produced a lot over those years. I love research, I love teaching, I love mentoring undergrads, I love being involved in the campus community. My experience is obviously anecdotal but I'm putting it out there for what it's worth.

An alarming fraction of students experience depression (18% experience moderate to severe, according to this study of economics students, though I've seen higher estimates elsewhere) and that percentage increases with time (25% by 5+ years). And this is not just mildly unhappy people - in the authors' words, this is \"debilitating psychological pain\". I don't know what the distribution looks like for psychological pain, but I'm willing to bet it isn't gaussian, and even if it is that suggests that the vast majority of people are not \"happy\" after 5 years in grad school. \n\nBy pointing out that only the most unhappy people come to reddit to vent, the point is lost that grad school is fundamentally broken and is causing detrimental psychological damage on a level far above what is normal in other workforces. I am so glad that not everyone experiences this, but depression is far from the exception among graduate students.",

              "text": "> Was there a lot of intellectual superiority and ego amongst your cohort and advisors?\n\nYes. Know-it-alls and large egos tend to be drawn to academia. I'm not sure that entomology is any different than other fields though. If you're shy you may have a hard time- just stick your neck out and try to get noticed when you do good work. Also you'll need to give a good impression when you give talks on your research. Usually *who you know* is more important than *what you know* when it comes to getting a job after you graduate. The entire point of getting a grad degree is to be more employable- sometimes people in grad school forget about that... \n\nHope you enjoy it. Insects are cool!",

Across fields I also see advisors really giving power to students themselves to work on what they want, which I think can\u2019t be understated. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, things can certainly get toxic, but it\u2019s not like one or two bad aspects dominate our lives.

Almost all of the \"I love grad school!\" posts I see here are from masters students or those at the very beginning of their grad school experience. 2 years into my masters I would have said the same. 3 years into a PhD... not so much. My advice to anyone considering a PhD would be don't do it, unless it is absolutely necessary for your chosen career path. It's a broken system. People come to this subreddit for support and it's hard reading about how other people are having a great time when you are not. I realise this is a little bitter but grad school has made me bitter!",
