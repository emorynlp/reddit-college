  "title:": "Requirements for Lecturer",
  "text": "I am interested in returning to school to ultimately become a teaching-focused professor or lecturer at the university level, teaching such topics as \u201chistory of irregular warfare\u201d, \u201cmilitary organization and theory for history/polisci majors\u201d, \u201cirregular warfare theory for history/polisci majors\u201d, \u201ccomparative political violence\u201d, \u201cpolitical violence in ireland\u201d, \u201cpolitical violence in quebec\u201d, etc. \n\nI currently have a MS Engineering Management, BS Engineering, and will be the graduate of several US Army schools, including graduate-level education in maneuver warfare. My professional experience has been in supply chain/operations as an engineer and in various command and staff positions as a military officer. I have done significant professional self-study in irregular warfare, general history, and leadership/management.  \n\nWill I need to get a PhD to make this happen? Or will a master\u2019s in history/polisci/etc. be sufficient? \n\nNote I would be good with, and perhaps prefer, being at a small university or college. \n\nThanks for ant advice.",

      "text": "I would suggest looking at the kinds of places you\u2019d like to teach and establishing if their staff all have PhDs. In my discipline, in the UK, it\u2019s basically a requirement now to have a PhD for a lecturer role. It would be unheard of for someone to be a lecturer or professor without one these days. But this can vary across disciplines and countries it seems.",
