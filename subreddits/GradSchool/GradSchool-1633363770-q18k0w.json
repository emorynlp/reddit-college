  "text": "First year STEM PhD student here. It\u2019s my second month of grad school and I feel like I have too much free time compared to my undergrad? \nI do all my homework in time, do OK on my presentations for class, and the PI of the lab I\u2019m rotating at seems happy w me.\n\nI feel like I should be doing more work but I\u2019m not sure a) why b) what more work would be\n\nTypo in header: Anybody else feel like they\u2019re NOT busy enough",

Being constantly busy is not a positive condition, it often signifies that you are either overworked or inefficiently managing your time. Since you seem to be meeting your deadlines and getting your work done in a timely manner, I think the fact that you have free time is an indication that you are managing your time well given your workload.",
