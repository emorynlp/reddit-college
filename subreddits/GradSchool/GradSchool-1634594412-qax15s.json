  "text": "It\u2019s so hard. I got Covid Last last year now I have me/cfs. I\u2019m like constantly short of breath. I\u2019m looking into a stem cell infusion out of desperation. I can\u2019t get stressed or it will get worse. I\u2019m only in this one class but I feel so overwhelmed with just this one midterm plus an assignment and one more lecture I haven\u2019t even gone over. I hate my life so much. I\u2019m too far in this program to drop out. I don\u2019t want to give up on my dreams but if you know anything about me/cfs it\u2019s like ur constantly sick and have to rest constantly. I\u2019m not suppose to push through the pain but it\u2019s hard. I have nothing left. What\u2019s the point, I can\u2019t date or exercise or do anything I once enjoyed. My life is miserable lol I just want to get this degreee so i have something out of it all.",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with MS during my second year of my PhD (still working on it). Be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you\u2019re going to have good days and bad days. On the good days, try to be as productive as you can, and on the bad days, allow yourself to rest as much as your schedule allows.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure you already know this, but don\u2019t make a rash decision in terms of stem cell transplants etc. \n\nOne day at a time. You can do it!",

      "text": "First, I hope that you end up finding a treatment that helps \u2764\ufe0f\n\nSecond, have you reached out to your school\u2019s disability services office? You may be able to get accommodations that could help you better manage school. Not gonna lie, sometimes they can be assholes (but also sometimes not!), but legally you\u2019re entitled to accommodations that will help you manage school on the same level as people without your condition. Really it shouldn\u2019t be too daunting - I have accommodations for mental health and my doctor just had to fill out some forms explaining my diagnosis and what accommodations he\u2019d recommend as a result. Sometimes you have to push a bit, but again keep in mind that you\u2019re just asking for what you\u2019re legally entitled to. \n\nOn a personal level, looking for a therapist who specializes in chronic illnesses might be helpful for managing the emotional toll and figuring out how to adapt to make things easier for yourself.",
