  "text": "hi all. how many universities should i be applying to, to be sure i'll have a good chance of getting into at least one as an international applicant? considering that spots for international students are limited, it's during a pandemic, application fees cost some, it's a tiring process and programmes are competitive. how many are you guys applying to?",

I also went to a recruitment event for my field where I spoke to about 7 more and applied to about 4 more. So money paid and everything sent in I think was maybe 7 schools. You should check out r/gradadmissions it was super helpful when I was applying!",
