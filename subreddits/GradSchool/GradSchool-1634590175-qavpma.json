  "text": "I am not to the point where I feel that mastering out is my only option, but I am at a point where I would like to know more about it as an option. I know it probably differed from program to program, and I\u2019m not yet at the point where I feel like having this conversation with an advisor, but I would love to hear about how the process works from someone who knows more or has gone through with it. Thanks!",

      "text": "It's going to depend a lot from program to program, with a significant factor being what options are available for a masters. \n\nFor example, if you're awarded a masters during your degree progression, you would simply leave after that point. \n\nIf your department offers a non-thesis masters, you could see if you've satisfied the degree requirements and then ask to switch tracks and apply for graduation. \n\nIf your department only has a masters thesis as an option, then you need to have a more involved talk with your advisor (and committee) about writing up a thesis and what that will entail.",
