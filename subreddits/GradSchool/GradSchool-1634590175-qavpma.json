  "text": "I am not to the point where I feel that mastering out is my only option, but I am at a point where I would like to know more about it as an option. I know it probably differed from program to program, and I\u2019m not yet at the point where I feel like having this conversation with an advisor, but I would love to hear about how the process works from someone who knows more or has gone through with it. Thanks!",

      "text": "It's going to depend a lot from program to program, with a significant factor being what options are available for a masters. \n\nFor example, if you're awarded a masters during your degree progression, you would simply leave after that point. \n\nIf your department offers a non-thesis masters, you could see if you've satisfied the degree requirements and then ask to switch tracks and apply for graduation. \n\nIf your department only has a masters thesis as an option, then you need to have a more involved talk with your advisor (and committee) about writing up a thesis and what that will entail.",

      "text": "In my department (US/psychology) we have an embedded masters, which means they don't by default send you a master's degree. However, it isn't too hard to request one once you qualify, which I did just in case (and because I earned it, goddammit). Once you have that, you can just quit. My friend and cohort-mate mastered out. She basically had to fill out a form and meet with someone in the department for an exit interview. She said the process was pretty easy and seems to be thriving now. I wish I'd mastered out instead of getting myself deeper in the program \ud83d\ude05",

Some of us just apply for the masters on the way through the program cause we worked our asses off to get through oral and advancement and just want something to show for two years of indentured servitude.",
