  "text": "I visited my dream university in late 2019 by my first pick in phd advisor and was told to keep in touch. I am now half way through my masters and emailed him once during the summer and again today.  I haven\u2019t heard back from him since my 2019 visit.  I am going to wait to contact him again until after I get published- I have an article under review right now and several in preparation.",

      "text": "It may have been just polite, but my guess is that it really meant \"let me know when something has changed and you're actually applying here\".  He probably wants to know when something is actually happening, when you're at the point that he can actually see your application and get involved in your admission process.  If you've just been emailing random messsages about yourself and not asking actionable questions around the PhD, he's probably just not bothering to reply because he's looking for a grad student, not a pen pal.",

A former student of mine asked me for a letter of recommendation for a scholarship he was planning on applying to, so I told him to keep in touch and let me know. I genuinely meant it. He ended up emailing me a few months later to let me know he got the scholarship, so maybe this guy is waiting for you to reach out?\n\nPeople get busy, but it does seem odd that he's missed your emails twice. One professor I work with has something like 10,000 unread emails so if he's anything like her, it can be easy to get lost.",
