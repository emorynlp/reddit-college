The cloud?\n\nI would like to start backing up my entire laptop on a regular basis. I'm not involved in research yet, but I want to establish the habit early. My laptop is getting up there in years, too, and if I lose everything on it then it will be a huge hassle to get everything set up again.\n\nI'm a little gun shy of external hard drives, as I got one about 12 years ago and not long after purchasing it the metal piece that the cord plugs into got pushed into the hard drive.

However, I feel like this comes up all the time but no one mentions one important thing; once you are in research be sure to check with ethics and your lab group whether or not you can use a cloud backup to store data. If it is human data, there is a good chance they will not want to backed up to personal cloud storage and will have designated storage for data.", "author": "sensorimotorneuro", "created": 1632260389, "upvotes": 1}, "hdrp8ct": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pspjwd/favorite_methods_for_backing_up_files/hdrp8ct/", "text": "Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive  \n\nRegularly backs everything up (on these platforms) to a home NAS server I have (It's just an ODROID HC-2 with a 8 TB HDD) which re-packs everything up regularly and uploads a version-controlled version to Google Drive.", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "created": 1632260051, "upvotes": 2}, "hdro0xq": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pspjwd/favorite_methods_for_backing_up_files/hdro0xq/", "text": "I use every service available to me.

Finally, I use git and GitHub for version control and that gets updated whenever I make changes to something. Typically I commit immediately after working on something. This system allows me to move between computers and Chromebook/tablet and have everything accessible when needed.
