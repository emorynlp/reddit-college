They absolutely never came to lab, and we didn\u2019t have group meetings.\n\nMy new advisor is amazing, but I still only talk to them about once a week, often times much less. I go over results, they give me major action items to complete, I go off to independently complete my tasks, and then we meet when I\u2019m done and repeat. Sometimes the postdoc will show up to give updates, but we\u2019re a very small lab. For me, it\u2019s an ideal situation.
