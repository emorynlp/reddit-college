  "text": "I finished. 6 months ago actually. Thought about writing this many times since, but was never up to it until now.\n\nI have my PhD. Yay. I'm the most useless kind of doctor I can be. I barely remember the last year, my brain just shut down somehow. I just went somewhere else. By the time I got out I could barely eat due to ulcers, hadn't slept properly in months, couldn't hold a pencil to write my hands trembled so badly. \n\nMy PI was absent my last year and a half. Almost completely. I think I met with him twice in that time. Absolutely unreachable. Despite multiple cries for help, the department was completely useless. I finally got the head to begrudgingly agree to sign my forms since I literally couldn't get in contact with my PI. The last 3 months whether or not I was actually graduating in August changed from day to day. \n\nMy PI never read my thesis. He showed up the day I defended, though. He stood up there and glibly lied his ass off. How wonderful I was to work with, how brilliant, how promising. The man who emotionally abused and abandoned his lab, who alternated between ignoring me and screaming at me for 5 years. \n\nHe hasn't responded to a single email of mine since that day. Silence when I asked for a letter of recommendation. Silence when I asked for feedback on my papers that will never be published. We have not spoken, and at this point I have no intention of ever reaching out again.\n\nI moved home. My parents didn't want me living on my own, being the wreck that I was. I couldn't find a job, of course -- there aren't jobs in my field here, and it wasn't like I had a single thing going for me on my resume. I did eventually find something to do, a basic programming job I could have gotten straight out of undergrad. \n\nI'm almost 28. I have an Ivy League PhD. And I live at home with my parents because my doctors don't think it's a good idea for me to live independently anymore. I take a handful of pills every morning just to be the barely competent human being that I am, just so I can go work my shitty job and live my shitty pathetic life that I worked so fucking hard for.\n\nIt kind of feels like the last decade didn't even happen. I like to imagine that it didn't. \n\nI just wanted to write this, because I very nearly quit grad school during my 2nd year, my 3rd year, multiple times during my 5th year. And everybody encouraged me, tried to cheer me up, insisted, \"It'll be worth it!\" \"Don't let them win! You can beat this thing!\"\n\nI did beat it. And it broke me.\n\nI didn't need encouragement. I needed permission to quit. I needed somebody to tell me it was okay, that it wouldn't make me a failure, that I wasn't throwing anything away. \n\nSo if you're looking for a sign that it's okay to quit: here it is. It's not always worth it. It certainly wasn't worth my health. And it isn't worth yours either. ",

Mind if I ask what your PhD was in? I'm pursuing one in Biomedical Engineering. By the sounds of your story, I am certain you have so much more you could say. No PI should ever be able to treat their PhD students this way, and I personally think you should expose him. I am sorry you had to go through all of that. Have you considered writing a book about your experiences?",

I read some of your replies as well and it seems like you're on track for the future, so I'm wishing you well.\n\nI'm nearly a decade out from a PhD that probably wasn't worth it. Feeling shitty about it will lessen... you'll have other successes in your life and you'll see how little importance most people put on academic successes/failures once you hit, say, 40. So try and stay on top of your mental health.\n\nThe one interesting thing I've found in industry is that even though a PhD isn't necessary for a lot of positions, it is taken into account as you rise in the ranks. If you want to become a manager or director you'll probably find that being introduced to the hiring manager as Dr. trucksareforgirls versus Ms. trucksareforgirls will help a bit. I always smile when people call me Dr because its such a rare thing and I know they're giving me an extra hint of respect. Anyway, it doesn't help with your first few jobs, but it will likely help later on.\n\nTake care.",

I did, and I'm happier than ever. \n\nThe hard part is finding the strength.

I was terrified that not only had my time in grad school been a giant waste of time, but that it had actually set me back.  Thankfully, after a few months of job searching, and suffering through a crappy in-between job for a couple months, I was able to find a pretty good industry job that allowed me to use the research skills I'd been developing throughout my graduate education.\n\n[This episode of the Freakonomics podcast](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-upside-of-quitting/) played an important role in my own journey.  It allowed me the freedom to admit that quitting is the most rational decision in some cases.  And that you should question the conventional wisdom that 'quitters never win,' etc.\n\nSorry to hear you're in a rough spot, and that you don't feel like your PhD was worth it.  Hopefully you'll be able to view it more positively some day.  \n\nIf nothing else, be glad that you're able to make a clear-minded assessment of it now.

Was it something you were especially passionate about?\n* You say you're a data science PhD, but you're only just learning how to code? How did that happen? (Sorry if this comes off snarky, I'm just really curious. Blame Reddit's anonymity) \n* You mention you are asexual and, again just my curiosity getting the better of me here, but do you think that lack of wanting to be intimate with someone negatively impacted you? In other words, do you think if you were sexually inclined, you'd have had a better experience (since sex/relationships help ease the stress)?\n* Are you sure you can't just apply somewhere outside of your home state? I'm from California, and there are tons of listings for PhDs in Data Science/Genetics/etc. \n\nFrom what I've read so far, it seemed like you had very limited avenues of stress-relief, which is crucial I think, shitty PIs notwithstanding.

Academia is definitely out of my reach as a career due to my poor thesis, and to be honest I'm making more money as an entry level developer with better hours than I would as a postdoc. \n\nMy thesis was about statistical methods in genomics.

I would encourage you to look into CPTSD and see if any of the symptoms resonate with you. I always thought I was just depressed and anxious, but peeling back the layers in therapy and getting my CPTSD diagnosis has been incredibly enlightening (that's not to say that everything is fixed).\n\nI hope things get better for you.

It seems like everybody says they do trauma stuff, but then they just focus on CBT and not actually processing the trauma. I've considered doing Skype therapy with trauma specialists. Maybe that would be a useful resource for you as well.",

      "text": "First off your taking this advice from a guy with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, an unmeasurable disdain for the educational system, a reader of far too many scholarly informative articles, and as a person who has read Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. According to an article i glanced at today you are already screwed. Once a person starts taking meds its impossible to get off. Now i know nothing isnt impossible, because i spend many days doing nothing. However if you are a drug addict (this is information i have gathered from several readings and i have always had a knack for connecting the dots) your fight will never be over. People with addictions develop a dependence on the substance or device to provide them with dopamine. Dopamine is a scary thing mix in a few more chemicals and you have love, mix in other chemicals and you have a concoction to commit suicide. When you take drugs, or as people prefer to call it 'prescribed medicine,' you are providing an overload of chemicals which tells your body to stop making them. Depending on the medicine you are on quitting cold turkey could kill you, so dont do that.  \n\nNow because you jumped through all the hoops that were required you got to graduate school. With no more hoops laid out plainly for you you flailed a bit and because society is literally living in the most counterintuitive way to prolong our existence. Sure Ol' Musky might have us terraforming mars in 50 years, however i dont believe we will last that long. By the Karadashev(sp?) scale we are a 0.7 civilization. Human beings are a 2.23(i think) on the trophic scale. Same level as a jellyfish, a species that has lived hundreds of million years longer than we have without a brain. Sorry lost myself... The reason you wanted to quit graduate school was because you saw options, the very thing man kind is afraid of. However society still deems academia as the highest honor, basically at this point we are beating an empty pinata hoping for candy that will never come. It's a nightmare and until someone does something we are going to be the next species caught in the sixth mass extinction, already the ring leaders of this circus. \n\nAnyway i hope this helps or raises questions from anyone/everyone. This was a sliver of my knowledge and i regret not having an answer. However in life there are no answers, only deeper questions. Haha my rant is over and i do feel your pain. But as a practicing philosopher my life's goal is to spread wisdom. ~Norman King Franklin III",

One of Deresiewicz's points was that we are too eager to foster an environment of direct competitiveness among our youth, and that we don't provide enough collaborative opportunities. ",

Just give a free lecture in a college, use that lecture history to leverage either giving a free lecture in another college or writing a short article in some fancy magazine about the subject you're an expert in, and just keep snowballing publicity references for a month or two until news reporters that want to mention your topic are coming to you as the guy they know they can call an expert.  The PhD only helps accelerate this.  The goal if you want to be interviewed isn't actual knowledge in a field so much as collecting as many shorthand signallers of \"expert\" status as you can.\n\nEventually you can find yourself getting paid to talk about whatever your chosen subject is, too.\n\nHeck, in this case he could make his subject \"problems in the academic process\" or otherwise get an interview just about how bad his gradschool experience was.",

You can be a superstar PhD candidate and end up never publishing or defending. You can be a shit PhD candidate and get multiple pubs and defend early. People tell you this and warn you, but you think that if you work hard you'll be fine no matter who your PI is, and they're wrong. ",
