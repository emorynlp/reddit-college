Thought about writing this many times since, but was never up to it until now.\n\nI have my PhD. Yay. I'm the most useless kind of doctor I can be. I barely remember the last year, my brain just shut down somehow. I just went somewhere else. By the time I got out I could barely eat due to ulcers, hadn't slept properly in months, couldn't hold a pencil to write my hands trembled so badly. \n\nMy PI was absent my last year and a half. Almost completely. I think I met with him twice in that time. Absolutely unreachable. Despite multiple cries for help, the department was completely useless. I finally got the head to begrudgingly agree to sign my forms since I literally couldn't get in contact with my PI. The last 3 months whether or not I was actually graduating in August changed from day to day. \n\nMy PI never read my thesis. He showed up the day I defended, though. He stood up there and glibly lied his ass off. How wonderful I was to work with, how brilliant, how promising. The man who emotionally abused and abandoned his lab, who alternated between ignoring me and screaming at me for 5 years. \n\nHe hasn't responded to a single email of mine since that day. Silence when I asked for a letter of recommendation. Silence when I asked for feedback on my papers that will never be published. We have not spoken, and at this point I have no intention of ever reaching out again.\n\nI moved home. My parents didn't want me living on my own, being the wreck that I was. I couldn't find a job, of course -- there aren't jobs in my field here, and it wasn't like I had a single thing going for me on my resume. I did eventually find something to do, a basic programming job I could have gotten straight out of undergrad. \n\nI'm almost 28. I have an Ivy League PhD. And I live at home with my parents because my doctors don't think it's a good idea for me to live independently anymore. I take a handful of pills every morning just to be the barely competent human being that I am, just so I can go work my shitty job and live my shitty pathetic life that I worked so fucking hard for.\n\nIt kind of feels like the last decade didn't even happen. I like to imagine that it didn't. \n\nI just wanted to write this, because I very nearly quit grad school during my 2nd year, my 3rd year, multiple times during my 5th year. And everybody encouraged me, tried to cheer me up, insisted, \"It'll be worth it!\" \"Don't let them win! You can beat this thing!\"\n\nI did beat it. And it broke me.\n\nI didn't need encouragement. I needed permission to quit. I needed somebody to tell me it was okay, that it wouldn't make me a failure, that I wasn't throwing anything away. \n\nSo if you're looking for a sign that it's okay to quit: here it is. It's not always worth it. It certainly wasn't worth my health. And it isn't worth yours either.

I read some of your replies as well and it seems like you're on track for the future, so I'm wishing you well.\n\nI'm nearly a decade out from a PhD that probably wasn't worth it. Feeling shitty about it will lessen... you'll have other successes in your life and you'll see how little importance most people put on academic successes/failures once you hit, say, 40. So try and stay on top of your mental health.\n\nThe one interesting thing I've found in industry is that even though a PhD isn't necessary for a lot of positions, it is taken into account as you rise in the ranks. If you want to become a manager or director you'll probably find that being introduced to the hiring manager as Dr. trucksareforgirls versus Ms. trucksareforgirls will help a bit.

Was it something you were especially passionate about?\n* You say you're a data science PhD, but you're only just learning how to code? How did that happen? (Sorry if this comes off snarky, I'm just really curious. Blame Reddit's anonymity) \n* You mention you are asexual and, again just my curiosity getting the better of me here, but do you think that lack of wanting to be intimate with someone negatively impacted you? In other words, do you think if you were sexually inclined, you'd have had a better experience (since sex/relationships help ease the stress)?\n* Are you sure you can't just apply somewhere outside of your home state?

According to an article i glanced at today you are already screwed. Once a person starts taking meds its impossible to get off. Now i know nothing isnt impossible, because i spend many days doing nothing. However if you are a drug addict (this is information i have gathered from several readings and i have always had a knack for connecting the dots) your fight will never be over. People with addictions develop a dependence on the substance or device to provide them with dopamine. Dopamine is a scary thing mix in a few more chemicals and you have love, mix in other chemicals and you have a concoction to commit suicide. When you take drugs, or as people prefer to call it 'prescribed medicine,' you are providing an overload of chemicals which tells your body to stop making them. Depending on the medicine you are on quitting cold turkey could kill you, so dont do that.  \n\nNow because you jumped through all the hoops that were required you got to graduate school. With no more hoops laid out plainly for you you flailed a bit and because society is literally living in the most counterintuitive way to prolong our existence. Sure Ol' Musky might have us terraforming mars in 50 years, however i dont believe we will last that long. By the Karadashev(sp?) scale we are a 0.7 civilization. Human beings are a 2.23(i think) on the trophic scale. Same level as a jellyfish, a species that has lived hundreds of million years longer than we have without a brain. Sorry lost myself... The reason you wanted to quit graduate school was because you saw options, the very thing man kind is afraid of. However society still deems academia as the highest honor, basically at this point we are beating an empty pinata hoping for candy that will never come. It's a nightmare and until someone does something we are going to be the next species caught in the sixth mass extinction, already the ring leaders of this circus. \n\nAnyway i hope this helps or raises questions from anyone/everyone. This was a sliver of my knowledge and i regret not having an answer. However in life there are no answers, only deeper questions. Haha my rant is over and i do feel your pain.
