  "title:": "Best way to include raw data in thesis appendix",
  "text": "I successfully defended my MS thesis (yay), one of the comments I got was to include the raw data in an appendix for future students. What is the best way of doing this? It seems like you can include whole excel sheets in word by inserting an object, but if the final product is a PDF that would be pointless I think. \n\nIs it standard to just include screenshots of the Excel files? I think that\u2019s what I am going to do, but was wondering if there is a better way. Thanks!",
