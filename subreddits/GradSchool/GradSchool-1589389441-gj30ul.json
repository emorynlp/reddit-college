I want to report out my story of feeling disrespected and misled by this group's job hunt assistance program. I feel they\u00a0prey on scared PhD holders who are worried about their job outlook, then do not deliver on services promised.\u00a0\n\nI would highly encourage Master's or PhD level job seekers to stay away from this organization.\n\nThe CSA program advertises career advice for PhD holders interested in transitioning into industry careers. They claim that all PhD holders are \"highly in demand\".\u00a0I have been with the group for several months and paid over $400 for an initial membership.\n\nThe following is a list of inappropriate and borderline fraudulent behavior I experienced during my time with this organization.\n\n1. CSA offered me a \"pay only once\" lifetime membership. Once enrolled in the main program, I was told that numerous specialized modules on offer are \"pay to access\", at a price tag of several hundred\u00a0dollars per module.\n2. CSA repeatedly and consistently claims that all PhD skills are \"highly in demand\". They claim\u00a0that companies are eagerly looking to hire candidates such as yourself. I believe this claim to be objectively false. I do believe there is a small, select subset of in-demand skills that are desired in industry. This is a vastly different reality than CSA's claim that employers are rushing to hire any and all PhD holders.\n3. CSA consistently promotes a narrative that if you're not getting hired, it's your own fault for not trying hard enough. That message is emotionally abusive. It pushes all accountability\u00a0away from CSA and onto\u00a0the paying\u00a0client. They consistently blame you, the client, for any job hunt failures you are experiencing.\n4. When I began raising questions about the program's methodology, I was passive aggressively threatened. My most recent post to the group's private Facebook page was a note expressing that a \"think positive\" mentality didn't work for me personally. That post was deleted in less than three hours and my account was immediately suspended. I was told the reason for the suspension was unrelated to the post I've referenced here.\n\nI feel motivated to report my story to a larger audience because I am not alone in my criticism.\n\nDozens of clients have reported they feel uncomfortable with how the Cheeky Scientist program is managed. My fellow clients have questioned why the claims of the program don't match the lived experience of their job hunts. These clients payed $400 or more, often while working low-wage jobs and paying off student debt, for this fraudulent\u00a0service.\u00a0\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to read this message. If you find yourself concerned by this report, please forward this note to any PhD email lists you have access to.\n\nIf anyone has questions about my experiences, I will do my best to respond to comments.", "author": "Copse_Of_Trees", "created": 1589389441, "retrieved": 1632953296, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 608, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"fwf65rb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gj30ul/note_for_phd_job_hunters_cheeky_scientist_is_a/fwf65rb/", "text": "[removed]", "author": null, "created": 1593473727, "upvotes": 1}, "ftq87iu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gj30ul/note_for_phd_job_hunters_cheeky_scientist_is_a/ftq87iu/", "text": "I was almost hired by them as a graphic designer - I had an interview and was going to accept the offer, but after reflecting on the interaction I had with the creator as well as doing some research, I decided it smelled too much like a scam and didn't want to be working for someone who is taking advantage of others, so I accepted a different job offer.

ALL the webinars end with the head guy preaching this.\n\nThey also send way too many emails. Like WAY too many, several per day. They also send emails like 'this is a personal welcome' and it is no way personal, it's a cookie cutter email.

We also offer advanced programs for those who would like specialized, in-depth training in a specific area (such as Project Management, Medical Affairs, Data Science/Analysis etc). You are in no way required to join any of our advanced programs once you are a CSA member.\n\nWe will help you until you get hired and far beyond - through onboarding, promotions, job changes, you name it! We offer further support and direction for members who are not getting hired within their desired timeline, and never blame or discourage them. You can hear this first-hand from PhDs who willingly put their names, faces, and professional reputations on the line to talk about their experiences in the program on our website or social media.

The team and I won\u2019t use your first or last name here out of respect for your privacy. I\u2019ve asked any the Associates who end up commenting here to show you the same respect. However, it is important for everyone reading this to know that this thread is written by someone who was removed from the Association because they repeatedly violated our terms & conditions, as well as those of the platform by refusing to be kind and respectful to all members, by refusing to being inclusive, by attacking other members, and by posting political, racial, and/or abusive comments.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that it came to this because our goal at Cheeky Scientist is to leave no PhD behind. We really do wish you the best in your job search and career M.T.\n\nPlease note that negative comments are common online but positive comments are harder to come by because when people have a positive experience, they rarely feel the need to start a thread. Therefore, it is important for anyone considering a job in industry to listen to the other side of this story. You can do so by watching any of the following videos of PhDs who joined the Association and where subsequently hired by top companies like Amazon, Google, Intel, Pfizer and many, many others which you can see on our website's success stories page or our social media pages. These are all PhDs who you can find on LinkedIn and contact. There are thousands of of such PhDs.\n\nFor all the issues raised in the many replies here, the Association is definitely NOT for everyone. The Association and all Cheeky Scientist Advanced Programs are only focused on one thing - getting PhDs hired into top industry careers. As such, our private groups are not places for people to attack others, criticize others, or post wild comments completely unrelated to job searching, let alone racially charged comments. Instead, the Cheeky Scientist communities are a refuge from this - one where the culture is inclusive, solution focused and again, job search focused.\n\nAs to the point raised by the author of this subreddit, M.T., please see below:\n\n1 \u201cCSA offered me a \u2018pay only once\" lifetime membership. Once enrolled in the main program, I was told that numerous specialized modules on offer are \"pay to access\u2019, at a price tag of several hundred dollars per module.\u201d\n\nThe Association membership is a lifetime membership. There are no monthly or yearly subscription fees and nothing more to pay for ever in terms of all Association content. \u201cModules\u201d are NEVER charged for as the author says above. In fact, all upgrades to the Association are free, including a large scale upgrade that just occurred, updating all training videos to HD videos with green screen and light board technology, and doubling the total hours of training material. Of course, like every company, we have multiple products based on demand. Our products are programs. Over time, demand for new programs such as a program specifically for Data Scientists, or for International PhDs, or for Medical Science Liaison careers have been developed. Memberships to any of these programs are also lifetime memberships. Each program has separate Program Leaders (all PhDs working in a specific career track, or in some cases a JD or MD or other expert, a separate Board, a separate website, separate training dashboard, separate private group, etc. Importantly, none of these additional Programs are required for Associates. They are all voluntary.\n\n2 \u201cCSA repeatedly and consistently claims that all PhD skills are \u2018highly in demand\u2019. They claim that companies are eagerly looking to hire candidates such as yourself. I believe this claim to be objectively false. I do believe there is a small, select subset of in-demand skills that are desired in industry. This is a vastly different reality than CSA's claim that employers are rushing to hire any and all PhD holders.\u201d\n\nThis statement is one of the reasons the author became increasingly angry in the group and started attacking other members. The author was having a difficult time getting hired, which I deeply empathize with. However, just because it takes some longer to get hired than others, it is not an excuse to abuse people. If the author would have focused on following the program\u2019s training materials and job referral process, they would have been hired. Instead, like many of us PhDs have a tendency to do, they focused intensely on the rejection they were facing in the job market and how the job market was \u201cnot fair\u201d. Sadly, the job market, nor life in general is often fair. But again, that is no excuse to take it out on others. PhDs are being hired in industry more than they have ever before in industry. Of course, there are more PhDs being produced than ever before. The landscape is changing though and more and more PhDs and Universities are realizing that most PhDs will end up in industry now, not academia.\n\n3 \u201cCSA consistently promotes a narrative that if you're not getting hired, it's your own fault for not trying hard enough. That message is emotionally abusive. It pushes all accountability away from CSA and onto the paying client. They consistently blame you, the client, for any job hunt failures you are experiencing.\u201d\n\nGetting hired is difficult, especially now that the world economy is in a recession. Again, the entire Cheeky Scientist team and I empathize with that. However, it is important, especially during difficult times, to focus on what you can control rather than what you can\u2019t control. This is why the culture of the Association and all Cheeky Scientist Advanced Programs are solution focused and job search focused. No individual is to blame for a rejection in their job search. They are responsible to how they respond to the rejection though - because no one else can control their actions. That person has to choose how they respond. They can respond by revamping their resume and LinkedIn profile, connecting with more people in industry, setting up more interviews etc \u2026or by being nasty to people and complaining. Encouraging PhDs to try again and helping them do so is not emotionally abusive; it\u2019s emotionally kind.\n\n4 \u201cWhen I began raising questions about the program's methodology, I was passive aggressively threatened. My most recent post to the group's private Facebook page was a note expressing that a \u2018think positive\u2019 mentality didn't work for me personally. That post was deleted in less than three hours and my account was immediately suspended. I was told the reason for the suspension was unrelated to the post I've referenced here.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m glad that the author brought this up but surely they know that they\u2019re coloring this with their perspective. The author became increasingly agitated and aggressive, and started attacking team members and other Associates, and posting wild comments completely unrelated to the job search process. They were being unkind to all, very negative and critical - repeatedly. Our administrators removed the author after they breaking our terms of service and the terms of the platform repeatedly and as such, we immediately responded to the author on multiple fronts and asked them to change their behavior. Instead of working with us, the author remained critical, negative, and aggressive. Many other Associates had complained to us about the author\u2019s behavior and our team member\u2019s repeatedly brought up concerns. We could no longer risk them distracting our other Associates from their job search or making them feel uncomfortable.\n\nWith all of this being said, we are still open to working with the author if they are willing to be kind, solution focused and job search focused in the program. These terms are NOT something Cheeky Scientist will ever compromise on. We will always ensure our communities and learning environments are safe, inclusive, solution focused and job search focused so PhDs can reach their career development goals, whatever they may be.", "author": "isaiahlhankelphd", "created": 1589424834, "upvotes": 1}, "fqkcn4e": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/gj30ul/note_for_phd_job_hunters_cheeky_scientist_is_a/fqkcn4e/", "text": "I would like to resonate the feelings in the comments.
