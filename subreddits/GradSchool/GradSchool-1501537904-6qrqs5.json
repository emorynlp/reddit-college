It's okay, though. You can overcome it. You just have to build up enough knowledge & experience that you start thinking, \"hey, maybe I do know what I'm talking about\". It takes time.\n\n2) Related to #1, regardless of how much you know about your topic, there is *much more* that you do *not* know. Cultivate humility, learn from others, and don't be afraid to admit you don't know something. Real learning will not happen until you accomplish these things. Plus, you're not fooling anyone; I wouldn't even attempt it.\n\n3) Try as much as possible not to compete with your cohort. Don't undermine them, don't put them down, don't be upset when they succeed. Foster a support network, based on care and trust. Help them and they will help you. They will be your colleagues, now and forever.\n\n4) Seek out mental health resources, early and often! Can't stress this enough.\n\n5) Show up to your advisory meetings with a clear agenda, starting with things that are most time-sensitive. Your advisors are busy and may not have the time to be as involved as they want to be in your life. Make it easy for them.\n\n6) The second you start writing the 3rd paragraph of an email, stop. Delete the whole thing. Schedule a meeting instead.\n\n7) Get 8 hours of sleep a night. Non-negotiable.\n\n8) And lastly, honest to god, *very few people are working as hard as they claim they are*. There is this weird culture in graduate school centered around complaining about how much you have to work. I'm not saying you won't have to work hard or that others *don't* work hard, but take what you hear from other people with a grain of salt; I see a lot of self-reported work inflation around me. Given that there's so much flexibility in how to get work done, there are many ways to get it done. Someone else's method may not work for you. Don't let it get to you.\n", "author": "RadioMars", "created": 1501537904, "retrieved": 1632953804, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"dszq0vu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/6qrqs5/as_i_enter_my_last_year_i_just_want_to_share_a/dszq0vu/", "text": "Thanks, I really needed to hear the part about the work inflation.

That is, don't feel guilty about taking a break if it actually helps because then you're just wasting your break with the unearned burden of guilt! And, if possible, procrastinate by working side projects that may help your future.. I did a great job of this early on, but I got a bit sidetracked away from this \"productive\" procrastination in recent years. \n\nAnd, finally, I would add a zeroth and very repetitive tip. \n\n>\\#0: It's okay to leave. If you don't allow yourself this possibility, you're going to build up a lot of pressure that will make you very ineffective in general. You are only here by your own choice.
