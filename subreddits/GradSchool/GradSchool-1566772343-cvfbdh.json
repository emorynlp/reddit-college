  "text": "My PI was delaying my submission of my dissertation and I created this account to vent. I finally convinced him half a year ago to let me submit which I then successfully defended 5 months ago. And today I finally finished with the revisions on the last article which I'm submitting as a first author from the lab. I'm finally done with the lab, have my PhD, and ready to move on.",
