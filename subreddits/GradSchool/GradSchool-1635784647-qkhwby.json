  "text": "So I\u2019ve had my heart set on lab work, specifically studying researching regenerative medicine/tissue repair, but I\u2019ve been having second thoughts. I\u2019m not sure if I like being in the lab all day, and a lot of what I do feels kinda pointless but that might be because I\u2019m in a lab analyzing detergents for the proper chemicals, which is probably a bit different experience than working in a biotech lab, which is what I want to do. Lately I\u2019ve been doing stuff in my yard to make it more wildlife friendly and I\u2019m really enjoying it, plus Ive always loved animals and nature so I\u2019ve been wondering if I should study something related to environmental science in grad school. The problem is that I didn\u2019t taken many courses in environmental science in undergrad and I focused mainly on cellular biology so I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to actually work in that field and I don\u2019t know if I have the qualifications to land a job that would give me a good idea of what it would be like\n\nI was thinking of doing something like a Masters of science in biology like they offer at Michigan state or the university of Illinois in Chicago. Is that a good idea? I\u2019m worried it might be too broad for either field I\u2019m trying to decide between",
