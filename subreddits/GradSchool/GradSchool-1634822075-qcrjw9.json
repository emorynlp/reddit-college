      "text": "Why do you not have LOR? For grad school or is pretty common to ask professors who taught your classes to write a LOR. You don't necessarily have to have done research with them.  Even if you are in industry know a manager could recommend you.  \n\nThis is all to say, not sure you will find somewhere that doesn't ask for LOR. You might be better off cultivating a relationship with someone who CAN write a LOR in the next few months.",
