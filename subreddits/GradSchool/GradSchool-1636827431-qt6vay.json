  "text": "I'm back in the office and literally have no idea how to make friends with the people I'm with. I've tried so much to chat with them and introduce myself but I still can't make friends :( \n\nI keep thinking that they probably see me as the office weirdo and I feel very isolated and self conscious because of it. Literally what can I do to make myself seem less awkward and more approachable?",

      "text": "I found the best way for to make friends was to start by being a better friend to myself. I know it might sound corny, but making friends with myself is actually the best practice I could ever get. It also takes a lot of the discomfort out of making friends with other people, because I've diminished the potential risk that a poor interaction will come back to haunt me through self-criticism or the influence of exterior judgments. From there, I am more comfortable initiating interactions when I actually want them, which makes for higher quality interactions when they do occur.\n\nYou are enough just as you are.",

Ask a group of a few at a time so there's no misunderstanding of intention.  \n\nA few times of that, then it's \"hey I'm gonna grab lunch, y'all wanna come?\"",
