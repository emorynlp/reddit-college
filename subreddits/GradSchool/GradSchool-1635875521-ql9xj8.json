  "text": "I graduated with my bachelors degree in psychology at the end of 2019, and have been putting off going back to school for a number of reasons. I\u2019ve recently started looking at programs again and got an interview for one in the upcoming weeks! I\u2019m very excited about this, but also very nervous about it. I\u2019ve been out of school for roughly 2 years so feel out of place, plus this being my first grad school interview has me not knowing what to expect. The program I\u2019m interviewing for is a clinical mental health counseling program, does anyone have any interview advice they\u2019d like to share? Even if it\u2019s not for the same program, I would love to hear experiences from similar programs as well. Thanks! :)",

      "text": "I'm in cognitive neuroscience so not quite the same program but still psychology. \n\nIf you have a list of whoever you're interviewing with, look up their publications ahead of time! You don't have to read them word for word but at least skim. If they don't have publications, at least look up their CV or linkedin so you have an idea of what they do. While you interview try to ask them specific questions that relate to their research or their job position. Try to project confidence- have good but relaxed posture, a firm handshake (the rule I heard was firm grip and 3 pumps before letting go). If you have a nametag put it on your right, because when you shake hands it's usually with the right hand so their vision will kind of naturally travel up your arm to your nametag. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso remember these interviews are about you too! If your program is set up so that you work directly under a member of faculty (which I feel like a lot of programs are), remember to ask them about their mentorship style. How do they like to teach their grad students, how hands on or hands off are they, what are funding opportunities for you if you do research (idk if that's relevant), do they have other grad students, etc. \n\nMake sure they actually fit with you! You deserve a good mentor/PI.",
