  "text": "I find it difficult to study alone and going out to coffee shops/ libraries just isn't the same anymore. I've tried to find different groups or something but it all comes off a little ...shady if you know what I mean.  I just want an accountability buddy.  Someone to study with. I'm in the EST time zone if that helps find options. I've found a lot of things overseas but that isn't convenient with my schedule.",
