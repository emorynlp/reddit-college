  "text": "I had my Master's defense today and tbh I was never enthusiastic about the project cz my supervisor never followed up with me and we couldn't do a project of good quality cz there's a financial crisis in the country which impacted the university too. My supervisor even told me that my report needed corrections ONE DAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE. As the title said, he was very rude and at some point my supervisor mocked me too instead of defending me. It's sad that my graduation project went very wrong instead of it being a useful experience for me. I don't hate research, but the circumstances of this project made me hate it. I needed to get this off my chest.",
