One crumb of something nice with a million beatings. It gets them hooked to the relationship and if you tie your self worth to it.... well...\n\nBe mindful folks. If they truly are good advisors it shouldn't seem like a miracle that they gave you a compliment.... that just seems manipulative. Continue being skeptical. Don't put too high a price tag on this compliment.",

                  "text": "I disagree. Grad students are learning to work on problems that take years to answer which push the boundaries of our collective knowledge. They are often young people with less than 5 years of other life experience, and they know they are in a publish or perish environment. On top of that their advisor is someone who's available to them in a limited capacity, more like a CEO than a direct supervisor, and he or she is usually critical of their work and how it can be improved upon for a publication.\n\nAdd to the work dynamic the fact that a student most likely traveled far from home to attend the graduate program, is trying (and failing) to find a good work-life balance, and watches everyone around them succeed. As all of this happens they probably become pessimistic and doubtful about their work and its real meaning. An advisor's praise is earned, and that praise is probably the most important for a student's self esteem when experiments or writing are going poorly. That praise is coming from a world-expert in your subject, and it comes from the person holding the most influence over your next job aside from you.\n\nThat is the situation as I understand it for most graduate students in the sciences in the United States. could we as a society change that culture? Possibly, but I'm not sure if it would be best for our future if we were to. And until then, graduate students are going to be emotional when the person with the greatest influence over their future is proud of their work.",

                          "text": "Almost anyone who has completed a graduate degree or who has witnessed the process first-hand can empathize with the OP's testimony because they can relate to it. That implies most of those people have had a similar experience, and thus that this is not a local incident to a particular supervisor, department, or university. Rather, it is a cultural phenomenon among graduate programs in several universities and several academic disciplines. Therefore your assertion is that the entire graduate studies culture is environmentally flawed.\n\nI think the part that you're not understanding is that graduate school takes a tremendous amount of emotional bandwidth and resilience. Most days you go into work at your lab or department to design, build, prototype, experiment, or whatever it is that you're doing, and fail for one reason or another. Then you're repeating the work you did again the next day or the next week and hoping it is going to work out the next time. You do this for years on end, and your progress is incremental and small.\n\nThat process is isolating because no one else really knows the subject you're studying as well as you do. Your advisor supervises your progress, but a good advisor doesn't hold your hand. You're going to try and fail and figure things out for yourself. Your advisor wants you to think creatively and to work independently of anyone else\u2014to become self reliant in your area of study. When your advisor tells you \"good job\" they mean it, and that recognition is the first reward you're going to get for hundreds of hours of trial and error that most people cannot recognize as being significant.",
