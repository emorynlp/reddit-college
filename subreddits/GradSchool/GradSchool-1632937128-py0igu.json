Long story on why I chose it to begin with, but there was a lot of pressure from my dad to do it, and he helps pay my tuition (yes I know I\u2019m sounding very spoiled). I got my bachelors in English and History, and I\u2019ve never had the talent for anything even remotely math related. Now I\u2019m stuck in another years worth of accounting, economics, and finance classes that I\u2019m severely struggling with.  There\u2019s so much I don\u2019t understand, and even when I do understand I still hate it. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m feeling constantly stressed and depressed. I\u2019ve recently decided that it may be best to drop the program as a whole and start a Masters in Secondary Education. Only downside is I\u2019ll have to end up taking on student debt if I do it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m necessarily looking for any specific advice (although student debt is gonna be a whole new can of worms) I just want to feel like I\u2019m making the right decision. I feel fairly set in my decision to leave the MBA, it\u2019s just a big, very scary step to take towards making myself happy and feeling like I have control of my life. It sounds like an easy choice, but I\u2019m throwing away a whole years worth of money and work, and most of my friend and family are discouraging it, despite the fact that I barely know if I\u2019m going to pass this semesters classes, let alone the rest of the program.
