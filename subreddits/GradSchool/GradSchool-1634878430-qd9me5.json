  "text": "I\u2019m a second year PHD student in the US, came into the program with a master\u2019s. At first I thought doing a PHD during COVID was a god send, for lack of better words. It gave me job security when others\u2019 futures were immensely uncertain. Lately, discourse has shifted from fear of lay-offs to employee empowerment. We\u2019re witnessing people leave their jobs in masse and it is making me question everything. Employees that are having remote positions taken away are LEAVING rather than being threatened back into the office. Employees that are being paid crap and are being treated like crap are refusing to take it anymore. Because life is short. And employers are having to raise benefits to compensate. \n\nAnd here I am, in academia. Dealing with an atrocious work-life balance and stipend that\u2019s hardly livable. My university had remote live lecture capabilities and THEY TOOK THEM AWAY. So I\u2019m commuting to campus four days a week. Anytime a professor speaks to me devoid of empathy and full of hubris I want to explode\u2026but I don\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t want to make a reputation of being difficult to work with, would I? I can\u2019t help but think this is all wrong. But I have no idea what I\u2019d feasibly do otherwise. \n\nI feel like my research which deals intimately with hierarchy, power, subjugation and contradiction is turning me into a reclusive weirdo. What do I really want to do? I want to forage for food and learn to play random instruments. I dream of starting a commune. I want to make art for the sake of making art, and be curious for the sake of being curious rather than produce \u201cdeliverables\u201d for the academic emperors in their ivory towers.\n\nAm I really just losing it here? Because I feel like I\u2019m kind of losing it.",

      "text": "I saw a post on instagram stating we\u2019re not crazy, but that our brains can no longer handle everything the pandemic has put us through. We\u2019ve been in survival mode for 18 months now. I\u2019ve also had thoughts about throwing everything away and going to be an influencer or dancer or something that\u2019ll make money \ud83d\ude02 the remote option being thrown away has happened at many schools and it really sucks. I see so many people suffering now.",
