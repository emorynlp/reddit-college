I probably sound like a pompous asshole when I say this but it\u2019s obvious from the conversations I\u2019ve had with my fellow students that they all come from a lot of money and a pretty nice background. In general the entire field I entered tends to skew that way. I find myself getting hung up about the consistent talk about how we need diversity in the field and to be inclusive to everyone but the student body is almost exclusively 24-27 year old white upper class females.

Some even had maids. I joined the military because I didn\u2019t have that many options left. I just come from a completely different world. \n\nI have not in any way shape or form experienced any sort of discrimination or anything. No one has really made it a thing at all. I honestly don\u2019t think anyone either cares which is fine or they don\u2019t know what to do either, because they\u2019ve never actually met someone with my background before.

Diversity a topic where people tend to have strong reactions, and trying to voice your concerns from the perspective of a lower socioeconomic status white male risks someone taking it the wrong way like you\u2019re a racist who\u2019s trying to steal sympathy meant for racial/ethnic minorities. Unfortunately similar tactics sometimes are used by people with bad intentions to try to derail discussions about diversity, and your grad school peers (and faculty!) are likely too inexperienced with diversity to differentiate between someone doing that and you sharing genuine concerns/experiences.\n\nIf you feel the need to say something, it\u2019s safer to voice your concerns in the context of how socioeconomic factors might affect a hypothetical minority student or a single mother.\n\nThat said, your experiences are very real and valid. Socioeconomic background diversity is VERY overlooked in a grad school environment.

So I'll get along well enough with my classmates and get my social needs met elsewhere.\n\nI had a roommate in undergrad who had a tricky time adjusting to college life so I know you're not alone in that. I bet there are other resources out there for that.\n\nJust to add something that I haven't really seen others comment on - the diversity and inclusivity topics. (Granted, white male here, so I'm coming from that bias, etc.) I think all the emphasis and talk about diversity/inclusivity in academia as highlighting values and goals and aspirations. If there was a simple solution/training/education that would make people actually open to all forms of diversity/difference and behave accordingly, then it would have happened already. They're aspirational because we're all biased and limited in our worldviews. Being more inclusive of diversity is something that we all should continue to work on and will be a very individual journey. So, the talking about diversity sounds kinda fake because they're trying to emphasize a value, not actually find a solution (or be aware of the direct examples in front of them that don't quite fit the stereotypes).\n\nPart of your job is to expand the club to include yourself.

My department (English) is HUGE and has 3 fields an MULTIPLE subfields. I\u2019m a Literature major and I\u2019ve been confused as a creative writer for most of my time in my PhD. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the queer, tattoos, or non-traditional academic trajectory and age, but it is what it is. We, at one time, had a military guy in our CNF program, and he was one of my favorites.\n\nWhen I first arrived (I know this bc people have since told me as much) people were intrigued by me because I disrupted their expectations of who/ what a literature scholar is. But they were also a bit intimidated (goofy to me, but I\u2019ll accept it as a compliment). Also, my cohort all came in married with babies or have had babies since we\u2019ve been here and I was going through a devastating break up of a long term relationship. \n\nOur lit scholars are super conservative which I didn\u2019t know when I came in bc my optimistic ass thought PROGRESSIVE LEFTISTS! lol. Not true. So I\u2019m totally fine with my ability to confuse and challenge people. \n\nDespite our wide ranging beliefs, values, and upbringings, I have found that underneath it all we are united in our fundamental interests in stories and culture. I suggest you try to connect through the subject matter which is what has ultimately led to your crossing paths. \n\nAs much as I share your sentiments regarding this particular social class\u2014one thing that kept me going was when my stepdad told me that *maybe I\u2019m there to teach them as much as I\u2019m there to learn.* Then there\u2019s the old cliche about not fitting in bc you\u2019re supposed to stand out. \n\nAll of this is to say, from one person who disrupts just from simply being true to themself to another, just be you, but cultivate curiosity.

I don\u2019t know anything about adjusting from the military, but I definitely got experience coming from a lower tax bracket than my cohort.

I was also very mentally unstable my first year, so take that with a grain of salt. Its hard to relate to friends that somehow take trips to other countries on the stipend that gets you by paycheck to paycheck. It\u2019s a different situation when you\u2019re goal in grad school is to get a job where you can pay off your loans vs someone who goes just cuz they love it. \n\nI fit in better when I joined a group in a different department (chemist in a ChemE group). A lot more of the engineers had worked in industry before and were more grounded than the chemists. It was a change in mentality from viewing grad school as school vs as a job, which I benefited from. I\u2019ve also had more success making friends with my neighbors and non-students I\u2019ve met in the gym, so try that too.\n\nYou gotta remember that you\u2019re experiences are unique, and that is a fuckin ADVANTAGE.
