  "title:": "7th-year PhD student, just diagnosed with ADHD after my advisors intervened when I was seriously struggling. I'm grateful to them for not giving up on me, because I was certainly ready to.",
  "text": "I want to share this because I felt extremely alone for a lot of this experience, and I hope that being open about it can help others who might be going through something similar.\n\nI'm in my seventh year of a PhD program in the humanities; somewhere around year five or six, I started really struggling. I was done with the coursework and dissertation proposal stages of the degree and on to the pretty unstructured research/writing phase. I wasn't getting much writing done, but at first I was reassured by the fact that this seemed to be pretty normal; lots of other students told me that they didn't get much done in their fourth year and even fifth year, and that most of their writing happened in the last couple years of the program.\n\nIn year five, I got a grant that was intended to allow me to focus solely on research/writing. However, I got very little academic work done that year. I felt an increasing sense of paralysis as I stared at what was supposed to become my first chapter; it seemed inconceivable that I'd ever be able to turn it into anything resembling a legitimate dissertation chapter. Instead of working on writing it, I spent a lot of the time in the mountains (rock climbing, skiing, etc). At first I told myself that I was just trying to have some work/life balance, and that when it mattered, I'd be able to turn my focus to the dissertation; but as the year progressed, deep down I became increasingly doubtful.\n\nYear six (2019-2020) was where things really got bad. Possibly partly precipitated by a traumatic experience I'd had over the summer, I began to totally withdraw. I couldn't even open my unfinished dissertation chapter. I stopped checking email because I was afraid of what I might see. I had to go to the department to teach, but I would hurry in and out to try to avoid interacting with anyone. I was supposed to submit an application for a dissertation completion fellowship in January 2020; I watched that deadline come and go passively, without even communicating to my advisors that I didn't think I could make it.\n\nMeanwhile, other parts of my life were also deteriorating. There were a couple months where I didn't pay my rent, not because I didn't have the money but just because the process of writing the check and sending it to my landlord felt too overwhelming. Because I was completely avoiding my email at this point, I missed numerous communications from my landlord, and only by sheer luck happened to finally open my email shortly after he'd sent a message telling me that he would have to ask me to leave the apartment if I didn't pay immediately. My hygiene deteriorated, including on days when I had to teach, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had a couple small jobs outside the department, and I found myself increasingly unable to fulfill basic responsibilities (sometimes as simple as printing a poster out) there, too.\n\nI felt like I was watching myself self-sabotage, but I couldn't understand why, or why I couldn't seem to even bring myself to really care. Every day I would wake up and tell myself that I'd turn things around; then I'd spend the whole day staring at distracting websites, feeling physically unable to bring myself to click on the email tab, much less open anything related to my dissertation. I felt constantly exhausted and guilty, and I began to withdraw from my social life because I couldn't admit what was going on to myself, much less to my friends. The one thing I did consistently manage to do was go climbing, which just made me feel more guilty: surely if I could motivate myself to get up at 5 am to go to the mountains, I should be able to print out a poster or mail a rent check, right?\n\nI was also reminded of my experience in college: I'd struggled in all of my exam-based classes, making poor grades (including a couple failing grades) and feeling generally not in control of my life. The by all accounts successful \u224810 years between then and now didn't seem to matter; all I could feel was that the \"real me\" was a failure, and that everything in between was a fluke that was destined to fall apart sooner or later.\n\nMy advisors had been reaching out to me, but because I wasn't looking at my email I didn't see their communication. Finally, in February, a professor was able to give me a note in-person, which prompted me to finally look. I saw that I'd received a letter from the department telling me that there was concern about my progress, and that if I wasn't able to show two chapters by the end of the year, I'd be put on academic probation; if I didn't show two chapters by the end of the following year, I'd be asked to leave the program. I felt numb, surprised that they were giving me that much of a chance, and pessimistic about my ability to take advantage of it. Nevertheless, I wrote to my advisors to set up a meeting.\n\nWhat surprised me was how kind they were at the meeting. Where I was expecting anger and disappointment, I instead saw concern. They acknowledged that I was struggling without pressing me to explain why, told me that they valued my work and wanted me to be able to continue to participate in the field, but also emphasized that the most important thing was for me to take care of myself and my mental health--whatever that might mean for my academic work. We talked through the letter and my options, and they gave me some on-campus resources to talk with.\n\n(I want to acknowledge here that I know that this kind of response is unfortunately not the norm in graduate departments. I feel extremely grateful that my advisors were so compassionate, and very angry that many people have much more negative experiences when dealing with mental health issues in graduate school.)\n\nI started working with a therapist, a psychiatrist, and an academic coach at my university. Pretty quickly they mentioned the possibility of ADHD. It wasn't the first time someone had suggested this (I had a couple therapists earlier in grad school who also suspected it), but it was the first time I began to take it seriously as something that might be affecting my work.\n\nUnfortunately, when the pandemic hit they had to put a diagnostic evaluation (and any stimulant medication) on hold, but the psychiatrist did give me a prescription for Wellbutrin (known to help both depression and ADHD). Probably more importantly, the academic coach helped me develop strategies for managing focus and motivation. With their help (plus some pandemic-anxiety-induced hyperfocus...) I was able to finish my two chapter drafts, and even successfully applied retroactively for the dissertation completion grant that I'd failed to apply for in January. The academic progress was obviously important, but even more than that I felt immensely relieved to begin to feel capable again and not to feel like I had to hide from my own life.\n\nThe last chapter of this somewhat rambling saga came this month. After delaying dealing with it for several months, I finally made an appointment to be formally evaluated for ADHD. The doctor confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed me a low dose of Adderall. It's only been a week, but the difference is already striking. I feel way less dread about starting work on the dissertation each day, and as a result, competing distractions feel less compelling. When I do get distracted, it doesn't feel like a monumental effort just to navigate back to the Word document. Maybe most surprisingly, I feel less imposter syndrome about the coherence of my arguments now that I'm able to focus on re-reading more than a couple paragraphs of my writing at a time.\n\nIn retrospect, the ADHD diagnosis makes sense of a lot of things I'd always just seen as personal failings/quirks: my extreme spaciness as a kid; my chronic inability to keep my personal spaces tidy no matter how much I want to; my tendency to fixate on things seemingly irrespective of their overall importance (often at the expense of basic needs like food or water); my anxiety about the fact that my ability to write has seemed to depend on intense surges of motivation/inspiration; my tendency to forget what I'm doing midway through a task; etc. No one picked up on it when I was a kid because I was a well-behaved girl who didn't fit the stereotype for ADHD. And while I'd been aware that a lot of this stuff might be related to ADHD for a few years, what I didn't expect was to feel like there were concrete solutions that could give me a greater sense of self-efficacy and clarity.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I wouldn't have imagined that this sense of competence and hope was possible for me. I didn't really feel capable of thinking about the future at all; if I did, I probably imagined that I'd be living with my parents after having had to explain how I'd managed to be kicked out of a PhD program that--up to a certain point--I'd been thriving in. I certainly didn't feel I deserved a second chance: instead, I felt that I'd already been given too many second chances and that I had finally shown my true character when I failed at this one. I was ready to give up on myself, and I'm so grateful that my department didn't let that happen.\n\nWhile I was going through this, I felt incredibly alone and as though my failure was unique to me. It didn't matter that objectively I recognized that the stress of graduate school took a heavy toll on many of my colleagues; I was convinced that in my case, it was just because I wasn't good enough, and that I had squandered an opportunity I never deserved in the first place. I also felt deeply ashamed at just how much I was letting my life fall apart, and unable to talk about it to even my closest friends because of that shame.\n\nI realize now that this shame was incredibly destructive. One of the first things that actually made me feel better was when the academic counselor I met with told me that she'd met many other students who, like me, had avoided looking at email for weeks or months at a time. I had felt so ridiculous for being unable to bring myself to do something so simple; knowing that other people had struggled with it, too, suddenly helped me see my own experience with more compassion. I've realized since that shame about academic failure perpetuates a culture of silence in which people often feel unable to talk about the extent of their struggles in academia--even when the topic of mental health is broached.\n\nSo, if you are going through similar difficulties (whether ADHD-related or something else), please know that you are not alone. No matter how badly you feel that you're failing, there are other people who have been there, too. You might feel like you deserve to suffer for your failures (I know I did), but what you truly deserve is compassion and support. You deserve to receive resources to deal with whatever may be causing your struggles so that you can live the life you want to live--whether that's in or out of academia. And if your advisors/department doesn't give you that support (which is sadly all too common), I hope you're still able to find someone who can step in, advocate for you, and remind you that you are worth it in those moments where you might not feel that way.\n\nThanks for reading through this mini-novel if you've gotten this far :) I hope it's helpful to at least a few people; I know it felt helpful to me to write it all out.\n\n**Edit**: Thanks for all the really kind responses and the awards! It means a lot to realize how much of this experience is shared. Anyway, now that I've replied to all the comments, I guess I should go actually try to write my dissertation or something \ud83e\udd23",

I was diagnosed with ADHD last month. I'm a woman as well and I relate a lot to your experience. I went through a burnout period and a bout of depression in late September that I was able to get out of because of my eventual diagnosis and treatment. Even though the wait was painful, I know a diagnosis after two months of seeking one is unimaginable for some people. It's been such a relief having help with my symptoms but it's even better knowing that my failings weren't all on me and were out of my control. I'm just starting my journey and it's nice knowing that I'm sharing a similar experience with someone else, especially a woman pursuing a PhD, which I plan to do after undergrad. I'm really glad you had the support and encouragement you needed to get help.",

      "text": "Thank you for taking the time to share your story! Women are so often under diagnosed because our symptoms tend to be more subtle and less destructive in early classroom settings (think; the little girl who can\u2019t sit still so she always volunteers to be the teacher\u2019s helper, or roams around the classroom trying to help others because she can\u2019t focus on her own page in front of her, or the little girl who doesn\u2019t do her book report and stays home \u201csick\u201d instead of admitting that she couldn\u2019t finish the book) \n\nI\u2019m really grateful that my sister:\nA) noticed signs of ADHD when I was struggling with the first year of my undergrad, and\nB) encouraged me to talk to someone\n\nI was failing most of my first year of classes after never having failed a class before. I dropped out because the only thing I could do to self-soothe was play video games all day and the thought of even trying to study or write papers was overwhelming. \nWhen I was first diagnosed, I spent a lot of time feeling infuriated and let down by the public school system for not catching it sooner, but ultimately not being diagnosed early helped me develop some helpful coping strategies (and some not so helpful coping strategies that I spent a lot of time unlearning), and has helped me help other women get diagnosed too. There are at least 3 other women who have gotten diagnosed with ADHD as adults directly as a result of a conversation with me! So be angry, be grateful for answers, and use both of those new feelings to self-advocate and help others advocate for themselves! \nAnd congrats on doing the self-work needed to succeed. I know it sometimes feels like you don\u2019t deserve praise because \u201cit\u2019s just the meds working\u201d but really, medication only quiets your brain a little, the rest is all you :)",

I relate to how being the \"quiet, obedient\" girl growing up might have been a core reason why getting tested earlier in life didn't happen.

I still need help with some little quirks - like forgetting key terms, and I needing to check myself on how hyperfocused I may be getting on something, but those things are manageable. \n\nI'm sad that I didn't receive the medical support that I needed earlier, but grateful that I received it all.

I went through a very similar situation when I was writing my Masters thesis and I was lucky that, even after struggling with communication for months, my advisor met me with nothing but empathy and understanding. I really wish this weren't so uncommon!\n\nLast year, one year after finishing my Masters, I discovered that I am autistic and it was a huge relief to finally understand why I struggled so much. Receiving proper care has been life-changing. I'm going to start my PhD in 3 months and, while I believe I'll have a hard time during the writing process again, I also know that I have the right resources to make it work better this time.",

Thanks and do you have any advice for the writing/revising part... whenever I see my words on a page I hate them immediately, and I can spend an hour on 2 sentences and when I come bak to them later I don't even like them. I am already on adhd and anxiety medication.\n\nThanks and I'm glad you found the answers you did!",

          "text": "I'm so glad it helped! Yeah, it is really painful to feel like you're failing on things without understanding why they are so hard for you when they seem like they \"should\" be so easy.\n\nFor writing/revising, the thing I have found probably most helpful is to just write a highlighted note to myself in text when I find myself ruminating over a sentence/passage. Often it'll be something as simple as \"Try to make this more precise later\" or \"Not sure if this actually makes sense.\" (For some reason, I find it more helpful to do this in-text than in a comment.) This often helps me to move on (and to be honest I usually end up never returning to those comments and just deleting them in the final draft, haha). Maybe you've already tried this but I thought I'd mention it in case you haven't.\n\nI also have found accountability sessions with other graduate students to be pretty helpful--we usually meet either via Zoom or just text, state a goal for the hour, and then check in at the end of the hour to see how it went. I find it most helpful to do it with people I trust to be non-judgemental, so that I don't get defensive/defeated/just lie about my progress. I find it helpful having the little bit of extra motivation of stating a goal, but equally important for me is the conversations afterwards, since they often help me realize that I'm not alone in what I'm struggling with.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure how to make this into something immediately useful, but on the revising front, I found that actually finishing revising a chapter made subsequent revisions feel a lot less daunting. The truth is that I'd basically never truly revised anything in my life up until now (including any of my papers during coursework), so I had a ton of doubt as to whether it was something I was even capable of. Unfortunately, that's kind of putting the cart before the horse, though...but I definitely think that there's some truth to the idea that if you can find tricks to get yourself into the habit of doing something that feels hard, it will start to feel less hard as time goes on.\n\nI hope some of this is helpful! Good luck with your graduate work and finding solutions that work for you.",

          "text": "Thanks for the kind words :) Something that was strange for me was that even though I was pretty sure I had ADHD a couple years ago after a therapist suggested it for the first time, for a long time it didn't feel like a \"real\" or \"big\" enough problem to me to merit seeking help or to explain the distress I was experiencing. I felt like it was something I should be able to deal with on my own (especially since I more or less had for quite a while), and that if I couldn't then that was just laziness.\n\nWhat I especially didn't realize until starting medication recently was how much it had affected not only my academic success, but also my sense of self-worth and my emotional well-being. Looking back, I also realize that it also probably had a lot to do with my difficulty fitting in socially at school--both because of my spaciness and the difficulty I had taking care of myself, which made me feel different from the other girls without understanding why--and I think that had a lot of long-term ramifications for my sense of self. \n\nA lot of the psychological distress I felt so deeply connected to my basic sense of self that I couldn't believe it could be related to ADHD, which I perceived as just being about having trouble making deadlines or finishing tasks. While certainly there are other factors involved, I wish I'd realized sooner how big a role ADHD was playing and that help was available that could make a real difference for me.",

Luckily, they were able to do the evaluation. I definitely waited until the very last minute (when I was running out of my Wellbutrin prescription, lol) to make the appointment, though.\n\nGood luck to you, too--I hope you're able to get evaluated soon and that you're able to find strategies and resources that help make grad school more manageable in the meantime!",

              "text": "I think it's common in smart people in general not just certain fields. Like many people who do grad school have adopted techniques throughout their lives that work for them and manage their studies. Our grades never slipped due to our ADHD so no one noticed it. But a PhD is so high stress and intense, those strategies start to fail. When I was first diagnosed they gave me info on methods to manage it with behavior changes, which I was already doing every single one of them before I crashed in my PhD. So I was self managing till then, but needed meds to get through.",
