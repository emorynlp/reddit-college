I'm grateful to them for not giving up on me, because I was certainly ready to.", "text": "I want to share this because I felt extremely alone for a lot of this experience, and I hope that being open about it can help others who might be going through something similar.\n\nI'm in my seventh year of a PhD program in the humanities; somewhere around year five or six, I started really struggling. I was done with the coursework and dissertation proposal stages of the degree and on to the pretty unstructured research/writing phase. I wasn't getting much writing done, but at first I was reassured by the fact that this seemed to be pretty normal; lots of other students told me that they didn't get much done in their fourth year and even fifth year, and that most of their writing happened in the last couple years of the program.\n\nIn year five, I got a grant that was intended to allow me to focus solely on research/writing. However, I got very little academic work done that year. I felt an increasing sense of paralysis as I stared at what was supposed to become my first chapter; it seemed inconceivable that I'd ever be able to turn it into anything resembling a legitimate dissertation chapter. Instead of working on writing it, I spent a lot of the time in the mountains (rock climbing, skiing, etc). At first I told myself that I was just trying to have some work/life balance, and that when it mattered, I'd be able to turn my focus to the dissertation; but as the year progressed, deep down I became increasingly doubtful.\n\nYear six (2019-2020) was where things really got bad. Possibly partly precipitated by a traumatic experience I'd had over the summer, I began to totally withdraw. I couldn't even open my unfinished dissertation chapter. I stopped checking email because I was afraid of what I might see. I had to go to the department to teach, but I would hurry in and out to try to avoid interacting with anyone. I was supposed to submit an application for a dissertation completion fellowship in January 2020; I watched that deadline come and go passively, without even communicating to my advisors that I didn't think I could make it.\n\nMeanwhile, other parts of my life were also deteriorating. There were a couple months where I didn't pay my rent, not because I didn't have the money but just because the process of writing the check and sending it to my landlord felt too overwhelming. Because I was completely avoiding my email at this point, I missed numerous communications from my landlord, and only by sheer luck happened to finally open my email shortly after he'd sent a message telling me that he would have to ask me to leave the apartment if I didn't pay immediately. My hygiene deteriorated, including on days when I had to teach, but I couldn't bring myself to care. I had a couple small jobs outside the department, and I found myself increasingly unable to fulfill basic responsibilities (sometimes as simple as printing a poster out) there, too.\n\nI felt like I was watching myself self-sabotage, but I couldn't understand why, or why I couldn't seem to even bring myself to really care. Every day I would wake up and tell myself that I'd turn things around; then I'd spend the whole day staring at distracting websites, feeling physically unable to bring myself to click on the email tab, much less open anything related to my dissertation. I felt constantly exhausted and guilty, and I began to withdraw from my social life because I couldn't admit what was going on to myself, much less to my friends. The one thing I did consistently manage to do was go climbing, which just made me feel more guilty: surely if I could motivate myself to get up at 5 am to go to the mountains, I should be able to print out a poster or mail a rent check, right?\n\nI was also reminded of my experience in college: I'd struggled in all of my exam-based classes, making poor grades (including a couple failing grades) and feeling generally not in control of my life. The by all accounts successful \u224810 years between then and now didn't seem to matter; all I could feel was that the \"real me\" was a failure, and that everything in between was a fluke that was destined to fall apart sooner or later.\n\nMy advisors had been reaching out to me, but because I wasn't looking at my email I didn't see their communication. Finally, in February, a professor was able to give me a note in-person, which prompted me to finally look. I saw that I'd received a letter from the department telling me that there was concern about my progress, and that if I wasn't able to show two chapters by the end of the year, I'd be put on academic probation; if I didn't show two chapters by the end of the following year, I'd be asked to leave the program. I felt numb, surprised that they were giving me that much of a chance, and pessimistic about my ability to take advantage of it. Nevertheless, I wrote to my advisors to set up a meeting.\n\nWhat surprised me was how kind they were at the meeting. Where I was expecting anger and disappointment, I instead saw concern. They acknowledged that I was struggling without pressing me to explain why, told me that they valued my work and wanted me to be able to continue to participate in the field, but also emphasized that the most important thing was for me to take care of myself and my mental health--whatever that might mean for my academic work. We talked through the letter and my options, and they gave me some on-campus resources to talk with.\n\n(I want to acknowledge here that I know that this kind of response is unfortunately not the norm in graduate departments. I feel extremely grateful that my advisors were so compassionate, and very angry that many people have much more negative experiences when dealing with mental health issues in graduate school.)\n\nI started working with a therapist, a psychiatrist, and an academic coach at my university. Pretty quickly they mentioned the possibility of ADHD. It wasn't the first time someone had suggested this (I had a couple therapists earlier in grad school who also suspected it), but it was the first time I began to take it seriously as something that might be affecting my work.\n\nUnfortunately, when the pandemic hit they had to put a diagnostic evaluation (and any stimulant medication) on hold, but the psychiatrist did give me a prescription for Wellbutrin (known to help both depression and ADHD). Probably more importantly, the academic coach helped me develop strategies for managing focus and motivation. With their help (plus some pandemic-anxiety-induced hyperfocus...) I was able to finish my two chapter drafts, and even successfully applied retroactively for the dissertation completion grant that I'd failed to apply for in January. The academic progress was obviously important, but even more than that I felt immensely relieved to begin to feel capable again and not to feel like I had to hide from my own life.\n\nThe last chapter of this somewhat rambling saga came this month. After delaying dealing with it for several months, I finally made an appointment to be formally evaluated for ADHD. The doctor confirmed the diagnosis and prescribed me a low dose of Adderall. It's only been a week, but the difference is already striking. I feel way less dread about starting work on the dissertation each day, and as a result, competing distractions feel less compelling. When I do get distracted, it doesn't feel like a monumental effort just to navigate back to the Word document. Maybe most surprisingly, I feel less imposter syndrome about the coherence of my arguments now that I'm able to focus on re-reading more than a couple paragraphs of my writing at a time.\n\nIn retrospect, the ADHD diagnosis makes sense of a lot of things I'd always just seen as personal failings/quirks: my extreme spaciness as a kid; my chronic inability to keep my personal spaces tidy no matter how much I want to; my tendency to fixate on things seemingly irrespective of their overall importance (often at the expense of basic needs like food or water); my anxiety about the fact that my ability to write has seemed to depend on intense surges of motivation/inspiration; my tendency to forget what I'm doing midway through a task; etc. No one picked up on it when I was a kid because I was a well-behaved girl who didn't fit the stereotype for ADHD. And while I'd been aware that a lot of this stuff might be related to ADHD for a few years, what I didn't expect was to feel like there were concrete solutions that could give me a greater sense of self-efficacy and clarity.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I wouldn't have imagined that this sense of competence and hope was possible for me. I didn't really feel capable of thinking about the future at all; if I did, I probably imagined that I'd be living with my parents after having had to explain how I'd managed to be kicked out of a PhD program that--up to a certain point--I'd been thriving in. I certainly didn't feel I deserved a second chance: instead, I felt that I'd already been given too many second chances and that I had finally shown my true character when I failed at this one. I was ready to give up on myself, and I'm so grateful that my department didn't let that happen.\n\nWhile I was going through this, I felt incredibly alone and as though my failure was unique to me. It didn't matter that objectively I recognized that the stress of graduate school took a heavy toll on many of my colleagues; I was convinced that in my case, it was just because I wasn't good enough, and that I had squandered an opportunity I never deserved in the first place. I also felt deeply ashamed at just how much I was letting my life fall apart, and unable to talk about it to even my closest friends because of that shame.\n\nI realize now that this shame was incredibly destructive. One of the first things that actually made me feel better was when the academic counselor I met with told me that she'd met many other students who, like me, had avoided looking at email for weeks or months at a time. I had felt so ridiculous for being unable to bring myself to do something so simple; knowing that other people had struggled with it, too, suddenly helped me see my own experience with more compassion. I've realized since that shame about academic failure perpetuates a culture of silence in which people often feel unable to talk about the extent of their struggles in academia--even when the topic of mental health is broached.\n\nSo, if you are going through similar difficulties (whether ADHD-related or something else), please know that you are not alone. No matter how badly you feel that you're failing, there are other people who have been there, too. You might feel like you deserve to suffer for your failures (I know I did), but what you truly deserve is compassion and support. You deserve to receive resources to deal with whatever may be causing your struggles so that you can live the life you want to live--whether that's in or out of academia. And if your advisors/department doesn't give you that support (which is sadly all too common), I hope you're still able to find someone who can step in, advocate for you, and remind you that you are worth it in those moments where you might not feel that way.\n\nThanks for reading through this mini-novel if you've gotten this far :) I hope it's helpful to at least a few people; I know it felt helpful to me to write it all out.\n\n**Edit**: Thanks for all the really kind responses and the awards! It means a lot to realize how much of this experience is shared.
