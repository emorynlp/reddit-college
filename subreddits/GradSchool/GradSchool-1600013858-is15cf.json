  "text": "New to the sub, but not new to grad school.. sorry if this is a repeat.\n\nI've recently come to the realization that I don't handle work-related stress well, and that my constant need to satisfy my supervisor and project collaborators has me miserable. It just seems futile because there is always more analysis, always more edits, always just more to do, and I never feel like my efforts are satisfactory in the eyes of my supervisors.\n\nRegardless, has anyone else ever realized in a graduate program that they will likely be happier working a related but less stressful job and spending more time on themselves?\n\nHope everyone else is hanging in there.",

The money will come. It's not the biggest thing in life. Waking up every day and *not* wishing something would just kill me, that is worth more than money. Well Mr. PI, the folks at this apt complex would like to see me, they think my work is great. I will be spending my Monday there and my Sunday prepping for it. Science is now a rung lower on my priority list. Time to get some validation in the most honest form it comes: money. Get back to it when I get to it. Sorry not sorry, maybe if you helped me enjoy science instead of hate it with every fiber of my soul then all this work I put in would lead me somewhere in science. Nope. It gave me the drive and management skills to get the fuck away from these toxic fucking egos.\n\nEdit: and if you are interested my TikTok handle is @dr.porkbelly . I make all sorts of vids about my wacky adventures through science and starting/operating a food truck business from scratch on 2 days a week. It's fun. I have no apologies",

I went into my PhD excited about all the new opportunities. I believe I could easily be employed at one of the two Universities in my area but I decided the lifestyle isn\u2019t for me. It would be more money but also significantly more stress. \n\nI\u2019m at the writing/analysis stage of my dissertation. I\u2019m going to persevere and finish hopefully this year. I\u2019m not planning on making big moves and even doing much research post PhD. I\u2019ve gained some great experiences, but I could live a much nicer life not getting caught up in academic and research pursuits. \n\nI 100% regret getting into my PhD in the first place. I wanted to prove I could do it, but it\u2019s come at a high physical/mental/emotional cost.",

Now that we\u2019re grown she works more, and I respect her so much for sacrificing her career for us. She never sees it as that much of a sacrifice, and the way she talks about it she sees it as the right decision. Also being an actually devoted parent takes an incredible amount of work. So basically, up to you, but I don\u2019t think you should feel guilty or like your education was a waste. Ultimately it helped our entire family become better people who strive for excellence ourselves.",

It didn\u2019t go as well as I\u2019d hoped (she told me think about it for a week haha as if I hadn\u2019t already) but she was glad I told her. After that it was just signing a paper for the department to switch my degree plan formally. The only lab person I explicitly told was the one who was training me on everything and it\u2019s casually come up in conversation with the rest of my group, who really don\u2019t make a deal out of it. Sorry to hear about it being so taboo to masters out for you. But just remember - 1) you won\u2019t ever have to work with those people again 2) if they\u2019re that close-minded to make quitting a phd seem like a bad thing, that sucks for them. Nobody needs a PhD to prove they\u2019re smart and I\u2019d argue more people drop for wanting a better life for themselves rather than not passing quals.",
