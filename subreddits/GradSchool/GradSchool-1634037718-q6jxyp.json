  "text": "I just handed in my MA thesis, originally due September 2020. I thought I was never going to get the bloody thing done and am now trying to feel some positive feelings but finding it tough! I had to work around a full-time job, ADHD, and carpal tunnel syndrome (I know I'm not special, just facts), and I think how long I ended up drawing out the process has made it hard to have that feeling of 'ta-da! All done!' \n\nI think it's also affected by the fact that I haven't been able to be physically present at uni for a year and a half, so it's just been Zooms with my (long-suffering) supervisor. \n\nSince I imagine lots of us are dealing with similar circumstances, has anyone got any tips on revelling in the joy of handing in? Thanks :)",
