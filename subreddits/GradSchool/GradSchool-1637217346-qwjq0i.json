  "text": "I'm seriously struggling to manage my time and stick to any schedule I make for myself. I am taking 2 classes which are a bit heavy and am also doing research. I hate that every week, I put off my research work until the night before my weekly meeting and I stay up to finish in haste. \n\nNext term we are planning to go back to mainly in person. I am taking 1 heavy class and 3 light ones (1 class is \"navigating grad school\" and the other is \"how to give a poster or oral talk\"), and will be continuing my research. For the past 2 years I typically took 2 classes, TA'd and did my research and I pretty much always did my research work the night before. I have progressed and am on track but I would like to change my work ethic, especially as I complete my coursework requirements and focus more on research.\n\nI am in therapy for my anxiety which largely drives my procrastination, but does anyone have other tips or suggestions as to how to take steps in the right direction?",

It\u2019s a planner but contains additional areas to fill in such as \u201cTasks that need to be done today\u201d, etc. maybe you could find something similar if you enjoy planners. I hope you find something that works for you!! You got this.",

      "text": "For my anxious brain, I use a pomodoro timer.  If you aren\u2019t familiar, it\u2019s a schedule where you work for 25 minutes and take a 5 minute break.  I will struggle with facing a few hours of work after a long day, but I can always convince myself to tackle 25 minutes.  I also always make myself take the break - even when it feels like I don\u2019t need it.  In peak times (like right now, finishing my thesis) I drill down to what I am going to tackle in each cycle.  Good luck!",

      "text": "Clockify is my dream for handling this sort of stuff. It A means I know where my time goes. and B means I can feel okay about doing things that aren't 100%. Like I allow myself \\~15-30 minutes of reddit and article reading each morning to start my day. Then I settle down into a task and once I've mangled that for X length of time I move onto the next. \n\nI think the important thing with having a personal schedule for me was recognizing that I didn't HAVE to stick to it as written. When I get a good flow going I'll ignore everything else until I'm done with what I'm doing. When I get really stuck on something I'll move onto the next thing early.",
