Honestly, I feel like I haven't understood parts of this project (meetings are helping). I barely can do anything lately. I sit to work on the project, write two lines, get distracted, remember what I'm doing after 30 minutes a the cycle goes on.\n\nSemester is almost over. All I want to do is sleep for one week when it's over.",

I also recommend doing the Pomodoro method which does take a lot of dedication at first, but you condition yourself for it soon.
