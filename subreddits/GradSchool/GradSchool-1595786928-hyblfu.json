A few months ago (in the pre-COVID times) I started writing a resource article on how to read scientific papers. I asked this sub for paper reading tips you would give to new graduate students, and I got some really thoughtful and detailed responses. \n\nAnyway, I finally got around to publishing the article and thought I would share it here in hopes that people will find it helpful. Thanks again to this great community for your input!\n\n[https://graduatedebris.com/how-to-read-scientific-papers/](https://graduatedebris.com/how-to-read-scientific-papers/)", "author": "JDL-PhD", "created": 1595786928, "retrieved": 1632845820, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 411, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fzf4aea": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hyblfu/advice_on_reading_scientific_papers/fzf4aea/", "text": "Great article, thanks for writing and sharing.

In my experience, as the discussion proceeds, and you get to results and conclusion, they are no longer supported by the data. The authors make conclusions that are simply not supported by the data they present. This happens more often than you might realize. \n\nI also encourage you to add a paragraph about communicating with the authors if you have questions. Authors rarely mind receiving an email with questions from readers, and they are often very pleased that someone has actually read their paper.", "author": "RainInTheWoods", "created": 1595863317, "upvotes": 2}, "fzdqu7x": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hyblfu/advice_on_reading_scientific_papers/fzdqu7x/", "text": "Thank you!
