  "title:": "Advice on Reading Scientific Papers",
  "text": "Hi everyone! A few months ago (in the pre-COVID times) I started writing a resource article on how to read scientific papers. I asked this sub for paper reading tips you would give to new graduate students, and I got some really thoughtful and detailed responses. \n\nAnyway, I finally got around to publishing the article and thought I would share it here in hopes that people will find it helpful. Thanks again to this great community for your input!\n\n[https://graduatedebris.com/how-to-read-scientific-papers/](https://graduatedebris.com/how-to-read-scientific-papers/)",

I find that my mind wanders and it can take me a long time to get through even a paragraph. I know some of this just comes down to discipline but I'm just wondering if anyone has experience improving here...",

      "text": "Nicely written. \n\nI encourage you to add a paragraph about making your own comparison of the discussion, and the stated results and conclusion, to the actual data.  In my experience, as the discussion proceeds, and you get to results and conclusion, they are no longer supported by the data. The authors make conclusions that are simply not supported by the data they present. This happens more often than you might realize. \n\nI also encourage you to add a paragraph about communicating with the authors if you have questions. Authors rarely mind receiving an email with questions from readers, and they are often very pleased that someone has actually read their paper.",

I'm actually working on writing a research paper at the moment, and this was really helpful! \n\nA bit of a question: Is the introduction the same as an abstract or is this slightly different? I think I've seen both on some research papers and was just wondering how this might be included. From what you said about the introduction though, it sounds like an abstract.\n\nThanks again!",

          "text": "Ah! Great question! The abstract and introduction are slightly different. \n\nThe abstract is a condensed summary of the entire paper, encompassing intro/background, methods, key results, and conclusions / impact. The abstract is meant to be a standalone blurb that someone can read to quickly learn what your paper is about and what you found. This is also the bit that people can see when searching your paper in databases like PubMed or Google Scholar.\n\nIn contrast, the introduction will go into much more detail on background, previous work in the field, etc. it\u2019s geared toward people who have committed to reading your paper, and it\u2019s the place where you really make your case for the question/hypothesis is that you aim to test.\n\nThanks for bringing this up! I may update my article to add a section about the abstract.",
