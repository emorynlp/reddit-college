It went well!", "text": "Sorry to add to the flurry of \u201cquitting PhD\u201d posts, but I wanted to give a quick update. I posted a few days ago asking for advice about how to tell my difficult PI that I\u2019m leaving with a masters. Well, I did it this morning, and it went MUCH better than expected!\n\nI was ready for side eyes, pursed lips, and clenched fists. But, when I first told her, her response was more along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that sounds like it was difficult decision. I want you to do what\u2019s best for you. Let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d \n\nMy PI has a tendency to be very hot and cold\u2014if you tell her something mildly annoying on a bad day, be prepared...so I think I caught her on a good day, haha. We still have some things to discuss (how much work I have left to do, exact end date, etc) but this first meeting made me feel like it will be a smooth process rather than fraught with hurt feelings.\n\nI will also say: I would never have had the courage to do this if not for the wonderful therapy I received last semester. If I didn\u2019t learn to be more confident and willing to stand up for myself and what is best for me, rather than just doing what is expected, I would have continued and been miserable for absolutely no reason for at least another three years. \n\nI\u2019m so happy and relieved!", "author": "lauriceman", "created": 1610562450, "retrieved": 1632845759, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 453, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gxtyy1f": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kwmjst/update_i_told_my_pi_im_mastering_out_it_went_well/gxtyy1f/", "text": "A wonderful decision but how is your salary, if you don't mind sharing?
