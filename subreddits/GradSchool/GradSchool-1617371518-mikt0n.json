  "text": "like i'm sorry but i'm not your surgeon, i'm not obligated to drop everything to zoom with you when you didn't even bother showing up to my scheduled office hours... normally i don't find students to be THAT entitled, but something about this semester seems to have made them think they can just intrude on my life at their own convenience. \n\ni even found myself feeling guilty the other day for telling someone i couldn't meet with her on 2 hours' notice but then i realized how ridiculous that would sound if we were in person. i hate that digital communication creeps into all of my free time. like yes, i have the technological capacity to be in touch constantly, but i don't want to! it doesn't help that the professor i'm TAing for has a habit of instantly responding to student emails and hopping on impromptu zoom calls all the time. \n\ni (sort of) tried to be positive at the beginning of the semester, but man i actually hate online teaching/learning. i never want to do it again and i wish video conferencing services would all go bankrupt overnight\ud83e\udd1e",

Whatsapp messages, mind you. \n\nI used to reply to them in the beginning of the semester but I quickly realized that I'm not really helping them, by enabling them to send me messages past working hours. If I get a message past 5pm, I just respond I'll reply tomorrow. Please message me within working hours etc.\n\nAll of my students are apologetic about it. I think their other lecturers respond to them at ungodly hours of the night too. I just think of it as me teaching them what to expect in their workplace next time.",

      "text": "I'm in a weird situation where I'm a lab manager and start grad school in the fall (I've actually been working as though I'm a grad student at this time just without classes), but I'm currently a TA and have been while I was an undergrad and during my \"gap\" year. So I have my cell phone number in my email signature so if there is an emergency at the lab with my freezers or my rodents I'm reachable (which has happened before). I honestly never thought about it. So when I replied to my students emails they now have my cell phone number. \n\nLast semester I had a student email me at 11:27pm asking to set up a zoom meeting for the next day about their report that was due in 5 days. 3 minutes later they called my cell phone. I keep very odd hours, and sometimes I have to be at the lab at 4am or midnight instead of my usual 6-7am, this was one of my 4am mornings and I was woken out of my dead sleep by my loud phone ringer. - this is when people call you because of an emergency, my instant go to thought is \"who died\". They then proceed to ask me about the assignment and say \"sorry for calling your cell phone I hope this is okay I emailed you but then I saw your number in your signature so I just decided to call. I have a few clarification questions about the report\". It took me forever to get my heart rate down enough I could go back to sleep after my nuclear bomb phone ringtone went off and scared me to death.",

Professors I speak to are increasingly dealing with students who expect 24/7 support. Some of the hypotheses I've heard others suggest:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The commodification of postsecondary make students more likely to view professors and TAs as customer service, similar to when their computer acts up and they contact Dell.\n* Reinforcement of this behaviour from (some) administrators. Some schools have policies where professors have to answer in incredibly short timeframes, and administration will sometimes scold professors for not being fast enough (even for completely reasonable response times). This can reinforce the behaviour.\n* Students increasingly translating social media/texting attitudes to formal communication. Namely, the immediate response times associated with messaging someone late seem to be expected.\n* The online environment likely exacerbates this, as the work/home divide is much blurrier than before. \n\nI expect this will get worse over time, for at least a while.",

Unfortunately it seems that's mostly what these evaluations measure. That term where I scored below made me stop taking evaluations seriously. There is absolutely no way I could have been more available without adopting a meth habit. I don't think it is entitlement, I think evaluations are bad metrics and students just don't care. There will always be a heavier weight to reporting bad than good (because good is average). Think about when you were taking classes.

They do not like that at all. And then I collect and bring questions up at the next session. I also use a message board where they can just post and answer other peoples questions whenever they want. That worked relatively well during corona. \n\nI also had to explain that teaching is not my main focus (4 hours/week) and that this is a JOB not my life, they usually calm down. \n\nMost questions in my classes are not because they do not know about the content/procedure but because they are scared and I have to calm them down.

I know people will have conflicts with office hours so I told them I can try to meet if they gave me at least 24hrs notice. \n\nFor weeks with an exam or big assignment due, I told them I'd try to be a little more available on responding to emails but not to expect anything.\n\nThe biggest thing is to be firm on your boundaries.

How are we supposed to \"normalize\" a healthy work/life balance, when our professors - the authority figures who have control over our grad school experience - don't put any value in this concept? I detest how universities give lip service to supporting student mental heath (\"sign up for our anxiety workshop and pretend like that bandaid solution compensates for your unhealthy lifestyle!\"), yet see no problem with complete enmeshment of studies/research with the students' lives. You can't have your cake and eat it too. \n\nI often wake up to find that my advisor has emailed me at 1 am, and while, like, I appreciate the prompt response, I would have survived if he waited until the next day.

          "text": "I think that the lack of boundaries is at the center of graduate school stress. The \"work anytime\" (translation: work all the time) culture. The expectation of answering emails within an hour is actually ridiculous. I need some time to focus on things besides email. \n\nEmail is like a random task generator. Some email tasks that take me 20 minutes to do; others take hours. Some can be deleted without opening. Some require a lot of emotional labor and writing skills. Approaching the task generator takes a certain amount of emotional and cognitive readiness, and enough time to deal with whatever problem crops up. And frankly, I don't have that all the time. The expectations for email are forcing us to keep going back and pushing \"new task\", when we haven't had time to finish the old tasks.\n\nAnd it's unacceptable to work them off serially, because you have to keep returning to the task generator to answer them quickly. It has honestly made my professional life such a mess. I wish it was acceptable to just do things until they were done, then seek another thing to do. Otherwise, it creates a huge mental load all the time just juggling what to do next.",

And I say most things because there\u2019s a difference between asking for an extension every week because you can\u2019t time manage and a last minute meeting once. Also a big difference between asking and demanding.",

Of course try to be a helpful TA and give a decent effort, but don't be afraid to make sure the students know that you're not expected to be on call. If they can't get organized enough to ask questions during tutorials/office hours, or wait a day or so for an email reply, that's their problem.  This isn't elitist, this actually is coming from someone who was pretty disorganized as an undergrad.",

Don't be afraid of students, and definitely do not roll over when they make unreasonable or stupid demands. \n\nDefinitely don't be snarkier than you need to, and don't invite conflict. But stand up for yourself and do *not*, under any circumstances, act as a glorified customer service rep. Be clear on roles when needed. Difficult students are often not killed with kindness and need a bit of a lesson in professionalism. If ever unsure or if a student really goes off the rails, ask the prof in charge of the course.\n\nThat said, don't threaten them by hanging grades over their heads. That's just asking for trouble. Always be straight with them, but do so professionally and never as a quid pro quo.",

Plus it\u2019s just a huge hassle to be fighting this stuff so it\u2019s best to avoid it if you want a smooth experience.\n\nPeople should definitely join a union if they can, but sometimes they\u2019re not available or aren\u2019t that helpful.

          "text": "I totally agree. Setting boundaries and expectations and going over them with students is helpful. We also write in our syllabi that it can take up to 24-48 hours to respond to emails. TBH when I was an undergrad (I\u2019m 1st gen) didn\u2019t realize that TAs were students, I thought being a TA was their full-time job. I became more sympathetic when a TA explained that they were also a student and being a TA was a duty accompanying their student status.",
