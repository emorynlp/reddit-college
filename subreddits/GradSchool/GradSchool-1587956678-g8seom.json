How do you maintain a good standing with your boss/students/collaborators if you are struggling?\n\nI'm a graduating PhD student about to hold her defense in June and trying to submit one last paper mid-May, which would make the final chapter of my dissertation I am currently in the process of writing. However, I was supposed to start a full-time job as per our original agreement with the employer in April, and so that's also currently ongoing as a work-from-home situation. I constantly feel like I'm failing everyone's expectations. I also live alone, so finding it extremely difficult to work all the time without being able to change environments or at least accept some days are bad guilt-free.

Even worse, they are sometimes lies told by people who aren't really practising what they are preaching, and maybe aren't even succeeding all that much! In general, you should be trying to practise kindness towards yourself, and don't get hung up on any particular idea about what you should be doing during this immensely difficult time.\n\nThat being said, I have a few ideas. Firstly, the \"changing environments\" thing you mentioned. I also struggle with this. The commute is the time where I change my state from \"at home\" to \"at work\". If I'm in the at home state, I might be thinking a bit about taking the bins out, or cleaning the bathroom, or maybe even playing a video game or something like that. In normal times I've learned to yank myself out of the door and that helps my brain go into \"thinking about work mode\". Since you can't do this now, you have to replace it with something else. I think this is also part of why getting dressed is helpful for some people (though not for me). I find meditation is helpful, you could also try going for a walk around the block, either way try to make it a \"mental commute\". Ideally you could try to make sure the work area is differentiated from the living area.\n\nBeyond that I think it's about staying focused and setting the right goals for yourself. I personally don't find detailed timetables helpful, it usually results in a feeling of failure early in the day for me. I prefer to have one A goal which I must get done, and one B goal which I will start if I complete A (and then a hidden list of other goals that I try not to think about or see when they are not needed). Recently I saw a youtube video about this sort of thing that I thought was really interesting. I've linked it below, but the main ideas to try: 1. dopamine detox 2. setting \"remain focused through the day\" as the main goal.
