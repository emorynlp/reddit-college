I reiterate what others are suggesting about contacting the ombuds office. I also suggest that you seek some form of advice from the human rights and equity office if you are able to do so, since what you are dealing with is sexual harassment and/or other forms of harassment. I don't know whether you would want to discuss the matter confidentially or not with the person in charge in that office, however, please seek some form of advice from an office at the university on how to proceed with this issue. Also, please do not be discouraged in any way or feel that you are have to accept any type of behaviour because you have switched advisors. Please seek other advisors if you do not feel comfortable with your current one. \n\n\nI would also suggest that you keep documented proof of all communications with the lab mate and advisor. After meetings (or conversations/ phone calls) with advisors or others, send a summary of the meeting/conversation to the people that have attended the meeting, with a clause at the end saying that if there is anything that you missed in the summary, they should add it, otherwise, you are going to assume that the summary is ok.
