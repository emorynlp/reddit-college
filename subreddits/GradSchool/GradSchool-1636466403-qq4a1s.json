  "title:": "Do references need to be in order in a paper?",
  "text": "I'm writing my first review paper and in my text, my references are not mentioned in order. For example, the reference I assigned number 1 is the paper that I'm basing my entire review on. However, the first paper I actually reference in my text is number 4 as it provide the correct background for that part of my intro. One of my peer reviewers said that I have to reference all my papers in chronological order. So for example I must reference paper 1 first and once I reference paper 2, I can't go back to paper 1 because it will be out of order. To me this makes no sense. In my paper, reference 1 is the main paper covered so I reference it all throughout the entire paper at points. I feel like I should be able to reference papers wherever I need to throughout my paper as long as it makes sense in the context of what I'm writing about. I don't feel like I should be writing my paper based of chronological order of my references. But, since we're both new at writing reviews, I wanted to ask if there really is a 'correct' way to reference papers throughout your paper.",

      "text": "It depends on the journal. Most use chronological order of appearance in the paper. Some other journals prefer alphabetical enumeration of references or just defer to using the author's name + year for in-text citations.\n\nIt's a bad idea to manually number citations based on \"importance.\" You should be using a reference manager that allows you to easily change between chronological/alphabetical orderings. Otherwise, making changes can be very tedious. Sometimes journals can assist with this, too (i.e., some are lax about the submission format and will parse references on their own and apply their own formatting). Regardless, refer to the journal's recommended format or just go with chronological order to be safe.",

If you need to cite the 1st article that appears in your paper in your discussion section and your reference list is by order of appearance, you can just put \\[1\\] wherever you want to cite that article.\n\nI have never known of papers with references sorted based on \"importance\" however.\n\nIf you haven't already, get a citation manager like Mendeley or Zotero. It'll do 90% of the work for you.",
