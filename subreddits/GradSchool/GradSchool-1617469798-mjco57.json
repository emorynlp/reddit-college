  "title:": "Depressed because I have no friends in either work or grad school. How do ya'll deal with it?",
  "text": "I started my PhD back in the fall of 2019 and only had one semester of in person classes before the pandemic turned everything upside down. During that semester I tried to make friends, but it wasn't working out and it seemed like I entered the program at a time where everybody had already formed their cliques or friend groups long before I even made it to campus. Then the pandemic hit and for the next year all of my classes were virtual. Despite being able to go on campus to do research, and despite making great strides with my own research progress (I'm fortunate the pandemic hasn't set me back on that front), people in the neighboring research labs usually ignored me and only talked to me if they needed to use a piece of shared equipment. I don't think it helps one bit from a friendship standpoint that I'm my PI's only student. \n\nWe're back on campus for in person classes now, I'm fully vaccinated, and it's more or less the same situation I was dealing with during my first semester. It's been incredibly isolating. Oh, did I mention I've also been working full time during my PhD? It's in the same field as my PhD and my job is paying for part of it so it's manageable. But, it leaves very little time outside of school to try and find friends. I'm not exactly close with any of my coworkers either, and they're all older than me with the next youngest coworker being older than me by at least 10 years\n\nMy schedule is basically like this: Mon-Fri I work from 7:00am to 3:00pm. Depending on the day of the week, I either have classes at night or I'll go into the lab right after work to do my research. Saturday's and Sunday's I usually keep free to myself and either exercise (I'm a long distance runner, that's really the only type of exercise I enjoy) or just watch netflix/browse reddit, but occasionally I end up either studying or going into the lab to finish an experiment. \n\nI feel like I am wasting my 20s away (I'm 28, only 2 years of that left) by not hanging out with friends or doing more exciting things. It never used to be a problem for some reason, but lately the fact that I have no friends has started becoming progressively more depressing. I'm engaged to be married (and I won't have a best man lol), but my fiancee is also in grad school and has her own stresses to worry about; I would feel massively guilty piling my feelings like this on top of what she's going through (that isn't to say we don't emotionally support each other). Ultimately, work and school is sucking up the majority of my time. I\u2019m depressed, anxious, and lonely. \n\n/vent\n\nEDIT: I posted this and left reddit for the day and didn't expect to come back to such an overwhelming response! Thank you to the majority of you who posted helpful advice. It truly means a lot.",

Eventually, I just gave up and tried to make friends with other lonely international students, but even those are hard to hang out with because we can't meet in groups of more than four people and I live with my boyfriend. This is not at all the experience I moved here for and I am still mourning that, but I just don't have the energy to keep trying to make friends with people that don't really want to be my friend. Can't wait to graduate and hopefully get a job that will allow me to socialize more post COVID.",

Majority of the time I do things alone and this pandemic did not help. I was limited of places to go, so I just hung out at my apartment or went on walks. Coworkers were toxic and competitive for no reason, so I backed off trying to build friendships with them. \n\nMy advice, join some kind of community (yoga & gym) some kind of small club that you can make friends with. I know it sucks, but once you have your freedom again, you\u2019ll be able to have more time with people who knows what you\u2019ve went through. I felt that me being in graduate school pushed people away because they thought I was too good to be there friend or made them uncomfortable. It\u2019s weird.",

I found out people who I thought were solid friends/acquaintances were saying very unkind things about me behind my back. People who I thought were reliable friends didn't take covid prevention measures seriously and forced me into risky situations without my consent. I can only validate that it's rough. I hope as things open up we'll be able to find new friends!",

I'll be in the Anthropology department, but my PI's lab in it is brand new and not anthro based (mammal paleoecology instead). Since my research will be different from that of the other grad students, I'm worried about making friends. I'm hoping I can make a friend with my PI at least since we'll both be the same age and working on the same stuff, but it's always nice to make friends with people in your cohort.\n\nI'll be turning 31 this year. I took a break between high school and undergrad because I didn't know how to go and do the college thing. Then I spent 6 years in undergrad, mostly just trying to catch up on all the science/math/english classes I needed to take. The last year there, I finally made some friends in my Geology department, and we all still talk today... but the age difference makes me feel like I'm not truly part of that group. Then I went straight into a Masters program across the country (US). I bonded well with the other grad students in my cohort, but since I was the only woman in the program I really felt left out. I wasn't invited to most of the hikes and group outings from the get-go, whereas the guys who started with me were instantly invited from day 1. We had our 1st semester in person, but then the pandemic hit. Now I'll be graduating this semester and I feel left out of the friendships I made while here. While I feel like like others in my cohort are good friends, I don't think anyone truly feels the same towards me... like I'm just a person they have to interact with. I only have one best friend in my life and he's my bf. We've been together for about 14 years now and we've been best buddies since high school. Other than that, I feel like I have no one else. I also feel like I'm no one's best friend. It's very lonely and I feel like I should start talking less to the people in my cohort and stop trying.\n\nI'm worried this will all just be repeated throughout my PhD. maybe I'm just not good at making friends.",

For me I just spent more time doing other things I love such as fishing, working out, and even trying to find a new hobby/outlet or even taking up a hobby or two I haven't touched in years.  \n\n\nGrad school is tough, and keeping a social life is tough. This doesn't get easier as we get older and get more into our field and our careers. So you need to find some hobbies and other activities because they inevitably lead to you being able to meet new people, or at minimum get more interaction with people. I'm about to be 28 and starting my grad program in September, and I  graduated from Uni at 27 so I've always been ion the odd man out category of making friends at uni(a 21 year old doesn't want to hang out with a 27 year old, and a 27 year old doesn't want to spend time with anybody under 21). I personally just got more into fishing, photography, and even doing sports/lifting more during the pandemic which has allowed me to either make new friends or reconnect with old.  \n\n\nI would say at absolute worse, if you can balance it with everything else, maybe get a part time job. Something that is one or two days a week for 8 to 16h a week at most. It will force you to interact with people, and gives a bit of a distraction from the day to day.",

The vast majority wanted to spend their time with other students who speak their home language.\n\nThis was as an international student myself (from Japan, not religious, very few other Japanese international students around), trying to make friends with international students from other countries. In general I found locals to be way more open and interested in interacting with me.",

I'm an Asian international student and from what I've observed in many groups, the reason why many don't want to mingle with locals is because they are often isolated by locals whenever they try to cross racial boundaries. I speak perfect English with no accent, but in my current institution, people are very cliquish and don't show any enthusiasm to make friendships with international students. This has been the experience of many international students of my ethnicity I talked with.",

I also make sure to find free, easy things that make me happy. I bird watch, watch the trees blow in the wind, I get fresh air when I can... anything healthy like that for a drop of serotonin or dopamine or whatever lol \n\nIt\u2019s several different things to help me get through these rough times but i think a good reminder is that this pain is temporary and trying to feel fulfilled without much of a social life is really important.",

Running is also one of the few things that makes me feel better. I just turned 25. My support system is non-existent. \n\nI'm going through a tough time: I've been struggling with depression/anxiety for a while and kind of just \"snapped\" a few weeks ago. I have zero energy left to give. I physically cannot focus on work. I cannot meet my normal grad school responsibilities right now. Strong s\\*\\*\\*\\*dal thoughts and all that. My therapist tells me that it's my body's way of signaling that I need to address the things that are causing me pain. Now in my 20's is the first time in my life that I've actually had the space, mental capacity, and resources to confront the things that are causing me pain (childhood emotional neglect, distorted beliefs about what makes me worthy as a person, a past abusive relationship, social anxiety, etc.). Better to address it fully now, uncomfortable as it may be, then to spend all of my 30's depressed too. I'm going to start medication soon and ask for accommodations, with my therapist's help.\n\nMy point in telling you all of that is to encourage you to seek professional help now, rather than later when some mildly stressful event suddenly makes everything too overwhelming to deal with. Your lifestyle is unhealthy. Something needs to change. You're devoting all of your mental energy into work and it's only a matter of time before that stops being sustainable. I'm guessing you also have baggage that would be in your best interests to stop ignoring. Your grad program/work doesn't own your soul or dictate your identity. It will be okay to take a step back.",

You shouldn't make monumental life changing decisions while you're in this state. You should request a leave of absence from your program and use this time to work on you. That PhD program will still be there (probably, if you have a good PI and advisor who actually cares for you) when you come back in half a year or one year. You're self aware enough to realize that you're not functioning properly, and that should become your priority right now. It's not the end of the world to step back from your responsibilities. You also have a responsibility to yourself, to care for yourself, just like you would if you stepped in glass, you'd stop walking to get it out and clean it and heal. You clearly have wounds and you need to take some time to treat them.",

Unable to make new friends in the program because of schedule issues (working all day then being in night classes until 9 or 10 pm almost every day).\n\nIt's rough, there's no secret magic though to fixing it. I started to have panic attacks and other things. Went to the doc because my significant other was wordy I was having some sort of cardiac issue. Turned out I had some major depression and anxiety issues. I worked with my doc to address those.\n\nOnce they got addressed I found it way easier to make friends with people, connect, etc. Anyways, this is a long way of saying do what you have to do you can take care of your mental health. There's nothing wrong with asking for help or needing medicine. You're doing way better than I was (I was forcing myself to work weekends because I was trying to maintain the same productivity I had when I just had a job). \n\nTake care of yourself and do what's best for you! I know that's easier said than done.",
