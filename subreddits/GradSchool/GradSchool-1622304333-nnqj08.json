  "text": "Wanted to create a thread for my fellow grad students with ADHD, so that we can share tips for success with one another. Here are some of mine:\n\n1. The most important thing is creating a routine that works for you. Don\u2019t stress yourself out by comparing yourself to those who are seemingly capable of studying all day. Instead, pride yourself on establishing a routine, as that is quite hard to do in our position.\n\n2. In line with not stressing yourself out by comparing yourself with your peers, create a goal of self-improvement that works for you. For instance, if you can only manage to get through 30 pages of a difficult piece of literature during a day, try to work your way towards reading 40 pages per day and be proud of every step you take which gets you closer to that goal.\n\n3. Make sure to take your psychiatrist seriously. If they say you should take your medication at a certain time in the day, do it. If they suggest you should be sleeping better, try to improve your sleep. Ideally, your psychiatrist has your health, well-being, and success in mind (if they don\u2019t, find one who does).\n\n4. Find at least one or two members of your department who understand your situation, especially if they are your supervisor(s). Nothing can be more stressful than feeling as though nobody around you empathizes with what you have to go through.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it there. Drop more advice in the comments, or any topics you need advice on. Hopefully we can help someone who needs it. :)\n\nEdit: because this post blew up, I have created a Discord server where this topic\u2014and other mental health concerns, study advice, etc\u2014can be discussed. https://discord.gg/5FTuezB9n6",

Right now I'm just trying to practice meditation for 5 minutes a day. \n\n There are some really helpful apps for this, the most popular currently is called Headspace. I've tried they're free trial, and it was great. \n\nIf you (like me) don't want to pay, there's a free app that was developed for the US VA (military healthcare system), but anyone can use. It's called \"Mindfulness Coach\". I've been using it for awhile, and while it seems less flashy than Headspace, it's got a ton of great stuff to start and grow your mindfulness practice.",

I've found that setting a timer for, say, 10 minutes and giving myself a required number of pages to get done in that time can get me into a flow. I do this repeatedly (no breaks, just different time and page requirements) until I'm done. \n\nAn accountability group has helped with imposter syndrome and remembering long term tasks. We meet once a week, just a few of us, and go over our goals for the week and struggles and successes from the previous week. It reminds me that *no one* is a constant productivity machine and we all forget things. I just forget things a little differently than my peers lol. \n\nFor scheduling, I can get really overwhelmed and paralyzed by to do lists, so I stack my tasks on flashcards. On the front is the task,  which I can breakup however I need as described above. On the back is a non-academic task or something small and fun (e.g. wash 5 dishes, play outside with the dog, make some fancy tea). I have this on an open face planner with my weekly tasks/goals and a big post-it that serves as a catch-all for random ideas while I work. I jot them down to address once I've finished out the timer to address later, keeping me on task. This doesn't work every day, of course, but on the days it works I can knock out an insane amount of work pretty painlessly.",

No motivation to read a paper or add to your literature review? Find articles and make a read later pile.\n2. Importantly, be more careful with your time. I've started reading the \"methods\" section of papers following the abstract to ensure they align with my research. A qualitative study with 5 participants is lower priority than a similar study with 50 participants, and a quantitative study is even better than that.\n\nGetting motivation is difficult enough, you hate to use it on less than useful tasks.",

I imagine what works for you may change over the course of several years so when do you know to change things up versus try to stick with it?",
