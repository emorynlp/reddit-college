Here are some of mine:\n\n1. The most important thing is creating a routine that works for you. Don\u2019t stress yourself out by comparing yourself to those who are seemingly capable of studying all day. Instead, pride yourself on establishing a routine, as that is quite hard to do in our position.\n\n2. In line with not stressing yourself out by comparing yourself with your peers, create a goal of self-improvement that works for you. For instance, if you can only manage to get through 30 pages of a difficult piece of literature during a day, try to work your way towards reading 40 pages per day and be proud of every step you take which gets you closer to that goal.\n\n3. Make sure to take your psychiatrist seriously. If they say you should take your medication at a certain time in the day, do it. If they suggest you should be sleeping better, try to improve your sleep. Ideally, your psychiatrist has your health, well-being, and success in mind (if they don\u2019t, find one who does).\n\n4. Find at least one or two members of your department who understand your situation, especially if they are your supervisor(s). Nothing can be more stressful than feeling as though nobody around you empathizes with what you have to go through.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it there. Drop more advice in the comments, or any topics you need advice on. Hopefully we can help someone who needs it. :)\n\nEdit: because this post blew up, I have created a Discord server where this topic\u2014and other mental health concerns, study advice, etc\u2014can be discussed. https://discord.gg/5FTuezB9n6", "author": "owlsandbooks", "created": 1622304333, "retrieved": 1632953907, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 372, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"hb6okxr": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/nnqj08/grad_students_with_adhd/hb6okxr/", "text": "I am a supposed-to-be-finishing Ph.D. who has pushed her very lovely supervisors to serious grumpiness.

On the front is the task,  which I can breakup however I need as described above. On the back is a non-academic task or something small and fun (e.g. wash 5 dishes, play outside with the dog, make some fancy tea). I have this on an open face planner with my weekly tasks/goals and a big post-it that serves as a catch-all for random ideas while I work.

Always do something. No motivation to read a paper or add to your literature review? Find articles and make a read later pile.\n2. Importantly, be more careful with your time. I've started reading the \"methods\" section of papers following the abstract to ensure they align with my research.
