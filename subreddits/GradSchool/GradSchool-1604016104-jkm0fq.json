          "text": "Huge congrats!! I just read your post and totally could relate to the \"doing nothing\" part. There were months (probably more than a year, tbh) of my PhD when I did nothing due to extremely poor mental health. I got to the point where I had actually made up my mind about dropping out and even spoke with my lab mates about how to break the news to my advisor, but I never followed through with it. Ultimately I decided that even if I never did science again in my life (which was how I was feeling at that time), having a PhD could still open a lot of doors for me while pursuing other things and that it was worth it to try to finish. I eventually got to a better place with mental health from changing up a few things (although full disclosure: the current status is not great due to the pandemic...), defended in August 2019, and now have an NSF postdoc grant. Wanted to share my story that it can get better.",

I finished my masters in august and have felt really down with how much of a learning curve this is for me. I hope I can make it out of this semester successfully to move on to the next. This is really encouraging to read this. Glad to be a part of this online community.",
