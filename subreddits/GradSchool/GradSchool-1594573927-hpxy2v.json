Currently my University is only allowing 2 people per lab at a time for those approved to return. There's currently 3 students in my lab so the one closest to finishing gets all day while the other person and I get 4 hour shifts. My ability to get things done is now cut in half and I'm worried that when all the undergrads return there's going to be another shut down. I'm in a state that originally was doing good and now we're surging since everyone thought green meant the virus magically dissapeared. \n\nThere's no way they can keep all the students in line. So far the plan is to do a hybrid method of online and in person, but I have little faith in that. There's not enough staff to sanitize each room after classes, we either have giant halls or the smallest conference rooms, and can we really believe that students are going to take their \"mandatory daily community wellness oath\" seriously and leave the mask on *correctly* at all times until they get back to their dorm? Plus they're told they can't leave, but seeing that most of them are local or close enough to wherever they came from they go home every weekend, I doubt it'll be enforced. \n\nWe have to teach all 5 years as part of our contracts to get paid. Right now I feel okay-ish because I only really work with one other person that I know has been isolating this whole time and we're both real good about sanitizing, mask wearing, and washing up after our shifts. But when I have to teach a whole lab of kids multiple days a week? I'm nervous that I could either get sick and get sent home, or the lab gets shut down because one member could pass it on to the others and all work stops again, OR I take it home and potentially give it to someone that is compromised. \n\nPeople in the department are at 2 extremes: super worried about everyone coming back -or- \"they're young and can handle it\". You'd think in a science based department we'd be a little better at handling this. I know it's selfish, but I was told if this didn't happen I would have graduated a semester early. Now I'm worried about having to stay an extra semester or even a year + possibly having/passing on a deadly disease. Part of me just wants to wait for the 2 papers I have in the works to be published and then duck out with a masters thesis so I don't have to be involved in the major dumpster fire that is about to be college campuses, but I feel like I'd be throwing so much away. \n\nSorry if this is a long ramble. Everyone around me is acting like it'll be fine and I feel a little on edge about it.\n\nTL;DR: Undergrads are supposed to return to campus.

Schools will have deaths on their hands by allowing campuses to re-open, even under whatever \u201csafety\u201d protocols they want to enact. My university is intending to allow 700 students back to campus and making all dorms single-occupancy. Despite this, I highly doubt undergrads will social distance or wear masks when socializing outside of campus or after classes. Coronavirus cases will spike because of this and the risk of re-opening the school under current outbreak conditions is too great. Had we social distanced once states started to re-open or controlled outbreaks by tracking infected cases I\u2019d be much more comfortable with going back. I\u2019ve petitioned my school to remain off campus during the fall but since I TA I highly doubt it\u2019ll get approved. It was really more of a political move on my part to add just that much more pressure on the school to remain closed, no matter how small my voice may be due to my status as a grad student.\n\n/U Captain_Of_All, my heart goes out to all international students that are forced to endure the political moves and whims of our president. I believe that the supreme court will declare this unconstitutional. Additionally, many universities are creating options like 1 credit courses that will be held \u201con-campus\u201d even though there may not actually be any meeting times or sessions. Other universities are preparing lawsuits to fight this unjust and racially charged mandate. I doubt that it will hold up, rather I believe Trump is trying to shore up his base by inciting class rage and distrust in the \u201cintelligencia\u201d of our country due to this year being an election year. The more he can declare life has returned to \u201cnormal\u201d, the better his odds are of winning the election; one of the reasons why he included his name on stimulus checks.\n\nUltimately, the risks of returning to campus should not be worth the reward. I\u2019m going to grad school to further my career goals, not hinder them. If I can\u2019t get out of bed or have trouble walking around the block or have long-term memory issues then who the fuck is that helping? As much as I want to return to campus, continue my research, and get grad school over with, I can\u2019t accept the risks associated with it, and neither should anyone be required to risk their lives in this way just so some undergrads can \u201chave the college experience\u201d. The world is fucked right now and we all need to accept that nothing is going the way we want. But if we\u2019re patient and react as new data arrise, say for a vaccine to come out, or for cases to drop, like they did in Europe, then maybe we can start to claw our way back to some sort of normal life.\n\nI wrote way more than I intended but this has been a huge point of anxiety and stress for me.\n\nBest of luck with everything OP and most importantly, take care of your health, now more than ever.", "author": "nothing_to_be", "created": 1594578685, "upvotes": 113}, "fxuiw00": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hpxy2v/is_anyone_else_worried_about_the_return_of/fxuiw00/", "text": "On the contrary, I am more worried about undergrads not being able to come back at my university since they announced only seniors will be coming back.
