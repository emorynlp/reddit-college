  "text": "I was in class learning about eigenvalues and singular values, and I raised my hand to ask a question, I guess the question was very stupid, because the teacher answered with another question back to me, which I couldn't answer, he realized I was very confused, the he asked another one, which I couldn't answer either, then he said \"This next thing I am going to ask determines wheter you should be in this program or not\", I don't even remember the exact formulation of the question, but it was about diferential calculus, when I couldn't answer he asked the class to help me, and someone said that it could be found with a derivative.  \n\n\nI was already feeling like I am very fucking stupid around here, thing is, I was at the top of my class when I did my undergrad, but I come from a small university in Mexico, and, I have been working at a factory as an Engineer for the last 4 years since I graduated, because I needed to save money if I wanted to keep studying, and when I was working I didn't need calculus or anything related, so naturally I forgot a lot of concepts, now I am here, doing a masters in Automation and Robotic in Europe, for which I somehow got a scholarship, but I can't help to feel like I am a failure, that I shouldn't be here.  \n   \nI know I should stop whining and instead of writing this I should just start reading and studying these concepts that I have forgotten, but I needed to vent.",

I couldn\u2019t see a damn thing. \n\nThere is absolutely ZERO reason why your professor should have done this. It\u2019s not up to them on whether you are good enough for the program. I taught AP Literature and we had tons of kids signing up for it that truly shouldn\u2019t have. But I still had some of those kids that gave it their all and fought tooth and nail on everything I gave them. Sometimes that\u2019s what matters most. I\u2019d rather have a not so great student doing their absolute best over a conceited student whose test scores say they\u2019re great for AP. \n\nIdk if there\u2019s something that makes professors hate their job or if it\u2019s an inflated idea of \u201cbeing harder\u201d on students bc they\u2019re adults or in grad school.

I was so insulted by every single one of their announcements. I chewed them out on their evals and didn't feel any remorse for it. \n\nI was super shy as an undergrad and always afraid to reach out to professors for help. Now that I am also an educator, I have no shame in it!

Especially for mathematics, there are lots of tutorials on the internet (I'm currently using Khan Academy to brush up on some advanced math in prep for a seminar and it's helped a lot).\n\nAnd last, imposter syndrome is crappy, but a lot of us go through it in grad school (this sub is proof).

      "text": "Even professionals and people that we look up to in our fields don\u2019t remember everything that they learned. Truth is we all forget concepts that we don\u2019t apply every single day. Just because you didn\u2019t know how to answer a question does not mean that you don\u2019t belong in your program. \n\nYour teacher should not be teaching if he does not have patience to TEACH. That\u2019s his main role and he failed to do it. \n\nYou came from a small school and now you\u2019re there in that program that you once dreamt of being a part of. You are there and whatever conditions you had to face to get there, got you there. \n\nFocus on finishing and improving yourself! Forget those people that make you feel small. Just focus on your goals and yourself. I know the feeling sucks when someone who is supposed to be an expert in the field calls you out like that. My \u201cmentor\u201d who is the head of the department at my university also told me that he didn\u2019t think that the I\u2019m \u201cfit\u201d for the program that I was in. His words affected me and my performance while I was there, but I can\u2019t blame him because I\u2019m responsible for how I react. That was his opinion of me and that\u2019s not my opinion of myself. However, as my \u201cmentor\u201d I obviously looked up to him at the time so his words carried weight. \n\nAnyways, just keep moving and don\u2019t let this get to you. Make yourself proud and keep learning and keep going for what you want. People who are improving themselves will often feel like a failure and will often go through a lot of failures because they are learning. Failure and feeling like one is part of the process to growth\u2026..unfortunately. But it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t lift yourself up! Cheer for yourself and enjoy the process of growth. \ud83e\udd73",

      "text": "Your professor doesn't know anything about teaching and sadly that's how most universities work. You just cannot judge/assess what a student knows or not based on one single random question posed in class (where you are totally exposed), let alone judge whether they are qualified or not to be in grad school. There are many reasons why a student does not answer correctly in class. His opinion is a moo opinion, because he's evidently not qualified to assess students (even if it is part of their job). Just because someone happens to be an expert in some field, that does not qualify them to teach. Usually professors are made professors because of how much they publish or how many grad students they have or how much funding they are able to raise. But, when all's said and done, they don't know anything about teaching itself, so they make the most ridiculous mistakes. I am sick and tired of people having the misconception that anyone can teach. No, they can't. And only people who are actually qualified to teach can see how much they suck at it. That being said, I think it is a really good idea to study some more. Don't let professors like this tell you what you should do about your life. You could also tell them that they should not be teaching and, unlike your professor, you would not be wrong!!!",

Regardless of what the professor believes you are capable of and what the program entry requirements are, you deserve to be treated with respect. Take time to be upset because you should!

Work hard and show your professor that you are capable and deserving to be there, but also maintain that sense of self respect and self worth.",

I'm also in grad school (master) in Europe and come from Mexico. I was lacking a lot of knowledge from my undergrad as well and was also top of my class on my undergrad. Honestly, I had to learn a lot of things from scratch and it took a lot of work. Don't give up! I had to learn about differential and multivariate calculus because I was supposed to know all those things, but I never had a class teaching me that in my undergrad.\n\nI can tell you that they make it seem more difficult than it is and that you can totally learn all you need. You're not stupid, you're just lacking some knowledge and that's ok! We might not have had a very good education as some others did, but now you have the opportunity to learn and you should take it. Don't let rude people bring you down, in the end you can make it work. I'm focusing on robotics on my degree as well, so if you ever want to talk dont hesitate to send me a message (:",

The Prof is stupid, obviously if you got into the program you're good enough for it. I'm sure you'll pass this class and you will laugh at this memory. Good luck!",
