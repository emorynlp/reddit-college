  "text": "First time poster! I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of if I am wasting my time.\n\nI graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Communication in 2017 from a state school in New England. For four years I\u2019ve been working in the field, doing pretty well for myself.\n\nI don\u2019t want to doxx myself, so I will just say I currently work full time in digital advertising for an Ivy League school in the Northeast and I am considering applying to their Masters in American Studies program.\n\nIt would be a dream to say I got my masters from this school, but here\u2019s the kicker: my GPA from undergrad is a 2.9. It\u2019s so frustrating because my dad died right before I graduated and my last few semesters I let things slip which has really put me in a bad position.\n\nI want honesty, so don\u2019t worry about hurting my feelings. Am I wasting my time by applying? Is the fact that I\u2019m a full time employee of the university enough to look past my horrible GPA? Can my personal statement and recommendation letters save me?\n\nThank you in advance!!",
