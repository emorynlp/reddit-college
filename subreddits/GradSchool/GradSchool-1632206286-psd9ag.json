  "text": "i\u2019m a future biology teacher who is student teaching this semester. This requires me to have lesson plans ready while staying on top of the work load of 3 courses. I am incapable of managing my time to the level necessary. Starting this semester I have been doing exponentially better at turning in quality work and starting Some things in advance, but I just cannot make it consistent. I have executive dysfunction so terrible that I struggle to feed myself and starve every day, partly because I don\u2019t have time. \n\nI know that I need to make a strict schedule to get work done daily. I know education is what I want to do and I am passionate about it. But most of my last three years of college has been spent doing everything at the last minute right before or after the deadline, constantly apologizing to professors for it, and I hardly make it to class on time. somehow I have made it through a B student so far, thus never really learning my lesson. I go through cycles of great work for a few days and then horrible burn out where I can\u2019t do anything if I tried.\n\nI don\u2019t know what kind of advice can be given to someone who\u2019s brain refuses to plan ahead and put in the work consistently, but even just some words of encouragement would be great.\n\n(I am trying to see my psychiatrist to see if I can get on better ADHD or depression meds and I do have a therapist though i\u2019m not sure how helpful she is)",

      "text": "You can develop time management skills to a certain point, but even after that you will find that you have a limit to what you can actually accomplish. \n\nOnce you have identified where that limit lies, you simply have to say no to stuff that exceeds it. That's where prioritizing comes in, and the habit of firmly but kindly declining additional work no matter who suggests it. \"That is not something I can take on now, given my other responsibilities. It sounds like a great idea, though, and I really encourage you to pursue it.\"",

      "text": "A combination of a chronic medical issue, panic disorder, and generally having survived this far without having been kicked out of school has me in a similar situation.\n\nSince I *know* that I'm very deadline-motivated, I keep my pace going by setting more frequent, but more minor, deadlines. For example, I deliberately space out my research meetings so that I'm delivering 2-3 updates per week (not all to the same audience) on my work.",

      "text": "I am a list person. Trello (website) helps me a bit with managing everything. It takes a bit of getting used to but you can label different things and have different lists on the same page (for example, each class has their own list) and you can set deadlines for each activity. \n\nOr you can do a master list of all the things and then separate it by day or make a general \"shit to do toda\" list. I find that I organize better when i can see it all. As for making yourself manage time, try to give yourself a schedule like \"from 12-1 lunch, from 1-2 emails, 2-3 pressing things\". For me, it's segmenting everything.",
