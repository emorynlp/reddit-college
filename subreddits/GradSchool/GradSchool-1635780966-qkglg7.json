  "text": "Is there any programs or software that really helped out during your work as a graduate student? I'm thinking like things that sort and hold papers you download, things that help you keep track of notes and highlights from papers with annotations, so on and so forth. General quality of life stuff too. I'm curious about what people typically already use before jumping in myself. For reference, this is my first semester of a PhD after graduating from undergrad this May. Thanks in advance!",

I do a large amount of data workup and image analysis, so having scripts to automatically do tedious and time consuming portions really helps. \n\nOthers I would recommend: \nNextcloud, I run a NAS at home along with automated backups. Also use nextcloud as my calendar. For a good backup solution, I use rclone to gdrive since as a student you get 5TB free from google.\n\nZotero for citation and paper management \n\nAn RSS reader for new papers from journals I like, I use TTRSS\n\nJoplin for notes and lists\n\nVinkunja for todo lists\n\nA good browser, I like Vivaldi. Allows for a built in email client, rss reader, calendar, and note taking.\n\nEDIT: paperless-ng for digitizing notes and documents.",

My whole work and classes schedule is in there as well.\n* I used Trello for a hot minute during grad school, it was great to organize info for each subject and to organize references for papers. A lot of people say great things about Notion, but I haven't tried it yet.\n* Finally got myself a fitbit to track sleep, physical activity and such\n\nGetting organized is a mesh of techniques and tools. There are so many, so my main advice is to start with something simple (whatever that is for you!) and go from there. There's some trial and error to go through. I never felt comfortable using some popular reference managers and still managed to find a way to keep my work streamlined and organized.",

It seriously changed my life.\n\nMy first year of grad school (after being out of school for nearly a decade) I really struggled with the feeling that i constantly had something i should be working on. It made it difficult for me to invest time in self care and relationships and I felt guilty when I did. Now, once a week, i sit down and map out all my readings and assignments for the week and assign them to different days. That way when I finish my to do list for that day, i can enjoy my free time guilt free. It's made my second year of grad school so much more manageable.",

      "text": "I really like the suggestions here for a programming language. VS Code plugins are pretty nice for building up your own custom workflows if you use a lot of markdown or text files.\n\nI'm particularly fond of text based solutions and open source software for my workflow.\n\nLanguages:\n\nPython or R or Julia - depending upon your use case. General purpose or machine learning (Python), lots of statistics and mathematical modelling (R), wanting to learn an up and coming language or add another to your toolkit and aren't concerned about a smaller package ecosystem? (Julia).\n\nBash - just the command line (CLI) more generally.\n\nLinux - I think scientists or engineers in particular have the potential to fall in love with linux. If you understand the broader UNIX philosophy and embrace the attitude of exploration and learning, then desktop linux is great for getting things done. If you come in expecting macOS or windows, you won't be happy. It's a different way to use a computer.\n\nNote-taking:\n\nZim desktop wiki - really nice for just taking notes and organising your thoughts for lit reviews etc. \n\nDendron (VS Code plugin) - started using a little recently. Still being developed but has some nice features.\n\nRMarkdown - if you use R, you should use R Markdown.\n\nReference manager:\n\nZotero - there's a zotero plugin for Zim, for all browsers, and often for a lot of open source or free notetaking apps. I bought a zotero subscription for the extra storage and to support the project. It's so good and so easy to use.\n\nPlasmid Viewers/Cloning Platforms:\n\nBenchling - recently switched to benchling (online, free) from SnapGene and haven't missed any features of SnapGene. Benchling is great for collaboration as well and it's really easy to get AddGene sequences.\n\nProject Management:\nTaskwarrior - CLI based project management software that is just awesome. By default it has a GTD type workflow, but it's easily editable.\n\nBoosted (mobile, Android) - Time tracking app to monitor time spent on different aspects of my project.\n\nImage Analysis/Management:\n\nInkscape - vector graphics\n\nGimp - Photoshop like image editor\n\nFIJI - for biological image formats particularly",
