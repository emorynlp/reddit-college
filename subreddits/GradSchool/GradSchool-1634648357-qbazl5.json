  "text": "I\u2019m overwhelmed and miserable. Ever since the pandemic has started life has gotten worse. I\u2019m so stressed and worried all of the time. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to finish my degree because I\u2019m running out of money.  I took a break from school so now I\u2019m in between semesters and I\u2019m running out of money. I can\u2019t work because of COVID-19. My mom, whom I live with, is very vulnerable to the virus. So I cannot work because I live with her. I have been struggling to get a masters degree for seven years! Seven whole years! I am running behind on my reading and studying! I think I have adhd which makes it harder for me to focus and study. This is why it\u2019s taken me so long to finish school. I have so much credit card debt and debt from the irs. I have considered getting a job online but I don\u2019t know what job I could get because I lack skills. All of these factors in life, have caused me to become suicidal. I don\u2019t have any immediate plans but I think about suicide every day. I feel like I hate my life and I hate myself. I\u2019m tired of struggling. My family is threatening to kick me out if I don\u2019t finish graduate school. They are tired of me living with them because we always fight and argue about how long it is going to take me to finish school. I really wish I could get myself together but it\u2019s so hard. Most of the time  I wish I didn\u2019t exist.",

      "text": "Ok, first of all, please find someone to talk to about this. Second of all, if you\u2019re worried about paying for things, student loans are a better option than credit card debt (assuming you racked it up covering expenses during your program). Third of all, I\u2019d talk to hour advisor about what you need to do to finish. Fourth of all, I\u2019d ask someone about getting evaluated for adhd if you think you have it.",

I thought I had it bad\u2026then Covid happened and I see so many in your shoes and wonder how in the heck they will survive and what they will do.  It\u2019s so terrible.  My heart goes out to you.\n\nHave you talked to your advisor? Grad director?  Dean of students?\n\nAlso like do what you can but know this isn\u2019t the end of the road.  Sometimes the best breads take the longest to rise and bake.  Time being important is a construct.",

Neither are administrators.\n\nNow good ones will end up referring someone to campus counseling services. But then someone posting here may not confess as much to them either. So best to always encourage people to directly see campus counseling help.",
