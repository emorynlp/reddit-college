  "text": "I\u2019m overwhelmed and miserable. Ever since the pandemic has started life has gotten worse. I\u2019m so stressed and worried all of the time. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to finish my degree because I\u2019m running out of money.  I took a break from school so now I\u2019m in between semesters and I\u2019m running out of money. I can\u2019t work because of COVID-19. My mom, whom I live with, is very vulnerable to the virus. So I cannot work because I live with her. I have been struggling to get a masters degree for seven years! Seven whole years! I am running behind on my reading and studying! I think I have adhd which makes it harder for me to focus and study. This is why it\u2019s taken me so long to finish school. I have so much credit card debt and debt from the irs. I have considered getting a job online but I don\u2019t know what job I could get because I lack skills. All of these factors in life, have caused me to become suicidal. I don\u2019t have any immediate plans but I think about suicide every day. I feel like I hate my life and I hate myself. I\u2019m tired of struggling. My family is threatening to kick me out if I don\u2019t finish graduate school. They are tired of me living with them because we always fight and argue about how long it is going to take me to finish school. I really wish I could get myself together but it\u2019s so hard. Most of the time  I wish I didn\u2019t exist.",

      "text": "Ok, first of all, please find someone to talk to about this. Second of all, if you\u2019re worried about paying for things, student loans are a better option than credit card debt (assuming you racked it up covering expenses during your program). Third of all, I\u2019d talk to hour advisor about what you need to do to finish. Fourth of all, I\u2019d ask someone about getting evaluated for adhd if you think you have it.",

Neither are administrators.\n\nNow good ones will end up referring someone to campus counseling services. But then someone posting here may not confess as much to them either. So best to always encourage people to directly see campus counseling help.",

              "text": "Great, glad you agree that professors aren\u2019t mental health professionals.  However profs can help you manage your graduate career, such as facilitating progress, give time off as needed, and help\nmentor someone professionally.  Clearly and obviously asking for help from a mental health professional is important and goes without saying.  We currently live in a society where access to mental healthcare is expanding and people know how to get help.  What my comment was addressing was the workload and what the professor can help with.  I also was close with my PI and he actually helped\nMe not overwork, which was my weakness.  Connecting with a professor, a good one, will be a great support while going through graduate school.  With professors, you don\u2019t need to tell them what\u2019s up, but you do need to use them to help facilitate success.  So say someone is overwhelmed, communicate it, ask for help managing the work load.  A good mental health care provider will also advocate for self advocacy.  Anyway.",

You CAN continue your MS just take out a loan for the final .....year? how much would you need for grad student housing (usually pretty damn cheap) and board plus a bit and apply for a federal loan and move on or close to campus. Perhaps you need to cut the cord with your family during this last part of studies.",
