I had to withdraw from a phd program earlier with only 3 semesters in, due to my unsupportive PI. Due to my visa restrictions, I did not have any choice. I don't have any publication but I do have research experience. I am 29 years old international student.\n\nDo you think a PhD in Molecular & Cellular Biology in these universities are out of league for me? What are your experiences in applying for these universities? I highly appreciate your responses.", "author": "Glutenfreegem", "created": 1632843923, "retrieved": 1632951961, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {}}
