  "title:": "I successfully defended today. PhD",
  "text": "And passed with no revisions. I questioned if I belonged in academia 2 years ago when I had an injuy that was hard to recover from and had an awful advisor. \n\nHe left for another position and I got a second chance with my committee. And had the support and mentorship that finally made me feel like I was where I belonged. \n\nRemember when you had a milestone birthday, and people would ask you if you feel different? \nI do feel different. It really does feel different. If you are lucky enough to be in a field you love - stick with it. Part of grad school is the bullshit you have to put up with. The work with no credit. The academic bullying. Take that with you, and when you are the mentor you can be the type  of mentor you wish you'd had. \n",

It is a wonderful achievement. :) \n\nI really hope my experience starts to mirror yours. I'm finishing my MA in the coming months. I've been coping with a terrible supervisor/some health issues, and it really discouraging me and making things terribly hard. I've been hoping things turn around when I start my PhD next year with a new supervisor. So its nice to hear people who have actually had good experienes! :) ",
