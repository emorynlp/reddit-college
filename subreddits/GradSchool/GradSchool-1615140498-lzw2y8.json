I live with the same issues, so I thought I\u2019d share what helps me cope.\n\nAnd that is: think of the type of person that you want to be.\n\nDo you want to be someone that works 16 hours a day, 7 days a week and has no close non-academic relationships? Or do you want to be someone that works hard and has fulfilling friendships and hobbies on the side?\n\nDo you want to be someone that can only talk about their area of study? Or do you want to have interesting conversations with people about a variety of topics? On that note, do you want to have diverse knowledge and experiences?\n\nThis sort of reasoning helps me when I feel like I don\u2019t have the time to take breaks.

Don't let friends with 9-to-5 jobs guilt you into doing a lazy PhD. Your PhD is a very unique time for you to really focus in 100% into becoming the world expert in your very particular topic, and it's entirely fine to embrace it. Just, as OP said, do it under your terms to achieve your goals, and make sure your work is not motivated by the \"rat race\" parts. Long hours are not necessarily effective and rarely the most efficient, and although it's counterintuitive, taking some time to step back and disengage can help you be more productive overall by giving you fresh perspectives. But also make sure your rest times are under your terms (like if you prefer to take a typical weekend off, or strictly keep weeknights free, or take breaks by playing sports, or long vacations once or twice a year.... whatever works for you). Don't feel like any particular way of being \"well-rounded\" is best. \n\nI felt the need to comment since my preferred mode of working is to just go straight for 3-4 days (with sleep) then take 1-1.5 days completely off. So it's more \"weekend-style\" than taking nights off, and it took me a while to find this because people kept suggesting things I felt like I had to do to take care of myself that broke my stride/focus, like \"you MUST get up and walk for 10 minutes every hour\" and \"you MUST stop working at 6pm and go hang out with friends\" or \"you MUST take an hour before bed to meditate and unwind\" or \"if you don't eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the SAME TIME EVERY DAY you're doing something wrong\", and I'm sure all of that was suggested with good intentions but all of that was very distracting and felt like more of a chore than a helpful relaxation when I tried any of it. Ex: when it takes me 30 min to completely focus down to a problem, getting up every hour to stretch means I accomplish nothing in a full day, increasing stress and burnout.", "author": "indecisive_maybe", "created": 1615148154, "upvotes": 98}, "gq4ntp9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/lzw2y8/think_about_the_type_of_person_that_you_want_to_be/gq4ntp9/", "text": "This has worked for me too.
