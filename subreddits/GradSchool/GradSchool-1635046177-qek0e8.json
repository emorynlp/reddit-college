  "text": "I have a RA position where I am supposed to be working 20 hours a week - right now it is all remote, I do not have to formally log hours, and I am just working on lit reviews. But with classes, I can barely get 15 hours a week of work in. Is this normal? Do people actually get 20 hours of work in a week? I do not have any hard deadlines, just soft ones, and I am doing fine on getting to meet those. Thoughts?",

Pro tip, get it done as quickly as possible and then you have made room in your schedule for other things (studying, relaxing, eating, and even sleeping!). I'm not sure how your department is, but that was how it worked for the RAs in my dept. who weren't working 20+ hours 'cause their faculty had them on insane projects or because they had volunteered for more.\n\nNow that I am a TA, I (and my TA peers) regularly spend about 30 hours between reading class material, preparing lectures, lecturing, grading, responding to emails and student contact, and having office hours. I get paid for 20 but I have no idea how this class will come together otherwise. Long story short, I wish we had a Union that could help fight for more resources and stable hours.",

      "text": "Just like with a TA, an RA will have fluctuating hours depending on the week. Some weeks you're going to work less, others more. I have had an RA for about 9 months now and had weeks at the beginning where I wasn't doing more than 10 hours because I was waiting for responses to progress. Now, I am studying for my prelims and writing my proposal and a manuscript while simultaneously analyzing data from two studies. So, I'm working close to 35-40 hours a week (not including lab work) now. It seems to even out. \n\nThe way I, my PI, and my department see it, as long as the work is getting done, it doesn't matter how many hours you put in.",

      "text": "I think it really depends on the faculty. A friend of mine worked with someone who was of the opinion that their RA should be doing 20 hours worth of work every single week. My friend was fine with that, except that some weeks there was not 20 hours worth of work to do so they practically had to beg for tasks to take up that time. It seemed like it was really stressful for the both of them. \n\nOther folks figure 20 is the average, with some weeks may be a little more while other weeks would be a little less. The folks I work with are like this. Nobody asks for my time, and even though it's an hourly position I am told to put in 4 hours regardless. Some weeks I work way less than 20 hours, others I work a bit more. As long as your supervisor is happy with your output, I wouldn't think too much about it. There have been weeks where I felt like I didn't really do anything aside from meet our weekly check-in deadline, but my supervisor seemed pleased with what I got done so it was fine.",

      "text": "I think it really depends on the department. I have two RA positions that combined should be 20 hours. I can't possibly track my hours worked except for in one of them, because the other entails monitoring emails, scheduling and communicating with other people on a project, taking notes, analyzing and coding. The email strings and meetings and info keep-up actually takes up significant time for me so I know I'm definitely hitting 10 hours a week plus.\n\nI hate it and wish it were either lit review or research.",
