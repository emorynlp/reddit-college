Some days I feel like the MD/PhD route is perfect for me, and other days I feel like a PhD in Dev Bio or Immunology would be a dream come true. Over the past few months, I read some papers and rediscovered my love for ecology - which I studied briefly during my undergrad. I feel like a mix of molecular or dev bio and ecology would be an amazing PhD experience. I guess my question is, when you commit to a PhD do you feel fully committed? Or is it normal to keep wanting to be a jack of all trades, master of none?   \nAnd additionally, does anyone here happen to have experience working in both mol bio and ecology, and can share their experiences?

Grad school is a magical period full of uncertainty, so the only thing you need to know is that you\u2019re willing to go through it (at least to a masters.)\n\nMy actual advice:\n\n\nLook for programs that offer the flexibility to study things you care about. I\u2019m pretty sure those fields overlap quite a bit. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to push back against your advisor and sometimes you\u2019ll need to carve out time for pet projects.
