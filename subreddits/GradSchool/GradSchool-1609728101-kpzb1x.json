  "text": "I just finished writing my dissertation today! But I only found out about reference managers 2 weeks ago... don't be disorganized in your writing like I was. It's so much easier to keep track of everything using a manager software instead of trying to do everything yourself. This became much more clear in my dissertation. In my publications, references were a pain, but I managed. It would have been so much easier if I had kept everything organized in a reference manager from the beginning of grad school. I'm not sure what's best but I used Mendeley (which is free!) and would recommend it.\n\nAnother bit of advice... start writing early. Many people told me this as long as 3 years ago and I thought \"oh what great advice. I'm definitely going to do that\" then I didn't open the dissertation document until 4 weeks before the deadline. Sure, I finished on time. But I barely made it and these past few weeks have been incredibly stressful. It might feel like a monumental task to open up the document and start writing, but once you get over that hump it's not so bad. Good look to all you fellow grad students!",

I manage all of my notes on papers on my own (listed under google-scholar-citation-formatted headlines and with [Author Date] placeholders in-text during drafting phases), and the papers that come up over and over are the ones that are actually worth it and that I remember. Also there is definitely a ton of poor-citation practices in academia. But what I and seemingly a lot of people on here mostly use a manager for is for inserting correctly formatted references into your document for publication, which is not a matter of remembering, but of saving yourself a lot of tediousness.\nNow I think both you and I could probably be more efficient; I suspect that I should put in the time to use my reference managers \"correctly\" to help me keep track of papers and interesting comments before the referencing stage, even though my system works. I'm probably like the old person who still keeps all their contacts by their phone because \"it works and that's how they did things back in my day!\"",
