But I only found out about reference managers 2 weeks ago... don't be disorganized in your writing like I was. It's so much easier to keep track of everything using a manager software instead of trying to do everything yourself. This became much more clear in my dissertation. In my publications, references were a pain, but I managed. It would have been so much easier if I had kept everything organized in a reference manager from the beginning of grad school. I'm not sure what's best but I used Mendeley (which is free!) and would recommend it.\n\nAnother bit of advice... start writing early. Many people told me this as long as 3 years ago and I thought \"oh what great advice. I'm definitely going to do that\" then I didn't open the dissertation document until 4 weeks before the deadline. Sure, I finished on time. But I barely made it and these past few weeks have been incredibly stressful. It might feel like a monumental task to open up the document and start writing, but once you get over that hump it's not so bad.
