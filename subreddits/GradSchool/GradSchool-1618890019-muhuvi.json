  "text": "Spent all weekend terrified I failed a very hard final. With zoom exams there's no looking around at everyone after like \"wtf\" when a hard exam happens. I assumed I was the only one who tanked it and apparently I was wrong. Proceeded to mope around all weekend and after getting my mark back found out it was massively curved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've officially passed all my courses needed for my master's!  Huge sigh of relief. We got this!",

      "text": "I remember back in my program I had something gifted to me. My program was a hybrid one where met one night a week for 4 hours and the rest was online. Classes were done one at a time for 5 weeks then you were on to the next. 3 classes per semester. \n\nI had to change cities during one of my courses and the weekend we moved was the weekend of the final for that course. \n\nI took the exam, but it had issues being submitted. I called my professor that Sunday to alert them that I had submitted my exam, but I received no result. \n\nHe basically said since I had participated well in class and it's not my fault the exam didn't go through properly, he just said \"I'll give you a 'B' for the course\". That was a blessing because I was in danger of getting my second 'C' for the program and I was only allowed two and this was my second semester of my first year of two. That literally saved me as I ended up with one other 'C' later in the program. \n\nSo I understand your anxiety and know how much relief that is to know you're done. \n\nCongratulations on completing your degree!",
