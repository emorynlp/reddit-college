  "text": "That\u2019s about it, I guess. \n\nI have just a handful of things I need to finish before I can graduate in May, but I am severely unmotivated. I\u2019m exhausted, like the kind of exhausted that a hot shower and sleep won\u2019t fix. \n\nI\u2019m tired of struggling through bit by bit. I\u2019m tired of stress headaches, deadlines, manuscripts, being broke all the time, and feeling unaccomplished. Then, when I think about how I can just tough it out for another 4 months, I get stressed because then comes the prospect of finding a job. What if I can\u2019t find one? What if I get one, but they realize I\u2019m a bad hire because I clearly have no idea what I\u2019m doing? \n\nIf we\u2019re being totally honest, the closer I get to finishing the more I wish I never bothered with grad school in the first place. But here we are.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say thank you to those who responded with such kind, thoughtful words. It really means a lot, and not that I\u2019m glad many of you are going through this too, but it is nice to know I\u2019m not alone in this. I truly appreciate all of your advice and I\u2019ve enjoyed hearing all of your stories. I hope everyone prioritizes their mental health and happiness, regardless of what that means for your grad degrees. In any case, I wish you all the very best of luck. Thanks again.",

Grad school is definitely a marathon and it can be really exhausting!\n\nIf you haven't done so already, you might seriously consider reaching out to your school's counseling or wellness center to see what resources they offer. They may even have free services available that can help you stay healthy and focused. \n\nExercise, sleep and eating right can go a long way-- when you're stressed and busy they can be easy to cut out, but they really make a difference. :)\n\nFor everyone-- if you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or you really feel you can't go on, free help is available, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 800-273-8255.\n\nTake care of yourself, and hang in there, you are almost there!!

I get myself through this by thinking about my friends and peers that graduated within the last 12 months, how they felt almost the exact same way. I think we build up the end of our PhD as this glorious moment where we feel we know so much and get to spread our wings and fly but it's really not like at all... If anything we are going to continue to be the least skilled or knowledgeable scientists at the next table we sit at. Maybe not a great way to look at it, but I've decided that I'm ok with not knowing shit because learning is fun, it's why I signed up for this in the first place and I will go on doing just that. My advice, find the even the smallest positive in it all. Good luck on finishing up and know you aren't alone in this suffering experience that is grad school!",

I\u2019m still not functioning at 100%, but my productivity is a lot better and more balanced now. Don\u2019t try to \u201ctough it out\u201d until May - take your health seriously, take it slow, one day at a time, and push graduation past May if you need to. In ten years you won\u2019t care that it took you an extra few months (or even years) to finish up. \n\nDo you journal? I set daily & weekly goals and I tailor it to my energy level. At this stage, the nature of your tasks don\u2019t get done in one day, so break them down into small pieces & give yourself lots of rewards to get lil dopamine surges as you check things off your to-do list. If you are setting goals REASONABLY (AKA not writing a million things you can\u2019t get done in x amount of hours and feeling bad about it/yourself), having evidence of your progress + rewards for making strides should improve your motivation and confidence.\n\nAlso, this is a personal choice and one not everyone can make, but if this is feasible and your mentors are supportive: don\u2019t force yourself to work full time if your symptoms are severe and you actually can\u2019t. Rest when you need to rest. If you have energy at 9 pm on a Saturday, roll with it. Some weeks I can\u2019t work at all. Sometimes I can only squeeze out 20-30 hours a week.\n\nIf you\u2019re depressed and can get a therapist to write a statement declaring your dx, you can work with the disabilities office at your school to have your mentors accommodate you. I did this, and the process was kinda shitty and draining, but overall I\u2019m glad I did it because I\u2019m allowed to work at my own pace now. \n\nYou\u2019re not alone! A lot of people feel this way right now. Be really really nice to yourself. I promise you won\u2019t feel this way forever.",

Idk your health care situation. \n\nWhen I was figuring my meds out in the beginning, my psychiatrist and GP both helped me taper up and down if I needed to go off something and try something else. It can definitely seem scary if you\u2019ve never tried before, but if it helps to know, I had a good experience. I have been in situations where my meds ran out before I could get my script filled, and the pharmacists (at least here in the US) will always give me a weekend\u2019s supply or however much I need until I get my script again. I\u2019ve personally never run into the issue of running out and dealing with withdrawal. \n\nIt is really important to take them daily and not miss doses, so if there\u2019s something going on in your life that makes that likely, SSRIs might not be for you. \n\nIf you have a psychiatrist, ask them! Wellbutrin is another one some people have luck with. But this is definitely something you\u2019d want to sort out with your docs. \n\nFor me, the choice to get on meds was prompted by trying therapy without meds, yoga/meditation, other lifestyle changes, diet, etc., and I still had extreme fatigue and very low motivation - like basic hygiene and feeding myself was hard. The way I saw it at the time, any side effect I\u2019d experience couldn\u2019t make it worse than it already was. But I wish I didn\u2019t wait until I felt that way to start - I think I wasted a lot of time letting it go untreated. \n\nAnyway, it\u2019s a personal choice for sure, but worth thinking about! For me it was a night & day difference. Being able to function sorta normally again is cool.",

It's like, I'm a few months out, all I gotta do is slog it out.\n\nPeople say one day I'll look back and realise it was worth it, but I'm not entirely sure that I will think that.\n\nMy confirmation was hell on earth, and I feel almost personally scarred by it.\n\nAt the minimum my PhD shook my confidence. Maybe it 'made me stronger', but it doesn't feel like it did. It feels like it injured me, and at best, I might be a little wiser and have more life experience.\n\nI hate feeling like, even after I graduate, things will get better than they are right now, but they might not get better than they were before I started.",

          "text": ">Hello, are you me? I feel like I'm trapped, I've done more than a lot of the other students who graduated our program, but my committee and chair aren't content to let me graduate and set the bar higher for me than they did for others. I'm just fed up. I see people who did graduate on social media (some who completed only their master's) buying their own homes, new cars, and doing fun things in places that are nice to live while I'm trapped in a shithole with a clunker and poverty wages. I'm so bitter and angry at this point. \n>\n\nI went through *exactly* this. My PhD took 7 years and my advisor just kept piling more and more work on my plate. I still remember after my defense, the committee said I had enough material for 2 PhDs. I was just so utterly burned out and drained that I had no energy to even think about doing a postdoc.\n\nTo your second point, I went through that too. Friends who didnt go to grad school were getting married, having kids, working in cushy jobs, having fun vacations, buying nice cars, and getting promoted at work, while my life was seemingly in pause. It helps to stay off social media. Delete facebook from your phone and limit social media use if possible.\n\nIt really does get better afterward. Dont stay in academia, industry is infinitely better. PM me if you want to talk.",
