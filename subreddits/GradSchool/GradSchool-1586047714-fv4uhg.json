  "title:": "Isolation is killing my passion for my degree.",
  "text": "Last year I was accepted into a great program to work with a brilliant researcher and pursue my dream career that I've been passionate about for my entire life.  Everything was going beautifully and I was loving the lifestyle and the material and had planned a trip in mid-March for data collection.  I like my advisor and the other students and the department and I was excited about my thesis.\n\nNow I'm totally alone at my apartment and haven't talked with anyone face to face in 2 weeks.  My trip fell through, my classes fell through, and my summer plans fell through.  I have no passion to read or study anything and I barely care about my thesis anymore.  I'm struggling to understand the material in one of my classes and every day it makes me hate the subject matter more.  I haven't done a single lick of anything for my thesis in 3 weeks.  I haven't communicated with my advisor because I'm ashamed of myself for how I'm reacting to this.  I'm completely discouraged and I don't see any joy in my research anymore and I don't know if my dream career is still my dream.  And the worst part is I don't know if it's just due to depression from being alone and feeling so powerless for so long or if this is really how I feel.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just felt the need to vent and this seems like a safe place to do so.\n\nEDIT: There are so many wonderful responses here, thank you all so much!  I've been feeling better this morning, just having expressed myself and been heard.  I have a great support network of friends and family, I just miss being with them in person.  We're not meant to be physically isolated for so long.  We're all in the same boat now and we'll get through this together.  I've emailed my advisor and asked for help finding something to re-motivate myself.  I definitely plan to finish my degree even if I choose not to continue into a PhD program afterwards.  Honestly my plan for several months now anyway was to take an indefinite break before going for a PhD.  Now I'm not convinced I will ever go back to school and instead will find fulfillment in a different career.  I want to be a teacher.\n\nEDIT 2: my advisor responded and told me not to be too hard on myself.  He said he has been struggling to get things done as well, but said he has some projects he could use help with remotely, so I will be able to get some work done.",

      "text": "Hey. Thanks for posting this. I think that many of us academics are feeling this way during such an unprecedented time. First of all, you are not alone. From what I have been reading in many online posts, many undergraduate and graduate students are feeling the same way right now. And I think it takes courage to come out and say it, so thank you. We are going through a period of grief, and it's totally understandable for anyone to not feel perfectly Ok during this time. Please reach out to your advisor, friends, and family. Do not let this escalate more than it needs to.\n\nI'm also feeling the same way. I am quite a very motivated person and benefit from the constant social interaction I have with other graduate students at my campus. Since January, we were having daily lunch at 12:30 pm for one hour. We would talk nonsense and usually get a pretty good laugh by the end of the lunch. Socializing is an important factor for graduate students. We carry so much daily stress from research, our pushy advisors, and other factors. So I get why we are going through this period of grievance.\n\nWhat I recommend for you to do now (besides emailing your advisor, talking to friends and family, and reaching out) is to take initiative to help you get through the next month in terms of meeting your goals and getting things done. I think it would benefit you to mark off some daily goals from your to-do list so that you get some incentive to do more, despite the circumstances. The following are routines/tools that have worked for me. It doesn't mean they will work for you, but you can try them and see if they work for you.\n\n**1.** **Set up a daily routine to train your mind/body that you are going to work.** During the week I wake up around 7-8 am as if I was going to work. I take a shower (for me, the only way to wake up is to shower right after I wake up. This may be different for everyone - also, I keep reading on different articles that using cold water helps too), put on a pair of pants/shorts and a decent t-shirt. I clean up dishes, make myself a cup of coffee, and sit down on my living room table to work. I usually work from 9-12:30 pm (I have a light breakfast in between). I eat lunch from 12:30p to 1:30p and watch a TV show or read a book. From 1:30p to 7:30p I continue working and sometimes finish work at 9p depending on how busy I am. You don't have to work this much, but set up a routine and stick to it.\n\nThis method has really helped me establish a daily routine in place.\n\n**2.** **Set up a designated work area.** This is important as it will train your mind to get work done at one specific place. For me, the living room table is the best place to work. I don't like to work inside my room, as I have designated my room as a rest/sleep area. If you don't have a dining room table or a place other than your bed to work, go on Amazon and purchase a small desk and a chair. A friend of mine did this, as he didn't have a place to work from home. I know many may not have the resources to purchase things, but if you can, do so. Just be mindful that you may not get the table on time or may have to try eBay, Home Depot, etc.\n\nAside from setting up my own work area, I also purchased a few ergonomic gadgets for my work area. I purchased a laptop stand, which raises the laptop so that my back won't hurt after a long day sitting. This laptop stand has also helped me train my mind to know that when I set my laptop on the stand, it's time to do work. It has really helped. You will need a compact keyboard and mouse if you will purchase a laptop stand. But it's a great investment.\n\nThe key here is setting up a place that is a work-only area. You will not sit there to watch TV or play games. Only work is getting done in this area.\n\n**3. Tools for getting things done**. I am a big believer in goal setting, checklists, etc. For my goals, I am using a daily planner. Each day in the morning, after finishing meditation and my cup of coffee, I look at the things I need to do for the month/week. I then write three things I need to get done for the day. That's all. Do not overwhelm yourself with 10 things. Simply pick the few that need the most attention now. You can also try the Eisenhower method for Ph.D.s ( [https://www.thephdlab.com/eisenhower-revisited/](https://www.thephdlab.com/eisenhower-revisited/) ), which I found very useful prior to the pandemic and during. By the end of the day, I usually have some things checked off my list. If some things didn't get done, it's Ok. I usually move them to the next day.I am also a big user of the Pomodoro Timer/Tracker ( [https://pomodoro-tracker.com/](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) ). This technique helps me achieve goals/tasks by breaking things down in 30-minute intervals. You work for 30-minutes distraction-free. After the 30 minutes, you take a five-minute break. I usually get up from the chair, do some light stretches, drink water, and get back to work by the end of the five minutes. I work for another 30 minutes or so, and continue the 30-minute work and 5-minute routine for four or five Pomodoros. Then, I take a long break, which is usually my lunch. In the evening, after doing four or five Pomodoros, I sit down to watch my favorite TV show for 20 minutes or so. But I always make sure I follow the Pomodoro timer to keep me on track. The Pomodoro-Tracker I recommended above lets me input certain tasks I need to achieve daily, and it also gives you statistics on what you are spending your time on. This tool has really helped me stay concentrated and on track.\n\nMy advisor uses the Asana application online for assigning tasks and due dates. This has been a somewhat Ok tool, but it lets me write down all of the things I need to do. Sort of like a dump bucket of things I need to do. I use Asana along with my daily planner to finish off tasks/goals.\n\nThe objective is here is to use handwritten/digital tools to write down your goals and get things done. There are other software and tools that you can try by going on a Google search or watching YouTube videos. Try different tools and see what works best for you.\n\nContinue reading my reply below for more tips:",

          "text": "**4. Communicate with your advisor.** So last week I was trying to avoid my advisor, which ended up me being overwhelmed and filled with feelings of anxiety. I finally had a Zoom call with him and asked him if I could email him whenever I needed to and in case I was stuck completing some data analysis task. He immediately told me to not hesitate and email/call him whenever I needed to. This really took a lot of anxiety away from me as I knew I could count on him during this time.You should also contact your advisor and express your feelings. Try and see how you two can work out a goal/task plan for each of the things you need to do. Remember not to over-commit and allow yourself enough time to get things done. The important thing is to continue communicating with your advisor. They want to help you, so make sure to let yourself be heard.\n\n**5. Get some exercise in the house.** Prior to the lockdown, I was running about three times a week and lifting weights two times a week. Not being able to workout has also being a bit detrimental for me. To fix this, I try and get some exercise done during the day. If you have a TV in your living room, go on Youtube and put some 30 min - 1 hr workouts. This helps to get your heart rate up and get your mind off things. I also have been doing some Yoga on YouTube.\n\n**6. Try mindfulness breathing/meditation.** I am a big believer in the benefits of meditation. I meditate once a day in the morning right after I shower. It can be from 5 to 10 minutes. Some of the apps I use are InsightTimer and Calm. InsightTimer has many guided meditations, which have helped me focus and deal with daily stress. I highly recommend trying meditation.\n\n**7. Call family and friends**. Now is the time to make use of the extra \"free time\" to call friends and family. During the semesters I would call home once a week (I know this is terrible). So take this time to call family, friends, and connect with old friends. Remember that others may be feeling the same way as you are feeling, so talking it out may be helpful for both parties.\n\n**8. Eat!** Make sure to eat healthy too. Remember that fruits and vegetables boost up our energy compared to junk food and sugary drinks. During this time we may not have the luxury to go grocery  the time, but I think a weekly grocery run is enough\n\n**9.** **Take it easy on yourself.** Remember that you also have the right to feel sad, unmotivated, and lost. It's Ok. Take the time you need to recover, even if it means completing only one task a day. Start in small steps until you can complete more tasks and are getting a grasp of the work-from-home routine. Also, remember too that you can recover from this. Just take initiative to make yourself feel better. I know it's hard, but it is not impossible.\n\nI hope some of the things here help you. I know that each person has a way of getting things done and dealing with life situations. But I thought to share as I keep seeing many posts about lack of motivation among us.\n\nTake care and remember to take care of yourself first.\n\n\"The brick walls are there for a reason. They're not to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something.\" - Randy Pausch",

I would suggest you talk to yours about this rather than keeping it a secret from them. Even if you have nothing to report, you might get something out of a (virtual) meeting with them. And if you just leave it and don\u2019t talk about it out of shame / whatever then you\u2019re unlikely to improve for a while.",

People didn't focus too well on their theses when the bombs fell either, and this isn't too different. \n\n\nDo communicate with your supervisor because they likely feel something similar themselves, and the goal right now is to keep yourself and your people safe and healthy and try to salvage a bit of work here and there when you can, as a _secondary_ goal. Some days you might do fine, other days you won't, there may be neither rhyme nor reason to those days and that's okay -- we are in an unprecedented crisis. Other people may look like they have their shit together but actually you don't know what they're going through and what they might be doing terribly with, or when they will crack. Some people will crack when the crisis passes, unfortunately -- human brains aren't good with unprecedented catastrophes, and that's okay.\n\n\nHumans are social animals so isolation is brutal for the vast majority of the population. Solitary confinement is a torture method for a reason. It is absolutely okay to feel like shit in these circumstances.

It sounds to me like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression (feeling sad, not doing things that previously interested you, feelings of shame) for a very truly saddening reason. This pandemic has cancelled many plans, ruined many meetings, and effectively changed the course of our plans. What I gathered from what you wrote is that, when conditions are great, you are super motivated and a definite go-getter. But now, that conditions have us isolated and aren\u2019t the best, you feel this mix of sadness, shame and even guilt with feelings of doubt. This is a normal response to change, especially this type of change. We are meant to be with people, to meet and hug. To consult in person. Right now, we cannot. I think you should send a message to your advisor about how you\u2019re feeling regarding your plans when you take a moment to think about what you are truly feeling. Maybe take it slower, and do not make any decisions based on this pandemic. This too, shall pass. We just have to take it step by step until this is over. Just please remember, it will be over. I send you virtual hugs, and I pray soon enough you get a warm real hug.",

We all go through this for several reasons where shit is either not working i the lab or life is throwing you a curve... this is part of the ebb and flow of grad school. It's especially true when a life threatening pandemic is running roughshod all over our \"normal\" lives. Just remember it's  along trek, you have time to prioritize yourself in order to have the opportunity to crank out great work later.  \n\nRock on brother and take care of yourself!",

A good supervisor should be able to accept what's going on without adding to it and be able to help you problem solve. If they react badly, that reflects on them being a crappy supervisor, not you being a bad student. I've heard a similar ish experience from so many grad students.\n\nI would also add that one thing I do that really helps when I feel like my research is pointless or doesn't matter is to talk about it to someone who isn't deep into it. They usually see it as being interesting and for me very important for the world (due to my field). I'm actually making it a point now to try to talk with someone else about my research at least once a week.",

Is there anyway, you could kick a soccer ball back and forth with a friend? Maybe try facetiming a very close friend that you know is handling this pandemic better than you right now and just dish? This is a great time to reach out to old friends virtually!",

I'm honestly really disappointed in how little our university cares about us and our research.
