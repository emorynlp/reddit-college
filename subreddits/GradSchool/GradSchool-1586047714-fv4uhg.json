Everything was going beautifully and I was loving the lifestyle and the material and had planned a trip in mid-March for data collection.  I like my advisor and the other students and the department and I was excited about my thesis.\n\nNow I'm totally alone at my apartment and haven't talked with anyone face to face in 2 weeks.  My trip fell through, my classes fell through, and my summer plans fell through.  I have no passion to read or study anything and I barely care about my thesis anymore.  I'm struggling to understand the material in one of my classes and every day it makes me hate the subject matter more.  I haven't done a single lick of anything for my thesis in 3 weeks.  I haven't communicated with my advisor because I'm ashamed of myself for how I'm reacting to this.  I'm completely discouraged and I don't see any joy in my research anymore and I don't know if my dream career is still my dream.  And the worst part is I don't know if it's just due to depression from being alone and feeling so powerless for so long or if this is really how I feel.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just felt the need to vent and this seems like a safe place to do so.\n\nEDIT: There are so many wonderful responses here, thank you all so much!  I've been feeling better this morning, just having expressed myself and been heard.  I have a great support network of friends and family, I just miss being with them in person.  We're not meant to be physically isolated for so long.  We're all in the same boat now and we'll get through this together.  I've emailed my advisor and asked for help finding something to re-motivate myself.  I definitely plan to finish my degree even if I choose not to continue into a PhD program afterwards.  Honestly my plan for several months now anyway was to take an indefinite break before going for a PhD.  Now I'm not convinced I will ever go back to school and instead will find fulfillment in a different career.  I want to be a teacher.\n\nEDIT 2: my advisor responded and told me not to be too hard on myself.  He said he has been struggling to get things done as well, but said he has some projects he could use help with remotely, so I will be able to get some work done.", "author": "Evolving_Dore", "created": 1586047714, "retrieved": 1632953915, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 375, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"fmifoyd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fv4uhg/isolation_is_killing_my_passion_for_my_degree/fmifoyd/", "text": "Hey. Thanks for posting this. I think that many of us academics are feeling this way during such an unprecedented time. First of all, you are not alone. From what I have been reading in many online posts, many undergraduate and graduate students are feeling the same way right now. And I think it takes courage to come out and say it, so thank you. We are going through a period of grief, and it's totally understandable for anyone to not feel perfectly Ok during this time. Please reach out to your advisor, friends, and family. Do not let this escalate more than it needs to.\n\nI'm also feeling the same way. I am quite a very motivated person and benefit from the constant social interaction I have with other graduate students at my campus. Since January, we were having daily lunch at 12:30 pm for one hour. We would talk nonsense and usually get a pretty good laugh by the end of the lunch. Socializing is an important factor for graduate students. We carry so much daily stress from research, our pushy advisors, and other factors. So I get why we are going through this period of grievance.\n\nWhat I recommend for you to do now (besides emailing your advisor, talking to friends and family, and reaching out) is to take initiative to help you get through the next month in terms of meeting your goals and getting things done. I think it would benefit you to mark off some daily goals from your to-do list so that you get some incentive to do more, despite the circumstances. The following are routines/tools that have worked for me. It doesn't mean they will work for you, but you can try them and see if they work for you.\n\n**1.** **Set up a daily routine to train your mind/body that you are going to work.** During the week I wake up around 7-8 am as if I was going to work. I take a shower (for me, the only way to wake up is to shower right after I wake up. This may be different for everyone - also, I keep reading on different articles that using cold water helps too), put on a pair of pants/shorts and a decent t-shirt. I clean up dishes, make myself a cup of coffee, and sit down on my living room table to work. I usually work from 9-12:30 pm (I have a light breakfast in between). I eat lunch from 12:30p to 1:30p and watch a TV show or read a book. From 1:30p to 7:30p I continue working and sometimes finish work at 9p depending on how busy I am. You don't have to work this much, but set up a routine and stick to it.\n\nThis method has really helped me establish a daily routine in place.\n\n**2.** **Set up a designated work area.** This is important as it will train your mind to get work done at one specific place. For me, the living room table is the best place to work. I don't like to work inside my room, as I have designated my room as a rest/sleep area. If you don't have a dining room table or a place other than your bed to work, go on Amazon and purchase a small desk and a chair. A friend of mine did this, as he didn't have a place to work from home. I know many may not have the resources to purchase things, but if you can, do so. Just be mindful that you may not get the table on time or may have to try eBay, Home Depot, etc.\n\nAside from setting up my own work area, I also purchased a few ergonomic gadgets for my work area. I purchased a laptop stand, which raises the laptop so that my back won't hurt after a long day sitting. This laptop stand has also helped me train my mind to know that when I set my laptop on the stand, it's time to do work. It has really helped. You will need a compact keyboard and mouse if you will purchase a laptop stand. But it's a great investment.\n\nThe key here is setting up a place that is a work-only area. You will not sit there to watch TV or play games. Only work is getting done in this area.\n\n**3. Tools for getting things done**. I am a big believer in goal setting, checklists, etc. For my goals, I am using a daily planner. Each day in the morning, after finishing meditation and my cup of coffee, I look at the things I need to do for the month/week. I then write three things I need to get done for the day. That's all. Do not overwhelm yourself with 10 things. Simply pick the few that need the most attention now. You can also try the Eisenhower method for Ph.D.s ( [https://www.thephdlab.com/eisenhower-revisited/](https://www.thephdlab.com/eisenhower-revisited/) ), which I found very useful prior to the pandemic and during. By the end of the day, I usually have some things checked off my list. If some things didn't get done, it's Ok. I usually move them to the next day.I am also a big user of the Pomodoro Timer/Tracker ( [https://pomodoro-tracker.com/](https://pomodoro-tracker.com/) ). This technique helps me achieve goals/tasks by breaking things down in 30-minute intervals. You work for 30-minutes distraction-free. After the 30 minutes, you take a five-minute break. I usually get up from the chair, do some light stretches, drink water, and get back to work by the end of the five minutes. I work for another 30 minutes or so, and continue the 30-minute work and 5-minute routine for four or five Pomodoros. Then, I take a long break, which is usually my lunch. In the evening, after doing four or five Pomodoros, I sit down to watch my favorite TV show for 20 minutes or so. But I always make sure I follow the Pomodoro timer to keep me on track. The Pomodoro-Tracker I recommended above lets me input certain tasks I need to achieve daily, and it also gives you statistics on what you are spending your time on. This tool has really helped me stay concentrated and on track.\n\nMy advisor uses the Asana application online for assigning tasks and due dates. This has been a somewhat Ok tool, but it lets me write down all of the things I need to do. Sort of like a dump bucket of things I need to do. I use Asana along with my daily planner to finish off tasks/goals.\n\nThe objective is here is to use handwritten/digital tools to write down your goals and get things done. There are other software and tools that you can try by going on a Google search or watching YouTube videos. Try different tools and see what works best for you.\n\nContinue reading my reply below for more tips:", "author": "astrosebas", "created": 1586108647, "upvotes": 2}, "fmi3yob": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fv4uhg/isolation_is_killing_my_passion_for_my_degree/fmi3yob/", "text": "I opened up to my honours supervisors last year about some personal struggles I was going through (my Dad was dying / died of pancreatic cancer, and obviously that zapped a lot of my motivation / energy and time for my project), and they were very understanding about it.

It sounds to me like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression (feeling sad, not doing things that previously interested you, feelings of shame) for a very truly saddening reason.
