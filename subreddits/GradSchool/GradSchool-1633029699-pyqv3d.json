  "title:": "What to Do During My Gap Year for Grad School? (Ontario, Canada)",
  "text": "I graduated in a double major in political science and criminology a few months ago and plan on applying to a masters program for public policy/administration/service (waterloo, uoft, ryerson, carelton, etc) since I have an interest in public policy (hope to be a policy analyst). I'm more so interested in the programs that gurantee co-op and have good networking as that can help me get my foot in the door for this field (as I don't really have any experience like internships/co op concerning this area).\n\nI'm in a gap year rn so I'm still working at my current retail job, so I'm just wondering how I can better prepare and train myself in relation to the public service. I picked up on some volunteering for this election, and plan to do more volunteering this year (thinking of stuff related to my crim degree, so at risk youth volunteering, shelters, etc). Are there any certificate training or online courses or anything else you'd recommend? I'm thinking of also applying to temporary/contract entry level public policy/policy analyst jobs in the meantime. I know some master programs require a pre requisite for economic courses which I don't have, so if I get into the Carelton program I can do the required economic courses over the summer. Any tips and advice would be appreciated in relation to this or preparing oneself during a gap year in general (since I have all this free time) if any of you have had a similar situation. Thank you!\n\nI posted this in the canadian public service subreddit but it got removed so I'm asking here.",
