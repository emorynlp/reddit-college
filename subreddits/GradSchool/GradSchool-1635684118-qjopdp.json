  "text": "Got into grad school and need advice!\n\nSo first and foremost, I got into grad school for a Masters of Occupational Therapy program. I am so so excited and I\u2019ve been working on this for 2+ years and it finally happened!!!! I quickly became overwhelmed with finances and could use some advice. \n\nI finished my undergrad in 2013 so it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been in school. I want to try and get scholarship money or grants and not sure how to approach this. Do I contact the school directly? Look for outside resources? I need to figure this all out as quickly as possible so any tips at all would be so helpful.",
