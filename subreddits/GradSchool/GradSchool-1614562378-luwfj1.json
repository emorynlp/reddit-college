Why do professors act like their class is the only one? I expected this behavior in undergrad but not in grad school...", "text": "I\u2019m getting a Master of Arts in Human Resources and Employee Relations. I\u2019ve been in the program for a year and this is my first time encountering a professor like this. The rest understand we work full time and/or have jobs and lives outside of school. \n\nI just found out I\u2019m losing participation points in my current class because even though I\u2019m meeting the weekly requirement of postings, I\u2019m only logging in once a week to interact with my peers on the discussion board and that\u2019s not enough. Regardless of everything being due on Sunday nights, regardless of Sunday being my only free day since I work full time and have health problems so I got to doctors appointments after work. Regardless of spending at least 6+ hours on said free day reading the book chapters, reading the PowerPoints, taking personal notes, posting on the discussion board, writing the weekly required 500 word essays that have nothing to do with HR, and taking the quizzes that have nothing to do with the material either, it\u2019s not enough. \n\nI\u2019m losing points because \u201cthe website monitors participation by logins and if you\u2019re only on once a week or for a short amount of time your score will be lower than others\u201d. \n\nI thought the whole point of an online only class was to be able to work at your own pace and do it whenever you have free time as long as you\u2019re meeting deadlines??? \n\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed getting my masters up to this class. I like the material and it\u2019s been better than my undergrad. But I have a life outside of school: a full time job and health issues. So outside of full time work, I\u2019m running to doctors appointments just about every evening. By the time I\u2019m officially home for the day or have free time during the week I don\u2019t have the mental or physical capacity to sit down and try to post well thought-out responses to each one my classmates. It\u2019s not even required in the syllabus!! But that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to have to start doing since I\u2019m not getting 100%s and I need them to pull off a good grade in this class since I\u2019m struggling. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I just needed to rant. I\u2019m thankful to be getting another degree. I really want it and to get out of my current job cause it sucks pretty bad too which is also adding to my depression, anxiety, and stress and hence why I\u2019m getting another degree so I can get out. Just feeling really stressed and overwhelmed and burnt out. \n\nIf you made it through this post, thanks \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m wordy when I\u2019m upset and it means a lot that you took the time to read this.", "author": null, "created": 1614562378, "retrieved": 1632954351, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "comments": {"gpe4hbh": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/luwfj1/losing_participation_in_an_online_only_class_why/gpe4hbh/", "text": "Basing any part of your grade on the number of logins sounds like complete bullshit.
