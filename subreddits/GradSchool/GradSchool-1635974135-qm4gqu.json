  "text": "Is anyone here doing a PhD program while being in the US National Guard? I might be getting the opportunity to do a PhD, but im so worried about what would happen if I were forced to take a semester or even a year off for a deployment. I know my unit wouldn't let me avoid going because of school. Are you allowed to take a break from a funded program?",

This could vary based on your funding source (i.e. if you are funded on a three year grant that has an expiration date) but there are always ways to make things work if you try hard enough. Have a serious conversation with your prospective PI and come up with a written plan for what you would do in possible scenarios.",
