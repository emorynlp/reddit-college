Since Covid hit right before I started, none of my advisors or department even had a chance to give my syllabus a look. I did my very best recording videos, providing feedback, coding a modular structure for my course website.\n\nDespite it all, I finished grading the last exam tonight and the student work/feedback has been universally awesome. I never really fancied myself a teacher, but I'm feeling pretty proud tonight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nS/o to all us graduate students making it happen!", "author": "EpicDestroyer52", "created": 1596527731, "retrieved": 1632953770, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 454, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"g0eenlz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/i3f7r4/just_finished_teaching_my_first_solo_class/g0eenlz/", "text": "Congrats!!

I have been there and I find there are two types of graduate students..those who enjoy teaching and those who don't after their first experience. \n\nWhat we should really congratulate you on is your resilience. My wife and I moved our two kids out to Arizona last year for a job opportunity and I am still in grad school. We moved away from all our friends and family. We tried to stay but in the end it was not in the cards with the way the job interviewers were progressing. Being on your own, not being able to just talk to someone who knows what you are going through, not having a steady mentor or coach nearby is tough.\n\nBeing alone is tough, being able to put it all together to teach and empower others is resilience.
