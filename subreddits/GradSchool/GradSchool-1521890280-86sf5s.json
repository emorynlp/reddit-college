              "text": "My BA took me 14 years to do (1985-1999) because of a series of stops and starts, changing majors, and marriage and motherhood. I didn't like it that I hadn't finished it and it was a matter of pride that I do so, so I did.  But I never managed to get a job in my major (which was Historical Studies - I wanted to do something in the museum field, but didn't ever find anything.)\n\nAnyway...I got another job, one I'm still in nearly 18 years later.  While enjoyable and it paid the bills and all and it was a good fit lifestyle-wise for me at the time, it wasn't something that thrilled me. \n\nIn my youth I always looked at work as just work - something you did to support the rest of your actual life - but I'm beginning to find as I get older that feeling has been replaced by a desire to do something more meaningful.  In my younger years I wouldn't have cared, but now?  I can't imagine doing the job I'm in now for the next 20 years until I retire.  It's mind-numbing.\n\nI'm also the kind of person who values safety, dependability and security.  I know myself and I know I'd end up staying at my current job until retirement if I don't make a crazy, radical, no-going-back-make-the-best-of-it choice in order to fulfill the desire I have now to make my life different and meaningful.  It's not in my nature to do this sort of thing and I'm scared to death that I'm destroying a possible safe place in order to pursue something that might fall out from under me.\n\nBut there's the rub.  I don't want to wonder, \"What if I'd only....\" in 20 years.  I don't.  I'd rather say \"I tried it and it fucked up.  But I tried it.\"",
