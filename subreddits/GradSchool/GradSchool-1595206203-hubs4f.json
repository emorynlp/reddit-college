  "text": "I'm two years into grad school in a science program. I'm lucky to be in a good department and working under a smart and helpful supervisor. I enjoy what I work on for the most part too. To many, this probably sounds like a humblebrag post but it's really not and I'm sorry if it comes across like that.\n\nI can't help but compare myself to people who've achieved so much more by the time they were my age. My own supervisor, many other grad students in my department, even people on StackExchange who answer my stupid questions so cleanly and who show such depth of knowledge - they make me realize that I am so fucking far from exceptional. And that's before reading the Wikipedia page of nearly any scientist (yes, I know they have a Wiki page because they're exceptional but still...). I'm pretty much in the middle of the road in terms of ability compared to my peers, maybe even below average. And this bothers me because it feels like I will struggle through this program, not really make any big contributions to science and probably end up in a corporate job after all this. Not because I want to but amidst the geniuses of my field, I don't think I have a hope in hell of a permanent job. I wish I was able to learn faster and just be smarter than I am. I'm also a few years older than my peers and it already feels like I'm washed up and done. I wish I could have those eureka moments leading to really cool papers regularly - instead, research progress feels like squeezing water from a stone for me and the good ideas all come from my supervisor. It's becoming clear that even with all the effort I can and do put in, I'm going to be a very average researcher.\n\nHow do you make peace with unexceptionalism and learn to enjoy the process and just be happy? How do you get over the feeling that research and science is just a perennial struggle? Most of all, how do you feel better about yourself? At the moment, the whole process and seeing those around me has me feeling absolutely shitty and it really sucks...\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you all for your thoughts. I'm really really grateful for everyone who took the time to post advice and new perspectives. I have to work on my own outlook and become a more positive person and threads like this certainly help a lot!",

      "text": "I find that acknowledging a few common biases covered in social psychology can really help me abstract away some of the immediate emotional responses to feeling inadequate and help me ground myself in reality. Here are a few examples:\n\n* [Attribution bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias): if you catch yourself thinking that other people are innately talented or have benefits you might not, you may want to take a step back and see if you're systematically misattributing success factors to others. There's a lot of subtle ones like actor-observer bias, fundamental attribution bias, etc.\n* [Worse-than-average effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse-than-average_effect): for difficult things with a low chance of success, you might be tempted to think you're worse than others by not being \"successful\" when in fact you're doing great already\n\nMaybe reading about social comparison will also help. Comparing ourselves to people deemed better/more successful can lower our self-esteem (and the opposite is true in that your self-esteem will rise if you compare yourself to people deemed worse). One way to moderate comparing yourself to others is to look objectively at how people in a similar situation to you are doing.",

      "text": "Based on academic standards, I'm worse than unexceptional. I haven't published yet in grad school, I don't have the most groundbreaking ideas, many of my conference submissions have been rejected, and the datasets/samples I use get a lot of skepticism from reviewers and other people in the field (I'm in an applied area).\n\nI used to feel bad about all of this. But now I focus on what I *do* like, what I'm good at, and how I'm unique even if it means looking for that perspective outside of academia. It's good to strive and feel dumb so you can learn sometimes, but feeling dumb all the time just depresses you.\n\nMake sure that you put your comparisons into perspective. Teach someone in your family or peer group about what you do - I bet they'll be excited to learn and you'll realize that not everyone knows the things you take for granted. Write a practitioner-oriented article and you'll realize that you have important skills, even just by understanding and synthesizing others' research.\n\nI know I'm never going to be an academic researcher. I'm much better at translating scientific concepts, analyzing data from studies that others have designed, and writing shorter, action-oriented pieces instead of longer academic articles. You may find that your niche looks quite different from the standard academic skill set too. Best of luck.",

      "text": "There will always be someone better than you at different things and you will always be better than others at different things. Academia has a way of making everyone feel inadequate because you\u2019re surrounded by smart and hardworking people. The position you or anyone else ends up in after grad school is going to be mostly due to timing and luck. That\u2019s not to say that hard work doesn\u2019t play a role, but success is meeting opportunity prepared and that relies on luck. Permanent positions in academia have been on the decline and likely will continue to be that way, so anyone getting a position now has to be coming into it at the right time to find a job that they are the perfect fit for, because everyone competing for these jobs is probably similarly competent. If you don\u2019t happen to have the right advisor, do the right experiment, publish in the right journals, get the right fellowships etc, you may not be competitive for these positions, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not exceptional, you just didn\u2019t do your PhD at the right time. I see this constantly, where exceptional students leave academia because the jobs are too reliant on certain factors or because it\u2019s too toxic. I\u2019ve seen very mediocre professors get tenure on the backs of exceptional students that leave academia. My most exceptional colleagues and the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met all went into industry or national labs as scientists/consultants, so I have to disagree with the idea that a corporate job is somewhere you end up. These positions are hard for academics to get because we don\u2019t prepare students for anything but academia. You don\u2019t just get a job paying far more and having more immediate impact than a tenured professor straight out of a PhD for nothing.",

And I used to tell myself \"there's no way these guys feel inadequate, they've done xyz accomplishments\". Turns out, they do. In the end, I graduated before many of them and while I definitely don't feel that my final work is at the stage I wanted it to be, it doesn't define who I am.

People stand out because of circumstances and luck as much as if not more often than from personal merit.\n\nThe real work, the real science, is the day to day stuff, the slow, plodding progress that looks at details, understands each cog...

If networking is your talent, or getting positive attention, it can make up for a HEAP of other areas where you might lack. Particularly in the Sciences, the incredibly smart people in the lab struggle outside it and need handlers who can communicate AND understand the science. These are the people who get grants, manage their business and make their important work viable and possible. \n\nThere is a role for everyone, but it is hard to be part of the conversation if you don't understand it. Maybe you aren't in Grad School to invent the next big whatever or work on the life saving whatever. Maybe you're in Grad School so you can understand and link the people together to make the life saving whatever possible. Because without people like that, nothing is possible.",

When I began embracing that I really began shining.\n\nSuccess isn't just about publishing papers and doing math really good. It's also about being able to make people feel good about themselves, having the humility to learn from others, the ability to get people to do what you want or help you. A lot of pure science types look down their noses at this and don't think success gained this way isn't legitimate. But I disagree. Social skills are just as valid as pure math skills. As long as you're not taking advantage of anyone or being unethical, and as long as you have the relevant technical skills to back it up, I see no problem with gaining success through networking and people skills.",

I know some of the very highest achieving graduate students/postdocs in the world and they have lower opinions of themselves than many others I've met.

If you remained comfortably ahead of those around you, were you really pushing yourself as hard as you could? \n\nResearch is hard work. It feels exhausting and makes you feel like an idiot.

I was consistently near the top of my class but I rarely felt a sense of belonging.

It also needs people like me with many, many outside interests, a well rounded background, and solid social and leadership skills.

Two thoughts for you to consider:\n\n- you don\u2019t have to be exceptional to contribute. Talent is great, but overrated. It atrophies if it\u2019s not practiced. Show up for twenty years and work your butt off, and you will accomplish more than the geniuses who are still waiting for inspiration to strike.

Besides, there\u2019s nothing you can do about talent; but skills you can acquire and improve. \n\n- everyone one does it differently. If you look carefully at the people you admire, you will notice that they play to their strengths. You\u2019ll have to figure out what yours are, and leverage them.

              "text": "The answer is complex: yes, people work hard. But in my experience most people do not sacrifice everything to get - and keep - those positions. \n\nLike most people, I have periods with deadlines when I stay up working late, but that\u2019s not all the time. But I usually manage my time well - a rarity amongst my colleagues - so I don\u2019t have to scramble to write a proposal in a few days, or a paper that should have been done months ago. \n\nI have colleagues who still try and pull together a grant proposal in a week. Over and over. Their success rate is low, but they are too busy with other things to start earlier. And so they waste effort on no-hope grants, and it never occurs to them that they simply can\u2019t do all the work they are setting themselves. \n\nThe problem, I think, stems from the inherent lack of structure in academia. I don\u2019t report to anyone, and there\u2019s no project management that will make me start a complex task in plenty of time to get several drafts done. If I don\u2019t develop the organizational skills and self-discipline to do so, there is simply no external force to provide structure. So people wind up spending a long time at work, without necessarily doing all that much.",

      "text": "Same here. I sometimes feel this way. As if I'm wasting time and learning slow. I look at other researchers of same age and feel like I'm a complete idiot compared to them. I want to publish good work that is recognized. Every time I see a paper about my field of work, I feel sad and envious that they beat me to it and I couldn't do that. Sometimes it makes me not wanna read that paper and pretend it doesn't exist. That's childish and stupid I know, but that's how I feel sometimes. \n\nI'm reality, this is science. It's a community. The goal is not to win some race, the goal is to contribute meaningful work for the advancement of humanity. But I tend to forget this and get boggled up in that mentality that is detrimental to ones sanity. This is worse if your field is very popular (like mine), publications are flying out left and right every minute. \n\nPersonally, I try to keep my mind on these things:\n\n1. The goal of a PhD is to train you to become a researcher. It's not possible to produce high quality work as those people because I just started. This doesn't mean I shouldn't aim that high, just be realistic.\n\n2. Define your goals, do you want to be popular or be good at something and why?\n\n3. Everyone learns at a different speed and just because those people seem perfect, they have their shortcomings as well that they wished they were better at.\n\nTldr; Focus on you and with your own speed along with your supervisor. At the end of the day, the fact that we are in a PhD program is already a big achievement.",

      "text": "Sorry dude. I definitely didn't see this as any humblebrag, it seems like youre going through a rut - this is normal unfortunately for grad school. I think in my case, although I imagined the relief would give me a second wind, my rut started after my prelim defense and lasted til I graduated. It's tough. You already know the \"rules\" about comparing yourself to others, just be strictly adherent to not doing it as best you can. Even those batshit wunderkinds have their problems, academic, personal, what have you.\n\nI can understand how it looks on the surface you may be unproductive without the razzle dazzle publications, but I think you may be overthinking it.....well I say this if you were hypothetically in my field (biology) and looking for scientist roles in industry afterwards (not TT academic positions). I graduated with only a publication under review. Now, three months later, it's in revision to be submitted again next month. And it seems (yea......seems) I have a lock on a stable biotech job that is of the expected entry level of a PhD. \n\nAs long as you're not being barred from graduation w/o crazy publication standards, then I would just try to convince you that your inner worry wort is just taking hold. I would suggest you start putting yourself out in the airwaves now, pretending nay - knowing full well you will be on the job market in what? Two or three years? Find the job you want and then reach out to people doing that. Ask them for informational interviews. You can also try to start cultivating one on one relationships with each of your thesis advisors - this is just so they know what you're looking for, and then with these cultivated relationships by the time you finish, they will be much much more willing to go to bat for you - get you connections or in contact with people hiring or acting as ace references. \n\nI promise you if you start putting yourself out there now, start talking to people and asking them for their help, advice, etc., many of them will reach back, and they'll see you as a person on a mission.",
