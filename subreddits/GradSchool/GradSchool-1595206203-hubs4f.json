I'm lucky to be in a good department and working under a smart and helpful supervisor. I enjoy what I work on for the most part too. To many, this probably sounds like a humblebrag post but it's really not and I'm sorry if it comes across like that.\n\nI can't help but compare myself to people who've achieved so much more by the time they were my age. My own supervisor, many other grad students in my department, even people on StackExchange who answer my stupid questions so cleanly and who show such depth of knowledge - they make me realize that I am so fucking far from exceptional. And that's before reading the Wikipedia page of nearly any scientist (yes, I know they have a Wiki page because they're exceptional but still...). I'm pretty much in the middle of the road in terms of ability compared to my peers, maybe even below average. And this bothers me because it feels like I will struggle through this program, not really make any big contributions to science and probably end up in a corporate job after all this. Not because I want to but amidst the geniuses of my field, I don't think I have a hope in hell of a permanent job. I wish I was able to learn faster and just be smarter than I am. I'm also a few years older than my peers and it already feels like I'm washed up and done. I wish I could have those eureka moments leading to really cool papers regularly - instead, research progress feels like squeezing water from a stone for me and the good ideas all come from my supervisor. It's becoming clear that even with all the effort I can and do put in, I'm going to be a very average researcher.\n\nHow do you make peace with unexceptionalism and learn to enjoy the process and just be happy? How do you get over the feeling that research and science is just a perennial struggle? Most of all, how do you feel better about yourself? At the moment, the whole process and seeing those around me has me feeling absolutely shitty and it really sucks...\n\nEDIT: Wow, thank you all for your thoughts. I'm really really grateful for everyone who took the time to post advice and new perspectives. I have to work on my own outlook and become a more positive person and threads like this certainly help a lot!", "author": "Old_Market", "created": 1595206203, "retrieved": 1632845915, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 355, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fyokjv4": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/hubs4f/how_to_accept_being_unexceptional/fyokjv4/", "text": "I find that acknowledging a few common biases covered in social psychology can really help me abstract away some of the immediate emotional responses to feeling inadequate and help me ground myself in reality. Here are a few examples:\n\n* [Attribution bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias): if you catch yourself thinking that other people are innately talented or have benefits you might not, you may want to take a step back and see if you're systematically misattributing success factors to others. There's a lot of subtle ones like actor-observer bias, fundamental attribution bias, etc.\n* [Worse-than-average effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse-than-average_effect): for difficult things with a low chance of success, you might be tempted to think you're worse than others by not being \"successful\" when in fact you're doing great already\n\nMaybe reading about social comparison will also help. Comparing ourselves to people deemed better/more successful can lower our self-esteem (and the opposite is true in that your self-esteem will rise if you compare yourself to people deemed worse).

But now I focus on what I *do* like, what I'm good at, and how I'm unique even if it means looking for that perspective outside of academia. It's good to strive and feel dumb so you can learn sometimes, but feeling dumb all the time just depresses you.\n\nMake sure that you put your comparisons into perspective. Teach someone in your family or peer group about what you do - I bet they'll be excited to learn and you'll realize that not everyone knows the things you take for granted. Write a practitioner-oriented article and you'll realize that you have important skills, even just by understanding and synthesizing others' research.\n\nI know I'm never going to be an academic researcher.

Academia has a way of making everyone feel inadequate because you\u2019re surrounded by smart and hardworking people. The position you or anyone else ends up in after grad school is going to be mostly due to timing and luck. That\u2019s not to say that hard work doesn\u2019t play a role, but success is meeting opportunity prepared and that relies on luck. Permanent positions in academia have been on the decline and likely will continue to be that way, so anyone getting a position now has to be coming into it at the right time to find a job that they are the perfect fit for, because everyone competing for these jobs is probably similarly competent. If you don\u2019t happen to have the right advisor, do the right experiment, publish in the right journals, get the right fellowships etc, you may not be competitive for these positions, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not exceptional, you just didn\u2019t do your PhD at the right time. I see this constantly, where exceptional students leave academia because the jobs are too reliant on certain factors or because it\u2019s too toxic. I\u2019ve seen very mediocre professors get tenure on the backs of exceptional students that leave academia. My most exceptional colleagues and the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met all went into industry or national labs as scientists/consultants, so I have to disagree with the idea that a corporate job is somewhere you end up.
