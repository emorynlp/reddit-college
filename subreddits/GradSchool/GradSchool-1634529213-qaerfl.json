It\u2019ll take a little while to get your finances in order/first paycheck once you arrive. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably need some money to put down a deposit for housing and stuff like that.)",

I'll apply around January, and then I'll start to see my possibilities. I don't really know when to start filling FAFSA's form, is it before applying or after?
