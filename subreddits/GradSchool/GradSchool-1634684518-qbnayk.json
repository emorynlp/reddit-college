  "text": "I get my bachelor's at a recognized public university. Applied for a job at the same university and got it. Now, I am looking at getting a master's in my field and the program at the university is one of the best ones, however, many of the classes from the master's overlap with the bachelor's and are usually taught as one class by the same professor. On the other hand, the master's will be paid by the university and I don\u2019t have to be in debt. I am planning to, later on, get a PhD but one step at a time.",
