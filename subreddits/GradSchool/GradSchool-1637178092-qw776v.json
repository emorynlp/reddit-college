  "text": "My whole life, I have been a pretty outgoing and fun guy, then I got into graduate school. During my first year, I was ready to tackle the world, I have taken 24/26 units each quarter, went the extra mile, and did all the extracurricular classes, organizing events, being part of journal clubs. The pandemic hit, I finished all the coursework required classes, and lab work became my life. 70+ hours of work every week. I got this huge sense of failure and impostor syndrome. I thought that I would be able to help people, be useful, and in the end, I feel like I am a glorified lab tech. I order items to maintain the lab functioning, take care of the inventory, process blood (PBMC's, plasma, sera), keep check on how the animals are doing, and design experiments checking the antibodies staining, some tissue staining, but in the end, nothing really is important. Every week is a rush to make up something to present to the PI, which I feel blessed compared with other PI's I have heard of, and I have my weekly reminder from the lab tech that I won't graduate. \n\nQE is scheduled, the anxiety is ramping up, my 5 hours of sleep became terrible 2/3 hours of sleep or 12 hours, and the feeling of not doing anything. I have no desire to come to the lab, and honestly, I just feel like thanking my professor for the opportunity and walking away. After 1 year of therapy and a lot of debate, I am finally going to get medicated since my blood pressure is through the roof, and I am having physical manifestations of severe anxiety. Anybody else?",
