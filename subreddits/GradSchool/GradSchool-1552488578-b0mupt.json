  "text": "Even after taking six months off and changing my advisor a year after coming back, I still feel so low on energy. I'm also developing a serious antipathy to just about everyone here. And yes, I'm seeing a therapist whom I really like once a week. I know this can be resolved, but it's just taking a fuckload of time and energy.\n\nAnyone relate to this?\n\nEDIT: Thanks so, SO much for all the support and advice everyone. You have restored a lot of my faith in humanity today. It's disheartening to know that we are all struggling one way or another, but at the same time it helps me have hope that there's a better future ahead. Keep being awesome and smart, guys, because you know you're both of those things.",

Even seeing my advisor is more helpful than seeing the therapist (and I do not talk about my mental health with my advisor).\n\nI can have one or two occasional good days if I'm infused in coffee or if I've had almost no sleep and the adrenaline is kicking in hard. Otherwise it's like simulating being alive and trying to not show (sometimes not even bother to try to look normal)",

A professor of mine once told me this after I showed up in his office, sobbing, because I just couldn't write, and I was missing one deadline after another \"It's okay to be depressed. Just don't be depressed about being depressed.\" Something about that really stuck with me. I stopped beating myself up about my depression and decided to forgive myself instead and not every time I feel a new wave rolling in I just remind myself of his words and I feel like it lifts the weight off my shoulders a bit. Hope it also helps you. ",

What really sucked was that it totally made me feel dispassionate about my project, which I was initially really excited for. I felt myself doing the bare minimum in my classwork, TAing, and neglecting other things too like my physical health and personal relationships. \n\nWhat worked for me is something you're already doing - THERAPY. I love therapy, and after trying out several different therapists (because your relationship with your therpaist is important) I finally found one that has helped me work on myself sans anti-depressants (currently just went off of em after 10 years of being medicated). \n\nOne thing I want to say is that academia can be a toxic environment. There is a lot expected of us, and it's ok to say no or take a day/night off. After accepting that I'm not perfect and that nothing absolutely awful will happen if I fail, I can finally feel like the fear of failure doesn't drive me, but rather my passion and excitement do. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have questions :)",

On top of all the work for school, actually taking my therapy seriously is also a lot of work and emotionally draining. \n\nI try taking one day at a time. Some days are better than others.

I have only been taking it for less than a year, and most times when the depressive case is severe, people take it for two years or so. Also, and I think most importantly, I tried three different antidepressants before I found the one and I found the right dosis for me. The fact that you're on an antidepressant now and you feel a bit better doesn't mean that that's the one for you, there may be one out there that fits you better. Still, grad school is still a struggle. Keep focus on your final goals, it won't last forever.",

              "text": "Yeah... unless they're *really* progressive they'll shut that down asap. Even if they are progressive, there might be some legal & ethical issues with them suggesting that you take an illegal drug, so you're likely to get some equivocating but no solid opinion on whether it's a good idea or not. Don't get me wrong, I think psychedelics can be powerful antidepressants, both because of their chemical effects and the psychological experience. Of course this is a double edged sword, a bad trip could make things worse. If you do go this route make sure you have a trustworthy source, do your research, find a trip sitter, and make sure to mind your set and setting. That last part is key, you need to go into it with a clear intention, positive mindset, and be in a space that feels safe, comfortable, and positive.\n\nI've been really struggling with my own depression lately, and now I have 60+ pages to write in three weeks to pass my qualifying exam. It got me looking into newer, potentially faster acting treatments and I found some interesting research on ketamine. There are actual legal clinics for it now, so you might ask your psychiatrist about that. Although again, I imagine a more conservative psychiatrist is going to be highly reluctant to suggest a cutting edge therapy that utilizes a drug best known for its recreational use. Personally I think I'm going to give it a try, but unfortunately it takes weeks just to get an initial appointment for evaluation, so a little late for pulling me out of my current slump before my deadlines.\n\nAnyways, I know how you're feeling and it sucks. Just do your best to hang in there and know that you're not alone!",

I'm assuming they were operating as part of clinical trials in some fashion before and are now open to anyone? Either way, I still imagine that a more conservative psychiatrist would be reluctant to recommend something so new before trying basically everything else first. As I understand it the treatment is already targeted towards folks with treatment resistant depression? (Admittedly, given the very lackluster results from current first line meds, I imagine more folks with chronic clinical depression are treatment resistant than not). So I'd imagine, at least based on my experience, that more conservative psychiatrist would be reluctant (even if not absolutely opposed) to recommend a brand new treatment using a drug that has the baggage of being associated with recreational use. Then again, I may be way overestimating ketamine's stigma among medical professionals.",

Similarly to the existing intravenous clinics, this new nasal spray product is only administered under close supervision. That should curb the worst of the recreational concerns.\n\nI agree that conservative psychiatrists will be reluctant, but in conversation with my own psychiatrist I think that mental health professionals are just as eager for new lines of treatment as patients are. Between this and the positive attention that psychedelics have had lately, I'm crossing my fingers that we're on the brink of a widespread, honest reassessment of drug use. Then again, I may be *underestimating* ketamine's stigma among medical professionals, ha!",

I didn\u2019t use them my first year and failed out of a class but the second year it made me feel like myself again bitch (minus the 6 week adjustment period where I hated everything and had borderline intestine issues) and my greatest fear as a social scientist, math, became MY bitch.\n\n I managed to turn around quite nicely to collaborate with a professor (who I thought hated me), went to one conference (and got accepted to two others one of which is outside the US), and submit a paper to a journal for publication.\n\nAlso counseling helps a ton. My counselor usually takes on art students but I\u2019ve been with my therapist for a year now and it\u2019s been great! If you do take up counseling chances are that you won\u2019t like your first counselor so you\u2019ll need to shop around for one.",
