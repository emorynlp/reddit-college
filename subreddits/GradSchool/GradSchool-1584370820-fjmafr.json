This can be a really unproductive and lonely time for a lot of us, so let's all share some tips! Here are some of mine:\n\n1. Prepare yourself for the day like you're actually going to campus/into lab. I find I'm MUCH more productive when I get dressed like I'm about to go up to campus even though I am basically sitting in front of my computer all day writing manuscripts.\n2. Set a schedule for yourself like you're actually at work. For me, that's a wakeup time around 7:30 A.M. and seated in front of my computer fully dressed with a cup of coffee by 9:30 A.M. at the latest. Lunch around noon, back to work around 1-1:30 P.M. I usually finish up around 4:30 P.M.\n3. Make a list of your to-do for the day. I have a bullet journal-esque planner that has convenient little checkboxes in it so I can fill in tasks. I HAVE to get things out on paper to plan out my day, and there's a big sense of accomplishment associated with checking off a task! Apps like Asana are great for organizing yourself too, if you'd rather use your phone or computer to get organized.\n4. Use the Pomodoro Technique to time your work. There is an app for this that I use called Focus Keeper. It allows you to work for 25 minutes at a time with 5 minute breaks in between, and then eventually a long 25-minute break every 2 hours or so. You can also customize it if that system doesn't work for your work style. It's very helpful for keeping yourself on task (something I can tend to struggle with)!\n5. Find or build a playlist on Spotify or Apple Music that gets you motivated! I have a big video game theme playlist (24+ hours) on Spotify that I love to use during work. Here is the link since people are asking for it:  [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Pzqw1oWA3kIQUAClZ9hxc?si=P5\\_gs3v9S1iWSP6QsEhk6A](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Pzqw1oWA3kIQUAClZ9hxc?si=P5_gs3v9S1iWSP6QsEhk6A)\n6. Make your space comfortable. I would not recommend working in bed; I literally just fall asleep when I do. I either sit at my desk or my kitchen table when I work. Find a spot that works for you and keeps you focused. I like to have sunlight, an outside view, and light a candle when I am working.\n7. Order takeout! Support local businesses, if you have the means to do so and get sick of cooking all the time. I'm trying to support local Chinese and Asian businesses as much as possible during this tough time.\n8. Maintain social distancing when/if you have to go into lab. Change gloves frequently, wipe down computers and instrumentation regularly. Keep hand sanitizer in the office, etc. Try to maintain distance with other lab members as often as possible!\n\nThese are just a few things keeping me going during this difficult time. Please share some of your faves! I think many of us could use all the help we can get!\n\nEdit:  Added another tip and the playlist link.", "author": "callofspacey", "created": 1584370820, "retrieved": 1632953275, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"g28fou1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/g28fou1/", "text": "Definitely a great list!", "author": "Sudestbrewer", "created": 1597944836, "upvotes": 2}, "fkq8rtz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fkq8rtz/", "text": "Great list of tips.

I regularly work from home, so I\u2019ll add a few things that I\u2019ve found to be helpful (sorry for mobile formatting):\n- Time yourself when you\u2019re actually doing work. When you take breaks (which you should!) or find a distraction (which you will!) pause your timer. This has helped keep me accountable. Sometimes I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve worked a long day (like 9-6) and then look at how much time I\u2019ve actually worked and it\u2019s only like 4.5 hours. So over time I\u2019ve learned that my feelings about how much I\u2019ve worked are not a great metric for evaluating my work, and in a way this has set me free. Now, when I reach my daily goal (6 hours, determined by research into productivity) I quit for the day knowing that I did a \u201cgood\u201d job. I\u2019ve also found that over time this has helped me find work-life balance and lessened episodes of burnout. \n- Call someone on the phone in the evenings. If you work from home, you can go a whole day without talking to anyone. Call your friends who are also hopefully practicing precautionary self-isolation. If you usually go out for drinks with someone, FaceTime while each of you have a drink in your house. Connecting during your off-hours is crucial for being productive during your work-hours. \n- I\u2019ve realized that if my house feels cluttered and untidy, so does my mind. So if you\u2019re finding it hard to concentrate, perhaps it\u2019s an environmental thing. Set a timer and clean/tidy for 15 min (you can get a lot done!) and see if you can then return to work. \n- Find some joy in domestic tasks, especially the ones you\u2019ve been putting off. Make these experiences pleasant by throwing on a dance playlist or your favorite Netflix show. Light your fancy candles; take the time to cook a good meal; launder your bed sheets; clean out your junk drawer; etc. If you\u2019re going to be stuck at home, make the most of it. I think this is helpful for subconsciously re-coding home as a place of productivity and accomplishment in many areas of life. And again, if home is a nice place, then working there will be more pleasant. \n- Take breaks to stretch and walk around. Truly. Most of us don\u2019t have the most ergonomic home work office, especially those of us who may be new to this. Your back WILL hurt if you sit at your dining room table for 3 hours straight, and if you\u2019re in pain you probably won\u2019t want to continue working.", "author": "slipperqueen", "created": 1584378521, "upvotes": 20}, "fko1m73": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fko1m73/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1584378327, "upvotes": 42}, "fknzz90": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fknzz90/", "text": "*cries in virologist* there\u2019s no way they\u2019re ever letting us go home lol", "author": "SecretAgentIceBat", "created": 1584377376, "upvotes": 26}, "fknya4o": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fknya4o/", "text": "These are all the things I\u2019m telling my friendos. \n\nMy only problem now is my adorable doggo who will sometimes come pester me to pet and play.

Even if it's just opposite ends of a kitchen table, respect each other's space.\n   * Establish some signals for working vs not working (e.g., headphones on, scheduled work time, etc.)\n   * Edited to add: Text each other instead of interrupting! Just like you would have to do if you were physically at work.\n* If you feel **stuck or bored throughout the day**:\n   * Clean your desk & start over\n   * Change your perch! Move from your desk to the couch (if you can work there) or the dinner table and treat it like you're at a coffee shop.\n* If you start **feeling lazy after a few days** starting wfh:\n   * Keep a routine (it sucks and sometimes you won't want to, but it helps)\n   * When you wake up, dress like it\u2019s a normal day (i.e., don\u2019t lounge in pajamas if you\u2019re feeling lazy. If PJ\u2019s make you happy and you\u2019re not feeling lazy, go for it)\n\n**Other general tips!**\n\n* Get started as soon as possible in the morning w/o thinking about the act of starting work (just get to your day\u2019s todo list asap).\n* I already said this, but to expand on it: I try to have multiple perches for working. I treat my kitchen table like a coffee shop table. Bring stuff over, make a coffee (take a break), and reorganize my thoughts. Then completely clear it up (\"leave the coffee shop\") when I'm done.\n* Mimic your setup at work as much as possible (if you like your setup at work).\n* If the budget allows, invest in some convenience items, like a good monitor. (inb4 \"a second monitor is necessary!\" I agree! This tip isn't aimed at you since you probably already have one.)\n* If you have a partner also doing remote work, MAKE A SCHEDULE FOR CONFERENCE CALLS. We live in a studio and have one desk in a walk-in closet, and one in the main room. This works for us (mostly) except we cannot use the bathroom when the other person is on a call. To deal with this, we started a shared calendar to let each other know when we have voice-only vs video calls and which ones are super important (meeting w/ PIs) vs occasionally interruptible (chats w/ other grad students, mentoring ugrads). Even if you're not in a studio, it's helpful to know when you can go bug the other person or not.", "author": "minniesnowtah", "created": 1584374017, "upvotes": 84}, "fknu6n1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fknu6n1/", "text": "[deleted]", "author": null, "created": 1584373997, "upvotes": 6}, "fkntbi3": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fjmafr/a_guide_for_working_from_home_as_a_graduate/fkntbi3/", "text": "Great list!
