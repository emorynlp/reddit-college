After 4 years of slogging through a stressful schedule in my college in India, I was asked to leave everything without any ceremony. I felt cheated. 4 years of my life and all my memories in that campus all just disappeared unceremoniously. I lost my pet cat which I had brought up since it was 4 weeks old. I never got to say bye to the places I spent hours building RC airplanes for fun. I never got to say goodbye to my friends in person. It kind of broke me, and my life has been downhill since.\n\nHere's my advice, this is basically everything I wish I had done, looking back. When all this COVID crisis is done, get your gang together, and celebrate. Do the whole ceremony thing, make it your own. It'll be more fun than the real thing could ever have been. Go back to the university, walk around, talk to familiar faces. Don't live on with regrets like me.\n\nP.S.

The end of this degree has really put a lot of strain on me, and I feel very exploited. The last thing I want to do is spend forced social time with the people who continually shifted the requirements on me.\n\nThat sounds bad, but I feel like graduate school really took a toll on my mental wellbeing and I'd rather it just be done.
