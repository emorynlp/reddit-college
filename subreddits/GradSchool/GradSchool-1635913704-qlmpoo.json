  "text": "Hello, I am from the Philippines. I am looking for a university that offers a master's in aquaculture or any related fields in fisheries. I believe that the research in Europe is superior to ours, no offense \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udded. \n\nI've been looking up potential universities online.  Well, the problem now is in applying for a student visa  I need to have a certain amount of money. Given the economy we have in the Philippines, a 1000 Euro in my country is a huge amount. \n\nIs there any scholarship I can apply for foreign students in my field of choice?\n\nThank you.",
