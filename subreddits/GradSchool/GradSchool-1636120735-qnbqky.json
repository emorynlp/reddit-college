  "text": "I\u2019m in my first yr, second rotation out of 3. I\u2019m really split between these first two labs and I was wondering if anyone could give me any perspective. Sorry for the long rant. \n\nMy first rotation was great, loved the lab environment, everyone was very friendly and helpful and always chatting/discussing issues throughout the day. The PI is new and as such has a lot of time to focus on us, and he\u2019s super present in a very nonchalant way. There to teach me techniques hands on, door always open policy, always checks in at the end of the day before he leaves. It just really felt like he cared about our progress and was there to help. Furthermore, he impressed me with how organized he was about mentoring. He has a \u201ccontract\u201d of sorts that outlines goals (research and career) and uses it to keep everyone on track and always brings our discussions on research back to what career you want and to get that out of your PhD. Very big on staying up to date on papers in our field released very week. All great, however while I\u2019m very interested in the lab and think I\u2019ll learn a lot, it\u2019s a very specific field and im not sure I want a career so so specified that also boils down a lot to working at a screen. I really love bench work and an industry job coming from this lab would probably focus more on the computational parts than the wet lab ones. \n\nMy second rotation has been a COMPLETE 180. This lab also has a new PI but it\u2019s a very large lab with many post docs and only 1 other grad student (for both labs id only be the 2nd grad student ever). The PI is very busy and hands off, only meeting once a week for lab weeks and then if you have results to show and discuss what next step the student would like to take. Essentially, I know grad school is about forging your own research, but this feels very much like being thrown in the deep end. I love the research topic, it\u2019s actually precisely what I went into grad school to study, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m prepared or will be able to succeed in such an independent lab environment. Everyone is very nice but, as it should be, no one has studied what my research project would be and so I can\u2019t get much help. Furthermore, I\u2019ve always had protocols to start out with and adapt from there so I have some baseline to work from. Not here. First time I\u2019ve ever had to search literature to even figure out a buffer (great experience but very confusing). I\u2019m only a few weeks into this rotation so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019ll get better once I have more fitting. But so far I feel very overwhelmed and in just these few weeks I\u2019ve gotten a lot of anxiety and doubt in myself. Oh and have I mentioned the project isn\u2019t funded yet? \n\nEssentially, does anyone have any advice on weighing career disciplines vs lab environment? How did you guys choose?",

      "text": "I was the first grad student in my PI's lab and had an overall good experience. My PI was pretty much the exact same as how you described the first one. I believe having that type of mentorship can be really beneficial, especially when career-planning and making sure you stay on task while developing your project. I'm a firm believer in positive lab environment (whatever that means for you). Is the research similar to what you were hoping to do? In terms of the second lab, I know you said no one has studied what your research project would be but are they doing anything similar? Or your project is the odd one out? Is there a postdoc in that lab you think would be available to mentor you in a way?\n\nWhat are your career aspirations?",
