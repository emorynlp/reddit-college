I switched from another lab into my current PI's lab, so really I'm just happy to have a PI who is respectful towards me and is involving me in enjoyable research. \n\nThey are very busy, so it's not uncommon for emails to go a few days without response or no response at all, which means I tend to only email if urgent or scheduling something. I find that at our meetings, every few weeks, I'm racing against the clock to get all the questions I can out.\n\nAs I'm hoping to defend by end of this school year, I'm worried with the lack of communication I might end up in a situation where my thesis defence gets delayed, etc.  I understand I can't really change the way that people act, but has anyone been in this situation?\n\nShould I start sending updates on the regular to my PI, even if not asked for? accept how it is? try to send more frequent follow ups? any tips are appreciated.", "author": "SilentPapaya", "created": 1631584968, "retrieved": 1632844578, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcrvwr2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pntjre/how_do_i_have_better_communication_with_my_pi/hcrvwr2/", "text": "Every PI is different, but here are some things that have helped me \"manage\" my extremely busy co-advisor:\n\n* Check with other students if there's a platform your PI is more active on that you've accidentally been left off of. My co-advisor didn't add me to his lab Slack, or even mention it, for months since he assumed I had been added and just wasn't using it (to be fair, he has another student with the same first name as me)\n* Schedule a standing meeting with your PI for every week or every two weeks, rather than schedule meetings one at a time as needed.\n* Absolutely do send regular updates, even if you don't have a question or it wasn't asked for! It's important to keep your PI on top of what you're up to, even if you don't get immediate feedback. This also means that you don't have to spend so much time on updates when you do meet.\n* See if you can develop a relationship with someone who can help answer your questions more quickly when you need help. This might be another faculty co-advisor or a postdoc in the lab.", "author": "aggressive-teaspoon", "created": 1631587943, "upvotes": 5}}}
