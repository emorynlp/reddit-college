  "text": "Hi all,\n\nIn a few weeks my advisor is planning to have all of his advisees get together for an in-person seminar where we are expected to present our thesis proposals and give feedback to each other. Any tips for getting ready to present a proposal? Should I reach out for a one-on-one meeting with my advisor to see what I can work on in the meantime? We submitted our proposals about a week and a half ago, but haven't received any news about anything yet.\n\nWhat should a good thesis proposal contain? Mine had an introduction, a short literature review, a data/methodology section, but no preliminary results or anything substantial IMO... what can I do to prepare for this presentation? I'm beyond clueless and anxious about this. Would appreciate any tips on proposal content, public speaking, etc.",
