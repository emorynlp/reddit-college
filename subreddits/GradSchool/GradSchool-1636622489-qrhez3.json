  "text": "I'm just posting a small rant to publicize my worries and anxiety about my applications to graduate programs. Just to highlight, I would really appreciate it if even one person comments or gives me feedback, but this is more for myself, as a kind of method to vent out my frustrations and to resolve myself into becoming a better person. This method worked when I wanted to quit a \"certain substance\" and I have been confidently 2 months clean since then.\n\nIn any case, if you read my title, you should know what I'm about to talk about. In an effort to keep it short, I am an undergraduate about to graduate with my BS in Biotechnology. My four years in undergraduate studies came a lot faster than I thought and now I was on the cusp of graduating, but my heart wasn't into leaving the school life I had grown so accustomed too. I decided that jumping into a graduate program was the way to go. It seemed like I was fairly well-set, since I had a fairly competitive GPA, lots of experience in a couple labs, and even a poster presentation at an undergraduate research conference.\n\nWhen I say it like that, it seems fine, right? Nope. As my last year as an undergraduate came to a close, I slowly became more consumed with anxiety.  I was constantly finding myself having little to nothing to show for my research in weekly lab meetings, was coming into the lab less, just all-in-all not doing my due diligence. I'm an undergraduate. I know I'm supposed to be learning and that my PI doesn't expect concrete research from me. Nevertheless, I began to slack off, feeling lazy and despondent over the prospect of graduation, feeling burnt out, if feeling burnt out lasts for months straight. I made my worries clear and my PI allowed me time to come back invigorated, which I did, until my last semester came up. Now it was the semester when some of my Master's and PhD graduate applications were due. I didn't work on them at all, except for one, the graduate CMB program at my local medical school, the very same medical school I did and am doing my undergraduate research at.\n\nNow there's only a couple weeks left until some of my graduate applications are due, so like breaking out of a trance, I hurriedly emailed a couple of professors for letters of recommendation, but instantly regretted it, knowing how absurd my requests were. Why did I stall for so long? Nevertheless, I still had time to ask for letters for the CMB program, since the application was due at a later date and I had already completed a lot of the material needed. It seems super silly, but what broke me was the process of asking for letters of recommendation, which I should have done well in advance. I felt confident in writing out my personal statement, essentially \"selling\" myself, as I always had a knack for writing, but I felt so pathetic when I hurriedly asked a couple professors for letters weeks before the application turn-in date. I realized that, perhaps, I was holding myself back from applying to graduate school.\n\nIt took me a day's worth of thinking to realize, I needed more time to think about my future. I know I have a love for research, but my laziness and inability to start my graduate school applications means that I need to fundamentally change myself so that in the future, I don't hurt my career and myself like this ever again. I've decided to only apply for that CMB program I mentioned earlier, since I really do believe that if I enter into their program, I can do well. Since it's an all-or-nothing approach, if I get rejected, I was planning on working, which I was planning on doing anyways since I'm graduating this fall and the new semester for my CMB program starts in fall, leaving me with a whole semester to take a break from school.\n\nI'm leaving my mark on eternal Reddit history to resolve myself to stay committed and to take care of myself, but most importantly, to understand myself and to understand what I want to do.

      "text": "This sounds really rough! I'm sorry to hear you've been so overwhelmed. It seems pretty miserable. Here's my two cents.\n\nYes, grad school applications SUCK. There isn't really any way to get around that. On top of that, you're in recovery. Honestly, you should pat yourself on the back for that! You. Are. Awesome.\n\nSo. Those applications. Let's talk about LOR, because that seems to be one of the biggest hurdles you're facing.\n\nI can't speak for your field of study, but I know for mine the norm is to write your own LOR. You write the bulk of it and leave some blanks for your professor/colleague/whomever to complete. It may seem strange and a little cringe to write about how awesome you are, but it is what it is. Of course, check with other alumni or associates to make sure it's the same for your field (I initially thought it seemed shady and unethical, but even the people working in admissions assured me it was the norm and basically considered a courtesy since you're presumably making a large request of a very busy professional). Doing the majority of the LOR yourself makes your ask a little more reasonable, even if it's last minute.\n\nOn top of this, make it as simple for them as possible. Let them know how much you appreciate it. Thank them afterwards. Once you're a little deeper into your program, follow up with them with an update on how it's going and let them know you haven't forgotten about they way they stepped up for you. It takes 30 seconds and in my experience, they really appreciate it. It's not too late to salvage your LOR, so I hope that's something.\n\nUltimately, though, it looks like your mental health is really suffering. If you don't address some of the underlying issues contributing to your exhaustion, even if you get your grad school applications in and are accepted into your school/program of choice, those issues are probably going to pop up again. Do you need a break before starting your grad work? Some time to recoup and rest? Do you have solid people around you who you can talk to? Do you have access to counseling services from a licensed mental health care professional? Do you have some good tools to help you take care of yourself? We all need support, so I hope you're able to get some and start feeling better soon.\n\nWhatever you end up doing/deciding, you've already accomplished something great by choosing recovery and this random internet stranger is thrilled for you! Good luck with everything.",
