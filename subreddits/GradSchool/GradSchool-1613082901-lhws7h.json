      "text": "Academics are not really taught to organise themselves properly or how to prioritize and instead are pushed towards doing as much as possible (and more!) as quickly as possible, even if it means cutting corners. Related to that is that most academics can't say no and being super busy is often seen as a measurement for importance and inflicts awe (\"He's also in that committee? Wow!\"). Annoyance only seems to occur when it gets hard to schedule meetings.  \n\nIt's all kind of a result of how broken the academic system is. PIs have multiple tasks which ideally would require a person each. They advertise a labs work, try to keep updated on current research and hypes, organise funding (and decide how to spend it) and have to supervise and teach. If they are extremely lucky they might also actively research but usually that simply isn't possible, instead they just enable others to research and try to put their results into context.  \nIt's actually sad how much the academic system could be improved by splitting these tasks between more people. There would be more permanent positions and PIs could concentrate more on some of these tasks. But academia somehow is scared of anything that resembles a strict hierarchy and refused to invest long-term in a person when there is permanent influx of new graduates, do they simply don't want to create these positions and PIs won't get any funding for it. And you can't put postdocs on these positions as they need other types of output and experience to even have slim chance to survive in academia.\n\n\nSo there's no real solution for your problem. If they pay more attention to your meeting something else will fall short, which will cause even more delays and the carefully balanced \"system\" of your PI might crash.",
