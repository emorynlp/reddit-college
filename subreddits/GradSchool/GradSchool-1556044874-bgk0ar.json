Just two hours ago my committee chair e-mailed me and said \"two committee members (note: I have 3 members total) are concerned about the quality of the content of the thesis. Please meet an hour before your defense to discuss.\" They've had the thesis for a while now, and I've tried to contact her for days now with no response. I've been through ups and downs with this thesis, and I've been working closely with the third committee member to even finish this thing. It's not even as if the two committee members who are \"concerned\" were out of the loop at any time! They could have expressed concern any freaking time last week! I forwarded the e-mail to the third committee member and she is so mad about the situation. It's nice to have at least have one person in my corner.\n\nSafe to say that I was far more confident before that e-mail today, and now I am completely shaken up. I can't imagine that anybody would have agreed to this if my paper was shit, but now I am feeling like it absolutely is a flaming pile of crap. More than anything in the world, I want to be done.\n\nWish me luck, y'all. I'm gonna need it!!\n\nEDIT: It was stupid bullshit drama between the three members, and I got dragged into it.
