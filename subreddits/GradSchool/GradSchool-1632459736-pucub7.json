Almost gave up, woke up from a long slumber of depression to finish my masters. In the process of final submission, I'm so done with all the formatting nonsense.", "text": "Oh my goodness, formatting is such a nightmare. Every software either wants some premium nonsense just for me to add my signature, or completely destroy my formatting once I convert files.\n\nMy thesis is written in Words, but the free software I use do not have Arial Narrow. I edited it with another software for that font (cover page only), but that software screws my formatting (PDF conversion). Damn all this, who fucking cares about whether my cover is Arial or Arial Narrow.\n\nI'm so done. Just sent my thesis and submission form to ny supervisor for signatures, then once she does that, I'll submit that softcopy. Next is spending money to print 5 hardcopies that nobody will ever read.\n\nI'm so done, everyone. I almost gave up, I even remember 2 years ago when I came to this sub. I \"ressurected\" myself to continue, passed my defense, did my corrections, and now I'm soo spent.\n\nI can finally move on with my life!
