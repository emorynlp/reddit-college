  "text": "So I've been getting progressively more frustrated with the poor pay, and have started looking for small gigs. Of course I've gotten a handful... of startups looking to pay stock cause they don't have any money...\n\nAnyone have any luck in building an actual slow but steady stream of gigs related to your field which help to supplement your income.",

Unfortunately for that same reason it doesn't work so well for me as I don't have the needed degree. Plus I'm already involved in a second startup which takes 2 days a week (This one at my supervisors bequest) which gave her an excuse to pay me less. Taking more full days as she'd probably make the argument she didn't have to pay me at all.",
