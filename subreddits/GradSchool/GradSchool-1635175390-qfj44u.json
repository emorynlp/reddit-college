  "title:": "I am defending my dissertation proposal tomorrow",
  "text": "Grad school has really not been what I'd hoped for or expected. My advisor isn't the kind of mentor I thought she was, and I have become increasingly more checked out and demotivated as I've moved through the program. I haven't accomplished many of my goals or done much that I'm proud of. Until quite recently, I wasn't sure I would make it to this point.\n\nA couple months ago, I finally thought to myself, \"I don't think this is normal. I'm not stupid or lazy. I shouldn't be having this much trouble getting things done.\" I reached out to my doctor, and a few weeks and some intense psychological tests later, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I have been taking medicine to treat the ADHD for almost two months now, and it has completely turned my world around. I cranked out a dissertation proposal in a week and feel on top of my projects for the first time in my graduate career. I'm still nervous as hell for my proposal defense, but I do feel prepared and ready to tackle whatever my committee throws at me. \n\nThe issues with my advisor are still there, but they don't feel quite as insurmountable as they used to, and they aren't keeping me from making progress anymore. I'm kicking myself for not considering the possibility of ADHD much earlier, but I am proud of myself for taking care of my mental health, even if it's long overdue. As long as this proposal defense goes well, I think I will be able to make it through the program and graduate in the spring like I'd always hoped.",
