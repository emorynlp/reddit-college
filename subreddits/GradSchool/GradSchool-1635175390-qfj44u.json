  "title:": "I am defending my dissertation proposal tomorrow",
  "text": "Grad school has really not been what I'd hoped for or expected. My advisor isn't the kind of mentor I thought she was, and I have become increasingly more checked out and demotivated as I've moved through the program. I haven't accomplished many of my goals or done much that I'm proud of. Until quite recently, I wasn't sure I would make it to this point.\n\nA couple months ago, I finally thought to myself, \"I don't think this is normal. I'm not stupid or lazy. I shouldn't be having this much trouble getting things done.\" I reached out to my doctor, and a few weeks and some intense psychological tests later, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I have been taking medicine to treat the ADHD for almost two months now, and it has completely turned my world around. I cranked out a dissertation proposal in a week and feel on top of my projects for the first time in my graduate career. I'm still nervous as hell for my proposal defense, but I do feel prepared and ready to tackle whatever my committee throws at me. \n\nThe issues with my advisor are still there, but they don't feel quite as insurmountable as they used to, and they aren't keeping me from making progress anymore. I'm kicking myself for not considering the possibility of ADHD much earlier, but I am proud of myself for taking care of my mental health, even if it's long overdue. As long as this proposal defense goes well, I think I will be able to make it through the program and graduate in the spring like I'd always hoped.",

I'd have to read the same lines over and over to understand them...I never really got into a flow state. \n\nI learned that ADHD is underdiagnosed in women and girls because they don't fit the typical ADHD prototype--a hyperactive little boy who keeps getting in trouble in school. I mentioned this to my doctor and said I'd like to be tested for ADHD.\n\nI was ultimately diagnosed after a bunch of different tests demonstrated a huge discrepancy between my intelligence scores--on tasks of abstract/verbal reasoning, I was in the 99th percentile. But on tasks of working memory and impulse control, I was in the low-average range.",

My whole life I have been an over-achieving go-getter, but over COVID, once I was forced to be still and still be productive, I just lost it all. I've been really struggling cause I feel like academic validation and being over-involved was kind of my identity. Now, in my first real job post-grad and having such a hard time focusing and producing results. It's a complete 180 of the type of worker I was in my undergraduate internships. Doctors suggested I could have ADD or ADHD and should get tested when I was a kid but my parents refused to hear it. Now, as a 22 year old woman, I am finally thinking it's time to go get a diagnosis and get help. Thanks for sharing your experience!!!!",
