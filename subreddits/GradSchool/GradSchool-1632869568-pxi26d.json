This would be no issue, but I think I lost all of my work from undergrad (I have been graduated for a year now). I used Word on a MacBook, and then 1 month before I graduated it broke and I got a Chromebook which I used Google Docs on. I swore I saved at least one or two papers on Docs or emailed them to myself at some point, but nothing is coming up. I don't have access to my student email or Canvas. \nI am thinking my best bet is to just write something new, with a focus in what I would be interested in pursuing further research if I get accepted to a program. I am working a job that would allow me the time to do this, so that wouldn't be an issue. Is this something other folks have done? I know they won't necessarily know or care when it was written, but it just seems like it could come across as trying too hard for the application?

Often as much as grades and GRE scores. \n\nSo you want to put together the best writing sample you can. Whether it's something old that you revise/refine. Or something new.\n\nIf you recently completed your undergraduate degree, and wrote a very good paper your senior year which you submitted digitally to your professor, and received back digitally, your professor may still have a copy of it. You could contact them.\n\nWhat was your undergraduate degree? Did you complete some kind of senior thesis?\n\nAlso, if the writing sample relates in subject matter to the area you hope to study in your Master's, that's also a plus. What area of Communications are you interested in?", "author": "raistlin65", "created": 1632915926, "upvotes": 2}}}
