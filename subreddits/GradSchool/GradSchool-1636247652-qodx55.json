  "text": "I have never observed a thesis defense so I really don\u2019t know what to expect. I\u2019m working on my presentation now where I go over the results of my research study, I know I present for about 15 minutes, I\u2019m asked questions and then I\u2019m kicked out while they decide if I pass or fail, then I\u2019m brought back in. \n\nI\u2019m not worried about failing as much as I am about appearing stupid. I\u2019m worried my anxiety will get the best of me and they\u2019ll ask me about my study (which I\u2019m obviously fully versed in and knowledgeable of) and I will forget the answer and blank. \n\nAny presentation tips?? I\u2019ll definitely meditate before. But any tips on presentation or questions I\u2019m likely to be asked??",

      "text": "Did you have to do a Thesis Proposal meeting? It's basically just that again. \n\nNot knowing an answer is almost always okay. There are so many ways to fudge a response. \"I'm not as familiar with that, but I do know ...\" \n\nYou don't typically get to the point of a thesis defense without your committee being ready to pass you. The assumption from basically all parties is, usually, that you're going to pass.",

      "text": "Is this an undergraduate thesis?\n\nGraduate thesis defenses are not 15 minute presentations, at least not in the sciences. A conference presentation is more along that timeframe. There's usually more than that to talk about anyway, you'd be surprised how little material you can fit in 15 minutes.",
