There are some people I know in this program that have always wanted to be a scholar or that made a very intentional choice to be here and planned carefully to make that happen (even if at times or even frequently they are frustrated with academia). In my case, it felt much more like a random choice, something I backed into when my post undergraduate years started to feel a bit aimless.\n\nWhen I was admitted, I was surprised and impressed (this program is among the most \"prestigious\" in the country). But even then, some part of me truly did not want to go. In fact, I put off accepting the offer even after the deadline to respond. I was scrambling to find another route--applying for new jobs, and so on. But although I loved many parts of my life in my previous city--a good relationship, a good set of friends, and so on--this offer represented a \"career\" path, and I had this feeling at the time that this was the only way forward in that direction. (In retrospect, I see that I had more options that I thought at the time). And because I've always loved the social sciences and social theory, I thought I could do it.  But ultimately, \"chose\" almost feels like the wrong word. I had a bit of a break down, and almost flipped a coin. I don't know exactly how to say this, but it never felt like a choice.\n\nAnd for the last two years here, there have been good moments--the material is often interesting, it is a stable (if small) paycheck, and so on. And externally at least (this is why it is sometimes hard to get feedback on this from people that know me) this is a great opportunity and a great \"fit\" for me. But at the same time, internally there has been an almost constant feeling that this is not it, from the first week I started to the present. Every morning when I wake up, this is the feeling. That this is not the route for me.\n\nI don't have a dissertation project I want to write, and to be honest, I don't necessarily see becoming a professor as a real possibility given the job market (I'm also not really sure I want that). I feel much less intellectually curious and alive than I did when I started, which makes me sad. I hate the culture of academia--I know some people like it and I don't want to contradict their experience, but for me there is this petty competitiveness that feels incredibly empty to me. Bigger picture, it kind of feels like I have been engaged in a multi year scam--pull in a stable paycheck, pretend for everyone around me that I'm actually interested in this so no one gets wiser, and keep kicking the can down the road. But with dissertation proposal deadlines and exams this year, I can only keep this up a bit longer. I either need to buckle down or leave. Again, there are definitely interesting moments. But it feels like I'm living someone else's life. I have a ton of regret for spending the past two years in this way, instead of trying to build a life I actually want.\n\nSo I feel deeply stuck and trapped. But, I don't know what to do. I guess first, I don't know if I should give credibility to any of this. Is this just me being indecisive, and coping with what for anyone is a difficult thing (getting a PhD)? I've worked in other fields and I get there isn't some perfect alternative out there.\n\nOr should I really listen to the voice that tells me to leave and that this place is sucking the life out of me. But the other problem is that I don't have a clear idea of what else to do--what other goal to pursue, where to move, and I don't have much money. So leaving seems incredibly scary.\n\nAny advice?
