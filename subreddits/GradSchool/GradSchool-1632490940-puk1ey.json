Be open to working even when you feel bad. It is still possible to do quality work even when our feelings are not cooperating.\n2. If you feel so bad that you cannot work then try to engage with something else that brings you value. Do chores. Catch up on sleep. Make art. But don't avoid everything all at once.\n\nIf you can think of something that helped you overcome avoidance in other areas of your life then you should apply that here. If you are caught in a cycle of avoidance in other areas of your life, then it is probably time to see this as a bigger issue and contact someone who is an expert on avoidance and anxiety.\n\nI feel for you.

Which just led to even less motivation.  \nSomething that helped was acknowledging that there were emotions causing the behaviours (fear of failure was a big one) and accepting them, and focusing less on the behaviours themselves.

Got a Fulbright to finish my dissertation, though I was sitting pretty. Travel got canceled. Therefore also didnt get the money.  All my interviews are in a language that i speak OK but not well enough to translate full speed hour long interviews in colloquial Tibetan by myself. Nearly impossible to find a reliable translator of this fairly rare language in the US during covid. Really fucked me. Applied to 5 grants and 30+ jobs last year. Didnt get a single interview. even for ones outside of academia. \n\nI've started to pull myself out of it a little. Here's what worked a little\n\nI really lost steam because (i know this will sound cheesy and performative) during covid i was so isolated and felt so selfish and self-centered. I taught in Tibet for 3 years before starting my phd and whenever things got rough during the fist years of my phd i could look at the pictures of my students and remember easily why i wanted to do a phd and my inspiration for doing so. Those kids had lives 10x harder than mine and worked their fucking asses off. They'd stay up all night in the stinky bathroom to study because its where the only light in school was after hours! Surely i could work hard enough to succeed, right!?\n\nBut covid cut me off from them, from the place, from my data, interpreters, purpose, everything. And everything was *there.* i dont really like living in the US, so being stuck at home was doubly bad. \n\nWhat's been working is simply digging deep to remind myself of the reasons I want to get a phd and finish this. I still truly want to understand how minoritized students get fucked in mainstream school and it's still important to me. Reading inspiration biographies of great tibetan saints has been very helpful in this regard! \n\nAnd the second thing thats been working is to break everything into *super* bite-sized chunks. The more desperate we get to finish, the more we want to just crush the thing in a single afternoon, the more overwhelming it seems. You aint gonna finish your dissertation by tomorrow. But i bet you can write one chunk of one argument of one section of one chapter by tomorrow. Rather than trying to get it all perfect on round 1, ive literally just started writing what i think is true.
