I defended my proposal with flying colors in April and I was told that that is a contract and what I need to do in order to graduate. I was also told to shape that proposal into three studies/3 manuscripts.\n\nToday, I had a meeting with my advisor and it turns out that only a small portion of my first study should be in my manuscript and that all of my in-depth analysis will just go in my dissertation and likely not be published. While I trust his knowledge and expertise, I am frustrated that I didn\u2019t know this in advance as the publishable part has been done since July.\n\nNow, I am stripping down the more detailed part into what we bounded in for the manuscript today. How do you stay organized with two drafts that you\u2019re editing in tandem?  One that is your manuscript draft and the other that is the more detailed draft of the dissertation chapter. A lot of the paragraphs are the same so if you edit one of them for clarity you want those changes to go to the other. There has to be a better way than using the compare tool and word or having both documents open and constantly copying and paste (which seems like a good way to make a mistake).", "author": "mldonahu", "created": 1630969385, "retrieved": 1632844757, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
