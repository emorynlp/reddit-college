Advice?", "text": "So basically I have a job in a college library as a library assistant and the college allows me to take classes through them for free. Most of my coworkers have gotten a degree, or are working on one through the school. I already have a masters in Library Science and want to continue to further my education and career, so I can eventually get a job as a \"real librarian\". Most major academic libraries like to see specialization and more than one degree. Currently I have an associates in liberal arts, two bachelors, one in history and one in political science, and a single masters. \n\n\nThe problem is none of the masters programs are things I have any sort of background in and I struggle to see the applicability of all of them, honestly, in all fields, not just libraries. The school is really a business college and I have lived my life so steeped in the social sciences I just don't know how to begin. So while I figure I should be taking advantage of this benefit, (especially since I don't get paid much, so its basically like neglecting to cash a part of my paycheck) I really don't know how to pick a program. The programs I can pick from are: 1) Business Administration (MBA) 2) Education Psychology (MA) 3) Information Systems (MS) 3) Integrated Marketing Communication (MA) 4) Public Administration (MPA) 5) Clinical Mental Health Counseling (MA) 6) Computer Science -Software Development (MS) 7) School Psychology (MA). They also offer two medical programs, 1) Physical Therapy (DPA) and 2) Physician Assistant Studies (MA), but these both require a lot of clinicals that may be hard to do while working full time. \n\n\nFundamentally, I believe I am capable of doing any of these programs. I am smart, determined, organized, and if I decide I am doing something, I will do it. Admittedly, some do seem a bit harder for me than other, like computer science, as math is definitely a weak spot for me. Bur really, they all just seem really boring. The most interesting programs to me are the medical ones, but I just don't see how to practically do them without needing to quit my job to finish the programs. I have read through all of the programs and there is really nothing about any of them that strike me as interesting and something I would sign up for if it wasn't for the fact that I can do this for free.\n\n\nI am looking for any advice, thoughts, or opinions on any of the programs and reasons to or not to choose any of the programs. Literally any thoughts at all would be helpful. Even thoughts on programs that would be stupid to start because I don't have a background in it. Or your own experiences, or anything at all! \n\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts!", "author": "MilkIsSatansCum", "created": 1632500302, "retrieved": 1632952071, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "comments": {"he51gnd": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pun5cu/can_get_a_second_masters_for_free_but_dont_know/he51gnd/", "text": "It sounds like the education or school psychology might be the most relevant?
