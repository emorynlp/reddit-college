  "text": "For context, I'm a psychology student and my GPA is currently 2.7. I'm graduating this December. I just talked with my academic advisor and she was honest with me that my chances are low for grad school. \n\nI've enjoyed psychology since I was in high school and eventually decided I wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in neuroscience. I knew it would be difficult and take a long time but I didn't mind. \n\nFast forward to beginning university and I was no longer able to manage school work while dealing with major depressive disorder like I did in high school. My mental health hit rock bottom and I struggled keeping myself alive for most of the 4 years I've been in college. Of course, my grades suffered as well. Now I'm facing the consequences. \n\nI have no interest in counseling or therapy related jobs but that seems to be all that a bachelor's in psychology is good for. I'm not good at socializing or handling other people's emotional needs. \n\nI feel like I've completely fucked up my whole future and wasted all of my time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears. I have never partied, done drugs or alcohol, or anything else that would be considered blatantly irresponsible to jeopardize my grades. I sacrificed so much and it feels like it was all for nothing. I have no idea what to do now. I don't know what job to look for. \n\nI'm the first in my family to complete a college degree, so I can't really seek advice from them. I never made any friends because I'm a recluse. I was so sure I was going to be successful and get the job I wanted and now I'm fucking lost. This is really destroying my brain. I feel like I let myself and my whole family down.\n\nAny and all advice wholeheartedly welcomed... sorry about any typos I'm bawling and can't be bothered.",

Grad school will be even harder than undergrad.\n\nSo perhaps you might want to get a job, and take some time for yourself to get to where you're not struggling?",

I\u2019m not in the psych field so I can\u2019t offer a ton of advice on what kind of jobs are out there after graduation, but you are getting a degree! Completing a college degree, especially as a first generation student is an amazing achievement that should be celebrated! \n\nIn terms of fields to explore out there, a psychology degree can actually give you a wide range of opportunities outside of what you consider \u201cpure psych (therapy, etc).\u201d I\u2019d look into entry level business jobs (specifically related to sales, marketing, advertising, or market research), as well as things like Human Resources (HR), recruitment, and even case management/coaching.",

What I did was enter the workforce and then slowly take some (graded) classes as a university special student to prove I was actually capable of succeeding academically once I got my meds sorted. I paid out of pocket for 1-2 classes a semester for several years to establish a pattern of academic success. Since I was a special student and not an auditor, all classes were graded and those transcripts were submitted along with my undergrad transcripts.",

Also you don't have to go to Harvard and you don't have to do human neuroscience per se. Plenty of R2 schools do interesting research in fish and rats and such. Another thing is having an advisor that wants you. I got into my program by reading research I liked. When I found a name that showed up really consistently I emailed that professor and just basically said \"hey I really like x,y and z publications of yours. Can you tell me more about them. Also, is there any chance I could do a masters under you in the next few years?\" He emailed me back and we met on zoom and talked for a while and then he offered me a fully funded PhD position instead of a masters.",

I'm also about halfway done my master's degree in a top 10 school for my field.\n\nGrad school applications will give you an opportunity to submit supplemental information, which is a great chance to make your case. I read a lot about not going into specifics because of the stigma against mental illness, but essentially I was like, I struggled with a, b, c in undergraduate and it affected my grades; since then, I've done x, y, z to prevent the same thing happening in grad school. I was conditionally admitted, but all that meant is I had to take the same prereqs as I would have had to anyway.\n\nIt also helped that I got a staff position at the university I wanted to apply to--this won't work for everybody, but I think it helped that I was contacting the admissions counselor from an internal email (I also got very discounted tuition). \n\nMost importantly, a couple years out of undergrad, I was more financially secure, could access treatment more regularly (on-campus care was a joke), and had a support system and a regular schedule that just made grad school so, so much easier than undergrad.",

I bet they\u2019re really excited for you and super proud. You should be proud of yourself. You worked really hard. \n\nYou didn\u2019t fuck up your whole future. Your GPA just isn\u2019t as high as you\u2019d like. Honestly, you\u2019re in the same boat as a lot of students in this pandemic. The last couple years you\u2019ve been in school have been extra challenging. And look at you, you still persevered and got that degree. \n\nI know what it\u2019s like to have that career dream. I know how much it means to you. However, I hope that right now you can let yourself enjoy your success. \n\nI think now is a good time to turn your focus inwards and really aggressively treat your depression. First of all, you deserve to feel better. This is a hell of an illness. I\u2019m so glad to hear you\u2019re having some success with treatment now. Second, you best bet for your future plans is developing a treatment plan that you feel comfortable with in the longer term. Grad school can be really stressful, so you want to have a support system in place. \n\nOnce you feel like that\u2019s going a bit better, you can turn your focus to grad school. You will probably want to look at master\u2019s programs to get your foot in the door. \n\nAnother thing to do if at all possible is to network. If you can do some research in a lab, that\u2019s great. If you can attend a conference, or present at one, awesome. It\u2019s hard to meet people, especially in plague times, but if you can connect with potential advisors, all the better. \n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s totally okay to take a year or two off between undergrad and grad school. It\u2019s okay if you have to apply during a couple of admissions cycles. It\u2019s okay if your research and career interests change! \n\nBut really, take things one step at a time, please. Right now you should be celebrating your hard work. The rest you can figure out down the line.",

Now they should not only let you in because you\u2019re a fighter, but also because your mental health disability increases the diversity of their team which will impact everyone in a positive way.  You could try this now, but grad school is really hard on mental health so get that sorted out to where you have a strong toolbox and support system.  \n\nI also highly advocate for getting some work in before a PhD.  It really helps you develop some focus interest areas before you start.  There are a lot of private research companies doing social science research which you\u2019re perfectly qualified for and will develop your skills to further prepare you for grad school.",
