  "text": "Hi all, I\u2019m (22F) a recent college grad looking into master\u2019s programs in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology for the next academic year. I\u2019m currently taking a gap year to look into and apply to programs, but I\u2019m struggling to find employment and/or experiences that will help me become a competitive applicant. \n\nI worked in biotech for a few months but it didn\u2019t work out, and now I have a retail job lined up. I have experience doing research in herpetology and I completed a thesis during my undergrad. I also have administrative/office experience but I haven\u2019t had any luck while applying to those jobs. \n\nI want to do something that will make my CV stand out more or will provide more experience to prepare for grad school in general. Should I take community college classes? Volunteer somewhere? I don\u2019t know what to do or who to ask for help. Im starting to feel lost. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",

Also check USAJobs for biotech opportunities. Texas a&m job board may also have a section for that.",

          "text": "Oh also: if there are natural history museums or zoos near you, they may have relevant positions in the general arena, if not your particular field of research. Also contact old professors and ask about helping in their labs. Unfortunately a lot of these suggestions are unpaid, but that seems to be the general problem in academia",
