  "text": "Some back story: Ten years ago when I was stoner idiot 18 year old, I was an English literature major at a Cal State and was kicked out after a few years. I travelled, and worked for five years and went back to school as a Math major. It's worked out really well for me so far, my grades at my community college have been awesome! And since transferring to my four year this semester they've been even better. \n\nNow that I only have roughly three semesters left of undergrad, I am looking into grad school for a masters in Mathematics. I was told by an advisor last spring that a majority of grad schools really only focus on your last 40 credits. Which for me, would be AWESOME! It would be mostly A's with some B's sprinkled in there. \n\nUnfortunately, my OVERALL GPA spanning all three schools sucks....A LOT. Which is unfortunate because all of my math coursework has been done well over the last three years since going back to school. But it's still not enough to really truly boost the overall. My GPA from my CC and my current Cal state is definitely good enough for programs though. \n\nAm I ruined? Will I be able to get into a program? \n\nNote: My current CSU doesn't have a Master's in Mathematics for anyone who might ask.",

      "text": "Make it clear on your personal statement that you fooled around, got kicked out, and then turned it around when you started again. They'll also likely ask for all your transcripts and see the crap grades from Cal State several years ago and see the different, recent transcripts with your new major and better grades.\n\nIdk if math works the way natural sciences tend to, where you search out an advisor and position first and the acceptance is more a formality, but if it is, be upfront about it.\n\nYou may also want to list your major GPA on your resume/CV, or your CSU-only GPA or something like that, so long as you do state what it is.",

      "text": "They will often want transcripts from every college you attended, and will ask for both your cumulative GPA and major GPA. Your poor cumulative GPA may not be a huge barrier depending on the program, the requirements, your other application materials, your potential adviser, and your statement of purpose. For a math program, I don't know that they really care if you made a C in introductory English literature as much as they'd care if you made a C in calculus. \n\nHowever, there are also people applying who made A's in introductory English literature while also making A's in calculus, so admissions can really be  a crap shoot.",

I know the best way to get into my lab (Which is engg so not exactly the same) is to email my supervisor. If she's looking for someone she'll typically meet with the person to get a feel for them and then make a decision from that over just looking at your transcript. \n\nYou won't get your first choice, but you'll likely get a decent school that way.",
