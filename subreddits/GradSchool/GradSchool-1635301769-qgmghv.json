  "text": "Some back story: Ten years ago when I was stoner idiot 18 year old, I was an English literature major at a Cal State and was kicked out after a few years. I travelled, and worked for five years and went back to school as a Math major. It's worked out really well for me so far, my grades at my community college have been awesome! And since transferring to my four year this semester they've been even better. \n\nNow that I only have roughly three semesters left of undergrad, I am looking into grad school for a masters in Mathematics. I was told by an advisor last spring that a majority of grad schools really only focus on your last 40 credits. Which for me, would be AWESOME! It would be mostly A's with some B's sprinkled in there. \n\nUnfortunately, my OVERALL GPA spanning all three schools sucks....A LOT. Which is unfortunate because all of my math coursework has been done well over the last three years since going back to school. But it's still not enough to really truly boost the overall. My GPA from my CC and my current Cal state is definitely good enough for programs though. \n\nAm I ruined? Will I be able to get into a program? \n\nNote: My current CSU doesn't have a Master's in Mathematics for anyone who might ask.",
