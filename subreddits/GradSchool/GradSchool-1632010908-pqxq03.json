Though I'm thinking I'm going to have to stop, it's ridiculous what publishers and reviewers want. Science should be built on more replications!\n\nI peer review too, and there are tons of great papers out there that should be published but they aren't because of a variety of reasons from my co-reviewers or the editor. Most I disagree with and they are often highly nitpicky often times. I hate it when good science gets rejected.\n\nI also recently got one comment, different paper. This is too controversial.

I know you're not necessarily soliciting advice here, but if I may be so bold as to offer some anyway?\n\nYou said that you often do meta-analysis or replication with extensions. Perhaps that exact work would be easier to publish and to please reviewers and editors alike with if you simply reframe it to focus less on what has already been done and more on what your work adds. You can (and should!) discuss the way that your work confirms or does not confirm prior work, but that should not be presented as the core contribution when writing titles, abstracts, and introductions unless confirming or not confirming this is a really big deal in itself.\n\nInstead of, for example,\n\n\"We performed an experiment according to the methodology laid out in So-and-so et al.
