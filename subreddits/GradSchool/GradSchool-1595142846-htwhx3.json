It's nowhere in the slightest near a blog post format, but it's meant to address the questions of \"what are the rules of doing well\" or \"what should I know before I start\". Maybe you might find this useful or maybe you might want to modify it to make it more.....legible/succinct?\n\n\n\nI just finished my stem doctorate, and while I think it's worth mentioning what I did do, I strongly feel like I should mention what I sorely regret I didn't do. All of this I either did, or realized much too late that I should have done/been doing. \n\n1. Develop healthy habits before starting and maintain them. Get a good sleep schedule. Eat well and balanced. Work out. Be a hydro homie (seriously these four will go a long way to help you through grad school although they may seem an afterthought.). Keep a journal of it all if it helps you stay on track. Best to have the habits by the time you start. \n\n2. Don't be bashful and put yourself out there. I am assuming you will have some resources in your program and you should make as much use of them as you can. Register your mental/otherwise disabilities with the campus disability org if that's a thing. Talk regularly with your program coordinator(s) one on one. Do the same for ALL of your committee members. Develop relationships with them all such that they will go to bat for you.\n\n3. Find friends and stick with them. Grad school is gonna be tough at times. It's probably easiest to do this with other members of your cohort/program. You will learn from each other but also keep each other in check and reign each other in when stress happens. Find cool, relieving things to do them. For example, I picked up D&D with my group of friends (albeit it was year 4, but a great discovery late is better than never).\n\n4. Do your homework on whose lab/group you join (who your PI/adviser is). Hate to be this person, but it's the truth that some advisers are manipulative assholes and grad students know it. Go into it with an open mind, but ask current grad students honestly and earnestly what their groups/advisers are like. \"What do you like? What don't you like? What do you do for fun?\" Just these three questions can give you hints as to whether a person is a true mentor or a slave driver. Do you want to be regularly working weekends for example? Are you that driven? Ask the current grad students about these things if you are in a position of rotating (I realize you are master's and may be different than PhD).\n\n5. In relationship to #4, set boundaries when you need to. If you don't, some advisers may take advantage of that. I think I always had a knack for being a people-pleaser, and then in two instances, my advisers started taking advantage of that, then I responded with boundaries later than I should have (I see in hind sight). Manipulative advisers don't like that. \n\n6. In relationship to #2, 4, and 5 - never isolate yourself. Never just yourself and your PI. DO NOT. There was a time for months on end, I would go to lab, work all day, go home, veg out and watch TV, go to bed, and then repeat. Pepper this in with meetings with an advisor during times when my research just 'didnt work'. No relief with friends, no outside perspective, no contact with my program managers that make sure the students graduate, no attempt at my well being through working out, having good habits. When it gets tough, you want your safety nets up and ready.\n\n7. Install and get comfortable with an article archiving/citation program. I strongly recommend Mendeley Desktop. When it comes time to write citations and bibliographies, your future self with thank you greatly. Make sure to manually curate old articles with these programs as their scanning doesn't work well on old articles that they themselves are xeroxed.\n\n8. Set away time for yourself each week to do something unrelated to grad school (maybe put this in your journal too). What do you like? Maybe hike, read a horror book, go to an orchard to pick fruit, a museum. Do something to remind yourself you do have a life that isn't school. \n\n9. Make use of campus resources, especially if they are free. Mental health services. Job counseling. Tutoring. You name it. \n\n10. Think about your next step (gradschool or jobs) BEFORE you get to the end. Do the networking and put in the elbo grease you need during grad school so the transition is seamless. Your program will go in a flash and you don't want to be at the end thinking \"well now what?\". \n\n11. Get an indestructible, good backpack. I used to think it was weird how everyone on earth had a North Face backpack, but once I got one, damn I feel like I can go through Hell itself with this backpack. \n\n12. If you can, have the inclination to, keep in touch with family. I realize some of the times I was stressed most, also happened to be the times I ghosted my family. They were also 2100 miles away, but go figure. \n\n13. Keep track of and somewhat steer clear of \"Negative Nancys\" and \"Debbie Downers\" (lol, yes I realize the two memes both have woman names....sorry). In grad school you will always find a certain style of student that can't seem to catch a break, but in addition, they will try to bring down too the others around them. (Also remember just recently how I threw a bunch of points at you about \"evil advisers\"?). Take other peoples' experiences with a grain of salt. Listen to these students and help these students, but don't let them convince you that YOUR sky is falling too. I've known numerous students like this, and more often than not they crash and burn or drop out. Pay attention to whose advice helps and whose doesn't  over the years. \n\n14. Set up your healthcare/bank/etc. services SOON in your new area. You want to bit the ground running, so it's nice to have these resources up and running as you start. \n\n15. Know your program's \"handbook\" like the back of your hand - you know the book that has all the rules and regulations etc. It's only an n = 1, but my program followed theirs to a T. In rare instances, the program and the people who ran it would let certain things go for good reason. Revisit point #2 and realize that you want the people that \"pull the strings\" to know you and go to bat for you. \n\n16. Read a minimum of 2 or 3 articles a week. If you really want to be solid, do an article every day.  Being on top of your fields literature will make you more nimble and will demonstrate to your committee that you're clicking along swimmingly.\n\n17. About #16, read greedily. Don't feel the need that you must always TOTALLY FINISH and comprehend everything about all the articles, (like people do with books or something). Promise, just don't. You'll waste a lot of time, you won't be able to even store that much information, and a lot of it won't even be relevant to you either. Find the article you want, get in, get the info you want, then get out. Did I sometimes miss something Supplemental? Yes. Did it kill me? No. For me this was worth it. Also note, if you always read greedily, then I would recommend doubling the numbers of articles I mentioned in #16.\n\nYou may get the sense from my list that I had a very tough time in school. Maybe half of these things are things I picked up on years in, some not at all. By the end many things started \"clicking\" as to why I had such a tough time. And don't let just my comment convince you that grad school has to be Hell. That all advisers are evil, etc. Your milage will vary. I want to reiterate that it was a bad time for me because I did NOT do what you are doing now, I learned all this on the fly.
