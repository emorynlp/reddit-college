But when other students speak during the class I\u2019d discover flaws and criticisms. How to improve this skill? I want to be more active in class rather than passive.",

      "text": "I\u2019m in a different field, but I can still share my personal methods to improve learning. The first thing you should do is read the material without a sense of awe towards the author. This can be hard initially, as their articulation seems to be at a very high level, and you probably want to write like them one day right? I relate, and I felt similarly when I started reading research by my advisor. But if you look at it as just another piece of reading, it will be much easier to point out potential issues/problems with the author\u2019s argument. Essentially, distance yourself and look at each content paragraph/page carefully. Don\u2019t develop criticisms for each sentence, but try to note potential issues with the thesis of each paragraph/ every 2 paragraphs. Try to think about how you could improve upon the author\u2019s argument. Good luck!",

      "text": "I get what you are saying. I have trouble reading critically, as I genuinely enjoy learning and if it is not something abhorrently stated (e.g., racist or sexist) I don't tend to immediately question it's legitimacy.  For me, it is a skill that has taken a lot of time to develop and I have done this by reading broadly and trying to look at the differences across studies on the same topics, to see which best fits with my own understanding. Another thing that I have found is that I can more readily critically analyse something if I know it well, especially if I have had real world experience of the subject.",
