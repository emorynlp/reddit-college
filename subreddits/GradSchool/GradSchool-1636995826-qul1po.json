  "text": "Hi!  \nI'm a psychology undergrad student looking to apply to HGSE's Human development and education programme in the near future. I will be fresh out of undergrad soon and I'm wondering what kind of work experience is required for admission? Any students of HGSE able to share their classmates' qualifications and do you know if there are any fresh grads in the programme? I have prior  part-time teaching experience (around 2-3 years) but at small learning centres, have done a bit of research as an undergrad, am volunteering as a research assistant in a child development lab and am currently juggling quite a few volunteering roles. I'm trying to see what else I can do to beef up my CV before applying. (Not sure if this is relevant but I am from Singapore and will be applying as an international student)  \n\n\nTLDR: Should I work a full time job before applying to grad school? Or should I do more research? Do people apply to grad school as freshgrads? Any advice will be greatly appreciated!",
