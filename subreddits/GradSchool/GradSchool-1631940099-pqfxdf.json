It\u2019s my weakest area in writing and with every new paper, I feel like I\u2019m wandering in the dark with not much learned from the previous one. \n\nI\u2019m not asking for stats help, but the order/language that should be used and tests that should be included or left out so that I\u2019m meeting journal reviewers\u2019 expectations. I asked my stats prof for more feedback but he just gave extremely vague praise when I know my last paper must have been riddled with errors, things that just aren\u2019t *done*, and language that would have a reviewer shaking their head at my na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\nI\u2019ve got to figure this out before I start my dissertation. Any suggestions on resources are appreciated!\n\nEdit: forgot to mention - my area is in the social sciences.", "author": "FakinItAndMakinIt", "created": 1631940099, "retrieved": 1632952435, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdaya8h": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqfxdf/any_suggestions_on_a_bookguide_to_writing_a/hdaya8h/", "text": "Read the literature from your field.
