  "title:": "Recovering from burnout, but not quickly enough -- how do I communicate this with my professors?",
  "text": "I'm studying for a Master's in Physics (thesis option), which is a 2-year program at my school. Last spring, after years of excess stress, not taking breaks, having a research advisor who was also stressed and burnt out, and a lot of other things not even related to school, I hit a wall. I got so burnt out I was unable to work on school more than one or two days a week and I wasn't able to keep up with chores. I told my professors and was able to get an extension on some assignments so I could finish the two classes I was also taking.\n\nThis year has been better. My research advisor has been more positive and encouraging. I switched apartments and my roommate isn't a bully like the last ones were. I've carved out time for hobbies and I've made relaxation and sleep a priority. Now, towards the end of the semester, I am finally able to work until 9 or 10pm most days, and I'm consistently waking up at a decent time.\n\nBut it's too little too late. I'm still only at about 70% productivity compared to where I was as an undergrad before I got burnt out. I'm having trouble balancing everything I need to work on: TA duties, writing my prospectus, working on the one class I'm taking, research, and applying to PhD programs. According to Canvas grade distributions, I consistently get the lowest grades in the class I'm taking, and I'm one of the last students in our year to get the prospectus written. I get a little better each week, but the work keeps piling up even more, and it's all I can do not to burn out again under all the pressure. How do I communicate this with my professors? I'm afraid I look lazy and stupid",

      "text": "You sound like every grad student lol. Set an organized schedule and do things methodically one piece at a time. This is key, been there\u2026done that. You will adapt, trust me. And don\u2019t be afraid to take the time to de-stress.  If you are still overwhelmed then just sit with your advisor and let them know. If they are nice they will ease up to let you breath, if not they will repeat what I just said. Good luck OP.",

      "text": "First Q is - do you have to do your PhD right away? If you decide to take a year off between your Masters/PhD it might give you some mental relief - enough to push through to the end of your program whilst knowing the stress is bound to alleviate for a little while directly after.\nYour goals are important but so is your well-being in the present. Take it one day at a time, set some expectations for yourself, and stay honest with your advisor about where you\u2019re at. \n\nAlso - remind yourself that you\u2019re in a Master\u2019s program for Physics! The majority of people on this planet that would consider you the exact opposite of lazy or stupid. You are a badass, and you just need some time to breathe. As for talking to your profs, just be honest that it\u2019s been a difficult year and your mental health had been a challenge, but you\u2019re trying to keep up as best you can. Most people will understand and be sympathetic. \n\nTry to remember what\u2019s most important to you at the end of the day, and lead from that.",

I know I couldn't. lol",
