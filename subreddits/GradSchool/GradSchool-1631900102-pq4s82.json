  "text": "I went to the doctor recently and was diagnosed with severely low vitamin B-12. Low to the point where she wanted me to drop everything and come in the office that moment to get an injection, come in weekly for the unforeseeable future, etc. She has no idea how I've been functioning the way I have until now and haven't been making a bigger deal about it. \n\nI've had some memory issues, but I mostly attribute that to some headaches I've had over the past year and years worth of concussions. But after getting this diagnosis. Things are starting to make sense some. In classes, I mostly stay quiet due to anxiety and due to the fact I can never remember anything that happens in the books and my brain screwing up my points/words before I have a chance to say anything. Do I need to tell my professors and advisors what is going on? My only hesitation is because of my headache thing from last year, it was a big deal and I feel bad about having to make yet another excuse for myself. \n\nNo one in my department would make a major thing out of it or belittle me for it so I'm not worried about that in the least bit, I just don't know if it is something I need to bring up. Most of them already know about the anxiety + headaches as a reason for me staying mostly quiet I just don't know if I should add another \"oh by the way my blood is defective\" even though it is probably the root of most of the other problems.\n\nUPDATE: For those curious I emailed my advisor and she was way more than understanding and offered to do whatever she could including driving me to appointments if needed",

I worked as a teaching assistant for a while and it's very helpful for profs/TAs to know if there is something going on so they can understand the situation and provide you with any support you need. At the end of the day, profs and TAs want to see you to succeed in your classes :)",

Then after 3 months you need to go back to get tested and see how it's affecting you. They determined I have problems absorbing vitamin B12, but given enough high amounts of it, the tiny proportion I do absorb eventually hits the normal level. So then they downgraded me to regular store vitamins and downgraded that some more to a letter dose after another blood test showed i was now consistently in the normal range (this whole thing was like a year or two, but now I'm fine just taking one of the B12 vitamins the lowest pill dose everyday)",

      "text": "People below have left some good responses and I just want to chime in as I was supposed to start grad school this fall but had to take a medical deferral until next year\u2026so I guess I have some personal experience with letting a university know about what\u2019s going on with my personal medical experience. I originally worked with the accommodations office at my uni so that if I had any in or out of class medical issues my profs would be fully aware, officially. This included official letters from my physician(s) plus my personal input that was then sent to all my profs so they would know the pertinent info of my medical situation and how to help if I had an emergency situation and also accommodations I would need if certain personal situations would arise. While the deferral is specific and not what you\u2019re asking for, it did involve a lot of communication, and I would recommend that you consider what goal you would have by telling your advisor/profs of your B12 issue. However, telling the accommodations office has no downside really. If you\u2019re not officially enrolled there, they can\u2019t really tell your professors, so if you go there for an info meeting, you could discuss the possible reasons for disclosing the info to your profs. Good luck and I hope your health improves!",
