Imposter syndrome gets talked about a lot in grad school, but no matter how many times people try to reassure me that (a) everyone feels it and (b) the people here deserve to be here, I don't feel all that reassured.\n\nBut it occurred to me today while talking with a friend that I've been/wanted to be a writer since I was 9 years old. I don't think anyone who knew me as a kid is surprised that I wound up in grad school for Writing Studies. I've literally been working towards this for most of my life. so why would I feel unworthy of this stop on that path? \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: if you can hardly make heads or tails of what you're learning, if you don't feel like you have a valuable contribution to make, you still bring something important to your field. You matter.

Plus I can't think of a good topic for my master's thesis (I only have an overtly general idea of what I want). And then there's work and all the pressures included therein.\n\nThese are some of the factors that make me think I just don't belong here.
