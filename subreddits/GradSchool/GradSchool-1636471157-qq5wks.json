  "text": "Burnt out from a long year, only have two units left until graduation if I pass this semester. Big if at this point\u2026.. \n\nI don\u2019t give a shit. I\u2019m so tired and I just can\u2019t fucking care.\n\nOkay, I mean, I think I really do. I have spent the past two weeks literally frozen not going out or doing ANYTHING - just sitting in front of a blank word document. Or crying in despair. Because why is this so hard? \n\nI know I\u2019m smart\u2026 why can\u2019t I just\u2026. Write? \n\nI have spent the past semester panicking about how I wasn\u2019t doing work\u2026 instead of working. \n\nSo, I have 14 days left to write three masters level essays. I really fucked it. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nEverything is like pulling teeth and I just want the fucking job at the end of the tunnel, you know? I\u2019m tired and broke and just want structure. 9-5 mediocrity so I can wear a dumb suit and complain about traffic. At least it\u2019ll be less tortuous than this. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, I\u2019ve always had issues with procrastination and avoidance and submitting stuff late but this is next level. I AM SO CLOSE. SO CLOSE TO GETTING OUT OF UNI FOREVER! So why did I do this? \n\nPlease give me reassurance\u2026 kind words, harsh words. Anything. I have 24 hours to write 3000 words somehow\u2026 \n\nPlease don\u2019t ask me to extend my degree or get extensions. I already have\u2026 multiple times lol. And to drop out at the last minute again? I just can\u2019t put myself through the shame again\u2026\n\nPretty sure I\u2019m not fit for life at this point.",

My advisors haven't been the best guidance or help either.\n\nThis may not work for you but it helped me a lot so far.... focus on WHY you want it. You want that job? Those vacations? Fancy home stereo? The ability to be at the store and say \"yeah, I could buy the extra fancy cheese\"? And maybe most importantly, to have time and money again for your other passions.Get hungry for it, all of it. Whenever you're feeling low remind yourself that this isn't the final goal...this is a step. And you're too far up the staircase to want going back down instead of climbing the last few, Admittedly hardest, steps. You got this. We can all make it.\nEvery day it feels like I have to remind myself but it keeps me going. I hope this helps.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve been through this and I know how hard it is. First, and this is a longer term thing, I can\u2019t recommend therapy enough. You sound fried, and at what I would say is a very high stress level. It\u2019s worth working through this with an expert. If you feel like you need reasonable accommodations for your mental health, please seek them. \n\nSecond, this situation has nothing to do with your intelligence or skills. You are intelligent, knowledgeable, and can write! You\u2019re just maxed out. I feel like acknowledging that helped me \u2013 it\u2019s not me, it\u2019s a moment in time. It will pass. \n\nThird, go for whatever writing hacks help you. \n\n- If you\u2019re stumbling on citations, write first and add them in later. I usually write \u201c(CITATION)\u201d where I want to add them in and move on so I don\u2019t lose my flow. \n\n- If it would help to write in outline format, do that. \n\n- If you\u2019re struggling to figure out what goes in what section, write in \u201cchunks\u201d you can move between sections later. \n\n- If sitting down at your computer feels too stressful but you\u2019re happy to talk about your work, try some dictation software, or just record yourself. Ask a friend to sit down and ask you a few questions, and just talk about things. Or like, message me and tell me about the topic of one of your essays. I\u2019m perfectly happy to listen and I\u2019ll try to ask questions to prompt you. These kind of casual things can be particularly helpful for background or discussion sections, but it can also help if you\u2019re struggling to explain methods.\n\n- If you need a carrot to nudge you along and you like cats, give [Written? Kitten!](http://writtenkitten.co) a try.\n\n- If focusing for long periods of time is hard right now, give the Pomodoro method a try. \n\n- Don\u2019t expect perfection right away. It\u2019s much easier to edit than to write. So get a crappy first draft done and then put energy into edits. \n\nFinally, I know you feel overwhelmed right now. Make sure you take care of yourself. You will not be more productive if you pull all nighters or don\u2019t eat properly. Take scheduled breaks, take a walk or get some exercise, and then come back and re-focus. Give your brain a break. Consider a mindfulness app like Calm or Headspace, or even check out breathing exercise on YouTube. \n\nYou can do this. Take things one step at a time. Be kind to yourself. I believe in you!",

Let yourself be disorganized and incoherent. Sometimes I'll start off writing how much I don't want to be writing and let my angry thoughts about how annoying this research is evolve into talking about the subject. Swear, exaggerate, whatever. Just get the words down.\n\nAlso, over the next two weeks, find a study buddy. Have a friend in person or someone on zoom/discord join you in studying. Share your screens so there's accountability. Set a defined start and end time. Set your goals low low low to start with (\"I will write two sentences about my sample prep in my methods\") and then gradually get more ambitious (\"I will write two paragraphs about zebras for my introduction\"). The goal is to build momentum so you can hit that final push.\n\nClean up your desk. Order delivery. Put on some lofi. Sit down and start on the easiest part of the paper.\n\nIt's gonna be hard.

When someone starts describing his big break as \"9-5 mediocrity\", then, I think, there exists a gap (probably of dark thoughts and fears) between his end goal and his current standing. I suggest that in order to reestablish a close tie between your \"prize\" and productive effort, you need to skew your thinking from what you ultimately want for some time and focus in the meantime on the reasons to keep doing the stuff that worries you (e.g. writing the essays). If it gets too hard look at it from \"whatever happens, happens\"  perspective: do it for no particular purpose, but just because you're sitting on your laptop and you thought \"why not\" whatever the consequence for your decision. Don't think too much about it, even if you're worried you're gonna spend the next 12 hours in front of a plank page. Because believe me, this time is going to pass anyway and you are going to be fine either way when it does.",

Taking away the pressure of trying to be perfect helps to get me moving again. \n\nI tell myself \u201csubmitting something that\u2019s crap is always better than submitting nothing.

Don't aim for perfect at first,; don't aim for good at first; don't even aim for correct spelling, grammar, or structure! You just need to vomit all of your thoughts onto the page as fast as you can. Once they are all out, then you can go back and polish and rearrange them.\n\nYour new motto in this time needs to be \"done is better than good\". Having something on the page will help to ease some of your stress and then you can work on the \"good\" part.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you talk about just wanting to fall into that 9-5 job lifestyle. I would suggest you try to emulate that as much as possible. Set up specific times and places for yourself to work and stick to them.

You absolutely have to keep writing (or researching) for those 50 minutes. And then, for ten minutes you absolutely cannot write at all and you have to get up and walk around, stretch, take a bathroom break, eat, or whatever else that isn't sitting down in front of your computer. After those ten minutes are up, you go back to writing for 50 minutes and taking a break afterward for ten minutes. Repeat it all four times. And then you stop working and walk around outside or exercise or something to get your mind off of the paper (as best you can) once the four hours are up. Do it again the next day and the next day until you're done. \n\nI also struggle to write and I've learned that exercise really, really helps me to focus better. Also, giving myself a limit helps because it helps to ease the pressure of never having done enough writing.\n\nBut like, I totally sympathize with your plight. I used to love school (and I still do usually) but I want to be paid for my stress from now on. No PhD for me. And as you mention, a 9-5 schedule sounds amazing. I'm working and studying from like 9 to 10 everyday and then cramming more studying and cleaning/cooking/errands on the weekends. I really, really don't like that schedule.",

You don\u2019t need to be enthusiastic about everything you write for those papers. They don\u2019t have to be groundbreaking or brilliant. They just need to be reasonably complete. You just need to pass your classes. \n\nSit down and just get words on the page. Make an outline if you need to, or leave little blank spaces where you don\u2019t know what to write. Get something you can work off of, then take a break and do something non-mental: take a walk, stretch, whatever. Come back and add whatever you can. Pad places where you don\u2019t have the time to find enough sources (or don\u2019t have something amazing to say, etc). Make sure it is comprehensible and then turn it in. \n\nI promise, soon you will be on the other side of this. And it is sooooo much easier than grad school, just like you think.
