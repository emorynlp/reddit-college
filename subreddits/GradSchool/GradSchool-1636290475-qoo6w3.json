  "text": "I'm a physics major and I'm graduating soon, I want to take a gap year before I go to graduate school. Is that a bad idea? \n\nReason: I'm working on a few research projects that will have an outcome after the graduate admission deadline. I know that with those projects I'll have a better chance of getting in, but I don't want the grad school to think that I'm slacking by taking a year off.",

Moving to a new city and furnishing an apartment from scratch is *expensive*, and even if you get a stipend it will barely cover month-to-month expenses. I worked for a year living with my parents, and used the money I'd saved to pay off student loans, buy a car, and go on an IKEA/Salvation Army shopping spree.",

I even wrote an article about why taking a gap year between physics undergrad and physics grad school can be a really great thing - check it out [here at Physics Today!](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20201118a/full/)\n\nTo specifically answer your question - grad schools essentially lump applications together for people who have taken 1-2 gap years, with the rest of the cohort of people who immediately came from undergrad. The statistics, as well as interviews with physics grad admission professors, supports the idea that there is no serious disadvantage (from an application side) of taking a gap year. \n\nThe biggest risk you run is that it will be harder to find the motivation/access to complete a grad school application when you are away from school. You will have to self-motivate to take exams (ie, the pGRE and GRE), track down your register's office to send in your grades, and somehow get professors to write you letters of recommendation even if you are not able to go directly to their offices.",

I somehow found my way into one of the top programs for my field in the world.\n\nThat time waiting tables was a great mental break between undergrad and graduate school, and it also helped for the motivation to get back into academia and research which I find more fulfilling.\n\nIf you take a gap year, get projects out, that would only be a positive. If you take a gap year just to relax and figure out what you want to do for grad school, that is also a positive. I actively encourage undergrads I mentor to take a gap year, if possible, between undergrad and graduate school.\n\nSo: gap year = very good idea, particularly in your situation",

Burnout is real and it takes time to understand how your mind needs to recover from prolonged bouts of stress (like academic). Additionally, there are programs that encourage (not require) time off bc some places care about young college kids becoming well rounded citizens rather than JUST scientists. I am finishing my masters (shark ecologist) and as a side job I work as a special ed teacher, a totally opposite field of my professional one but I'm happy to say that it's been a good place for me to learn about myself and give my mind a break. \n\nSorry to ramble, but I feel like people don't talk about gap years enough!!

      "text": "Take the gap! Give yourself that break and time to figure out what you want to do and find work, etc. I worked for 5 years between undergraduate and grad school. I did a certificate in between but it was low key. The gap helped me a lot to get an idea of what I wanted to do and talk to different professors/programs. I\u2019m still in my masters program and trying to finish my thesis, thanks to COVID and some mental health stuff, it\u2019s taking me longer (it\u2019s nothing to do with my advisor or program, a lot of it is me).",

      "text": "No, why. This idea is quite OK. You can spend your gap year doing some research, for example. You can also read professional literature or learn some new things during this period. Your extracurricular activities will increase your chances of being admitted. Recently I came across reflections about a gap year for high school graduates (I leave it [here](https://ivypanda.com/essays/is-a-gap-year-necessary-for-high-school-graduates/)) - I think it works for grad school too. It's getting to be a trend in the US. Maybe, you'll find a little bit of inspiration there.",
