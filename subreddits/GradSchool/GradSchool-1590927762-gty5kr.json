It's also important that you are first author on a number of them.\n\nThere's also tons of other silent rules like over 5 years of post doc-ing is considered too much and becomes much harder to get a job. Having years where you didn't publish looks bad unless you have a good reason (but your clock only starts when you start your PhD, not before that). You usually need a first-author high impact paper in your late PhD or during your post doc to be invited for an interview.\n\nNetworking is your best friend. Publishing is your life-long partner. And all the stress and anxiety it causes to get 1 spot in the whole country out of thousands of applicants after 10+ years of work is hard, so mental health issues are your annoying neighbor that's always home...",

You can have some fun while being a grad student. Since nobody is going to read my dissertation, I can basically do whatever I want with it. Journal articles tend to reflect reviewer opinions often too strongly. For example, I had to create an entire appendix out of a section for one paper because of one reviewer\u2019s (reviewer 2) strong opinion but I think it actually just flows nicer to keep that section in the body, so I did spend some time to move that section back into the body of my dissertation.

But if it was an option, I think it will help you more towards finding an academic job.\n\nTbh, good academic jobs are really hard to secure, so you will need to do everything you can do. Having highly cited papers in top venues seems like the most important thing one can do. But I do not think it is enough since the market is super competitive (talking about 'top' schools).",
