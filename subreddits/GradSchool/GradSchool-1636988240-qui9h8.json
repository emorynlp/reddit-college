  "title:": "LOR from Non-Major Professors",
  "text": "I'm a psychology major that is getting ready to graduate this may. Because of covid, most of my classes have all been web by my department. I've only had a few classes that have taken in person due to being a transfer student and never gotten a chance to talk to them (I cant even ask my old professors from my past school due to dropping out for 5 years before coming back). Currently, one of my psychology professors retired and I have no way to get a hold of them. The other declined because ive only taken one of their classes. The other does not do LORs unless you've done research with him. I have had a few professors that i've taken multiple times that are willing to do a LOR, but they are not in my field. My programs i'm applying to are M.S. in Social Work, M.S. in Marriage and Family Therapy, and M.S./M.Ed. in Counseling with an emphasis in mental health (this program usually falls under the school of education).\n\nNone of the programs specifically require a certain degree, just a related field.\n\nWill these LORs be seen as a negative?\n\nI plan to use two professors (one is higher ed professor and the other is the department head for humanities) and my current job supervisor.",

And ignore doing \"what ifs\" regarding things about your application you have no control over. Doing that won't help with your applications. But it will provide needless anxiety.",

So if the professors writing your LORs know you well enough to describe what kind of student you are, I wouldn't worry about it anyway.",
