  "text": "I did not take out any loans for my undergrad so I\u2019m new to all this \ud83d\ude13. Now that I\u2019m planning on going to grad school, I\u2019ll be taking out a loan through FAFSA, which I am most likely offered around $20k per year. Some of the grad schools I\u2019m looking at are hellaaaa pricey and will require more than $20k per year. I\u2019m not sure if FAFSA is capped at $20k/year for grad school students so if this is the case, then I may need to get another student loan lender.\n\nI was wondering what student loans aside from FAFSA you all chose (if any) and what other low interest rate student loan lenders you would recommend and why. \n\nNote: I don\u2019t have an employer who is going to finance my education so this is not an option for me. There\u2019s no stipends offered for the masters programs I\u2019m applying to either so I\u2019ll definitely need to to find a way to finance my education. \n\n\nTips and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! \ud83d\ude0c",

Take advantage of any grad school programs offered by your employer\n\n3. Take out student loans\n\n4. Do a research based master that provides a stipend \n\n5. Work during your master as a RA or TA for undergrad student (sometimes this can get you a tuition waiver as well)\n\n6. Work part-time during your master to help pay any student loan/tuition fees/living needs \n\n7. Apply to externally funded scholarships",

      "text": "Many grad students are funded through TA (teaching), RA(research) or PA (project assistant) positions that provide tuition remission and a stipend. In my case, students admitted in their first year are funded with a TAship for an intro class, unless their adviser has funding for a RA position for them. This is the case for both MS and PhD students. \n\nNot all Master's programs are funded, though, so if your program does not provide funding then I would assume either a combination of loans or part time work would be how people afford their studies. You could probably also apply for TA or RA positions--your university's job board would typically list these positions.",

I\u2019ve thought about delaying my plans for getting my Masters so that I can save more for it, but Im not having any luck finding a decent job relevant to my degree because I don\u2019t have the \u201ccompetitive\u201d edge and not a lot of experience yet. Getting this MS degree will hopefully help me land the jobs I want. \n\nI\u2019m still applying for jobs and will continue to do so even when I start my MS program. I just don\u2019t want to delay my plans so I\u2019m willing to take out loans.\n\nI\u2019ll look into those stipends you mentioned. Thanks for sharing that info!",
