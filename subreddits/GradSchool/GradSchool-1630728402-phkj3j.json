To be quite honest with you, I'm really struggling to see the logic behind that. It seems pretty petty and childish to me and I just can't understand why you would do such a thing. \n\nI do not blame her for withdrawing as your adviser. Being an adviser is more than just a name on a paper. I'm not sure how your department works, but my adviser coordinated my prelim exams, is working with me on planning my dissertation, is my main point of contact for any and all questions I have about the program, policies, or procedures, will be responsible for reviewing my drafts of my dissertation and providing feedback, and shepherding me through the whole dissertation process. It's a big responsibility and takes up a lot of time. Considering you never wanted her as your adviser and made it clear it was temporary, wasn't this inevitable?\n\nHave you gone to the chair of your department to discuss what you can do? My first adviser ended up leaving academia, and it was my department chair who helped me find a new adviser. You might be able to arrange a co-adviser situation where you technically have two advisers and they split the responsibilities between them. If you are as well liked in your department as you claim in your comments, I don't see why your department wouldn't be willing to work with you to find a solution here.", "author": "False-Guess", "created": 1630739965, "upvotes": 9}, "hbjjszt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phkj3j/i_just_got_dumped_by_my_advisortalk_me_out_of/hbjjszt/", "text": "I hate to say this, but I think there's a couple of decisions that you made that took this on the wrong trajectory. First of all, taking someone as your supervisor with the plan to switch as soon as possible - and even making that clear to the supervisor. I'm not totally surprised that your supervisor felt like they weren't really \"your\" supervisor, just a name on your papers until you find the one you want. And then you never switched, so now they have to actually somewhat take you on as their student. Why didn't you switch anyways?\n\nAlso, to not email them for a year just to see \"if they would contact you or not\" is not a good strategy. If a supervisor isn't supporting you, you make them support you. Sometimes a supervisor doesn't know you need it or how to support you - and given the already rocky start of the supervisorship, I'm not surprised this happened.\n\nI'm really sorry for what happened and it sucks balls, but I think you just finding another supervisor and starting a relationship over again would be best. And don't wait for your supervisor to come knocking at your door. They are busy and have many things to do - you knock at their door and tell them what you need.", "author": "cm0011", "created": 1630738374, "upvotes": 20}, "hbjcfg8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phkj3j/i_just_got_dumped_by_my_advisortalk_me_out_of/hbjcfg8/", "text": "If there is one thing I've learnt from your story, it's that They dont need You, You need Them.

Has she been not very hands on with you? Yes, but also 1. You say in the beginning you didn\u2019t want a hands on advisor and 2. You were clear to her that you didn\u2019t want her to be your advisor.\n\nThen YOU are late to a meeting, never follow up and never reach out because of your \u201ccuriosity\u201d about how things would turn out? I mean\u2026 are you taking this seriously or not? I\u2019ve definitely have students not show up to 1-on-1\u2019s, and if they don\u2019t reach out or give me a reason or at least apologize, I don\u2019t feel the need to go out of my way for them anymore.\n\nI think you need to take more of the responsibility for this situation. I wouldn\u2019t want an advisee who told me they didn\u2019t want me for an advisor, didn\u2019t show up to meetings, and generally didn\u2019t take things seriously either.", "author": "boilerlashes", "created": 1630729456, "upvotes": 46}, "hbj777d": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/phkj3j/i_just_got_dumped_by_my_advisortalk_me_out_of/hbj777d/", "text": "I dunno how prelims work in your department (or field, for that matter), but what I'm used to is that your *actual* advisor would be the one setting them up for you. They are about your idea for a thesis topic and the person who'll be helping you through writing that is supposed to be the main person in charge of evaluating your proposal. So I don't think it's that strange that your current advisor would not want to be in charge of this prelim. In my department that would just mean that she's officially your thesis advisor and is planning to guide you to graduating. It seems like this situation persisted longer than originally planned. At first the plan was just for her to temporarily be your advisor on paper, signing forms and such, to get around departmental bureaucracy. But now it's gone on for a long time and she might feel like you were trying to slyly backdoor your way into being her student \"for realsies\" in defiance of your original arrangement? That would be my theory for why she's doing what she's doing, at least, with just this small window into the situation. \n\nAs to what you should do, it sounds like there are zero people in the department who are willing to supervise you. So the only other option would be to reach out to people in other departments, right? Can students in your department have faculty from outside the institution as their major advisor? If not you might need to transfer as an ABD student to another institution. It sounds like you'd have no trouble getting good letters of rec from people explaining the situation and making it clear that it's not like you're being drummed out of the department. That would probably come with a lot of headaches and set you back one or more years though.", "author": "InfanticideAquifer", "created": 1630729403, "upvotes": 9}}}
