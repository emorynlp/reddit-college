  "text": "I'm applying for PhD in Clinical Psychology and I noticed that e-mailing professors is highly adviced. There are uni websites where they mention if the professor is recruiting or not. How do I email them knowing they're already recruiting? I have an area in mind but I haven't narrowed it down to a research topic so discussing my research ideas seems difficult.\nAny ideas on that will be appreciated.",

      "text": "My form of reaching out to prospective supervisors was actually a bit more unorthodox? However, I am a PhD applicant to a public health program so the process may be slightly different.\n\nI emailed my prospective research mentors to introduce myself, say that I was a prospective applicant to \"X\" program for Fall 2022, and then I proceeded to tell them about the papers of theirs that I have read, what I liked about their work, and how their research aligns with my current research interests.\n\nAfterwards, I would ask if it would be possible to set up an appointment with them to speak with them regarding their research and to gain insight into their work if they were available and willing to meet so that it left it somewhat open-ended. \n\nThen during the meeting, I would assess how I feel about them, and whether or not we would be compatible, discuss my CV, what my aims are for the program, etc. \n\nI have met with a decent amount of mentors who were not accepting students but were kind enough to refer me to other faculty members, so I still see it as a win. \n\nIt's perfectly okay not to have a narrow idea of your research interests and there's no shame in asking for your prospective supervisor's thoughts on your interests either! \n\nI've been reading papers from potential mentors pretty regularly to truly hone in on my interests before every meeting, and I have found that this also helps!",

I was having difficulty in following up with them, continuing the conversation. \n\nWill it be alright to tell them about my future goals and ask if the program is a good fit for me? Recently I've considered doing a MSW and then go for a PhD so I thought if I should get their advice on it. Or is it just admission related??",

              "text": "I would say this question could definitely be asked both ways! I definitely have asked this question to program directors/admissions officers but I have also asked prospective mentors for advice on how to go about this career path or line of work. I am also applying to primarily MPH programs and one PhD so your question is worth asking! I found that it was advantageous (in my experience) to ask prospective advisers, as they were able to offer holistic advice because of their proximity to my field of interest.",

One paragraph on your background/previous experience, and one paragraph on generally what you are interested in pursuing. \n\nTypically advisors have their own ideas anyway, so if you say something like \"I want to study how X effects Y in this particular system\" you won't end up doing that anyway.",
