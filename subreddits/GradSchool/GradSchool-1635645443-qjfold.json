  "text": "I need advice. I\u2019m currently a senior in undergrad majoring in criminology. I hate it. I did it because both my parents are lawyers and I was expected to be one too. I hate law. I have always wanted to do music. I blew that chance for undergrad to appease my parents.\n\nI\u2019m graduating soon and I\u2019m being pushed to get my masters in cybercrime and make a career in cybersecurity so I can be successful and make a lot of money. The thing is that terrifies me. I don\u2019t like crime. I don\u2019t want to do it forever until I\u2019ve got one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. I hate it. I hate the thought of it. \n\nMy mom just called me to tell me I would make \u201czero dollars and zero cents\u201d in music if I pursued it. My music minor is currently the only thing that makes me happy.\n\nDo I tough out getting a degree in cybercrime to appease my family? I touched out undergrad and survived but I\u2019m not a very happy person, I\u2019ll admit. I cry a lot. Almost offed myself. I\u2019m lost.",

You don't need to struggle with this on your own.",

I think you need to figure out a viable career path that involves something you enjoy. You mentioned music. Do you want to teach at a school? Give lessons? Work in the industry as a producer/manager/agent? What about entertainment law? (Throwing that one out there as a long shot because you mentioned your parents are lawyers.) I mean, I think you should really explore these options and find something that resonates with you. \n\nI know you feel really boxed in and you\u2019re under a lot of pressure. I get it, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it. Lean on your support system right now, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for. Reach out to academic advisors or maybe even a professor whose music class you liked and discuss possible career paths. Maybe something like an MBA would help? I have no idea, I would ask the experts. But please, at least ask questions and see what pops up.",

Otherwise, I'm not sure what their leverage is. \n\nYou're an adult and your parents don't have the right to force you to do anything. That being said, while your mom was pretty harsh about what she said, I also think she's kinda right. Music is a great hobby but not great for employment. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it's a lot harder to be happy when you're struggling to make the rent. \n\nThe good thing is that a bachelors degree (ANY bachelors degree) is the requirement for entry for a lot of jobs. It's proof that you have a decent work ethic and can stay focused for 4 years. You will have a lot of options just by having a degree. You also don't have to figure any of this out immediately. Presumably you're around 22. You'll have 40 years of work ahead of you so there's no rush to plan everything out. That's also all the more reason to not force yourself into a cybersecurity career if you don't want it. \n\nSide note, but I'm a bit confused about what this cybercrime masters is. You said this would be so you can work in cybersecurity--my partner works in cybersecurity but his background is entirely compsci. Do they not expect a computer science background for this program? The cybersecurity I'm familiar with, in short, has nothing to do with legal systems and everything to do with pointing out shitty code. Unless we have two very different fields in mind, this has nothing to do with criminology. If your parents are going to try pressuring you into a program, they should at least know that your undergrad in criminology is not enough preparation to start grad school in this field.",

It\u2019s hard, it takes up all your time, and there are long stretches where you basically live and breathe your thesis. If you don\u2019t absolutely love it, there is no way to force the motivation needed to finish it.",

Money can always be made until the day you die, but you can never regain your youth, and your mental health has a value associated with it too. People who spend their lives chasing dollars and cents often end up with lots of dollars and little sense. \n\nIf your parents wanted to raise someone just like them, they should have cloned themselves rather than have kids. At some point, they need to realize that you are an adult with your own personality, your own interests, and your own goals. If music truly is what makes you happy, then I don't think it makes sense to pursue a graduate program you know you're going to hate, that you will likely struggle in, only to apply for jobs you don't want in a field you can't stand. \n\nAt the same time, because the phrase \"starving artist\" exists for a reason, I think it would be helpful for you to consider a backup plan. Others suggested maybe an MBA so that, if playing music professionally doesn't work out, you could have marketable skills for the music industry. I think that's definitely something to consider.",

You've stated yourself that you're dealing with depression to the point of it being life-threatening, and it seems like your studies are only making it worse. Going into cybersecurity will only make things worse.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would do this: graduate with your bachelor's and get a job. It doesn't have to make bank, but as long as you can support yourself you'll be fine. With a criminology degree, you can go into law enforcement, but you can also do something a little bit more low key, like being a probation officer or even working an office job at the police department. Hell, you can even work as a teacher's assistant or an administrative assistant, as long as you think you'll be able to make ends meet. My personal standards for making ends meet is 30k a year/15 dollars an hour, but yours might be higher or lower depending on where you live and what your needs are.\n\nTry to rent a room with a friend, or a cheap studio (if you live in a place with low rent) and *establish independence.* One of the biggest ways parents hold authority over you is through financial compensation. If you learn how to support yourself, they will no longer be able to hold that over you. One of the best things you can do is google \"how to move out without any money\" and read/watch every result.\n\nOnce you've learned how to live on your own, your life is your own. It's not too late to pursue music through taking some extra classes on a part-time basis. However, I personally recommend going the music education route. Every school has a choir, and every choir needs a teacher. That's why I recommended looking into being a teaching assistant, because you could establish a relationship with a school and eventually get a job once you get enough credentials.\n\nAlso, there are so many programs that prepare you to become a teacher at an affordable price. Look into some of those, and try to incorporate the curriculum from your music minor in order to gain a teacher certification in music.\n\nHowever, if teaching isn't for you, just try to find a job you don't hate and will make ends meet. From there, spend your weekends and evenings continuing your passion through community choirs and even voice/piano lessons for supplemental income.\n\nMy two biggest recommendations: prioritize your mental health first and establish independence from your parents.",

That economy doesn't really exist anymore.\n\nBesides, it's absolutely untrue to say that you can't earn a living as a working musician. Whether you're in like half a dozen wedding bands or you work events, or you teach music to children and teens, there's many ways you can get revenue out of your musical skill.

It's not an economic necessity to go through with this degree you don't want.\n2. Maybe your parents think that's what's best for you. But they don't know that, and neither do you. Plus, you think it would make you unhappy.\n\nStanding up to your parents and doing your own thing can be pretty hard. My parents don't really speak to me anymore ever since I came out to them. But it was either that or I was going to be miserable forever. My dad used to say I didn't need any gender identity at all, that being transgender would distract me from my Ph. D.

I graduated anyway with a degree in arts management and spent the next seven years figuring out what the fuck I actually wanted to do. Now I'm finishing my graduate program in a completely different field. I'm so thankful I took the time off to develop skills and put out feelers. I'm a huge proponent of taking time between undergrad and graduate school. My point is that it might be beneficial to take some time, either get a job in your field and use your free time to pursue music and figure out if it's something you really want to pursue professionally, or go ahead and pursue music with a fallback in your back pocket. You can also go into arts administration and put the skills you're learning now to good use there! Art still needs people with various tech skills.\n\nNothing you're learning right now is useless, and can offer you a unique and cross-discipline perspective. I know it feels like you have to decide RIGHT NOW where your life is going, but lemme tell you, I've been out of undergrad for almost ten years and I have done SO MUCH but at the time it felt like SO LITTLE for no reason. And even now I'm nowhere near music professionally, by choice, but it's still a huge part of my life. Please don't lose faith, and if you're having thoughts like that please take advantage of your campus counseling resources. You're not alone and I'm certain you'll figure out how to keep music in the spotlight.",

Plus, there's a chance that once you make singing your main career rather than a hobby or side gig that you'd end up disliking it as a job (not saying you definitely would, but just that it's common to hear this from people who pursued their hobby interests as careers). Is there maybe something like, being able to create music for some tech industry company, or something where you can take what you learned in criminology and apply it to industry while you do music on the side (until it get stable enough for you to do as a main career)? I don't know if criminology has applicable skills, but I imagine it might be possible for you to get into something like UX Design or something related that is somewhat artistic at least even if it's not music, and is also quite practical and lucrative.\n\nI sympathize as someone from a culture where parents' opinions really matter. I disagree with everyone saying \"fuck your parents and do what you want\" and empathize with why you want to appease them. But your life has value too, and if you're at the point where you were close to offing yourself a few times, there has to be some better dialogue about this. Also, never tough out grad school in a topic you hate just to appease your family; it's tough enough even for people who are passionate about their topic. Where is it going to end? After another 8 years of grad school when you get a PhD? After another 20 years of being a lawyer or something? Or maybe when you do off yourself? There's a huge gap between music and a criminology career in terms of other professions/careers, so there *has got to be* a compromise that exists here that both you and your parents could deal with.",

Yes it can change and you can always change again in the future, but it ultimately needs to be your decision. There's always going to be a chance you'll get into criminology as a worker and actually enjoy it, but do you want to put up with all the schooling and stress to get to that point? Or do you want to go with what you feel \"called\" to and where you feel like you need to go for yourself? It's a hard decision and hard to stand up against your parents when they have things decided for you, but ultimately you'll come out stronger for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust keep hanging in there!

You didn't specify what exactly you want to do in music, but if it's playing an instrument, a lot of times that isn't cheap (especially if you're a guitarist like me who insists antiquated 1920s technology *sounds better man)*. If you have a good career, you'll  have plenty of money to spend on really nice equipment, vs if you do music as a main career you might struggle and not be able to get all stuff you'd like.\n\nGranted I don't hate my career but it does get old sometimes. Music for me is a great escape from all of it. In fact, I don't know if I'd want it as a career because then it'd be something I have to do and it'd suck the joy out of it. I think it's important to find a career that you don't hate, but also keep in mind you don't have to do what you love as a career, you can always do it as a hobby. And having a good career and more money to burn on that hobby is just icing on the cake. \n\nAnyway, hope this helps.",

So many times, I ask people, \u201cWould you like to be a baby or a big girl, or a baby and a big boy, because while you\u2019re a baby, you\u2019re sitting in a back seat of the car. You can mess around and do anything because someone is driving. So, do you want to be a driver? Or do you want to be driven?\u201d\n> \n> BB: Yeah, and you know what, sometimes we climb in the back seat because we don\u2019t want the responsibility of driving.\n> \n> EE: Exactly.\n> \n> BB: But then we\u2019re angry that we\u2019re being driven.\n> \n> EE: Exactly. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. Yes, the approach-avoidance conflict, that we talk about in psychology, that I want to approach it and I want to avoid it. And yet, growing up is much more fun than being a child because you are child-like. You ask a child, \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d The kid would say, \u201cBecause I feel like it.\u201d The kid doesn\u2019t care about consequences. So, I like my Hungarian chocolate cake, but I know I have a very bad scoliosis, and if I gain weight, I have more pain, so I don\u2019t have to run from the chocolate cake. I can look at it and I can decide whether I will reach for it or not, so that\u2019s why I like the idea of, to being child-like at 93 but not childish, to be not smart but to be wise and decide before I say something. But that it\u2019s really very important that I have to say it, I listen more now and guide people to be very compassionate listeners.",

I\u2019m not sure what other things you may have looked at field wise, but I would look and spend some time exploring those options, maybe reaching out to professors at your school in those fields (explain your situation and just ask them questions you have, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be willing to help).\n\nYou could also drop by and talk to your department advisor/mentor/favorite professor and talk to them about the situation. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re at least somewhat knowledgeable on at least the other fields people have taken after getting a criminology degree.\n\nHonestly, taking some time off from school (if you find out you want/need to get a masters in another field for the career path you want) has been one of the best decisions for me personally. I wasn\u2019t successful in a career job hunt but I had opportunities to take \u201cgrunt work\u201d jobs that would\u2019ve paid me enough to at least pay bills and maybe save a small amount of money, especially if I found a roommate.",

If they won't talk to you, fuck em and try another. You don't want a school who'd treat you like that anyway. They'll talk to you without any commitment and could help give you suggestions on where to start. Or you could start on the hard path and get a shitty grunt work job like was suggested above and make connections there. Lots of what professional music is is connections anyway, so somewhere like an opera house or similar theate may be good, even if it's just a volunteer gig at the start. Volunteer gigs are great for getting your feet wet and generally pretty flexible, plus the added benefit of having that low level experience that's so important.",

Your parents have likely limited your perspective, and that has continued with your undergrad focus among like-minded students and faculty. Please look into career-exploration resources. Good universities offer quite a lot in that regard.\n\nThere is a good chance that you can use skills learned in your undergrad program to do things that you find personally rewarding and enjoy doing day to day. I'd keep that idea in mind as you do structured career exploration.\n\nMusic is a difficult career. That means society has created a lot of other ways to sing. You can always be a singer, with other music lovers. Having a satifying \"day job\" is a useful complement.\n\nAs a grad-admissions person, I strongly advise not aiming for graduate school. Your note is full of the red flags we look for when considering who is most likely to succeed in our program.",

      "text": "In hopes that this helps, I'll tell you my story.\n\nI graduated from undergrad in 2020, with a psychology/neuroscience degree with honors. Most of that degree was directed towards me going into grad school for neuroscience. I worked my butt off to get a good cv for years. I worked in labs, padded my resume with clubs, published and everything. During interview season, I got interviews with some of the top neuroscience programs in the world. I ended up going to a state school.\n\nI had it made. No loans, guaranteed funding for 5 years, a nice stipend, insurance, the whole nine yards. My wife got a new job, where she was promoted fast and given regular raise. We could afford to live really comfortably in a 3 bedroom house, a nice change from the college days of our 1 bedroom apartment. \n\nI did well my first year. It was pretty easy, I had a 4.0 and everything was going well. But there was something missing.\n\nI hated research. I initially wanted to go to grad school because I wanted to become a professor and teach at the highest level. But doing research everyday and academic politics were daunting. I also found out that I have a higher chance of randomly finding a 4 leaf clover than getting a faculty job. And if you get lucky, the career path is so stressful and uncertain until you get tenure, which the best case could take 7 years as an Assistant professor, but on average it takes longer just to have a stable job. \n\nAs I said before, I hated research but I had developed a love for coding. I took one cs class during the last semester of my senior year in college and I loved it. After long grueling days in the lab, I would come home and code and just learn. I had so much fun learning how to make new things. Recently I felt sort of like op, I hated research to the point I hated waking up in the mornings. It also started to affect my mental health, but coding was my escape. So I made the decision that I would pursue a career doing what made me happy and accept any consequences that came with. So I left my cushy grad school position about a month ago, with no job and some savings. I plan to spend a couple months perfecting my coding skills and studying cs and making cool projects. I bet on myself. When my savings run out, I could either be working as a software engineer or at McDonald's until I can get a coding job. But I made peace with it and this month has been the best month since I started doing research. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, you need to figure out what you want, what are the consequences of pursuing it, and if you would be ok with the worst case. If you are then go for it and don't look back.",
