  "text": "I do not know if it is due to my carelessness or if my training has been bad and is carrying over to my grad school now.\n\nI recently started my Ph.D.\n\nIn the first rotation, I messed up western blot in 5 ways. and procrastinated doing the western by almost 1-2 weeks due to midterm and interval exams in courses. I also maintained an iPSC line during the 6 weeks, but that is just maintenance and getting familiar.\n\nMeanwhile, in my second rotation, I have been messing around on the confocal microscope and have NOT got any good images. It has been pretty frustrating and I get a max of 2 hours on most days but due to some or the other issue ( I fell ill last 3 days), I don't have much actual useful data and I am no closer to completing my limited project goal.\n\nI feel like an utter failure. I know that rotations are just precursors and it is natural to commit mistakes during inexperience, BUT I feel like I am failing everything at epic proportions. Neither my lab PIs are that happy with me (but the first one Is desperate for grad students, but I like the second one's lab culture much better). And as the days go by, I am becoming less and less convinced that I am actually capable.\n\nI came to a Ph.D. with just my bachelor's in a broad field, and it's all more specific in the Ph.D. of course. But I feel I am becoming a liability to everyone around me.\n\nI am unable to cope with the repeated failures in my experiments or works or labs. and I feel guilty.\n\nI am also not comfortable talking about this with anyone within my immediate circle.\n\nIt's been 3 months since my Ph.D. began, but I don't think I am close to even putting in 1% of the effort needed. Classes are hard, and I am unable to score well in them either, just barely passing or scraping through.",

      "text": "As someone who has done western blots for like....a decade, I hope you realize that this is one of the most challenging techniques for people to do in molecular biology. Not only is it pretty foreign dexterity wise....there are just so many steps that its just that easy to fail.. When you say 5 ways, there are like.....three dozen more. And then even when you get good at western blots, many of them still suck. Whenever there's that picture perfect grad student you see that somehow does all their westerns perfectly without fail, just remember that they typically have easy targets, are using robust antibodies, and Yada Yada. Like the other commenter has said, I think this is high chance of imposter syndrome. \n\nFeel free to reach out for tips or anything western blots or otherwise. Recently got my PhD in genetics and I've done enough westerns to just know they are a drag typically for everyone.\n\nEdit: sorry, but I'm not trying to downplay the guilt. I know what you're going through is super real and debilitating. I guess I would just say give yourself a break right now since you only just started.\n\nEdit: oh damn, and don't even get me started on confocal. How new are you to these two things? Sorry dude these two things just have steeeep learning curves. \ud83d\ude33 this isn't you.",

          "text": "Reading this, I (a post-doc) was reminded about how I screwed up a western 5 ways in the same week when troubleshooting why a \u201cperfect\u201d western failed. Literally everything that could have gone wrong went wrong but only one thing at a time. The worst part? My issue was the detection kit had lost sensitivity and I needed to adjust my antibody accordingly.",

You can be in one lab, do a western and it works perfectly, then go to the lab next door, do the exact same thing, same materials, and boom you just did the shittiest blot of all, like huge black splotch across the whole membrane \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44",

      "text": "As much as I hate to say it, it sounds like you are experiencing imposter syndrome. Graduate school is extremely stressful when you first start and this often results with feeling like you can't keep up and don't belong. When I first started my PhD, in the first six months I broke a Schlenk Line. Nothing too serious, but I snapped off one of the two way valves. Was completely freaked out by having to tell my advisor and when I did he just chuckled and said \"well, you're officially a true group member with that one.\" My point here is everyone makes mistakes as they're learning and results aren't going to immediately happen overnight. Coursework is a different monster compared to undergrad. Research is an entirely new beast compared to undergrad. Keep at it and don't give up. Don't ever give up. You'll get the hang of this sooner than you think, and one day you'll look back on this and have a decent chuckle yourself. You've got this.",

I have trained many rotation students and rarely have I seen projects \u201cfinished\u201d. \n\nThe thing with scientific research, though, is that you have to be comfortable with failure. 90% of the time, something doesn\u2019t work or my hypothesis is wrong. It\u2019s just a part of the job. You have to learn and move on. It\u2019s tough, but accepting it has made my life significantly better. It\u2019s not you, science is hard.",
