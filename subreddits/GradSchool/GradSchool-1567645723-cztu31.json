I\u2019m approaching the end of my year of graduate school, and I\u2019m genuinely happy to be in school. Yes, it\u2019s certainly tough and overwhelming at times, but I expected it. \n\nMy gripe is how many students I see in class, or on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. incessantly complaining about the work. I understand that we all cope differently, but it just seems so counter intuitive to me. If you have time to post a perfectly curated photo of your Starbucks coffee and laptop, then it seems you have time to write that paper. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily how they spend their time that bothers me, but the message they are sending to others. Anyone else annoyed by this or do I just need to get a life?

It happens; it could just happen more.\n\nAnother way to get involved with attacking the problems endemic to grad school is to get involved with your school\u2019s grad student union. If you don\u2019t have one, you can make an even bigger impact by getting one started!\n\nI\u2019ve been involved off and on in the union at my school, and it\u2019s a very eye-opening experience getting to see how different departments face different challenges and how the administration plays them against each other. It\u2019s tough to see how faculty can oppose grad student unionization even when they\u2019re in the same boat in terms of job security and poor compensation.\n\nExposure to the way the union works and all of the structural cultural forces keeping grad school the way it is showed me both how big and complex the issues we face are and also how solving them is largely a political problem. (By that I just mean it\u2019s a problem of organizing. It requires getting people to see that problems exist, getting them on the same page in looking for mutually beneficial solutions, and getting buy-in and trust in the union as an organization that can achieve those solutions.)", "author": "Psychrobacter", "created": 1567782757, "upvotes": 1}, "ez761lp": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/cztu31/is_anyone_else_tired_of_the_im_so_busy_stressed/ez761lp/", "text": "Just another random thought; I don't know about the people you see complaining, but I am teaching nearly full time to support my family, am in grad school full time, and Spring term one of my (new to teaching - a recent transition from nursing administration) professors regularly assigned over 300 pages of reading per week, with no prioritization.

I think most people actually have plenty of time (baring crazy class workloads, but like, once you're done with most classes and just doing research). What happens is most grad students spend all their time in \"trial and error\" mode so they never feel like they're getting anywhere, and so \"dont have time\", all of the time, since they always feel like they're not making any progress!\n\nAll I can say is... this can be minimized quite a lot. Take time to understand the methods you're using, so you're not debugging them and finding out your results dont mean what you think they do later. Fields in which totally heuristic-based methods dominate have this problem the most, so one always needs to be most critical of methods that aren't (essentially) well posed math problems.\n\nLastly, if students just wrote more regularly, as they go, they would always feel like they're \"making progress\", and hence dont have the existential feeling of \"no time\" constantly weighing on them. This takes a long time to learn, both how to write, to the point where the material is actually usable, but also to develop the habit of really doing so. My advice, the moment you begin a project (or subproject) you are thoroughly interested in, begin a latex doc of the project. Add titles, authors, sections, and fill in paragraphs of text in the intro, methods, results, and even appendix. When adding material to these sections, anytime you feel you're rambling, your minds wandering, or you have weird tangential thoughts, all of that can be put in the discussion. Now, quite a lot can be filled in \"early on\" in the project, and so it will already look (and feel) like you're well on your way with your research, which I think helps people feel more relaxed (and probably become more productive).", "author": "seismic_swarm", "created": 1567712463, "upvotes": 2}, "ez60zec": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/cztu31/is_anyone_else_tired_of_the_im_so_busy_stressed/ez60zec/", "text": "Yes.

You shouldn't feel obligated to follow these folks. In a few years you'll never even talk to them anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was quite open throughout graduate school that I did the following:\n\n\\-I saw a therapist every single week. Same time, same place. Everyone knew I did this. It not only helped me (obviously) but hopefully helped address the stigma.\n\n\\-I made time for yoga. \n\n\\-I utilized my social media to follow things that boost me up - lots of good fitness outlets, food recipes, uplifting sports materials, mindfulness.\n\n\\-I meditated just about daily.\n\n\\-I did not respond to emails or work matters outside of certain times (emergencies were different).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy no means am I some enlightened, shining example of self-care.

Many of my cohort could not believe I didn't spend long hours into the night reading. Well, I knew how to fucking read because I have a BA in English. I read smarter, not harder. I also did most of my course reading free from distraction, at the library, on saturday or sunday mornings.

I'm sure other fields have their equivalent. As a grad student you should be prepared to put in long hours when necessary because that is how research works. However long hours does not just equate to constant work.

My advice is to simply NOT hang around people like this and go out of your way to be positive about grad school. I know it's hard with little pay and unfair and all all kinds of shit like that. But taking one look around the world and seeing what other people have to put up with in their lives should be enough to make any person who goes and gets a coffee whenever the fuck they want and gets paid to read books and write about their thoughts to shut the fuck up. \n\nIf you follow some 'academic' feeds, it really has become nothing more than a pissing contest to see who can come up with the cheekiest and hyperbolic summation of academia and the obstacles people face. it's become a contest to prove whose life if the worst.

It\u2019s a larger sickness in academic culture and in a lot of other professional fields too. My husband and I went on vacation (he works full time) and he admitted he was thinking about work for a lot of the trip too. I give myself time off and prioritize spending time with friends and family on a regular basis unless there\u2019s some emergency deadline reason that I can\u2019t. However I can\u2019t actually control that I still feel emotionally and mentally stressed even when I take breaks. That also manifests physically (GI tract issues, lately it\u2019s been weird skin rash stuff) and that\u2019s been an issue since I was in high school. So I do like commiserating with others who can empathize, which is often other grad students on social media, not because I think we all are martyrs and should celebrate being burnt out but because the emotional and mental toll is still huge even with time off. It can be a toxic circle of reinforcing unhealthy behaviors, or it can be a way to fight the isolation of grad school that then makes all of the unhappiness and stress worse.
