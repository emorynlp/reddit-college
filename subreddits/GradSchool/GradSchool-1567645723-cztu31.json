  "text": "\n\n\nHi all, first time poster here! I\u2019m approaching the end of my year of graduate school, and I\u2019m genuinely happy to be in school. Yes, it\u2019s certainly tough and overwhelming at times, but I expected it. \n\nMy gripe is how many students I see in class, or on Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc. incessantly complaining about the work. I understand that we all cope differently, but it just seems so counter intuitive to me. If you have time to post a perfectly curated photo of your Starbucks coffee and laptop, then it seems you have time to write that paper. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily how they spend their time that bothers me, but the message they are sending to others. Anyone else annoyed by this or do I just need to get a life? Ha!",

Oops. \n\nIt would definitely be more productive (and probably healthier) to turn the focus toward sharing ways we\u2019re looking out for ourselves and encouraging others to do the same. It happens; it could just happen more.\n\nAnother way to get involved with attacking the problems endemic to grad school is to get involved with your school\u2019s grad student union. If you don\u2019t have one, you can make an even bigger impact by getting one started!\n\nI\u2019ve been involved off and on in the union at my school, and it\u2019s a very eye-opening experience getting to see how different departments face different challenges and how the administration plays them against each other. It\u2019s tough to see how faculty can oppose grad student unionization even when they\u2019re in the same boat in terms of job security and poor compensation.\n\nExposure to the way the union works and all of the structural cultural forces keeping grad school the way it is showed me both how big and complex the issues we face are and also how solving them is largely a political problem. (By that I just mean it\u2019s a problem of organizing. It requires getting people to see that problems exist, getting them on the same page in looking for mutually beneficial solutions, and getting buy-in and trust in the union as an organization that can achieve those solutions.)",

      "text": "Just another random thought; I don't know about the people you see complaining, but I am teaching nearly full time to support my family, am in grad school full time, and Spring term one of my (new to teaching - a recent transition from nursing administration) professors regularly assigned over 300 pages of reading per week, with no prioritization. Meanwhile, our biostats class required 20 hours of homework per week (everyone knew about that up front, it's a high-credit intensive series). And there was a third, totally reasonable class. That one overloaded class really was an unreasonable load that just hammered those of us who also work.\n\nSometimes the load really just is unreasonable, and people need to vent about it and get moral support from their social circle.",

      "text": "Just don't buy into it. I think most people actually have plenty of time (baring crazy class workloads, but like, once you're done with most classes and just doing research). What happens is most grad students spend all their time in \"trial and error\" mode so they never feel like they're getting anywhere, and so \"dont have time\", all of the time, since they always feel like they're not making any progress!\n\nAll I can say is... this can be minimized quite a lot. Take time to understand the methods you're using, so you're not debugging them and finding out your results dont mean what you think they do later. Fields in which totally heuristic-based methods dominate have this problem the most, so one always needs to be most critical of methods that aren't (essentially) well posed math problems.\n\nLastly, if students just wrote more regularly, as they go, they would always feel like they're \"making progress\", and hence dont have the existential feeling of \"no time\" constantly weighing on them. This takes a long time to learn, both how to write, to the point where the material is actually usable, but also to develop the habit of really doing so. My advice, the moment you begin a project (or subproject) you are thoroughly interested in, begin a latex doc of the project. Add titles, authors, sections, and fill in paragraphs of text in the intro, methods, results, and even appendix. When adding material to these sections, anytime you feel you're rambling, your minds wandering, or you have weird tangential thoughts, all of that can be put in the discussion. Now, quite a lot can be filled in \"early on\" in the project, and so it will already look (and feel) like you're well on your way with your research, which I think helps people feel more relaxed (and probably become more productive).",

      "text": "So I unfollowed all but 4-5 of my 22 person cohort on all forms of social media sometime during my first year of my program. They were part of the toxic \"rise and grind\" higher education culture (we were in a higher education program). Their social media was like a fucking mood swing between \"THIS IS WHAT SELF CARE LOOKS LIKE\" (which was always just thinly veiled class elitism) vs \"GRAD SCHOOL IS SO TOXIC AND UNHEALTHY\" (despite eating like trash, not having therapists, not doing anything to legitimately make the process easier... etc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of them were simply privileged whiny kids. A lot of them were under prepared academically, so when they finally felt legitimately challenged many of them threw their hands up in a rage about how the entire system was broken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, OP, unfollow the majority of these people on social media. You shouldn't feel obligated to follow these folks. In a few years you'll never even talk to them anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was quite open throughout graduate school that I did the following:\n\n\\-I saw a therapist every single week. Same time, same place. Everyone knew I did this. It not only helped me (obviously) but hopefully helped address the stigma.\n\n\\-I made time for yoga. \n\n\\-I utilized my social media to follow things that boost me up - lots of good fitness outlets, food recipes, uplifting sports materials, mindfulness.\n\n\\-I meditated just about daily.\n\n\\-I did not respond to emails or work matters outside of certain times (emergencies were different).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy no means am I some enlightened, shining example of self-care. But grad school was NOT some toxic deluge of hell and long nights. I had ONE project take me into the long hours of the night. I didn't work past 9pm, hell 7pm if I could avoid it. Many of my cohort could not believe I didn't spend long hours into the night reading. Well, I knew how to fucking read because I have a BA in English. I read smarter, not harder. I also did most of my course reading free from distraction, at the library, on saturday or sunday mornings. It was not hard to stick to that schedule. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes, graduate school is designed to be challenging. But you can take strategic steps to make challenges easier for yourself.",

For example, being so busy we don't eat, don't sleep, and overwork ourselves to the point of a mental breakdown is NOT something you wrap up in a pretty filter and brag about. It sends the message that if we aren't doing xyz, then there is no chance for us to succeed. \n\nAs for the sarcastic question you threw in at the end:\nYeah, I do work a lot, and it isn't fun. Luckily, I took the time to step back and create a schedule that allows me to get my work done AND have free time. I usually like to scroll through social media then. ;)",

However, it does annoy me when some undergrad or just someone thinking about a PhD asks for advice and just gets a blanket response of \"run away now\" \"it's awful\" \"grad school is so stressful\", like, yes it's stressful sometimes, but it's still worth it. It's not just a huge sacrifice that people are making for a few years, it's a really rewarding experience when stuff works, and it's not fair to portray just the hard parts and make yourself out to be a martyr when it is totally manageable almost all the time.",

The stereotypical struggles are real for most grad students, and because of that I don't feel comfortable trying to pick apart who's being authentic and who's just virtue signalling.

Also, studies show that when we multitask, we aren't as productive. Kudos for developing those skills - it's not easy!",

I'm sure other fields have their equivalent. As a grad student you should be prepared to put in long hours when necessary because that is how research works. However long hours does not just equate to constant work. If you have to work 12 hour days 6 days of week, 52 weeks a year, you aren't managing your time well",

I give myself time off and prioritize spending time with friends and family on a regular basis unless there\u2019s some emergency deadline reason that I can\u2019t. However I can\u2019t actually control that I still feel emotionally and mentally stressed even when I take breaks. That also manifests physically (GI tract issues, lately it\u2019s been weird skin rash stuff) and that\u2019s been an issue since I was in high school. So I do like commiserating with others who can empathize, which is often other grad students on social media, not because I think we all are martyrs and should celebrate being burnt out but because the emotional and mental toll is still huge even with time off. It can be a toxic circle of reinforcing unhealthy behaviors, or it can be a way to fight the isolation of grad school that then makes all of the unhappiness and stress worse.

It was completely unnecessary, and in fact I ended up redoing the assay with less tissue in a shorter, reasonable time frame. \n\nI found it unsettling that in my former field, this kind of behavior was seen not only as acceptable, but as a source of bragging rights. \"Look how dedicated to my science I am!\" It was a heavy contributor to my decision to switch fields to one that is more supportive of work/life balance.",
