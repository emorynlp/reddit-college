I\u2019m planning on trying to take a leave of absence for the remainder of the semester to go to therapy and allow myself to have a break to hopefully come back with more drive in January. I\u2019m also planning to come back with a new advisor. I\u2019m really nervous to have this conversation with the department. My advisor now is not bad but he can be very arrogant and I keep getting cornered into research I\u2019m not interested in. I get immense anxiety every time I know I\u2019m going to see him because he likes to quiz me on how much I know (making me feel like a pos). He also has been zero help and is extremely hands off which just hasn\u2019t worked for me. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone on here has experience with changing advisors at the same university? How did you bring it up? Was it awkward seeing them around since then? \n\nI feel bad switching because he\u2019s not as bad as some I\u2019ve heard of on this page but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have the strength to return if he\u2019s still my advisor.", "author": "Suff_erin_g", "created": 1632467813, "retrieved": 1632952068, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"he6i1kg": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/puen56/has_anyone_gone_through_the_process_of_changing/he6i1kg/", "text": "I\u2019m going to share you my experience. I have been working with Prof A since undergraduate through an exchange program in Country A and university A. After graduating, he introduced me to Prof B as a prospective adviser who is his long time collaborator to get me to pursue a masters at a top university in Country A, univ B. So for the rest of my masters everything was happy. Prof A and Prof B work well with one another and share fundings. They also pay me to do side projects. But then for some reason, Prof B was forced to retire so the department, without my permission, transferred me to Prof C. He is relatively a young professor who is very ambitious and graduated from a US univ. He is also very much productive in his field. But Prof A and Prof C didn\u2019t get along well due to authorship and political issues. So I was caught in between. To make matters worse, Prof A began badmouthing me to Prof C so he won\u2019t want me as his student. This worked and Prof C began ignoring me early on at the start of my first year PhD. He did not even include me in group meetings and at one time, he would even throw racist remarks at me. Prof A became greedier and would overwork me with projects, papers, and even his funding grants. The worst that he did was to ask me to write for another PhD student who has very bad english. He would always remind me that he is the professor and he is paying me so I should be doing everything that he says, and not listen to Prof C. It\u2019s quite difficult because Prof C is the main adviser since I\u2019m enrolled in Univ B. During my third year, Prof A already has monopolized my abilities further and my thesis has been delayed several times in favor of his own projects. So during a meeting, I asked about my thesis. He said that he won\u2019t fund my thesis if I don\u2019t finish an additional two projects for him and then goes on to shrug his shoulders. He even tried to kill my confidence that I have designed my thesis in a wrong way. This did not sit well with me so I walked out of the lab. That was the last time that I saw Prof A. He would constantly ask his students to check on me the next months but I just stayed put in Univ B. As for Prof C, he was still ignoring me. \n\nSo I went to find a new adviser and a new university even if I\u2019m already in my third year. I didn\u2019t care about that because I was not progressing in my main objective, and that is to finish my dissertation. Everyone had been so manipulative and did not even give me the proper guidance that a professor should have. At last, I found Prof D who is a very successful and high ranking in his field. I applied to the new univ which was a top 50 univ. A considerable big step from a rank 250 univ to top 50 and working with an even higher ranking prof! I\u2019m so shocked that the prof was really kind and genuine and has good relationship with his students. I guess that\u2019s what successful people are. I was accepted in the university after I left my old univ. the new prof also knows all about my situation and accepted me. Before leaving the univ, I sent an email to all the professors and told them I\u2019m quitting. Only Prof B who retired and who was still trying to help me during my ordeal called me and told me that he supports my decision and said sorry that he retired and was not able to protect us his remaining students. \n\nAs for the recommendation letters, my undergrad adviser and univ president recommended me. I also did well in collaborations so other profs from other univs recommended me as well. I was really scared because there\u2019s no recommendations from my current univ. But the new adviser even went his way to recommend me.. \n\nAs of now, I am blessed with Prof D who is really a cool and kind person and always tells me that honesty is the most important thing in his lab. \n\nSo if you feel changing, if deep inside you you feel that this is going to help you, then do so.

I felt pretty awful about the whole thing and admittedly it was quite stressful to transfer labs, BUT it was by far the best decision I could\u2019ve made to actually graduate. My university was kind of shady about the whole thing, so they wanted me to find a new advisor and then tell my old advisor I\u2019m leaving. I was worried about the blowout if they found out before I found a new advisor, so I made the choice to directly tell them and be honest (to a certain point). \n\nThankfully they literally never come into lab, so I\u2019ve never had to run into them, but do still have to work with them on projects. I really wanted to remain on good terms with them, but long story short, they\u2019re very manipulative and I mostly avoid collabing with them at all anymore because for me it\u2019s better to be away from that situation than have an extra publication on my resume. But there\u2019s definitely a world in which you can stay friendly with your old advisor, and continue to maintain a professional relationship.\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad about wanting to wanting to switch. Everyone\u2019s situation is different, so maybe your advisor \u201cisn\u2019t as bad\u201d as other people\u2019s, but they might be just as bad for you. If you really want to switch, stay confident that you\u2019re making the best choice for yourself. \n\nMy new advisor is great, and I\u2019m actually making progress now. Submitted an F31, published a first name manuscript, and proposed a new thesis, all in a couple of months. When I talk to people in my old lab, things are still really bad and now several people are trying to leave. So it depends, but for me, switching labs was truly the best choice I could\u2019ve made.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk more about the whole process!

I would encourage that you don't burn the bridge in the process of asking (such as saying that he is the cause of your mental health problem even though it may be true) because you never know what can happen later.\n\nI know one of my labmates has done this for my group, which led to political drama between professors. Maybe others have a different story, but a lot of political aspects come into play when a student from one advisor moves to a different advisor. Also, for your second question, yes, that student who switched an advisor has never seen his original advisor ever since, and the old advisor cut his ties with him.\n\nPersonally, I think it is not worth it to change your advisor unless that is absolutely the last resort you must take, but best of luck to you. This is not gonna be an easy task in my opinion.", "author": "beat4lifez", "created": 1632479820, "upvotes": 2}}}
