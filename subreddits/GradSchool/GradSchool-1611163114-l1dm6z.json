Got everything submitted, approved, etc. Before the defense, and during the defense, me and my supervisor had a talk about my future plans. I told him I wanted to start applying for faculty positions, but if he\u2019ll have me, I wanted to be a postdoc for a while under him and finish up loose ends. Write up papers, wrap up experiments, etc. He agreed. That\u2019s what we were telling other committee members and everybody who asked. After that I applied to get my OPT. I got it, and now i\u2019m just waiting for my job offer. I just kept applying for faculty positions because i thought this could be good practice for the future as i build my portfolio up. I get to know how the process is, what is expected with no expectations because i felt i was still a fresh grad. \n\nFast forward to today, i am scrambling to keep my status and not eat into my grace period. The \u201cfunding\u201d fell through leaving me jobless with my supervisor. I am applying for postdoc positions everywhere. My browser\u2019s front page is all job boards. I can\u2019t even get a volunteer position in my old lab because HR said what i\u2019m gonna be doing needs to be paid. \n\nNow my wife, who\u2019s also finishing up her phd, is forced to earn for both of us. The disgusting thing is when I was talking to my supervisor about it, he said that he\u2019s not worried because the two of us were earning and we\u2019re gonna be ok because we have savings. Those savings were gonna be for starting our family. I can\u2019t even be depressed because I don\u2019t want to be a detriment to my wife\u2019s work. She\u2019s finishing her PhD, giving classes, and planning out her research. In contrast i\u2019m a bum.\n\nI\u2019m beyond angry at this point because I got screwed. My supervisor kept telling me there are options to keep me and it never materialized. Now i\u2019m trying for anything and not getting anything. I think i have a healthy cv, i\u2019ve been publishing since before my\nphd, but nobody has contacted me. I don\u2019t know what i\u2019m gonna do. It feels as if i\u2019m not good enough and that\u2019s why i can\u2019t even get an undergrad level pay just to keep my status. I\u2019ve read how PIs will look for money to keep or get people they wanna get, but that didn\u2019t happen with me. So i\u2019m inclined to think i never really was on the \u201ckeep\u201d list. My supervisor kept building me up, saying I was good, but perhaps i wasn\u2019t good enough. I had thought delivering what was asked of me consistently and timely would be enough to ensure support. Add that to the fact that there had been older members of the lab that tried to bully me, one being physical even, and i just kept quiet because i didnt want to create big issues. There was even a junior student who was telling everybody she was the one who generated the material and data that i did. I just stopped working with her without making a big fuss. Everything i did was for the team to keep it afloat and not about me. That was one of the stupidest things i ever did. It\u2019s not about the team in academia. It\u2019s never about the team. It\u2019s about your PI and how you\u2019re gonna be an effective and cheap tool for his advancement. Once you\u2019re not, you\u2019re gone. \n\nDont be like me. Look for options as soon as you finish defending. Nobody\u2019s gonna look out for you except for you. It sucks. I think i am gonna need to go home and abandon my dreams because of this screwup. Instead of me and my wife helping each other to get up, i am dragging her down. If you\u2019re graduating, be constantly on the lookout for opportunities. \n\nAs i\u2019m writing this i got guess what - another rejection letter. I officially suck ass.

Preferably as soon as possible.\n\nNothing is set in stone and Covid makes it harder. My advice: I know you are pissed at your advisor right now, but do not burn any bridges. You will definitely need him still, if nothing else for a recommendation letter.\n\nI am also an international student, but work permits are easier within the EU and visa is not needed. When Covid hit, we all needed to work from home for a time and I used that time to write up loose papers and started on dissertation. Importantly, I moved back to my home country enabling me to have family closer and expenses lower. I was also pregnant and gave birth. My daughter is now 6 months and I am on unpaid maternity leave since countries can\u2019t decide who\u2019s responsible for me. All in all, I was searching for a job once I started writing, since my supervisor openly said he has no funding for me. He actually has had to let quite a few people go, due to no grants coming in. I got a couple offers ( I actually got a profession outside my PhD), but I was waiting for my daughter to start child care at 1 year. Now I also received a great post doc offer (3 years guaranteed) at my former institute, with the project basically written for me. I think my old supervisor recommended me. So I think I might do that....\n\nImportant: never burn any bridges, act like you are always searching for a job, network, don\u2019t limit yourself to academia, learn soft skills, do work for the team -always, even if they are shitty, get a profession you can fall back on - preferably something in high demand, don\u2019t hold grudges and look forward in search of opportunities instead of thinking you got screwed over.\n\nAdditionally : Don\u2019t put off family for money issues, consider moving if possible.

The truth is that with the economy the way it is, jobs are very hard to find, particularly academic jobs. Trust me, I have been job searching since early 2020 as I was preparing to start on my dissertation and one year later, nothing. I am lucky that I was offered a job (that I saw was temporary until I finish my PhD) weeks before COVID, but I am certain that if I didn't have that I would still be jobless. This is not so much a reflection on you than it is a reflection of our economy.\n\nBeing an international student is hard because of visa restrictions, and this adds to the difficulty of the job hunt. With OPT, most employers are hesitant to hire because they don't want someone for 12 or 18 months (if you are a STEM major), and then having to sponsor the person's employment visa. \n\nYour supervisor is way out of line by making assumptions about your family's finances. Even if it was true, it was not his place to say something like that. And maybe he really didn't have funding, but instead of being sorry, saying that just sounds so frivolous. Totally inappropriate.\n\nYou are not a bum, and you're not useless. Your wife is not forced to earn for the both of you if she has no problems doing so short-term. If you had to push  back starting a family for a few months, it is not going to be the end of the world. I've been there. We waited until my husband finished his PhD before thinking about starting a family, and it was a good 7 or so years for us. It took him a while to find a job, but once he did, things actually took off really quickly. It felt like a nightmare when he was jobless (we were also on one income), but when things got moving we got back on track VERY quickly.\n\nThat being said, time to think of options. Is switching to an F-2 visa an option for you? Is that preferable to going home once you hit your 90 days unemployment period? Those are questions that your immigration advisor needs to answer for you. None of those are good options because it will require a change of status when you have a job, but one will allow you to stay with your wife.

I am not exactly sure where you are from, or what your PhD is in, but hospitals ALWAYS need help, especially now!
