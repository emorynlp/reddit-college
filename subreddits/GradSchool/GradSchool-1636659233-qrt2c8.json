  "title:": "Biology major w/ CS minor. Should I go back for second BS or MS?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a Biology grad from a top 50 school with CS coursework that is equivalent to a minor. Decided that medical school wasn\u2019t for me, however, I don\u2019t have any internships or industry experience at all in the tech industry. The CS-relevant coursework I have taken are Computer Architecture and Organization, DS&A, OOP, Discrete Math, and Linear Algebra. So pretty much a majority of the lower-division courses.\n\nMy main goal is to use the master\u2019s to fill in my CS gaps as well as use it as a springboard to get a job (I live in the Bay). I\u2019m been learning iOS for the last year or so and having this master's is kind of a back-up in the situation that recruiters decide to just trash my resume since I don\u2019t have a CS degree.\n\nI\u2019m currently in this dilemma of whether I should go back for a 2nd bachelors in CS or just go for a program like OMSCS or on-campus CS master's programs like UPenn, UCLA, and USC. This would probably require me to take the GRE and obtain additional letters of rec. Getting a 2nd bachelors also seems hard to attain considering most universities don't allow for it or put 2nd bachelor applicants at a lower priority compared to 1st bachelor applicants.\n\nWould love anyone's input on this as I'm starting to reach out for letters of rec and I'm not sure if I should be expending my energy on grad school applications. :)",
