  "title:": "Is the Northeastern Align MS in CS bridge program worth it?",
  "text": "I got admitted to the Align program at Northeastern and would be attending a satellite campus (Vancouver) which launched in fall 2020. Because of its newness, I\u2019m a little apprehensive about the program but I\u2019d be getting a Northeastern Master\u2019s in CS degree for $48K CAD (about 38K USD) since I\u2019m a Canadian citizen. \n\nI am considering also applying to the bridge program at NYU Tandon as well as writing the GRE and maybe doing the Boston LEAP or UChicago\u2019s program since these schools rank higher. The only caveat is that they are way more expensive. \n\nHas anyone here done the align program at a satellite campus and had a good experience? Do you think this price is worth it for a MS in CS?\n\nI don\u2019t have a CS undergrad and come from a non technical background and I\u2019d honestly rather not get a second bachelors. I wouldn\u2019t get into OMSCS without additional course work either and MCIT is highly competitive. I want to begin working in tech ASAP.",
