  "text": "I'm on my last semester of grad school and am set to graduate in like a month, but I'm not doing so hot in one of my classes, and it's likely I'll get below a C. It'll be my first time ever in grad school where this has happened, and it might interfere with me getting my degree since it's a required class.\n\nThe thing is, the class average for that course is below a C as well, and the only people doing well in the class are people who are majors or already have degrees in that specific subject.\n\nEven scarier is, I'm feeling so apathetic about it despite the high stakes involved. I've already talked to my advisor about it and he's been dodgy at best, but if I end up not getting my degree, I'll probably just leave it at that forever. I'm sick to my core with school and academia, and just wanna put it all behind me and try to make it in the job market.",

      "text": "If the average is less than a C, why are you afraid you won\u2019t get your degree? That would mean that a good percentage of the grad students won\u2019t get a degree because they got lower than a C in that one class. \n\nDon\u2019t stress about it too much. You will get that degree.",
