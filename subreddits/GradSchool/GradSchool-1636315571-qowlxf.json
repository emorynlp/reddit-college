  "text": "Sometimes it's obvious enough to me that plagiarism because I know how wildly off-base the copied answers are; either they're so ridiculous that the student could only have arrived at them by copying from online, or they used numbers from an prior year's version of the problem. However, to convince the bureaucrats that plagiarism occurred, it's much more helpful to have a proven source.",

      "text": "To get the answers from Chegg, you either have to have someone at a Dean level send an email to Chegg requesting it or simply give in and get a subscription yourself to see the answer(s). Alternatively if two or more people have the same \u201canswer\u201d then simply make the case they copied off each other. Proving something is often a hard case but you might be able to make a case for lower threshold of \u201cmost likely\u201d depending on your institution\u2019s rules and guidelines.",
