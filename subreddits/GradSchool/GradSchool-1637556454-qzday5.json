  "text": "Title. This part of the application lets you choose a scholarship you qualify for and then prompts you with an upload button with the text: \"Please upload a statement on how you meet the eligibility requirements for this award\"\n\nI tried doing some searching on what this statement should include, but didn't find much. Can anyone who has written something like this before share what needs to be in it? How long it's supposed to be? and any other helpful tips when writing this statement?",
