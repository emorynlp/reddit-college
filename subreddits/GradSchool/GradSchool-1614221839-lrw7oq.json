  "text": "PSA: Are you stressed beyond belief? Anxious about how shit your research, classes, everything is going?\n\nI kid you not. Go get some elmers glue and their magical liquid and take a break to make and play with slime for an hour. It is so relieving!\n\nMy roommate and I bought elmers slime making kit on a whim and it has been so stress relieving! We have now got all the Biology grad students making some slime and they all agree. I just wanted to share it with all of you who may be in the same boat!\n\nHappy slime-ing!",
