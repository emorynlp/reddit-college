  "text": "And I thought there would be an exclamation point at the end of that title but instead it's really just a palpable sense of relief. The urge to stress cry when my committee came out of their break room (zoom defense was not terrible but it felt like they were in there FOREVER as I chatted with some friends who sat in) and said \"Congratulations Dr.\" was surprisingly strong.\n\nAfter a curbside pick up at my favorite liquor store I'm waiting for this to feel real. Maybe after the few \"minor edits\" the committee are going to compile? I don't care. I'm technically done. It feels great, and I want everyone here to know I believe you can do it too.\n\nIn closing: [https://imgur.com/a/la50Hq0](https://imgur.com/a/la50Hq0)",

It was just... Relief. And a readiness to move on to real life.",

Going too quickly can cause you to inhale a rouge peanut chunk.\n\nAlso, everyone knows that a jelly/custard/cream filled donut needs to be attacked with a distinct plan. If you aren't careful, you'll end up with a mouthful of jelliless bread or breadless jelly. \n\nI commend the professor for not taking his pastries lightly.",
