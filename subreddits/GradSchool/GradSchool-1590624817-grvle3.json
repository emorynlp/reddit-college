The urge to stress cry when my committee came out of their break room (zoom defense was not terrible but it felt like they were in there FOREVER as I chatted with some friends who sat in) and said \"Congratulations Dr.\" was surprisingly strong.\n\nAfter a curbside pick up at my favorite liquor store I'm waiting for this to feel real. Maybe after the few \"minor edits\" the committee are going to compile? I don't care. I'm technically done. It feels great, and I want everyone here to know I believe you can do it too.\n\nIn closing: [https://imgur.com/a/la50Hq0](https://imgur.com/a/la50Hq0)", "author": "well---actually", "created": 1590624817, "retrieved": 1632953904, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 372, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"fs3uv5i": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/grvle3/i_successfully_defended_today/fs3uv5i/", "text": "Congratulations!
