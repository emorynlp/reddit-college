  "text": "I am trying to prep for grad school in the next few years.  I want to gain some research experience, and I am very overwhelmed.  I want to pursue grad school for neuroscience, biostatistics, or anything of the like.  It really depends on the program that each specific school offers.  \n\nDoes anyone have success with getting their foot in the door in terms of research experience?  I would even be happy to move if the position is paid.  I just don't know how to stand out when I have no experience.",

      "text": "I can't say this for sure for neuroscience/biostats but if they are anything like psychology, you probably won't be able to find a paid position after undergrad with zero experience (and without access to undergrad funding sources). Likely you'll start out as a volunteer RA, part time.",
