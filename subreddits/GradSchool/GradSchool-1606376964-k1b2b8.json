Most the time you wonder, \"am I out of my mind?\"\n\nBut sometimes, not always, but on occasion, you remember:\n\nYour research IS valuable. \nYou DID impact those two students this semester. \nIdeas, beleifs, education, thinking DO matter. \nYou DON'T want to sell out to corporate misery. \n\nSo you go grab five hours of sleep, and do it again the next day, and the college system, in its good, its bad and its ugly, keeps chugging along, and in the morning, your remind yourself that you ARE contributing to the good of it, cause it's a new day and there is good. \n\nAnd, besides, Ramen ain't THAT bad!", "author": "ashamedpudding222", "created": 1606376964, "retrieved": 1632845734, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 464, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "comments": {"gdthpeo": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/k1b2b8/pov_youre_a_grad_student_in_the_last_month_of_the/gdthpeo/", "text": "Sounds like the industry system but they pay better and you have a bigger impact than 2 people\n\nyes I have been bitter today but at least I sold my soul to the devil of industry before my last ounce of bambi eyed idealism was crushed beyond repair.", "author": "slim2jeezy", "created": 1606523685, "upvotes": 1}, "gdq4tic": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/k1b2b8/pov_youre_a_grad_student_in_the_last_month_of_the/gdq4tic/", "text": "You basically just described my life to a T.
