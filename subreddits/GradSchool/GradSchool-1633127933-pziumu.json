      "text": "Advisors assume that you are like 12 years old. No cap! \ud83d\ude06\n\nIn my undergrad, I pretty much was given the same advice/lecture from advisors and mentors as if I couldn\u2019t think of that plan/idea myself. I think they state the obvious, not to belittle your understanding, but to assume that you don\u2019t know it yet. I feel like they say the same things to everyone since they talk to so many students. Idk what your relationship is with your advisor, so your POV towards your advisor may be different \u2026this is just my assumption from department advisors.",

      "text": "My Master's thesis advisor used to constructively shred my chapters with comments. Feedback on about every other sentence with good advice.\n\nWhen I got to the third chapter back from him, I asked him. \"Is my writing that bad that you have to do all this commenting?\"\n\nHe said, \"Not at all. I do this extensive commenting for everybody.\"\n\nIf you have good professors and advisors, you're going to get lots of feedback. Sometimes it will seem obvious after the fact because you have achieved the background knowledge to understand it.\n\nBut there is a difference between finding something easy to understand, and being able to come up with it on your own. The latter is harder.",
