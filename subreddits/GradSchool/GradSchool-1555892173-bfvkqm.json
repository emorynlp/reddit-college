  "title:": "Two years ago, I quit grad school. I wanted to share what has happened since then.",
  "text": "I wanted to share my story because, 2 years ago, when I was grappling with my decision to quit or stay in my PhD program, I couldn't find many stories of people who had quit a science PhD. It was a difficult decision to make but was the right one for me in the end. \n\nI am not trying to encourage anyone to follow the same path, I only want to share my story in case it might bring some perspective to someone going through a similar struggle.\n\nSome background: in 2016 I started a PhD program in a subfield of biology. It became very clear I was unhappy. After doing 4 lab rotations in the first year and not being able to imagine myself in any of those labs for the next 4-5 years, I decided to leave the program. It's hard to describe everything that went into the decision and it usually ends up sounding like it wasn't a big deal. But it was a huge deal (lots of crying, I'll admit it) and lots of talking and thinking and internet searching. Maybe you can relate.\n\nI quit grad school with nothing else lined up. I don't necessarily recommend doing it the way I did because I got lucky. After I told the necessary people about my decision, one of them knew someone at a local biotech company and recommended me. I got a job a week later. I 100% recognize my luck here and this unfortunately means I don't have much to say about the job search after quitting.\n\nI worried that people would judge me for quitting grad school. The reality has been a mixed bag. I found 95% of people were supportive. One friend said \"if you felt like you needed to quit enough for you to go through with it, then that was absolutely the right decision.\" There were some people who asked why I didn't at least get a Master's degree. One person dismissed me as the type of person who quits things easily. I'm sure other people have formed all sorts of opinions. I thought it would be a huge shadow following me around for a long time but, for the most part, that hasn't been the case. Especially 2 years later, it is becoming a smaller and smaller blip on the timeline of my life. It's on my resume under \"experience\" and, when people ask, I tell them. It has not been a problem or deal breaker so far.\n\nI'm still working at that same company and have been promoted twice. I love my colleagues and the work that I do. I don't feel the sense of dread in the mornings that I felt in grad school. I don't feel the need to escape my life on weekends anymore. And I realized it is possible to move up in science-related work without a PhD. Grad school has the potential to be an amazing thing but it's not for everyone and it definitely wasn't for me. Admitting that to myself was hard (I had to go to therapy and everything). Everyone around you wants to see you succeed and wants you to stay in school (at least that was the case for me) and seeing a therapist can give you an impartial person to speak to. That helped a lot and I recommend it if you are going through anything similar and have access to one.\n\nMy main point is: it works out. Life is about trying things and I don't see leaving a PhD program as any kind of failure. We all try things and sometimes they're a bad fit or we don't like them so we move on. \n\nI'm not trying to push anyone in any direction and I hope this post won't come across that way. I would have wanted to read a story like mine when I was deciding on quitting. Maybe it will help someone, maybe it won't. Figured I'd share just in case.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you for the amazing responses and for the gold. I wasn't sure how this post would go but I am so glad so many people have shared their experiences here as well. I hope others going through similar things now and in the future can read this post and feel less alone. This is an amazing community.",

I am currently in a situation where I am supposed to leave for grad school to another state but am realizing I made that decision for all the wrong reasons. I am having panic attacks just thinking about the fact that I have to move and go into that program. I have been so torn about the implications of me changing my mind and not going. What will people say? How will it look? How do I answer questions about when I re-Apply to the school in my state. It feels like I have so much weight on my chest and it feels wrong to go. That should be enough for me to say I\u2019m not going, but I\u2019m still struggling with the thoughts that maybe I only feel this way because it\u2019s something new. Thank you for sharing, I felt so peaceful reading about your story. If I end up not going, it won\u2019t be the end of the world.",

Only this morning, I was criticising myself for not being more motivated to think about, and work towards, grad school applications. I'm very career-oriented but I've never felt that grad school is something that is meant for me. I still think about it because it seems to be the new normal, especially when I look at all the young people around myself. It helps me immensely to know that one can find happiness and career success outside of/apart from grad school, which I already do know, but actual experiences matter more. So thank you.",

I am around 8 months in to a 3 year immunology PhD, and although the topic is interesting and my lab mates are great, I found myself realising today that I am struggling with the pressure, expectations, and independence that come with academia/PhD. I was a research technician in virology before this which was great cause I could do experiments and contribute to the research but was not solely responsible for everything. I just feel that I struggle to think about things in the way that everyone else does and I'm not progressing. I get that \"sense of dread\" too and kinda live just making it through to the weekend where I can chill a bit! I love science but think I'm more suited to something more routine like a hospital lab or something. I don't intend on staying in academia after the PhD so I feel now I'm only staying for the title... I've going to speak to family and of course my supervisors in time but any and all advice would be super appreciated cause I am very confused!",

This needs to be your choice and an impartial person will help you recognize your feelings without judgement and can help guide you towards making the best decision for you. I think I only saw my therapist 4 or 5 times but she got me out of the cycle of \"do I quit, do I not quit.\" \n\nBut also definitely talk to people about your struggle with thinking about things in a certain way and progressing. Your advisors, other professors, and colleagues want to see you succeed (usually) and they might have some great advice.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in your career and future decisions!",

I have no idea what I'm going to do afterwards, but I can't help but feel a deep sense of shame and hate for myself, like I'll never forgive myself for not finishing. Does that feeling ever go away?\n\nAlso I should mention that science was the only thing I was ever good at, and now I know I'm not even good at that. Getting this doctorate was the only thing I could place my worth on. When and if you see people from your old cohort is it awkward? I know the ones in mine will talk about people who dropped out in a not-so-positive light.",

          "text": "It's very difficult to quit, it's important to be patient and compassionate with yourself during this time. My program requires first year students to take a sort of qualifying exam after the first year so I got to the point where I had to either stay and buckle down for the exam or leave. So I had outside pressure forcing me to make a choice. If you don't have that outside pressure, it can be very difficult and scary to take that huge jump, I don't think you're a coward. The feelings you're describing go away, yes. \n\nWhat makes you think you're not good at science? You used to think you were good, what happened that changed your opinion? Academia and industry are very different and you could consider finding an industry job in your field. You may realize you are good at science but that academia wasn't the right environment for you. It's normal to feel very lost and like you're not a real scientist. Find a job, start working and adding value to the company/team, and your confidence will come back. Along with your happiness.\n\nI actually don't really see people from my cohort (there were 8 of us, very small program) but I'm sure they had opinions about me leaving. Honestly, I couldn't care less. It is better to let them say what they want and to live your own happy life out of grad school than to stay and be afraid of what they will say. You're the one living your life every day, not them.",

And I'm a coward for a lot of reasons, this just being one of them.\n\nI used to think science was something was good at, but soon realized I was wrong. Everyone was smarter than I, were getting more done than I. They had grants and papers and traveled all over for conferences while I barely had anything and had set back after set back. I can't even do basic stuff anymore without screwing up, and every time I think I did well it turns out to be a failure. My boss confirmed as much this morning. I should have known, but I kept fooling myself thinking I could make up for it. At this rate I doubt I am competent enough to make it as a technician or anything of that nature, and I'm not good at anything else.\n\nI'm sorry, this just has me kicking myself a lot lately. I guess I need some time.\n\nEDIT: Case in point, I just gave my boss a pymol file with leucines labeled as charged when they're not. I had a fucking chart of amino acids open while I was doing this and still fucked it up. I don't even know how I manage to survive by myself anymore.",

Even our most well-meaning and supportive friends will have some type of implicit bias (be it towards or against grad school, the department we're in, etc.).  Thank you for sharing your story-- I think successes like yours are incredibly important for other grad students and undergrads looking at going to grad school to read about. At least in my field, so few faculty actually have any experience in industry that career paths like the one you've taken aren't even discussed as an option.\n\nSo again- thank you, and congrats! I hope you continue to have a successful career and enjoy your workplace :)",

I'm about to finish my second year in the PhD program and things are just not what I expected them to be.  I'll spare all of the nitty-gritty details, but the primary issue is that I feel like my PI misrepresented the project he wanted to me to work on before I joined the lab.  I have no bad feeling towards anyone in the lab or my PI (in fact, I really like them all), but the project isn't what I wanted it to be.  I've considered switching groups, but none of the other groups are particularly interesting to me any more.  The stress of the entire situation has been affecting both my mental and physical health for about 4 months and the daily \"feeling of dread\" that others have mentioned  is definitely real.  On the bright side, my PI is supportive of whatever decision I make and I've seen a therapist a couple times to help work through the mental issues.  I'm currently finishing the semester and taking a leave of absence for the summer to make the decision, but, honestly, I'm pretty sure I'll be leaving in Decemeber with an MS.  I've already started browsing job postings to get an idea of what's available and hopefully I'll be able to graduate and walk into a job at the top of 2020 (if anyone has suggestions, let me know, haha).",

I think her transition period of looking for a job is probably more typical (she didn\u2019t have much help from her old advisor in terms...they didn\u2019t answer the phone when employers where calling them as a reference). She also did mentioned that one of her friends spent 2 years job searching (which might be the more extreme end)",

Although I still have days in which I feel like the scum of the earth, I decided to leave (after the department suggested I leave) rathet than salvage things because I know my happiness is worth more than a PhD.\n\nI finish in June and have been dragging my feet for job apps because I have a lot of immediate work to do for my Master's.  But mostly because I still feel such a strong sense of shame and anger about what happened to me.  I worry that if I have any period of unemployment between now and getting a job, I will spiral into an even deeper depression.  It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this situation, ans that life continues to move on in a generally positive direction.",

Give yourself the benefit of time to grieve your loss, and also to discover where to apply your talents. You\u2019re just as hardworking and smart and ambitious as when you first joined your PhD program, and other people will see it in time!\n\nI can also confirm that no recruiters and potential employers have batted an eye at my quitting the PhD.

There will be salary caps as well as status insecurity, but I\u2019m making 70k+ in biopharm qc in Wisconsin with 3 years experience. I know plenty of people that have gone quite far in analytical development- leading teams, in charge of company regulatory affairs that have no more than a bachelors degree. It will not be as glamorous as R & D though. I was in your shoes I would definitely continue to aim for something computational. Hope it works out for you",

Meanwhile there are millions of fresh-outta-college students to do the same menial work at terrible wages on 6 month contracts. Well, let's  be real, it's not fresh outta college students doing it now, it's people with 5 years experieince.\n\nThis is why I'm trying to move to tech. I think it is much easier to find an actual permanent stable position, AND wages seem higher. I realize I'm going on anecdotes in this post, but I really have talked to a lot of people about this transition, and I think it can be backed up with stats too.",

They have a huge leg up and are possibly able to graduate early (because they can start research earlier because the coursework isn't as difficult). \n\nShit, I've seen a third-year PhD student who passed their quals but their professor moved. They moved with them and the second institution required him to retake a huge chunk of coursework.",
