I wanted to share what has happened since then.", "text": "I wanted to share my story because, 2 years ago, when I was grappling with my decision to quit or stay in my PhD program, I couldn't find many stories of people who had quit a science PhD. It was a difficult decision to make but was the right one for me in the end. \n\nI am not trying to encourage anyone to follow the same path, I only want to share my story in case it might bring some perspective to someone going through a similar struggle.\n\nSome background: in 2016 I started a PhD program in a subfield of biology. It became very clear I was unhappy. After doing 4 lab rotations in the first year and not being able to imagine myself in any of those labs for the next 4-5 years, I decided to leave the program. It's hard to describe everything that went into the decision and it usually ends up sounding like it wasn't a big deal. But it was a huge deal (lots of crying, I'll admit it) and lots of talking and thinking and internet searching. Maybe you can relate.\n\nI quit grad school with nothing else lined up. I don't necessarily recommend doing it the way I did because I got lucky. After I told the necessary people about my decision, one of them knew someone at a local biotech company and recommended me. I got a job a week later. I 100% recognize my luck here and this unfortunately means I don't have much to say about the job search after quitting.\n\nI worried that people would judge me for quitting grad school. The reality has been a mixed bag. I found 95% of people were supportive. One friend said \"if you felt like you needed to quit enough for you to go through with it, then that was absolutely the right decision.\" There were some people who asked why I didn't at least get a Master's degree. One person dismissed me as the type of person who quits things easily. I'm sure other people have formed all sorts of opinions. I thought it would be a huge shadow following me around for a long time but, for the most part, that hasn't been the case. Especially 2 years later, it is becoming a smaller and smaller blip on the timeline of my life. It's on my resume under \"experience\" and, when people ask, I tell them. It has not been a problem or deal breaker so far.\n\nI'm still working at that same company and have been promoted twice. I love my colleagues and the work that I do. I don't feel the sense of dread in the mornings that I felt in grad school. I don't feel the need to escape my life on weekends anymore. And I realized it is possible to move up in science-related work without a PhD. Grad school has the potential to be an amazing thing but it's not for everyone and it definitely wasn't for me. Admitting that to myself was hard (I had to go to therapy and everything). Everyone around you wants to see you succeed and wants you to stay in school (at least that was the case for me) and seeing a therapist can give you an impartial person to speak to. That helped a lot and I recommend it if you are going through anything similar and have access to one.\n\nMy main point is: it works out. Life is about trying things and I don't see leaving a PhD program as any kind of failure. We all try things and sometimes they're a bad fit or we don't like them so we move on. \n\nI'm not trying to push anyone in any direction and I hope this post won't come across that way. I would have wanted to read a story like mine when I was deciding on quitting. Maybe it will help someone, maybe it won't. Figured I'd share just in case.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you for the amazing responses and for the gold. I wasn't sure how this post would go but I am so glad so many people have shared their experiences here as well. I hope others going through similar things now and in the future can read this post and feel less alone.

I was a research technician in virology before this which was great cause I could do experiments and contribute to the research but was not solely responsible for everything. I just feel that I struggle to think about things in the way that everyone else does and I'm not progressing. I get that \"sense of dread\" too and kinda live just making it through to the weekend where I can chill a bit! I love science but think I'm more suited to something more routine like a hospital lab or something.

Does that feeling ever go away?\n\nAlso I should mention that science was the only thing I was ever good at, and now I know I'm not even good at that.

I'm about to finish my second year in the PhD program and things are just not what I expected them to be.  I'll spare all of the nitty-gritty details, but the primary issue is that I feel like my PI misrepresented the project he wanted to me to work on before I joined the lab.  I have no bad feeling towards anyone in the lab or my PI (in fact, I really like them all), but the project isn't what I wanted it to be.  I've considered switching groups, but none of the other groups are particularly interesting to me any more.  The stress of the entire situation has been affecting both my mental and physical health for about 4 months and the daily \"feeling of dread\" that others have mentioned  is definitely real.  On the bright side, my PI is supportive of whatever decision I make and I've seen a therapist a couple times to help work through the mental issues.  I'm currently finishing the semester and taking a leave of absence for the summer to make the decision, but, honestly, I'm pretty sure I'll be leaving in Decemeber with an MS.
