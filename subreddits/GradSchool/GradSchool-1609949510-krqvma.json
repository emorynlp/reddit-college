Please bare with me through this. My anxiety is through the roof and just writing this is making me sick to my stomach.\n\nLast semester was my first semester of graduate school. I am currently pursuing my MS (thesis option) and I have a really amazing research assistantship right now. My RA is fully funded through my entire program and my stipend has been increased since last semester (I was a TA).\n\nAnyways, my project is starting to ramp up this semester and I am struggling to start. While classes don't resume until next week, my work started again on Monday. I have accomplished NOTHING in the last three days. I have maybe spent two hours \"working\" and by \"working\" I mean just staring at all the articles I have to read and then breaking down. Over and over and over again. I don't know how many more break downs I can have before I am pushed over the edge. I fear that if I continue down this path, I will crack. I have a history of depression and anxiety that have stemmed from an eating disorder I had when I was a teenager. I have been doing so well for years and now my mental health is just being ripped to shreds. I haven't felt this low in so many years and for the first time in over 5 years, I'm beginning to feel suicidal again. I'm in a really dark place right now.\n\nI started experiencing some of these feelings last semester and I reached out to the counseling services on campus. I had a few sessions of therapy and while it helped in the moment, I don't think it made any impact for the long term. I was on medications years ago for my depression and anxiety, but all they did was make me feel more suicidal.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. My SO and I moved across the country for this opportunity back in August. I feel like such a failure. I'm so lost. I'm so heartbroken. I truly never wanted to go to grad school in the first place. I interviewed for my position back in June (which was pretty competitive) and I  the day after I interviewed I was offered the position. I accepted this opportunity because that's what it was- an opportunity. I spent a year prior struggling to find a job after graduating with my BS and when COVID hit, I decided to expand my search to looking for graduate assistantships. I figured grad school couldn't be that bad? I was so sick of wasting my time working as a bartender/server while I struggled to find meaning in my life. I figured that at least with this opportunity, it would give my life more meaning. It would give me a sense of purpose.\n\nNow, I feel nothing but sadness, dread, and guilt. I DREAD having to open another article to read. I DREAD a meeting I have with my major advisor today to edit the QAP for our project. I feel SO guilty taking a spot from somebody who would have enjoyed actually working on this project. I have no passion for this project. I have no motivation to work on it. I constantly feel like I'm about to vomit. My stomach is in 20+ knots, my heart is racing, and I feel like I'm about to have my second break down of the day.\n\nI don't know if by writing this if I am trying to seek advice or help or what. I'm just lost, and scared, and so angry at myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I want to thank all of you for your kind words. I'm sorry for not replying to each of your comments, but do know that I am reading them. I'm struggling to even type this out. I am going to give myself the next few days to come to terms with my next step. One thing I want to mention that I may have not addressed before (I'm struggling to think coherently right now) is that I have no issues with my courses. Actually, I really enjoyed my courses last semester! This semester I will only have one course and will solely be focusing on my project. I want to clarify my research just a little bit. The project I will be working on is quite big and in a way, I think it has just become too overwhelming for me. There are many dimensions to this project and this project covers a lot of ground (covering an entire geographical area). I think that it may just be too much for me to handle at this time. I'm considering the idea of taking a leave of absence, but I know that if I do that I will lose this project and honestly, I'm okay if that happens at this point. I have a few people that I am going to talk with over the next few days to get some input and direction on where to go. I also want to mention that I did take the last two weeks off for the holidays to take care of my mental health, and I do let myself have the weekends off. I think those two weeks just weren't enough for me to take care of myself.\n\n Again, thank you everyone for being SO incredibly supportive <3\n\n&#x200B;", "author": "Animal_guru", "created": 1609949510, "retrieved": 1632846114, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 322, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gik6l5e": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/krqvma/grad_school_is_destroying_my_mental_health/gik6l5e/", "text": "I literally cried in front of my PI and one of my\ncommittee members when they asked me if something was going on.

Relate to this a lot. Also just finished semester 1, significant other and I moved across the country for MY school. Was on a TAship last semester (that was absolutely awful) and moving to a better RAship this semester.\n\nFor me I feel like I'm figuring out where the dread comes from. All online classes, not really meeting anyone in my cohort or department, only leaving my apartment in a new part of the country for like 2 hours a week, my life has been voided of all human interaction with people other than family and previous friends, all of which are over a thousand miles away except my SO. So whenever it comes to having an email exchange or a meeting or any personal interaction with someone new, it's like I've forgot. Or it's like I think I remember how it's supposed to go, but that doesn't stop the dread and anxiety. I don't quite know how to fix it yet, except more interactions to normalize interactions again. A fellow student at a distanced social remarked, \"It seems that after all this time locked up we may have all forgotten how to socialize.\" I think after all this time, with such a different lifestyle, it's hard adjusting.\n\nI don't really have advice, I'm more so living a similar experience alongside you. I would only remark to consider taking the semester off and finding some other way to pay the bills. Worst case scenario is you're in school a lot longer, but you figure things out. If you remain in school, worst case scenario your mental health deteriorates, which will lead to a demise in everything else. Then you've lost out on time as before, but are in a much worse position.\n\nI hope you find what works for you. Taking a semester off can feel like failing, but no one really signed up for any of what's going on right now. Everything that needs to line up will.\n\nEDIT: I would also like to remark that my approach for this semester is trying to treat it like a job. Setting boundaries. It's especially hard since everything is at home. Wake up, \"go to work\", break, class, \"go back to work\" and clock out at 5. I feel like if I can commit that things will go a lot smoother.

Getting it off your chest is so important to keep the anxiety from consuming you too much. I\u2019ve experienced the same thing as you (and im sure many commenters have too!) Back to work this week and I felt like my tank was empty. I also struggle with anxiety and I, too, have also accomplished fuck-all this week and bawled my eyes out at the anxiety of simply stepping back into the year to face grad school again. I\u2019ve been waking up everyday with a knot in my chest but I keep telling myself to take it one day at a time, one week at a time. With grad school, I\u2019ve had to cope with easing my naturally anxious excessive planning & need for structure. The learning curve in grad school is impossibly steep that there is no amount of preparation that can ready you for it till you\u2019re thrown into the chaos to grow through it yourself. So take it day by day and realize doing your best WILL look different EVERYDAY and that\u2019s ok! You just cannot see that far enough and ahead for the never ending journey that\u2019s grad school. Just focus on the hour in front of you, getting through the day and then getting through small tasks for the week. Your footsteps will hopefully get lighter even if it won\u2019t feel that way for a long time at the beginning!\n\nSo many of the comments here have been wildly supportive and comforting that I\u2019ve saved them for myself too. Especially resonating with the ones mentioning that it\u2019s **absolutely ok** to not feel like the most passionate person on earth while in grad school and to treat it as just work / a job. It\u2019s easier said than done seeing how there was definitely some innate driven passion/curiosity that even got us to this position in the first place. It still no doubt exists inside of us but the grind of grad school will try to tear it apart. But grad school is an experience. It\u2019s a transition. It\u2019s not meant to be forever (sure feels like it though). It helps you learn skills along the way and you teach yourself more than it teaches you. It blows my mind when I realize that we literally have ZERO training for this job. We learn on the job as we go along every single day - designing experiments, spending 50% of the time just getting equipment to function, scientific thinking, critique, literature review, writing, presenting, becoming a scientist etc. It felt horribly lonely at the beginning because there is no amount of orientation that can mentally prepare you for the road ahead. The downside is the tough emotions that accompany it may not completely be over until this is over. So it\u2019s really important that you don\u2019t sacrifice your current wellbeing just to get to the other side because this is a LONG journey. There has to be some way you can create happiness, rest and joy outside of grad school. \n\nDecision to leave or stay is completely up to you OP - nobody gets to speak for you. But I\u2019d just like to chime in to not make big decisions when your mind is turbulent because the heavy emotions are so all consuming that it will thwart the way you view yourself and the situation you\u2019re in. Give yourself some time to breathe, soak in positive reaffirmations and work through your emotions, then consider from all perspectives. \n\nIn my first year of PhD I cried every week like clockwork for the entire first semester and wanted to quit constantly. I was thrown into a completely new project and realm that nobody else had expertise on in the lab, not even my PI. Everything had to be built from the ground up and I felt so lost and overwhelmed at the sheer impossibility of moving forward. I would get panic attacks from thinking about yet another experiment that isn\u2019t working out and full on cry in my car before even stepping into the lab. I\u2019ve felt so broken down from failed experiments that I had to escape the lab to cry in the toilet too. Somehow I made it through to my second year now, crying a little less and feeling more like myself again. Negative or positive data aside, growing through what you go through helps you feel just a little braver and easier to tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ve gone through this before, I can go through it again\u201d when you inevitably hit snags along the way. Along the way, I definitely set boundaries for myself to prevent the very severe burnout I was experiencing (I went from a year of undergrad honours research to PhD with only a 3 month break in between). I stopped glamorising the \u201chustle\u201d of working till late in the evenings, stopped working weekends & made sure NOT to guilt myself about it, I became more open about seeking help (from PI / fellow grad students / postdocs) and voicing out my worries instead of isolating myself to deal with difficult emotions alone, I made time for my hobbies. I put my well-being as a person first before my existence in grad school. And somehow it got me a bit further than I thought I could ever handle. Like I said, baby steps one day at a time. Deal with things as they come, not as you fear.\n\nEveryone\u2019s experience is so different OP and all I can do is offer my support and to tell you IT IS OK. YOUR EMOTIONS ARE VALID. PLEASE DON\u2019T BE ANGRY AT YOURSELF OR YOUR EMOTIONS. YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS. With or without grad school.

Grad school is really hard in general, but I don't think people realize the impact it can have on student's mental health unless they've been there. It's a type of \"hard\" that's difficult to explain. \n\nI think one thing that might be helpful is to realize that you don't necessarily need to feel passionate about the work you're doing. Grad school isn't really about that for lots of people - it's more so about developing a skillset, learning the tricks of the trade on a project, regardless what this project is. In that sense, there's nothing \"wrong\" with you for not feeling passion or motivation. \n\nThe sadness, dread, guilt bit is also, I think, a wide experience lol. For me personally, I think about the redeeming qualities of being a grad student - i.e. \"I feel less stupid now than at this time last year.\" That's enough to keep me going most days. Having said that - I, like you, went back to \"work\" on Monday and have done shit all, productivity-wise. \n\nI guess the moral of the story is that you're not alone and there's nothing \"wrong\" or even unique about any of the things you're feeling.

I'd say give it a chance - try to find a combination of medications that work for you now at this stage of your life.\n\nAnd of course, exercise, eating healthy, getting good sleep, and reaching out others is so important too.

I also had an ED during my teenage years, and all that comes with it. Never was as ready to die as I was last semester.\n\nHave you thought about why you feel this way? It's one thing to say, \"I am in grad school and I feel horrible.\" But why? These are hard things to find and admit, but they are worth doing because, objectively, grad school is just a job that I and many in my cohort take way too seriously at the expense of our health (by admission). That you don't like the work can't really be all that's going on, because you didn't like the work you were doing prior and that's why you (and I) are here. I'm working through this as well, but to be honest a lot of my problem is that I am terrified of being judged and I am terrified of disappointing others and failing. To be more concise, I am taking myself too fucking seriously. The best advice I've been given so far is to take my emotions out of the work. It's just work. It can be rewarding sometimes but it is a job.\n\nAnother possibility is that you are simply burnt out. Shit, I am. Do you take any days off during the week? What do you do besides school?
