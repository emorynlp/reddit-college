  "text": "Every time I watch a video posted by my professor or read through the comments made on my papers, my professor is preaching that we NEED to be using grammarly premium and following the APA sample paper our school has as an example. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it seems like she almost wants me to use the sample paper as a template, and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s grading my grammar based on what grammarly premium is saying rather than using her own comprehension. It\u2019s really frustrating for a number of reasons, one being that my papers are very strong and I don\u2019t need a program to tell me what\u2019s wrong with my papers when there\u2019s actually no grammar issue whatsoever. \n\nIs grammarly premium really as great as my professor is praising it to be, and have any of you ever had professors rely on it so hard? I feel like it\u2019s pretty unprofessional how much she\u2019s relying on it, especially since when she makes comments on my papers all she says is \u201cuse grammarly premium to avoid errors like this.\u201d",

There is a difference between penalizing students for serious problems and basing the grade on the number of improper semicolons or typos. \n\nThe fact that you're even asking this question suggests something is deeply wrong. Either you're being graded on grammar in lieu of content, (perhaps the professor really is having grammarly to grade!) or your professor is working themselves to death trying to do both at once.",

The alternative is using Hemingway, which identifies the same things but is much cheaper (one time cost). Obviously, you still need to use your judgement and it'll make incorrect suggestions for some technical stuff.\n\nI still had my supervisors read through the thesis but there was noticeably less corrections to be made. With the two reviewers, I got one minor corrections and one no corrections. IMO, Grammarly definitely helped me clean up some poorly written sentences.",

All languages have a long list of grammar exceptions or complicated nuances, and automatic tools tend to have problems with the more obscure ones, such as some aspects of academic writing.\nI'm just starting in my field, and English isn't my native language, so I find a grammar tool invaluable. It doesn't save you from learning proper grammar, as you should know when the tool is wrong, because it will be wrong in some scenarios.\n\nI personally find that Grammarly Premium is prohibitively expensive for me, and looking for alternatives I found LanguageTool (https://languagetool.org), it is an open source grammar checker with a cheaper hosted premium option and good extensions for browsers.",

Like people were turning in work without capitalizing \"I\" and misspelling tons of words (which I blame on the lackluster high schools in the area and our universities lack of support in helping these students but that's a whole story of itself).\n\nIt's weird your professor is recommending it if she expects you to pay for it and if your writing is overall solid. Grammarly makes a lot of mistakes, especially with academic writing. I would only recommend it to students who struggle with basic grammar and spelling which shouldn't be an issue in graduate school - with the exception of dyslexia or second language issues.",

It can more reliably spot basic grammar errors, has an admittedly good vocabulary (it's spotted a lot of more technical terms for me), and is a good tool if u already have the basics down. You need to have the basics down because it'll give you a ton of false flags depending on your writing style. If you know what suggestions to throw out, it'll essentially act as a second, albeit weaker, pair of eyes.",

The last paper I reviewed (for an IF 6 journal) had over a hundred minor errors left after running through grammarly, and I took the time to point every single one of them out and requested the authors hire a native-language proofreader. They did, and the article turned out exceptional.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely suspicious that a professor is pushing this nonsense. They should be promoting the use of human proofreaders who are educated in English composition. Your university may even have a writing center that offers this for free.",

The additional features of Premium are just a bit too buggy, like it\u2019s a beta release for academic writing. The free version does what it does very well, though, since it only does simple grammar.\n\nCan be risky though: if you don\u2019t know English or formal writing well enough to get the grammar right, maybe you also can\u2019t tell when grammarly gets it *wrong*.",
