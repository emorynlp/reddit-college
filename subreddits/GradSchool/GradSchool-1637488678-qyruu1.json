          "text": "Georgia Tech is a great school for STEM, but they're also the only place that refers to Georgia Tech as \"the MIT of the South\" lol. They are more highly ranked than private schools OP lists.\n\nKeep in mind that the state of Georgia also recently gutted tenure for public colleges like GT, so they may have a much harder time recruiting new faculty than other places, and may have issues with faculty retention? Only time will tell.",

              "text": "True true.\n\nBut if cost is a factor, I think OP would likely get the same quality education at GT right now (and for the immediate future) as those private schools. But the tenure issue will fl definitely be a factor retaining good faculty and will over time decrease that quality. Something definitely worth pointing out and keeping in mind!",

      "text": "That\u2019s really too broad of a question. The short answer is yes it\u2019s a good school. The longer one is more complicated as certain schools are better known for specific subjects, and at times specialize in specific sub-areas of focus within those subjects. Then the question becomes not how well respected they are as an institution, but whether their program and faculty align well to what you are personally interested in studying.",
