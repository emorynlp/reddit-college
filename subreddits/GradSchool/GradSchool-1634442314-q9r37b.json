  "title:": "How does anyone afford to move out of state for school without a job?",
  "text": "So basically I\u2019m feeling really hopeless and discouraged these days because I do not know what to do. I had this naive idea growing up that if I got a degree I\u2019d be able to either find a job that I was qualified for or enroll in a graduate program and move away from my home state. I don\u2019t like living here and I\u2019ve wanted to leave for years. I now have my degree but I have loans that I need to pay back I had to take out to get it. I just got a job recently but it doesn\u2019t pay a lot. I live at home currently and don\u2019t have expenses in that regard. Being able to afford to leave though feels insurmountable. :( I don\u2019t know how I can afford to go to school somewhere else without taking out more loans and I don\u2019t know how to find a job or a place to live that I can afford that will allow me to go to a school in a better area. My parents can\u2019t afford to help me at all really except what they already do by allowing me to live at home rent free and to pay for my food and living expenses. My move will have to be entirely financed by me but I don\u2019t know what to do. My parents have lived here most of their lives and they are locked into staying here because of my dad\u2019s work and inability to relocate. I don\u2019t want to end up stuck here forever. I have to get away but I don\u2019t know how I can afford school or how to even get hired for a job in another state. Moving to another state without a job waiting for me isn\u2019t an option cause I will have no way to support myself. How does anyone afford to leave their small towns to get educated elsewhere? I\u2019m having a quarter life crisis and don\u2019t know where to turn.",

Not all programs do this, so you need to do your research. \n* Work for a while and save. Then spend your savings and/or take out more loans. (not recommended).\n* Don't go to graduate school.",

STEM fields generally only accept you for a PhD program if they\u2019re going to give you a TA or RA position, and those include a tuition waiver, sometimes a fee waiver, usually health insurance, and a stipend a little above the poverty line. If you live frugally, that\u2019s enough to survive on, and you won\u2019t have any debt when done.",

In the meantime, start looking for jobs in cities you want to move to. Lots of places are doing interviews over video chat these days anyway. If you don\u2019t have a deadline you can just put some applications out there and see what lands. You can also stay where you\u2019re at, save up a couple of months of living expenses, and then make a move and start applying once you get there. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend going to grad school just to get out of your hometown. It\u2019s probably the most expensive way to achieve that goal and most grad students don\u2019t have a ton of time to meet new people/explore their new city anyway..",

The advice I got prior to applying for my MA is to *only* go to a program if they fund *well.* Tuition covered, and then usually a stipend for your work in the department.\n\n\nKnowing that, I did some searching and only applied to MA programs that funded most or all of their students. I accepted my highest offer. That offer was enough to pay rent where I am now located, so the only logistical issue then was actually getting there from where I lived.\n\n\nFor that, it just took some pre-planning. My last year of my ba, I saved some of my work-study money and all of my tax return, so I had a little put away. Then over the summer, I moved back with my parents so I wasn't paying out rent. I got a paid internship and a part-time job, so I had enough money to make the drive here.",

I\u2019ve browsed many different and good schools online but I couldn\u2019t ever find anywhere on their websites where they spelled out how much tuition help they were willing to give. It seems like a lot of schools seem to keep that part pretty well hidden because I couldn\u2019t find any that said anything about TA opportunities or tuition waives. :/ This scared me out of applying cause I didn\u2019t want to somehow magically get accepted only to find out I wouldn\u2019t be getting any financial assistance and that I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it. I don\u2019t have any family who has gone to graduate school so I don\u2019t know anybody who knows how this works or how to apply for aid.",

              "text": "For the basics (what type of funding) it'll sometimes be on the program site, but for other info, it's sometimes doing extra stuff like writing the director of graduate studies to get more details about it. Some programs may give less info than others, but how they answer can be useful data on its own.\n\n\nWith assistantship funded aid, what I saw was either programs who would either automatically consider you for aid if you applied, or folks who would ask on your app if you wanted to be considered. In those cases, they either included your offer with your acceptance or in a separate offer letter. One program where I applied had accepted students interview four different positions, and you only found out your offer after that process. I liked that the least because it took the longest amount of time to know what exactly you could get.\n\n\nThe other thing I will say is that at least in my experience, you won't know the full scope of your offer until the end of that cycle. So it's possible that at the beginning of letters going out, you won't get any funding, then you could get offered funding for decision day if the initial wave of students has people who decline their offer. One school did this to me, and I have a friend who accepted an offer because of this, so if you don't get money but the program gives money, it can be worth not formally turning down your offer until it's right on that April deadline. And remember: if you really want to go somewhere but aren't sure if they were offer you enough, you can always say no once you see that number.",
