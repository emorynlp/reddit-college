  "text": "I know this is probably a common theme on here, but I feel the need to ask anyway. I've only just started grad school and I'm starting to slowly question if it was the right move.\n\nI had similar feelings when I got to the end of undergrad (about my chosen field) and just blamed it on my Bachelors taking me longer than usual (twice as long, for various reasons) thus making me tired of doing school. \n\nI took a 2 year break after graduation doing some random stuff and felt like I was ready to go back, but now I wonder if I was just out of options.\n\nI just feel a little lost.\n\nAnyone else feel this way? Even if you don't, I'm open to advice/suggestions!\n\nI plan to talk to my therapist at the end of this week, but I wanted to get some opinions from people who might be in the same spot.\n\n(Sorry if I rambled)",

      "text": "There are two primary reasons to go to grad school\n\nYou love the discipline and crave learning more about it.\n\nThe degree you're seeking is important to your career path.\n\nIf either of those things are true, you're in the right place as long as you're motivated.\n\nAlso, you're at the middle of the semester. If you're like most people, things are going to heat up a lot with all the work that's due by the end of the semester. It's the lull before the storm so to speak.  How you are feeling at this moment could be quite different from how you will feel mid December when the semester is finished.\n\nSo my advice is to start organizing and preparing for the end run. Focus your energy there. You'll be glad you did the last few weeks.",

              "text": "I had fellow grad students who would take it easy the last weeks of October and the first week of November. But then they were having to work through Thanksgiving and pull all nighters the last couple of weeks.\n\nI always started my end of the semester projects pretty seriously around now and just kept a steady pace where I only had to gear it up a little bit the last couple weeks. Then I could take off a few days at Thanksgiving (a welcome break), and was not pulling all nighters in December. I was never very stressed at the end. \n\nAlso, by getting started well on end of the semester projects around now, I could get enough done to go in and talk to my professors in November about them for further guidance.\n\nI think the quality of work is better then, too, because of the importance of gestation time. Giving yourself time to work on things and think them through, without having to try to push through so much work in a short period.",
