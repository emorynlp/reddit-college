  "title:": "Prospective school only sends rec letter emails AFTER app submission? Is this as dumb as it seems?",
  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to 13 PhD programs, mostly at large R1 state universities. Out of these, 12 do the usual recommendation process- the applicant enters the recommenders\u2019 emails while filling out the app, and the recommenders immediately get an email with letter instructions. Most of my apps are due in December/January, and so I made sure to reach out to my recommenders in late September/early October so they have enough time. \n\nHowever, one school (app deadline of December 8th) requires full application submission before sending rec request emails. I confirmed this with the department secretary as well as the university\u2019s graduate division. It\u2019s not a big deal and it honestly helped me get some fire under my ass to start writing my generic statement of purpose ahead of time, but it was kind of annoying and strange when I found out.\n\nHas anyone ran into this? Why would a university engage in such a counterproductive and seemingly abnormal practice? I would expect something like this from a highly selective place to maybe cut down on the number of unserious applications, but the school in question is pretty middle-of-the-road. Anyway, just curious.",

I\u2019m not trying to be snarky I guess I\u2019m just really confused about what the issue would be. Once you point it out I may see it and totally get it!\n\nEdit: to add to my post, many job applications don\u2019t ask for references or contact them until you\u2019ve made it through the first round anyway so this seems fairly in line with that",

You never know when they may start reviewing early and you can be harder to get noticed, or you could just have some issue last minute that stops you from submitting on time.\n\nRegarding sending all the requests at once\u2026 I don\u2019t think that matters either. Professors (and GAs who write letters) make one rec letter and spend two minutes changing the info with each resubmission. We don\u2019t need it sent all at once.",

They're probably  trying to get the jump on better schools by recruiting candidates by getting you to submit your full app in early December.",
