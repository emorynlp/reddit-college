  "title:": "Why is there a commonly repeated idea on this sub that non-STEM PhD programs in the US aren't usually fully funded?",
  "text": "I've noticed a trend on this sub over the past few years. Nearly every time someone asks about fully funded grad programs in the US there is an answer that says something like \"All STEM programs are fully funded, but that is not the case for other disciplines.\"\n\nThis is completely false. Nearly all well regarded social science and humanities PhD programs are also fully funded. And if they aren't its a sign they really didn't want you or the program has some major systemic issues that you should avoid anyways. Yes, STEM programs generally have higher stipends and masters programs are more likely to be funded for STEM students, but that isn't the question being asked. So why is there this idea out there that only STEM PhD programs are funded that keeps being repeated on this sub?",

Compare that to stem fields (engineering: 3.8%, life sciences: 9%, physical sciences: 3.8%) and you find a clear difference.\n\nSo people are saying it because for every 5 humanities students reading the comment, one might consider an unfunded position, seemingly despite your personal experience.",

That\u2019s what my gripe is, especially when we relate this back to the big picture question here, which is practically, what do we tell applicants when they ask about whether or not to take an offer that isn\u2019t funded. Could you honestly based on that data tell someone to just take a non-funded offer to, for instance, a psychology program, just because 25% of psych phds have to fund themselves, compared to 9% STEM phds who have to fund themselves? No, of course not. With those statistics I\u2019d still tell people in psych that you should be able to find and expect an offer with funding. Yet, OP and others recognize that people are not giving this sound advice to similar applicants and are instead falsely suggesting that social science majors like psychology are rarely funded and therefore that\u2019s something you just have to expect when it\u2019s just not true.",

While not conclusive, you could make the presumption that then 91% of STEM PhDs are funded, and 75% of social sciences/humanities is funded. *How does that suggest that STEM is largely funded while social sciences/humanities is not?* **All I see is that both are largely funded, with STEM a little bit more so.**\n\nYou could make the argument that there is a significant difference when you're talking about education vs. every other major, but that's a specific argument that isn't exactly being made here. In the first place, humanities and social sciences shouldn't be lumped together. They have different sources of funding, with social sciences having more research based funding from sources like the NSF and NIH that are more similar to STEM than something like English or pure humanities.",

Many PhD students in Humanities and Social Sciences have to teach in order to have their tuition waived and to receive a stipend, for instance. Maybe the notion is that you're not 'fully funded' unless your funding is attached to your research rather than to teaching?\n\nAnother thing that makes things more complicated is the distinction between being funded formally and funded 'in-practice'. I'm in my fifth year in Communication, and my funding offer is technically only for four years: 1 year fellowship, 3 year TA guarantee in the department. But in-practice, everyone beyond their fourth year just applies to TA for writing or language programs in other parts of the university and gets funded that way. My friends in Anthropology, History, Visual Arts, Sociology, etc. are in a similar boat. While there is technically no guarantee of funding for the entirety of a Humanities/Social Science PhD at my university, everyone who applies to teach for writing programs gets an offer, so in-practice our degrees are fully funded.",

Even when people with those backgrounds are hired by industry, it is usually in small numbers. There will always be more market demand for chemical engineers than zoologists.\n\nAt least in my experience, universities put about as much priority and funding into their pure mathematics department as they do the most neglected humanities fields.

I should say that I was also admitted to public schools that had generous social science funding that came from the school and not the PI. In the end, the offer from the school I accepted was only marginally better than offers from public schools (say, Big 10 range). But, again, your point is well taken. I advise everyone I can to go to a well-funded school if they want to pursue social science topics.\n\nNot sure if you're in SS or H, but the de-coupling of funding and work is beyond just the source of money in your bank account. It also means that you are often not affiliated with a lab, so you are free for the first couple of years to \"shop around\" for profs that support your work. If you find a prof whose study you would like to join (e.g. for field work or something), then you can. But for many of us, the prof merely plays a supervisory role. I speak to my advisor a few times a year when they read my drafts. I'm a quant social scientist and fairly independent. Some people prefer more oversight. But I am truly free to plan my day/weeks as they work best for me and my research.",

Plus their funding is controlled by advisors and it sounds like from many of them, if you piss off your advisor your funding could be gone and you are essentially out of the program making them have to put up with way more toxic behaviors and time demands. My research grants have been in my name to my bank account for my own project with nothing my advisor has real control over and I like that freedom. It makes spending 5-15 hours a week TAing for a stipend and insurance on top of the outside research funding totally worth it.",

Currently I am guaranteed priority when TA slots open. This is what fully funded means and my own research happens either in the evenings or the weekend. Also, if I do not make an active effort to get a TA position with a faculty member, I do not get paid. Finally, if I want funding to do my research (similar to what I had in my genetics PhD by virtue of being in a lab and having a PI) I need to bring in my own funding from external sources (graduate fellowships for example).",
