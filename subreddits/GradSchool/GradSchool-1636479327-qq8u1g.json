  "text": "Okay so I am a senior in college, graduating with a bachelors in animal science and a minor in wildlife and conservation. \n\ni have no clue what i wanna do with my life but i honestly have always considered being a teacher. I would love to teach elementary education but i\u2019m not sure if I can go to grad school for that without having some sort of education background from my undergrad. \n\ni could ask 1000 other questions ab grad school but can someone at least answer that",

      "text": "There is always a market for teachers, so getting into grad school or other credentialing avenues is quite easy, at least in the US. Pro tip, the only way to become good at teaching is through experience in the classroom, so don\u2019t overspend on a grad program! If you live in a major city with a big district, you can also see if they offer contracts where you train on the job while earning your credential for free (there are certainly drawbacks to this approach, but my point is there are lots of ways to get credentialed in the US).",

But teaching is an intensive profession and I would encourage you to do an internship before investing thousands of dollars into a teaching degree. The demands are high and the attrition rate is also high. Check out r/Teachers",

      "text": "Depends where you live. In Canada it's a two year professional post grad undergraduate program to get your Bachelors of education, enabling you to teach in public boards. This degree is not difficult, as it's a lot of pass/fail and placement. Your masters in education is a typical master's degree, and your doctorate of Philosophy in (educational field) is the following step and is a typical doctorate in difficulty. Most teachers here stop at B.ed as it's all that's required. I have b.ed and masters and beginning doctorate next fall after some years of classroom teaching to continue my career. If outside of Canada I unfortunately can't help you. If within, lmk any Q's u have!",
