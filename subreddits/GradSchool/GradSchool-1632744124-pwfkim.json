I'm currently an undergraduate student and was on the pre med track before realizing after countless volunteering and shadowing that being a doctor was not exactly what I wanted to be and realized research is what I was actually looking for. I have been looking over what my motivation is what my focus in research would be. But the problem is regardless of what I was planning to do after undergrad I have done horribly in school due to mental health, trauma and lack of discipline. It feels like no matter what I'm scared I wont be able to fix this and get into a PhD program and that makes me so scared. Maybe I'm just letting this off my chest but the fear is real and especially cause now I'll be graduating later than expected and my family aside from my parents will be incredibly judgmental of my choices. Theres just too much I'm stressing over and worried about.", "author": "bokuakaken", "created": 1632744124, "retrieved": 1632951993, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hehrlvm": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwfkim/feeling_lost_and_like_a_failure/hehrlvm/", "text": "Oh man, I was in a similar space graduating from undergrad. Honestly, I decided not to go to grad school and went to work in business for 5 years while I figured my shit out and climb out of the financial hole I dug myself into. I am now a second semester masters student.\n\nI don\u2019t have solid advice for you since this is pretty personal and only you can decide how to move forward but I will tell you that you shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed. Academia is hard and it\u2019s a lot for a young person to feel so pressured all the time to figure out what they want to do. Life does not work the way academia thinks it does, and it\u2019s always been my biggest grievance with it.\n\nAsk for help. Talk to someone, an advisor, therapist, friend, someone. Sometimes just talking things through can help a lot.\n\nLastly, you have your whole life ahead of you and no amount of planning or passion can prepare you for what life throws at you. Anyone saying you have to figure it out right now is full of it. I\u2019m 28 and while I decided to go back to grad school to become a teacher, I still am figuring out who I want to be and what I want my life to look like, and I can say with 100% certainty that my career choice is but a fraction of the equation. \n\nI found solace in eastern philosophies, daoism in particular helped me a lot. Not sure it will be your cup of tea, but it\u2019s helpful when stuck in a rut.\n\nGood luck friend, try not to stress, life is too ridiculous to take seriously :)", "author": "itsajackel", "created": 1632763207, "upvotes": 2}}}
