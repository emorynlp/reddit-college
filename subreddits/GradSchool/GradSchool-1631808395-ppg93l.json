The program wants you to take all of your classes in the first year and have you do your thesis in the second year. So I'm currently in three classes plus doing my first ever TA-ship in a new city. It feels like a lot as most people I know are either doing three classes or two with a TAship. I want to be able to do all my readings thoroughly but right now I only have time to just get through them as quick as possible. Do you think two classes plus a TAship would be a better workload? Or, a better question, is it reasonable to take one class in the next fall semester while I work on my thesis? Thanks!", "author": "sideoftrufflefries", "created": 1631808395, "retrieved": 1632952561, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hd4i1s2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ppg93l/first_semester_of_grad_school_3_classes_and_a/hd4i1s2/", "text": "My PhD program required three classes and a TAship if you needed departmental funding every semester for our first three years, even when working on our MA theses (although we were able to take reading hours for one class starting our second year). So I guess that sounds pretty normal to me. And honestly, having no classes while doing your thesis sounds great. But I don't know you or your program necessarily.", "author": "archaeob", "created": 1631824614, "upvotes": 3}}}
