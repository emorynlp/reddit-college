      "text": "It'd be difficult to do for sure and very likely to burn you out and affect your performance pretty severely. In the long run, it ends up not being worth it, especially if you end up doing poorly in classes and end up having to repeat them and spend about the same amount of time had you been going at a slower pace.\n\nAlso, a lot of programs will place a cap on how many hours you're able to work if you're doing the program full time specifically to prevent the problem of not being able to focus on your coursework.",

      "text": "2 classes (6 hours) is considered full time at my university so if you are working full time that would be A LOT. I'm not in political science, but I've taken classes in that department  and in my experience it tends to be a very reading and writing heavy discipline. I had to drop a class because it required an average of 160 pages of reading every week, much more than the two other classes I was taking at the time, and it required a final paper that was like 40 pages. I think taking 3 classes would be ridiculous, personally. \n\nThat is also not including the amount of time you will need to spend doing research, which often equals or exceeds what you spend in class. If you have a 40 hour workweek with your job, I would conservatively double that to get a sense of how busy you would be if you enrolled in a Phd program. The readings you do for classes and the readings you need to do for research don't always overlap, so you could also find yourself having to read a ton more for things like literature reviews or project planning. You'd also need to find a professor who is willing to work around your full time work schedule, and that alone may not be possible. If you're not interested in doing research then that obviates that need, but then there's also no point in getting a PhD. \n\nAnother potential complication is course selection. Some required classes may not be offered at a time and in a modality that you could take them. If your work schedule is flexible, then you could manage it, but not all classes in grad school are evening classes. Many are offered in the middle of the afternoon and do not have an online version in the summer. Some are only offered in one semester, so if you can't enroll due to scheduling, you'd have to wait another year only for the class to potentially be offered at the exact same time.",

The only way that I can manage that is because my full time employer is the university and they are being very flexible (both my professional job and the academic department).\n\n3 classes would be basically be a full time job just for the PhD, 2 is difficult enough.",

      "text": "Not all programs would allow you do to it part-time, so you\u2019d need to have a clear idea of your goals with getting a PhD and whether schools that allow part-time students will get you there. \n\nFor example, I\u2019m in a social science PhD program and I have strict deadlines for completing my MA thesis by spring of year 2. There\u2019s no timeline for someone doing it part-time.\n\nIn addition to classes, you also have to think about making time for your research. You\u2019ll be expected to make progress toward your thesis or dissertation while taking those classes. \n\nFor reference, 3 classes is full-time at my school. I\u2019m taking 1 class, TAing half-time, and working on my thesis, and that\u2019s over 40 hours of work per week. TAing gives me a tuition remission, so if I weren\u2019t TAing, I\u2019d be paying it myself. Depending on your job salary, working full-time during your PhD might not save you money, because you\u2019d be responsible for tuition. What\u2019s your motivation for working full-time during the PhD?",
