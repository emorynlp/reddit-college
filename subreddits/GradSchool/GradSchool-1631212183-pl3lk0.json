  "text": "I've started teaching as part of my MA, and I've been given a small history class. The students are all fine, but one is starting to frustrate me a little. \n\nWhen I ask a question to the others, the student keeps jumping in if the others can't answer straight away. The student is also overly confident, which I applaud, but they are almost at the bottom of the class for quizzes (homework is fine, but quizzes aren't the best), so sometimes they come up with irrelevant ideas and derail the class a little. \n\nThey're not a rude or bad student, but it's just starting to get a little tedious, especially when I'm trying to get through a lot of content, or steer the discussion to a specific topic, and they keep going off on tangents.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? It'd almost be easier if they were a terrible student, or blatantly nasty, so I'm at a bit of a loss.",

Unrestrained in lecture as if it were a game of jeopardy, my tests and quizes were poor quality since they reflected my impulsive answering rather than carefully reading and considering. I missed deadlines, held class hostage with tangential inquiry, it was cringy. \n\nThe thing that gave me the tenacity to work through treatment was the underlying empathy for the other students. If your student can be made to understand how their actions effect others, they might seek help to reign in their behavior.",

You can also pull them aside after class and let them know they need to give others a chance to think. Remind them to wait 30 seconds before answering so others have a chance, especially if they\u2019ve already had opportunities to speak in class that day.\n\nETA: remember, you are the authority in the room. If they try to derail you, just say \u201cinteresting, maybe we can discuss that during office hours.\u201d They probably won\u2019t come to office hours to discuss it but it shuts them down in the moment without being completely dismissive. \n\nTo your other point about his quizzes being bad\u2014tell him you\u2019d love to see as much effort and enthusiasm go into his studying as he shows in the classroom",

At my university, when they refer to our (student) clinic for testing, they often pay for a big hunk of the testing. \n\n(Also, even when we conclude, \"No, it is not ADHD\", we figure out what *is* going on and make recommendations based on that.)",

Now, I\u2019m good at Math, but give me to do a long calculation and zeroes will drop\u2026 \n- Overcompensation: the student may actively participate because they feel guilt about missing out on keeping up with the course.

You get 1 follow up but after that sorry we need to return to lecture, speak to me after class about it. The logic here is that usually if you have a question, theres many students who may have the same question, so it benefits the class. The one follow up is that I'd hope the answer satisfied most students, but there might be one or two students  still not getting it/missing something. After that, The only person who needs information is that specific student, therefore it does not benefit the entire class to discuss, come see me afterwards for a 1 on 1.",

If you're lecturing and stopping for student comments or questions, you're kind of stuck with straightforward verbal approaches that others have outlined. Even if it wasn't this frustrating student, you'd face some fairly common problems. But, with TPS, you're having the students discuss their answers with each other, which:\n\n1) lets everyone try to answer the question or address the topic, even if only to each other\n\n2) lets you listen for common misconceptions or wrong answers\n\n3) lets you strategically pick a pair, whether to highlight a common response, the correct response, or get quiet people to talk more\n\n4) hopefully builds everyone's confidence to participate more\n\nI think you'd find this effective to deter this behaviour in a way that's pedagogically sound and generally good practice.",

And the open ended nature of the statement saves the student some face.  If they still don't \"get it\" afterwards, then a more direct comment in line with what others have mentioned is helpful.",

      "text": "I used to do this - especially since I really, really enjoy creative interpretations on presented material (to this day). What finally made me realise that I) I was getting the class off track II) I was being too overzealous was a teacher (not a professor at the time) talking to me after class and saying, *Al\\_the\\_time, it makes me happy to see someone engaging the material and already able to make some connections. It is important and something I hope others in the class start picking up on too. But, for* this *class, the exam doesn't encompass that, its a straight forward exam on basic knowledge that you have to know to go further in the study - and regardless if you do or not, it's what I need to cover so that you all can pass the test. Keep thinking through the material, but give other students the opportunity to speak so I can gauge where* everybody *is.*\n\nI appreciated them understanding my motivation for engaging as I was, and reframing this to make more socially aware of my responsibility as a student and *their* student. It was extremely helpful to me as I practiced this over time.  \n\nMy reasons for interrupting were a) I thought that intervening and somewhat de-railing the class would lead to more challenging, interesting conversations, and b) I felt that challenging the set curriculum would let me see something others couldn't/wouldn't while gaining my foundations in the field. I still believe both of these things, but translated them out of the classroom once I realised it was kinder to my professor and classmates - and better for my own foundation - to just listen and pay attention to what was happening in class, and *outside/in addition to that,* elevating and challenging what I wanted outside of class in projects, office hours, etc.\n\nPerhaps taking a similar approach to students who exhibit a desire of creativity and mastery -  set the idea of a dual challenge, and emphasise the notion of consideration for the class community.",

Feedback is an important part of the learning process. It gets easier if you think of this as a chance to do a bit of mentoring. \n\nI actually like leading these discussion by asking the student questions and using that to guide the conversation. How do they think things are going? Is there anything they need help with? What\u2019s going well and what isn\u2019t? Their response can help shape how you address this, so plan your feedback for any questions in advance, but do listen to what they say and adapt as needed. For example, they may sound overly confident, but actually feel like they have something to prove. Maybe they like the subject but struggle with some aspect of it (e.g. test anxiety).\n\nIn terms of planning your feedback, think in compliment sandwiches. Yes, it\u2019s trite, but it\u2019s a good starting point for constructive feedback. Something like: \n\n>On my end of things, your enthusiasm is great. I just want to make sure everyone gets a chance to participate in discussions. Can you please hold off on answering if I don\u2019t call on you? I love the interest in the subject, but I want to make sure everyone gets a chance to answer questions. Thank you, I appreciate it. See you next week! \n\nIt\u2019s low key, and you can always bump it up from there. It\u2019s up to you if you also want to mention their quiz grades.

Some students are hesitant to just jump in without being acknowledged first and others draw a blank when someone cold calls on them. \n\nIf you need to re-direct the student that's always jumping in, you could say something like \"let's give (REDACTED) a chance to respond if they want to\" and then ask (REDACTED) if they have any thoughts. \"Let's hear from someone we haven't heard from yet\" is another good one.",
