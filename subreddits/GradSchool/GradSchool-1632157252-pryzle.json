  "text": "I always had the plan to continue my education and go to grad school. However as applications have opened up I find myself clamming up and I'm starting to second guess if this is a path I want to go down. Mainly because I feel like I don't have a good enough reason to continue my education. The only reason I have is because I don't know what else to do. \n\nSo why did you guys go to Grad School?",

      "text": "lol see, I was the exact opposite, it took me 10 long years (off an on of course) to finish my bachelors and afterwards I was like fuck this I'm done w/ school I'm over it, I never wanna go back... but then my life got hella stagnant w/ not much success or even remote life stability (like a real job maybe) came from my bachelors, so I started to reconsider if grad school was maybe something I was willing to do. I applied for the mental health cousenling program at the same university I got my bachelors and they like immediately rejected me and that kinda had me thinking \"maybe I'm not grad school material...\" but I had reached out to a bunch of different schools outside of my state cause I had big dreams of moving, and I got some informational materials from this real hippie looking place that caught my attention and I decided to look into which lead to starting the application, but then I drug my feet w/ a personal essay and resume, and next thing I know I have someone from the school reaching out to ask if I am going to complete the app by a certain date and tbh I was shocked anyone gave a shit whether or not I planned to finish ya know. So that encouraged me to take it more seriously, so I finished the personal essay and submitted it, then they say they wanna do a zoom interview and I checked the website and saw that's something they do w/ pretty much everyone so I wasn't thinking much of it, but then I felt like the interview went surprisingly well, and it came up that I was missing 2 of their 3 undergrad prerequisite courses, and so they gave me the offer to take the classes I was missing and if I passed them I would be admitted, I went to [study.com](https://study.com) which they recommended and took the first class and got a high B and they went ahead and accepted me, and then I made an A in the second, and now here I am going into my 4th quarter to finish out my first full year of grad school since I started Jan. 1. And ya know even after being accepted I seriously doubted I was really cut out for my program (mental health counseling) and somehow this has been a mistake, but how tf have I made either an A or a couple A+'s, so I mean my grades seem to indicate I am cut out for this, so maybe I need to quit doubting myself.",

      "text": "Start with your end goal. The plan backwards to where you are today. Does it absolutely have to run through grad school? Or does it not have to, but really should run through grad school? Do you like researching? Are there alternatives that give you equivalent credentials?\n\nI notice a lot of people say, \"I want to study my passion,\" because they really liked undergrad. But do you want to learn about your passion or do you want to research your passion? Personally, I love reading other people's research, but original research myself is not something I'm good at. \n\nFor me, since I'm a teacher, I really think 80% of my teaching skills came from actual teaching, and 20% came from grad school. But there really isn't a way to teach and get a good salary with just a BA. I wish I could have skipped it, but then I'd be making less money than I did as a union cashier at a grocery store.",

I\u2019m only going to grad school because it\u2019s just the necessary path in order to get to the career I want\u2026 without post graduate studies it\u2019s not possible to join the field (at least not formally registered). I would say that grad school is for the most part difficult and taxing, and I would tell a friend to only do it if they felt like it was important for them/they had the passion for research. That\u2019s just my two cents! You could always take a break, work for a bit and get a better idea of which road you want to take? Maybe academia versus industry? Goodluck!",

      "text": "Grad school is a huge commitment. Before deciding on grad school in immunology, I read a lot of job postings to figure out 1) which positions I wanted, and; 2) what skills/education was needed. A PhD was listed for the senior positions that I\u2019d eventually want.\n\nI also worked for a few years in both academia and industry (I want to pursue a career in industry, not academia). My supervisors all suggested that my work ethic, grades, and curiosity made me a good fit for grad school. By working in academia, I got familiar with grad school and research. By working in industry, I figured out what I want for my career.\n\nGoing to grad school just because you aren\u2019t sure what else to do is generally discouraged. Could you pick a job position and try working for a bit? Do you need grad school for your desired career? Can you volunteer in an academic lab to see if you like research?",

If I hadn't done that, I absolutely would not have ended up in the type of program I am in now, doing something I'm super interested in but hadn't thought about doing seriously enough previously. For me, grad school is important because I switched fields from my undergrad major (French bachelor's -> CS master's) and it puts me in a better position for getting a job in the country I want to work in.",

              "text": "I had done a university certificate in computer programming as an undergrad, so I had some coursework already to show that I knew my basics and could hold my own. I used that to get into an online master's program in Data Science (online because I was unable to attend the residential program, since I was living abroad). I leveraged that year of an online master's to get into my dream program. My SOP and my LORs were definitely important, as I really had to make it clear why I was a good fit despite my non-traditional background, especially as I was applying to schools in a country where they're usually pretty strict about prerequisite degrees. I'd recommend really learning about what area of CS interests you and making sure you have not only the practical skills, but the theoretical base as well. My current program is heavy on theory and having done those other courses previously really helped me to not drown in information now.",

I chose a doctoral program because the degree I will attain gives me a large degree of flexibility in terms of settings and jobs I can work in the future. If you aren\u2019t sure why you want to do this, I would recommend waiting: it\u2019s a big commitment, can be expensive, and is time and energy consuming. I have also found it very fulfilling to dictate most of my own education, to be able to be involved in research, and to learn wth others who are passionate.",
