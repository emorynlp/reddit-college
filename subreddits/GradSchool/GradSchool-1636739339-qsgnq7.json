  "title:": "How to drop out due to serious medical issue",
  "text": "Im in my first semester of grad school. I also just found out that I may have a serious neurological issue that while it may not be fatal will decrease the quality of my life for the rest of my life. Although I'm perfectly capable rn the news is devastating and i have no idea how I'll focus in the final month of this semester. How do I go about doing a withdrawal for medical reasons? Is there typically a specific person in the university administration that handles this type of stuff? I guess I want to try not to tank my grades on the off chance i can resolve this medical issue or i want to give it another go after I've come to terms with how shitty my life will be",

      "text": "Talk to your advisor about the types of withdrawals your school offers. They should have some insight on what your appropriate options can be. You need to provide them with details about how you're feeling and some information regarding your medical issue for your advisor to see why you'll be requesting it. And don't feel as if any type of withdrawal will negatively impact your reputation as a student. I've had some family medical issues as well as moving issues myself for this semester; I explained to my advisor how stressed I was and how I was having a hard time adjusting to changes along with the medical issues. They were very understanding regarding why I wanted to lighten my workload. So seriously, don't worry. If your advisor is a genuine person and the department and school care about the welfare of their students, they will completely understand why you've chosen to look into different options to finish this semester in any way you can.\n\nAlso, I'm very sorry to hear about this. I hope everything will go well and the issue can be addressed quickly with your doctors. Hang in there, bud. Life gets rough sometimes but we always have to keep our head high \ud83e\udde1",

May schools also have medical leave options for situations like this that don't require fully withdrawing from the program. \n\nI know in my program people have deferred their final grades until the next semester, giving them the time and space to handle the emergency in front of them and not have it affect their grades. That might be an option for you?",

But it varies from institution to institution.\n\nAsk your advisor. If they don't know, then you can try the department director of graduate studies. If that fails, talk to the college Dean's office.",

      "text": "It seems like you\u2019ve gotten some good advice on withdrawing. I wanted to say, as a PhD student with a systemic, progressive autoimmune disease, that there are resources at your disposal to help if you want to continue or return to graduate school. If you\u2019re in the US, your school should have a disability services office that helps with accommodations. For example, some accommodations that I\u2019ve gotten or considered include reduced course load, flexible deadlines, flexible attendance, and a note taker. Also, scheduled transport with the accessible van service that brings me around campus for my schedule. If you ever want to talk about grad school with a disability, I\u2019d be happy to chat. \n\nDefinitely look into whether you can take a leave of absence if needed, because then you won\u2019t lose your place in the program if you decide to come back.\n\nI hope your program is understanding about your situation. I can\u2019t speak for your diagnosis, but from my experience: getting the diagnosis is really, really rough, but it gets better. Best wishes for your health and your studies.",
