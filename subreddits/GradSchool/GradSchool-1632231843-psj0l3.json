  "text": "Story time: Two nights ago I was driving home and I realized I hadn't backed up my thesis in a quite a while (3+ months). Realizing the danger I was in and that Murphy was probably looming somewhere in the shadows, I backed up my thesis when I got home.\n\nAs if on queue, I lost my primary flash drive yesterday. Luckily, I had backed up all of my stuff only a day or so before that instead of several months ago so it was a minor inconvenience versus a serious setback.\n\nAlways back your stuff up, friends. Save yourself the heartache and wasted time.",

I've been telling everyone to back it up to GSuite, but I guess the data didn't quite cut it.  \n\nHe ended up having to send it out to a hard drive recovery firm and after everything was done, it cost like 1200 dollars.  Yeah our advisor reimbursed him for that but safe to say...   It's always cheaper to back up than lose months/years worth of data.",
