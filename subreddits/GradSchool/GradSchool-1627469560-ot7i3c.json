Basically a wakefulness agent.  I think it was a huge part of my recovery.\n\nFor me, I knew part of my stress response, when it gets really heavy, was shutting down a bit.  Usually feeling really tired.  I also knew that shutting down and falling behind led to more stress.  And it was a *substantive* stressor.  I wasn\u2019t doing what *I* wanted.  I wasn\u2019t living life like I wanted. \n\nStress can create blocks.  And part of being a functional, thriving person is pushing through those with intention.\n\nSo I discussed using modafinil \u2014 a wakefulness agent to see if it helped. (I\u2019ve been prescribed a aderall and ritalin before, which are stimulants, but also anxiogenics. So n steps forward and m steps backwards.)\n\nAnyway, it seemed to help a ton! Importantly - it\u2019s hard to ascribe cause because when we try to improve our lives there are multiple things going on simultaneously. But I felt more \u2018on\u2019 despite stress and didn\u2019t notice the extra stress that I seemed to get with, for example, aderall.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t make things *easy*.  Or not scary.  But it helped keep me on my feet so that I could push through that and start fixing my life.  And *that* I feel is what helped me deal with my anxiety/depression/whatever \u2014 substantive changes and continual, active confrontation of irrational feelings/irrational levels of feeling.\n\nAnyway \u2014 I just wanted to mention it as something to discuss with a doctor/psychiatrist if you want.", "author": "OphioukhosUnbound", "created": 1627501453, "upvotes": 1}, "h6v0h4f": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ot7i3c/mentally_out_of_shape/h6v0h4f/", "text": "Same here, I have barely done anything academic or even fun since May.

I don\u2019t know how chill your boss is, but last summer I was also feeling this way and straight up asked my boss for a week off.

Days 3 and 4 I started cleaning my home and dabbling with small things that bring me joy, like gardening and drawing. By day 5 I was itching to be back in lab, and actually sat down voluntarily to read about my project and plan my week back.\n\nWhen I got back to lab it felt like all of my motivation and energy came back, and suddenly I was able to keep up with everyone again without any issues. It was such an improvement in productivity that I got more done in that first week than the previous month, and I never felt bad about taking a break again. And now that I\u2019m staying on top of maintaining work-life boundaries, I\u2019m needing fewer and shorter breaks.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is definitely the solution for everyone but it\u2019s simple enough that it\u2019s worth a try.
