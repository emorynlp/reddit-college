You don't feel like you deserve any rest, the expedition starts shortly after and you're struggling even more.\n\nI've finally found words to describe how I'm feeling with mental work. I have done so little last months but I don't want to wake up anymore. So I wrote them out, if you're in a similar situation, if you have tips feel free to write.",

I'm also taking a year longer than most people in my program and have felt very alone in my writing this year too. And I've also seen a therapist and worked on procrastination -- I absolutely still do it, but it has helped me to think about it as an emotion management problem not a time management problem. The times that I'm really procrastinating on something, I'm probably also suppressing an uncomfortable emotion. \n\nI don't know if I have any advice -- just here to commiserate and say I felt very seen by this post.",

      "text": "Sleepy peeps \ud83d\ude34 and stress \ud83d\ude16.\n\nSomething, slightly non-standard that helped me:\n\nWorking with my doctor I started using low-dose modafinil.  Basically a wakefulness agent.  I think it was a huge part of my recovery.\n\nFor me, I knew part of my stress response, when it gets really heavy, was shutting down a bit.  Usually feeling really tired.  I also knew that shutting down and falling behind led to more stress.  And it was a *substantive* stressor.  I wasn\u2019t doing what *I* wanted.  I wasn\u2019t living life like I wanted. \n\nStress can create blocks.  And part of being a functional, thriving person is pushing through those with intention.\n\nSo I discussed using modafinil \u2014 a wakefulness agent to see if it helped. (I\u2019ve been prescribed a aderall and ritalin before, which are stimulants, but also anxiogenics. So n steps forward and m steps backwards.)\n\nAnyway, it seemed to help a ton! Importantly - it\u2019s hard to ascribe cause because when we try to improve our lives there are multiple things going on simultaneously. But I felt more \u2018on\u2019 despite stress and didn\u2019t notice the extra stress that I seemed to get with, for example, aderall.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t make things *easy*.  Or not scary.  But it helped keep me on my feet so that I could push through that and start fixing my life.  And *that* I feel is what helped me deal with my anxiety/depression/whatever \u2014 substantive changes and continual, active confrontation of irrational feelings/irrational levels of feeling.\n\nAnyway \u2014 I just wanted to mention it as something to discuss with a doctor/psychiatrist if you want.",

I don\u2019t know how chill your boss is, but last summer I was also feeling this way and straight up asked my boss for a week off. Not to go anywhere, not to accomplish anything, just to turn my brain off and ignore emails.\n\nI spent the first 2 days as a lump on my couch phasing in and out of sleep. Days 3 and 4 I started cleaning my home and dabbling with small things that bring me joy, like gardening and drawing. By day 5 I was itching to be back in lab, and actually sat down voluntarily to read about my project and plan my week back.\n\nWhen I got back to lab it felt like all of my motivation and energy came back, and suddenly I was able to keep up with everyone again without any issues. It was such an improvement in productivity that I got more done in that first week than the previous month, and I never felt bad about taking a break again. And now that I\u2019m staying on top of maintaining work-life boundaries, I\u2019m needing fewer and shorter breaks.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is definitely the solution for everyone but it\u2019s simple enough that it\u2019s worth a try. If it\u2019s something you can afford/have access to, it would also be a good idea to get in with a therapist/psychiatrist. Pushing on like this without any support/outlet can lead to burnout.",

It isn\u2019t a break to sit at home worrying about work or answering emails. And you don\u2019t want any major obligations. \n\nThe rest is just being super gentle with yourself. Take some time to just veg out a bit, but put a limit on it, like a day maybe. And then do some super low key stuff to get your body and mind moving. Stuff that doesn\u2019t actually matter if it\u2019s done well or even gets done at all. Like maybe you start doing the dishes and get tired halfway\u2014don\u2019t get mad at yourself. Just take a break and try again later. Low stakes.\n\nThen once your body is kind of \u201crebooted,\u201d do some more energizing activities that do not include work. Like hobbies, or spending time with loved ones, but don\u2019t vent about work or think about work. \n\nBasically the idea is to give your work-mind a moment to shut down and restart, but stay active and engaged with other things so you don\u2019t shut down completely. Once the juices start flowing again, then you can try to transfer that energy into work.",

Mindfulness meditation also helped me quite a bit, as far as getting that true mental rest that's so hard to find. It's no substitute for therapy, social support, and healthy boundaries though.",

Quarantine made it hard to socialize, I spent most of my time working on various class projects and then either playing games or venting to friends through texts.\n\nPutting myself first would have meant cutting corners to lessen my workload. Communicating with class assistants to clarify what the expected minimum is. Taking regular time off to de-stress. Taking my headaches and attention issues seriously, and not letting them worsen with every week. Exercising much more regularly - I gained weight and my posture worsened. My back started hurting whenever I'd stand up, but I ignored it. Making sure to be present when talking with friends, and not be mentally checked into various classes the entire time. Potentially visiting a therapist. \n\nThis past month I had been trying to put myself first (before school and work), but I was being very passive in response to all the stress I'd been under for so long. In a way, I still let school dictate what I did, as I was prioritizing giving my mind a break and getting back into mental shape over improving my mental health, my physical health, my personal happiness and my social life.\n\nI sacrificed a lot in order to do as much as I could, and since work in academia is never over, I could sacrifice a lot. Putting yourself first in this situation means making sure that those sacrifices are warranted, and that the work you are doing is still in service of your life, not the other way around, like it was for me. Now I'm overall miserable with very little in my life, and it shows. People, who are important to me, don't want to be around me, either because haven't been there for them for a long time, or because I'm honestly no fun to be around.
