  "text": "So, as the title says. I mean, I could go in to grad school for CS and hope that it involves math, but then will it be the same? If I cannot get into a master's program, then I have don't see any real path towards a math PhD.\n\nI don't suppose anyone around here tried to do that CS -> Math switch? If they did, I'm wondering just what they did.\n\nAre there other avenues into math that don't involve going to grad school? No self-learning, I have a hard time learning math on my own and I don't think you can learn Real Analysis, Measure Theory or Multivariable Statistics on a screen on your own. I don't think I want to go for another undergrad degree either, I don't think I have the time for it, and I'm not interested in pure math as much as I care about certain applied maths. ",

      "text": "I am a graduate student in an EECS department. I did courses on real analysis and measure theoretic probability as an EE undergrad, and courses on discrete probability and high-dimensional statistics in grad school. Most of my research is applying mathematical ideas to problems in \"CS\" and I know plenty of people in my cohort who collaborate with theoretical computer scientists, statisticians and applied mathematicians. You will find that the fields that appear very distinct and separate in undergrad will gradually all meld in to one another as you study further - borrowing ideas, techniques and even problem formulations from one another. \n\nNow, applied math is a very broad area, and I primarily interact with a small subset of people working on probability, stats, learning, etc. Are there specific problems in applied math that interest you which aren't really within the domain of theoretical cs or ee? If so, the situation is a bit more complicated.",

      "text": "I am trying to make the switch (to pure even), and the short answer is definitely difficult, and it will not happen without sufficient self-studying,  that's the real ugly truth.\n\nFirst of all, your first course of action is to decide exactly what you wish to do in applied math. \n\nIf there is overlap, you may be able to get into a CS programme and pick appropriate courses that are math heavy. Some programmes allow you to take courses from other departments within the same faculty.\n\nI am in a CS programme, but I am effectively doing applied mathematics, well, machine learning to be exact. I picked courses with math, and what I didn't know I covered on my own. It's not impossible, but needs a lot of dedication and many sleepless nights.\n\nI plan to get a PhD in ML, and that will be effectively applied math. During the PhD I will be going to graduate courses from the mathematics department, given that I have covered the background knowledge, just to observe, one course per half semester, by the end of the 3 year PhD, I will have covered 12 courses from the math department, so effectively have the necessary background, and get a PhD. Note that this may be infeasible and subject to change, but i am prepared to give up all of my life for it.\n\n\\----\n\nAlternative plan for you:\n\nTake a look at Master of Advanced studies/ Mast at Cambridge, it's a programme that effectively brings you up to speed for PhD studies, and doesn't have that heavy math requirements. There should be similar programmes elsewhere. But you need to figure out what you want to do and if you do that, chances are there will be overlap with CS.\n\n\\----\n\nRegardless of what you do, your solution will involve many sleepless nights of self studying,  there is no escaping that.",

I don't mind doing that, it would be nice to get a title out of it, but I figure that's not really necessary if I already have a CS title. Most people will think you're already a math junkie with that alone even if CS maths are pretty basic. Can you get just a math minor? I'm not sure if that's something you can do, but that would be interesting. \n\nWhat do I want to do? Ideally ML, but at a more serious level with understanding of the math that's going on. I know you can get into that without doing much math, I don't like that.\n\nOtherwise, I want to end up doing quant finance or something involving supply chain management.",

Our ML course was math heavy, and so will be your research if you take this route. But you don't need an \"applied math\" degree for this.\n\nWhat you need is a very strong foundation of linear algebra, probability theory, and vector calculus. Depending on where you go from there, you may need abstract algebra, Riemannean geometry and so on, but that means self study. \n\nIt is not impossible to do it on your own, but I do concur that a math degree is far,  far better for ML.\n\nIf you can go through a book like \"Elements of Statistical Learning\", or Bishop's, you are more than fine.",
