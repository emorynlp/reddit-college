I'm a first year PhD student in chemistry and I'm nearing the end of my 4th week. It's been overwhelming but honestly I've been really enjoying it so far. I had a ton of anxiety going in but have been managing really well, all things considered. \n\nHowever, a few days ago,  I was talking to a second year in a group I am rotating with and he just really started to scare me. He started going on about how you can get kicked out because no groups will take you (even though it doesn't happen often) and how he almost failed a class I am in now and is on probation. \n\nI really love research and have a couple of great groups I would be very happy in here, but this 2nd year has me panicking and it's made me worried the rest of the week. I also had a PI recruit me to the program who I would love to work with, and apparently it is possible for him to just turn me down. I had no idea. Now, it has really scared me and I'm worried that no groups will take me. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice/ logic to deal with these sorts of anxious thoughts in your first year?", "author": "castor2015", "created": 1631300341, "retrieved": 1632952710, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "comments": {"hcctq7o": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plrb3n/how_to_deal_with_first_year_anxiety/hcctq7o/", "text": ">I was talking to a second year in a group I am rotating with and he just really started to scare me.\n\nSounds like a second year who is excited to have some first years to bully.\n\n>he almost failed a class I am in now\n\nThis person is not going to be helpful to you.

However, you just take it as it comes. The best advice I can give you for the stage that you are at is to go to any workshops or tutorials that are recommended to you by your department or supervisor/prospective supervisor. You'll win brownie points, and they may actually give some critical information you otherwise would have missed. Don't take on the experiences of other students, but do learn from them. If you see a lot of grad students failing under a specific supervisor, avoid that person like crazy because it is almost certainly the supervisor's fault at that point.", "author": "ProprioCode", "created": 1631302095, "upvotes": 3}, "hcchxv1": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/plrb3n/how_to_deal_with_first_year_anxiety/hcchxv1/", "text": "My advice is to consider the student in question. It is clear that he has issues and projects them onto you. He is in a bad place, is probably anxious and vents his frustrations onto you. \n\nMy advice, talk to and form relationships with those that are enabling and positive. If none are around (I.e. stressed out and unhappy is a default in the department), then it is worth thinking about your environment. Is it good for you?\n\nYou most likely will find people that are more positive and successful. Listen to their advice and don\u2019t be afraid asking them about how they think you are doing or what you should do.", "author": "EdgyEdgarH", "created": 1631300782, "upvotes": 7}}}
