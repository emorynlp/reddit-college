The program is pretty specific but definitely a newer field in STEM.The work load is heavy and I'm also doing two jobs (one research and one to actually make money lol).  \n\nHalf of my class are professionals with a few years of experience and the other are straight from college.  This younger half goes out partying and drinking till 3am. I've gone a few times but usually leave before midnight while they stay out partying. I'm also in a serious relationship so really not interested in the clubbing or get-drunk-hook-up life. They're all super nice and friendly and always invite me to join. But I just can't do two jobs, full class load and maintain my relationship and family while going out four nights a week.\n\nAny other professionals going back to school feel the same way? Anyone else being the lame adult that doesn't go to bars between classes? I'd love to hear ya'll experiences", "author": "Blabitybla2021", "created": 1630542548, "retrieved": 1632845148, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hbbf50x": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pg6raw/classmates_party_animals_in_grad_school/hbbf50x/", "text": "I'm really struggling to see the problem here.\n\nYou don't want to have the die-hard club life.
