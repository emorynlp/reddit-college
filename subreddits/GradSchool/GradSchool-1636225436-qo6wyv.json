  "text": "I am applying for Master's in computer science to an American university as an International student.\n\nMy name is   \"ABC DEF GHI\"\n\nwhere ABC is my given name, DEF is my middle name (father's) and GHI is the last name.\n\nMy country's passport however has only first name and last name.\n\nMy passport shows first name as \"ABC DEF\" and my last name as \"GHI\"\n\nWhile filling university applications, I see that they ask for only First name and last name.\n\nI am unsure if I need to fill my first name as \"ABC\" (given name) or \"ABC DEF\" (as per the passport).\n\nI would have preferred to use \"ABC\" as \"ABC DEF\" doesn't make much sense as a name.\n\nBut however, can it be matched with my passport by the university?\n\nI have always used the entire \"ABC DEF GHI\" everywhere, be it my CV or transcripts. But the problem arises only when I am asked separately for first name and last name, but there is no middle name option.",
