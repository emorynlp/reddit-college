(Basically asking for a raise?)", "text": "I've been out of school for awhile, and now that I'm a couple weeks in, I realize the lab I was accepted into is understaffed. The PIs recognize this, and have additional funds to pay interns/more grad students (I'm helping them advertise the positions on campus), but so far we haven't found anyone. Ideally, we'll find some people soon, and we'll have a more manageable lab schedule.\n\nHowever, if this doesn't happen, I'm looking at severely longer hours at the lab than I expected. This comes with increased costs - eating out more b/c less time/energy to prep food, occasional ride service needed if I'm trying to get home at a very late hour. I didn't factor this in to my budget! I figure I'll wait it out a couple more weeks, but if we haven't found anyone by then to help, I want to ask for a raise to help with these costs.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation, and successfully got a \"raise\"/increase in their stipend. If so - any tips to go about approaching the professor?\n\nThanks!", "author": "ohdangherewego", "created": 1632360729, "retrieved": 1632844059, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "comments": {"hdyvc92": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ptko38/anyone_have_success_renegotiating_funding/hdyvc92/", "text": "I know that at least a couple of my MA cohort-mates successfully negotiated for more money.
