Plus the federal student loan forgiveness programs only apply to federal loans given through the FAFSA & your school\u2019s financial aid iirc.\n\nI filled out the normal FAFSA and took out both the subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Looking back, I should have only taken out the subsidized and cut back on expenses. But here I am.\n\nIf you can\u2019t finance it without private loans, I\u2019d suggest seeing if your program will work with you to study on/off alternating semesters so you can work enough to save up for the next semester and pay by the semester instead of using private loans.,",
