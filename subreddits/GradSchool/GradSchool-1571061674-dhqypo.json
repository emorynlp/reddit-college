So I'm happy to chat or offer advice related to those problems here/in PMs -- too many of us suffer in silence and it's super important to talk about these problems earlier rather than later.", "author": "trm90", "created": 1571061674, "retrieved": 1632953393, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 503, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"f3tsbdb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/dhqypo/last_year_after_3_years_of_my_phd_i_had_no/f3tsbdb/", "text": "You're the real MVP.

Second, you can write a book pretty quickly once you know what you want to say.
