      "text": "You'd really need to look at a school's curriculum for each program, as these fields have a huge overlap, but \\*generally\\*, I'd say that:\n\n* an MPS is best if you're working in political strategy for a campaign and/or party\n* an MPA is best if you're looking to work as a bureaucrat in the executive branch (civilian employee or political appointee)\n* an MPP is best if you're looking to work as a legislator, lobbyist, or in policy analysis for an organization.\n\nAgain, this is general--different school's curriculum may change, a school may have multiple types of curriculum under one name that you'd tailor to your preferences through electives, etc.\n\nETA-my answer is for US schools. I'm unsure how other countries may name their programs.",

      "text": "If there\u2019s a specific area of policy analysis you are interested in, it might also be worth looking into degrees for those fields specifically (e.g. health policy). But if your goal is to run for office that might not be the most helpful\n\nBut I agree that looking into the specific curriculum and career outcomes for each school\u2019s program  is the best move.",

      "text": "Public Administration with as much math related elective as possible. Trust me, I know people who graduated from these degrees, Bachelor's and MA. These are all equally useless but if you HAVE to choose one at least Public Ad teaches you how does the bureaucracy work.\n\nPolSci is less rigorous Economics, just take anthropology if you're into that.\n\nMA teaches you how to conduct research not good governance in general. You can't learn public ad anywhere else. You can learn how to consume political science research by learning economics/social science in general.",
