      "text": "You'd really need to look at a school's curriculum for each program, as these fields have a huge overlap, but \\*generally\\*, I'd say that:\n\n* an MPS is best if you're working in political strategy for a campaign and/or party\n* an MPA is best if you're looking to work as a bureaucrat in the executive branch (civilian employee or political appointee)\n* an MPP is best if you're looking to work as a legislator, lobbyist, or in policy analysis for an organization.\n\nAgain, this is general--different school's curriculum may change, a school may have multiple types of curriculum under one name that you'd tailor to your preferences through electives, etc.\n\nETA-my answer is for US schools. I'm unsure how other countries may name their programs.",
