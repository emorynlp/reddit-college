  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI started graduate school about a month ago and I'm finding that I'm really not enjoying my program and that I would like to apply to something else for fall 2022 instead. Do any of you have any advice as to how I can go about explaining this change in my application to the new school? I'm worried that they'll reject me if I seem indecisive.\n\nI'm currently studying a master's of public health but I think I'd like to apply to journalism instead, if that's any help!\n\nMany thanks!",
