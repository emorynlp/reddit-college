  "title:": "Does the number of transcripts I have matter?",
  "text": "I graduated with dual degrees in Economics and a business field. I would like to go to grad school for econ and am aware that the subject is very mathematically intensive at this higher level. I would like to boost my mathematical background by taking Calculus I-III and linear algebra for credit.\n\nSince I work full-time, it is hard to find courses that fit with my schedule. Would grad schools care if I were to take these courses at different institutions, depending on what works best for my schedule? I would probably end up with 3-5 transcripts total, depending on how lucky I get during registration. Thanks for your help.",
