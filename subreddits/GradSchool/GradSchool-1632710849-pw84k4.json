Would I be misrepresenting my program by calling it Food Microbiology on a resume?", "text": "I am currently an undegrad studying Microbiology and Food Science. When people hear I am a Food Science major, they think I am inventing all of these new and trendy foods in a kitchen all the time. While I respect the people in Food Science who do this, that is not at all where my skillsets or primary interests are. The lab I am set to work in focuses entirely on food safety microbiology and my prospective project will focus on desiccation tolerance in Salmonella and E.coli and designing mutants with desiccation tolerance genes knocked out. My coursework is set to focus on microbiology/genomics, chemical contaminants,  pathogenesis, foodborne disease, food law, plant physiology, processing, and statistics. I get rather annoyed when people try to paint me as a chef in the making, if that was what Food Science was all about I wouldn't be doing it. We are not members of my school's microbiology department (My PI wants to try to join it), but when I have told people I will study Food Microbiology for my MS, they generally take a much more accurate guess as to what my daily studies are than when I say Food Science. So I wanted to know if tweaking my major on my future CV or in discussions would be ethically wrong.", "author": "Ashley_123018", "created": 1632710849, "retrieved": 1632952006, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"heoar3w": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw84k4/applying_to_an_ms_in_food_science_would_i_be/heoar3w/", "text": "I just started my MS in Food Science (Enology), nice to see a fellow FS person here!", "author": "rowantreewitch", "created": 1632882094, "upvotes": 1}, "hegw5p2": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw84k4/applying_to_an_ms_in_food_science_would_i_be/hegw5p2/", "text": "Yes", "author": "Shark_Bones", "created": 1632749175, "upvotes": 1}, "hefnctk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pw84k4/applying_to_an_ms_in_food_science_would_i_be/hefnctk/", "text": "On a resume education section, you should list your degree.

You can also add your thesis project and other graduate responsibilities underneath your graduate position. I think that should help make it clearer as to what you do. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be applying to jobs (QA, micro, etc.) where people know that food science has many facets and isn\u2019t just R&D. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to refer to yourself as a food microbiologist when speaking, but I would only stick to your specified major in the exact wording your university uses when writing it formally.", "author": "2Black_Cats", "created": 1632712502, "upvotes": 5}}}
