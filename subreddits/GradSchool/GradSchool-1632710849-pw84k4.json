  "text": "I am currently an undegrad studying Microbiology and Food Science. When people hear I am a Food Science major, they think I am inventing all of these new and trendy foods in a kitchen all the time. While I respect the people in Food Science who do this, that is not at all where my skillsets or primary interests are. The lab I am set to work in focuses entirely on food safety microbiology and my prospective project will focus on desiccation tolerance in Salmonella and E.coli and designing mutants with desiccation tolerance genes knocked out. My coursework is set to focus on microbiology/genomics, chemical contaminants,  pathogenesis, foodborne disease, food law, plant physiology, processing, and statistics. I get rather annoyed when people try to paint me as a chef in the making, if that was what Food Science was all about I wouldn't be doing it. We are not members of my school's microbiology department (My PI wants to try to join it), but when I have told people I will study Food Microbiology for my MS, they generally take a much more accurate guess as to what my daily studies are than when I say Food Science. So I wanted to know if tweaking my major on my future CV or in discussions would be ethically wrong.",

          "text": "So in undergrad, we were instructed in our Food science career seminar to call our degrees by our concentrations. Ex: a student with a concentration in Food Processing/Technology is encouraged in our department to call their degree Food Processing/Technology. I was instructed to call my undergraduate Food Science degree Basic Food Science. \n\nI typically ignore this and call the degree Food Science anyway because I feel that my other major in Microbiology conveys more than Basic Food Science would. My diploma is set to say Food Science and my transcript will say concentration in Basic Science. \n\nDo you know of any reason why we were told to do this? This was why I had carried this logic for the grad program. Its a little odd to me.",

We taught our students to list their degree as \"BA in Writing with Emphasis in Creative Writing or Professional Writing.\" Depending on what their concentration was.\n\nThen you're covered. Because you are listing the degree as it's bestowed by the university, but also including the focus/concentration. \n\nSo it sounds like you have a BS in Food Science with an emphasis, and a BS in Microbiology. So you would list both on your resume.",

      "text": "Hello fellow food microbiologist! \n\nIf you get a MSc in Food Science, you should absolutely only write that on your CV/resume. You can also add your thesis project and other graduate responsibilities underneath your graduate position. I think that should help make it clearer as to what you do. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019d be applying to jobs (QA, micro, etc.) where people know that food science has many facets and isn\u2019t just R&D. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to refer to yourself as a food microbiologist when speaking, but I would only stick to your specified major in the exact wording your university uses when writing it formally.",

          "text": "That is one particular thing that annoys me about the title \"Food Science\". It is so vague that people come up with their own definitions of what it could be with most of them correlating to nutritional sciences or product development. If my school had an MS in Micro, I would be doing that first but that is something our micro department doesn't offer. I don't think I want a PhD in Food Science, when I hit that point I think I would go back to Microbiology. However, right now I am a bit unsure if I want my studies to focus more on food safety or microbial interactions with plants. I'm hoping I can figure this out more over the course of my masters.\n\nAnyway, thank you! When I speak to other students/friends/family, I will call it Food Microbiology. I will strictly say Food Science in my CV. This piece of Food Science being so product focused really annoys me in my undergrad courses.",

I think it makes us much better-rounded scientists. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend joining IAFP if you haven\u2019t already. \n\nMy MSc is in Food Science, but I\u2019m working on a PhD in Animal Science (my work is still heavily food safety/micro related). My current university didn\u2019t have a PhD in Food Science, or that\u2019s probably what I would\u2019ve done (even though I also have BScs in both Food and Animal Science). I\u2019ve taught the Food Microbiology lab for the last 2 years during my PhD. Most of my students are micro majors, and I\u2019ve realized that I had a much better practical understanding of micro than they do. Obviously I\u2019m much further in my education now, but there are interesting differences the two majors focus on, in my experience.",
