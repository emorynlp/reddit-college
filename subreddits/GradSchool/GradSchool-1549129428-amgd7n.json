      "text": "I went through a weird curve. I entered graduate school not wanting to go into academia at all; after being lightly brainwashed by my program and having my first experience teaching undergraduates, I decided that I might like to. The last few years of graduate school and a postdoc, though, reminded me that nope - I really don't.\n\nIt wasn't the corruption or injustice towards graduate students, though. It was the unrealistic work expectations, the shrinking number of positions and the fierce competition to get them, the terrible work/life balance borne by those problems, and the lack of control over where I could live if I wanted to cast the widest possible net. Oh, and the fact that the pay didn't match up with any of that.\n\nI work in industry now; I love my job; I have zero regrets.",

      "text": "I've always enjoyed teaching, writing and research so an academic career of some flavor has been attractive since I was in late undergrad.  I honestly didn't know much about the career since nobody in my family were academics.\n\nThe overwhelming support from good mentors and scientists I knew from my undergrad and post-bacc years encouraged me to earn my PhD and find an academic job.\n\nThen I found out how rare those good people actually are in academia - especially at \"prestigious\" schools.  It's an utter shit show where most of the faculty are pretenders who capitulate and overhype/whore out their work in a desperate chase for funding.  Trainees are put through a meat grinder and rarely gain an education.\n\nI want to fix it and bring a more conservative/responsible approach to mentoring and research (not in the political sense), but even after a pretty good grad career the incentives simply don't favor people who practice science in good faith or value moderate scale projects and a practical balance of academic responsibilities.  \n\nIf you aren't putting novelty and impact above reproducibility, you will have a hard time.  \n\nThe type of methodical and incremental work that unlocked our modern scientific enterprise is almost shunned in lieu of high-risk projects that take years for the field to unravel and rarely reproduce.  \n\nTenure is given to people who can't teach and who engage in blatant research misconduct.\n\nAbuse is covered up by HR. \n\nMoney is shuttled around in borderline fraudulent schemes that I can only assume would trigger audits of any company or government agency.  And we have the audacity to ask taxpayers to keep footing the bill without addressing these systematic problems.\n\nIs it all bad?  No.  There are still a dwindling number of old guard who see the problems for what they are, and some new people who are eager to effect change.  \n\nYeah I still want to do the job I've planned for and worked toward.  I see a need to do it well that isn't being met, students who are being ripped off, and questionable research flooding the literature.  But I am much more acutely aware of the scarcity of worthwhile academic jobs now (not just the scarcity of TT jobs, but positions within responsible and ethical departments).",

      "text": "I wanted to stay in academia but as I\u2019ve gotten older my priorities have shifted. I love bench work and the rigorous thinking that goes into scientific discovery. But I don\u2019t think I have the patience to be a PI, or to work for several more years at near-poverty wages despite having advanced degrees. I have a serious SO now and his employment prospects are nowhere near mine so I\u2019m going to have to be the primary breadwinner if we stay together. We both have fairly serious chronic health issues so we\u2019re going to need health insurance that doesn\u2019t suck. I\u2019d like to retire someday and another 5ish years of not saving much if anything for retirement is scary. My SO is very close to his family and they almost all live in the area where we live now, and those relationships are important to both of us, but especially him. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019d be willing to leave or spend years bouncing around between academic institutions, or have little choice about where we settle down because academic jobs are so competitive. \n\nNone of this stuff was even on my radar when I was 22 and applying to grad school a few years ago. I cannot emphasize how much things have changed (in good ways!) personally for me since I\u2019ve started my PhD. \n\nAnother big thing is that when I was younger, I used work as a way to distract myself from how unhappy I was\u2014throwing myself into schoolwork in high school to get out of my abusive home and get to a good college, and then using research as an excuse not to allow myself to fall apart completely when I got really depressed during college. There are other things in life that can give you meaning besides work, I just never realized it because it\u2019s not what was modeled for me at home. Things don\u2019t have to be 100000% serious business all the time. Fun things are important to have in life too. \n\nI don\u2019t love the idea of working for big pharma or anything but if that\u2019s what it takes, I\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s not like academic research is entirely pure and noble either. I\u2019m looking into alternative careers now and keeping my ear to the ground as well as thinking about what kind of things I actually need day to day in a job to be happy and fulfilled. \n\nAnyways I\u2019m definitely just rambling self-indulgently at this point but yeah. Had the dream of being a professor and Doing The Thing\u2122\ufe0f but now I\u2019ve got some other dreams. We\u2019ll see what happens but either way I know I\u2019ll be able to build a happy and fulfilling life for myself. Or that\u2019s what I tell myself at least. ",

Athletes don\u2019t usually do that, they let their talent and hard work speak for itself.Academics, on the other hand, do just that. \n\nThey\u2019re not just constantly talking about science to talk about science. They\u2019re doing it to look and feel like a \u201ctrue academic.\u201d Like they\u2019re just as smart as (or smarter than) everyone else in the room. One of my advisors (who I really like) admitted this to me. He said when someone asks a tough question, it isn\u2019t to trip you up. It isn\u2019t even because they\u2019re curious about the answer, they likely already know the answer. It\u2019s mostly because they want to look good in front of their colleagues. They want to look like the smart guy/woman who asks the tough questions that trip people up.\n\nIt\u2019s a big dick contest and I find it to be a real turn-off. My intellect is one aspect of who I am, and I don\u2019t feel the need to constantly prove to my peers how smart I am. It\u2019s lame. ",

In year 2 of 5 of my PhD experience, I began getting industry credentials and transitioned.  I finished my degree with a second adviser at the same university, and then used my data science / stats skills to carve out a niche.\n\nThere is a lot rotten about the hierarchy in academia and power dynamics. Yes, you get office politics anywhere, but professors aren't trained to be great managers.  They're there to be scholars that push the boundaries of their discipline.  I happened to get one of the ones that wasn't particularly good at the managing portion and the setup of academia allowed her to continually get away with it, even leading to her getting tenure despite 1-2 pubs in STEM.\n\nOn the other hand, my partner is a tenure-track professor now, too.  So I've witnessed the good and bad.  I'm hoping the battle for academia's soul starts to ease up as she climbs the ranks.  ",

Of course industry isn\u2019t perfect; people still compete to look good to their manager.  But when the focus is on delivering a quality product / project without worrying about \u201ccredit\u201d I think you get true collaboration and less fighting over who contributed the most (first author, last author, etc).\n\nI\u2019m defending in the spring and have an industry job lined up to start over the summer.

              "text": "Not all work is worth publishing initially though.  There is virtue in scrutinizing and interrogating results before interpreting and submitting a polished narrative to peer review.  \n\nI might re-frame your comment as \"a race to fit data into a neat story.\"\n\nI'd argue that the vast majority of publications are premature and forced to fit tidy narratives that obscure the more informative idiosyncrasies and weird results inherent to research.   Given the cost/complexity of reproducing big studies, premature publication of a half- baked interpetation/narrative can have a massive and damaging influence on a field.  This is one reason I kind of like preprint models where data can be uploaded and discussed before gaining higher status in glamor journals.\n\nI think we need more patience and open sharing of data prior to publication.  This would be more possible if tenure and promotion were less dependent on grant success and impact factor/H-index.",
