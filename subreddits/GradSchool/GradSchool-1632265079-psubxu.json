Hate is a powerful emotion that will push you to do things you never dreamt possible. Harnessed and properly challenged, hate will sustain you and motivate you towards greatness. But take care, you may find that when you achieve your ends and reach your goals that the outcome isn't what you predicted. Unlike love, which sustains itself, hate will eventually burn itself out and may turn to ash in your mouth.\n\nThink on Ahab, the tragic Quaker. Through hate he developed a singular focus on an objective and an outcome and brought that scenario kicking and screaming into the world. But in his moment of wrathful confrontation with his hated foe, he and his crew were destroyed. The white whale, tellingly, was not.
