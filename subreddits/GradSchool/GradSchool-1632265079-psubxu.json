Now I\u2019m grinding out 6 publications in a year while doing a 180 on my research topic. Since the school isn\u2019t disciplining him at all the only thing I can do is make him regret scaring off a good grad student.\n\nEdit: what I meant is I switched due to his sexual misconduct- not because he was mean.",

      "text": "Through spite all things are possible. Hate is a powerful emotion that will push you to do things you never dreamt possible. Harnessed and properly challenged, hate will sustain you and motivate you towards greatness. But take care, you may find that when you achieve your ends and reach your goals that the outcome isn't what you predicted. Unlike love, which sustains itself, hate will eventually burn itself out and may turn to ash in your mouth.\n\nThink on Ahab, the tragic Quaker. Through hate he developed a singular focus on an objective and an outcome and brought that scenario kicking and screaming into the world. But in his moment of wrathful confrontation with his hated foe, he and his crew were destroyed. The white whale, tellingly, was not. When his hate died it was a great pyre that consumed all it touched. Learn well this lesson, and perhaps instead when your hate dies it will make [something new and beautiful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrUEjpHbUMM)",
