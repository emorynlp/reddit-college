  "text": "So I'm coming to the end of my PhD in the UK. I'm (hopefully) giving myself January - March 2022 to write up. I am considering renting an AirBnB for the month of February somewhere with either some winter sun and/or beautiful views. Try and make the writing experience a little easier. Has anyone done this and could share their experiences? Anyone have strong feelings about this? Thanks!",

      "text": "Yessssssss, this sounds like exactly what I want to do, however how are you with distractions? The new sceneries could be very distracting plus a reminder that writing sucks and you want to be free which might put you in depression. If you can schedule a writing meeting with someone else to keep you in track then it might work regardless.",

      "text": "A postdoc in my lab did just this for his PhD. He went to Brazil. He fell in love, and his lover got pregnant, and he came back to the US to defend with a baby in tow.\n\nI think it can be a wonderful way to get you through the slog of writing. You can set up increments of working and relaxing/soaking up a new environment that would be more productive than staying in your room.\n\nOn my end, I accidentally ended up in two AirBnBs while my apartment was getting fixed for water damage. Two new environments, and I gotta say...I did write the most in both cases and finished my thesis in the second one. Of course, I was in the same city, but a completely different neighborhood and vibe.",
