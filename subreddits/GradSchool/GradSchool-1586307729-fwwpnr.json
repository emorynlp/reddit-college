I have some amazing news: today I was awarded $24,000 in scholarships to attend my dream institution. If I can get the graduate assistantship I applied for, then I can go for free!!!!\n\nGetting partial funding may not be that big of a deal, but I am literally stoked. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to attend this institution because I\u2019m out of state and the tuition is extremely high, but these scholarships make it affordable. I enrolled in my courses today and I couldn\u2019t be any prouder, especially as a first generation college student!\n\nWhat are some of y\u2019alls accomplishments during COVID-19? I\u2019d love to hear some more great news to brighten my day during these crazy times!", "author": "aufwiederbean", "created": 1586307729, "retrieved": 1632845369, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 510, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "comments": {"fn0u6hb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/fwwpnr/got_a_huge_scholarship_to_my_dream_school/fn0u6hb/", "text": "That is amazing!
