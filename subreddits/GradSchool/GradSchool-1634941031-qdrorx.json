  "text": "I am looking for one more program to apply to! BUT no gre required, I\u2019m interested in cog psy and/or human factors. My primary interests are in utilization of games as complex cognitive tasks to inform on cognitive functions. I\u2019m really interested in how people play games! So far, I\u2019ve met with faculty from UCI\u2019s cog sci program and G Tech\u2019s engineering psych program, but I\u2019d like to have one more program and I\u2019m struggling to find it! I\u2019m also applying for masters programs but the deadlines are till February/March giving me time to study for GREs. I just didn\u2019t take the gre due to some medical stuff after getting my BA. Anyways, if you guys have any programs in mind, or advice, or wanna yell at me for not taking the gre, that\u2019d be awesome! \n\nPlease don\u2019t yell at me though. Thanks!",
