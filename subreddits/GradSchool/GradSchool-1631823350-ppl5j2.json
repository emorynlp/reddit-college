I\u2019ve recently been experiencing really bad anxiety due to family issues that have affected my work. These issues have overtaken my life over the last few weeks and I\u2019ve basically fallen badly behind in my research. I have just reached out to my chair because I have barely started the work that I am supposed to submit to them, and they've actually been fantastically supportive.\n\nMy question is, should I also reach out and explain my situation to the instructors in the class I do not currently struggle with? It is a small taught class, which focusses a lot on leadership and mental health, and I\u2019m doing well in it so far because there is not yet a lot of work to do. Would explaining my situation be too much information/ information they do not need, since I am not asking for an extension or accommodation? I feel like sharing this information because I\u2019m really struggling mentally but at the same time it\u2019s not obviously affecting my work in this particular class and I am worried about oversharing. \n\nFinally, this class is class is taught by two professors, one teaching the course and the other so far supporting (technical and admin support, but so far no teaching), if I do decide to write, should I address the email to the main professor or both of them? \n\nI'd love everyone's thoughts on this!", "author": "smallgreenfrog", "created": 1631823350, "retrieved": 1632844187, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "comments": {"hd4ndb8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ppl5j2/sharing_mental_health_struggles_with_instructor/hd4ndb8/", "text": ">Would explaining my situation be too much ... since I am not asking for an extension or accommodation? I feel like sharing this information because I\u2019m really struggling mentally but ... I am worried about oversharing.\n\nSo it's more of an impulse to share than a request for help?\n\nFor a professor that does not already have a personal relationship with you there are very, very, *VERY* few things they can do to help. You say in your post that you don't want the help they can offer. Do not go to someone and say, \"I am struggling, but the only things you can do to help are not things I want.\" They will likely be confused as to why you are telling them.\n\nI understand the desire to be open about mental health. You can be open when it's relevant. It sounds like for this class it is not. If you can figure out some kind of help that you want then you should definitely ask for it. Otherwise, what are you hoping to get out of disclosing this?\n\nThanks for telling me though :) I feel for ya.", "author": "HerndonMath", "created": 1631826838, "upvotes": 6}}}
