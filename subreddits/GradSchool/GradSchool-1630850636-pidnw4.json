I asked to know if there are any options/universities to accept edX MicroMasters or similar to save time.

Honestly, don't even put them on your CV/letter of intent. Even an entirely online bachelor's is iffy. \n\nThe only programs I'm aware of that will let go of bachelor's requirements are MBAs. Basically, if you are already managing a business they'll def let you in. \n\nOtherwise, probably not going to happen.\n\n What field are you going into? For instance, if you have already designed a bunch of successful softwares, maybe there's a possibility of pursuing a CS Msc, but honestly I'm struggling to think of many careers where you can get successful enough at the job without a bachelor's, successful enough for a department to waive the bachelor's requirements.
