{"sid": "j9gcen", "link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/j9gcen/a_letter_to_all_of_you_from_the_dumbest_person_in/", "title:": "A letter to all of you, from the dumbest person in her program:", "text": "Dear r/gradschool :\n\nBy this point in the semester, I know you\u2019re all feeling beaten down and ready to quit, which is exactly why I feel the need to write this letter to you all. \n\nI am, truly, the \u201cdumbest\u201d person in my program. I come from the lowest ranking university, I routinely score the lowest grade in the class, and I have the lowest GPA of my classmates. This is a fact of my life; one that has taken me years to feel comfortable with. But now that I\u2019m in my 3rd year of grad school, here is what I have learned:\n\n1. \u201cDumb\u201d is relative. I\u2019m the dumbest in a room full of people trying to get a PhD, I can live with that. \n\n2. \u201cDumb\u201d does NOT mean worthless. Your worth is rooted in who you *are*, not what you accomplish. \n\n3. Being charming and pleasant goes SUCH a long way. I\u2019m an American woman in a STEM department made up of men from China. They care about intelligence, and are pretty open about not liking Americans. And even I have found a way to get by, mainly by being charming. \n\n4. Own where you rank. Dont walk around like you know all the answers, because you don\u2019t. Nobody expects you to, that\u2019s why you\u2019re in school. \n\n5. Some professors will wish you were smarter. That\u2019s their problem, not yours. If they are unhappy with how much you know, it is literally their job as a professor to help you. \n\n6. Somebody has to be the lowest rank in your program. That\u2019s just a fact of life.\n\n7. \u201cThis person knows more than me\u201d is NOT the same as \u201cI should know more things than I currently do.\u201d Somebody being smarter than you doesn\u2019t take away from the stuff that you *do* know and *are* good at. \n\n8. You deserve a life outside of school. You\u2019re in grad school. It\u2019s ridiculous to punish yourself by never giving yourself a break because of how \u201cdumb\u201d you think you are. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO A FULL NIGHT OF SLEEP. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for the things you think you lack. \n\n9. You don\u2019t owe your professors anything except what you\u2019re capable of. Your department saw your transcript. They knew who they were getting when they admitted you. You cannot be anything other than yourself, and if they don\u2019t like you, that\u2019s on *them* for choosing you.\n\n10. You know what they call the dumbest person to graduate with a phd? Doctor. \n\nAnyway, it really is going to be okay. And to my fellow dummies out there, stay strong!

Understanding and accepting that earlier in your career means you can be honest about your weaknesses AND your strengths. I now build highly functional and productive teams of scientists, which necessarily requires understanding strengths and weaknesses and creating balances. When people are honest about themselves, this is much easier. Remember: Individuals don\u2019t move products to market, teams do.\n\n2. Emotional intelligence, being able to read the room and get people to like you, is so much more important than being the best at something scientific. There will always be someone that knows more than you. HIRE THEM. You rise in industry with the EQ, you are \u201cstuck\u201d in the lab when you cling too much to your scientific expertise. Learn how to socialize. Learn how to be \u201cinfluential\u201d (which really just means when people like you, they listen to your opinions).\n\nI have so much more I could say on this topic.
