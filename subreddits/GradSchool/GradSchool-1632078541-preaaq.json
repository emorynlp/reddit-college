Unfortunately I have been on it twice- once in my first semester of community college (I was 18, fresh out of high school and I didn't know what I wanted to do nor did I feel I was mature enough for college). I also was on academic probation my first semester of undergrad after I transferred from community college b/c my mom got sick with cancer and my parents were going through a divorce all at the same time. I managed to clean up my act both times and my grades have proved it. \n\nWhat do I say? Is this going to damage my chances of getting into grad school?", "author": "alelis1130", "created": 1632078541, "retrieved": 1632952193, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "comments": {"hdj61vj": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/preaaq/grad_school_applications_asking_if_i_was_ever_on/hdj61vj/", "text": "That makes me sad. I was asked to withdraw for a year during my bachelors because I had a really terrible term in 2nd year (mental health struggles), but pulled my grades back up, went on to do very well in a master's program, and then won a full-ride scholarship for my PhD in a department that is top ten globally in my field. Bumps in the road have nothing to do with long-term success.
