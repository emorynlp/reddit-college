  "text": "Hi all,\n\nProspective PhD student here. I was wondering if it is appropriate for me to talk about being a partial caregiver for my elderly grandparents as a challenge/diversity in my life. I'm not \"disadvantaged\", first-gen student, or a POC. I'm a white woman, first gen american, upper/middle? class, from suburban hell, with one educated parent (bachelors). \n\nI wanted to write this because I thought it is uncommon being 20 years old and having to partake in asset management and end of life planning for elderly people, but I don't want to make it seem like I'm making a stretch just to sound \"diverse\", since diversity isn't really thought about in that way. \n\nThanks!",

It can't hurt to bring up the dynamics of caregiving, which is a huge one that affects a lot of people.\n\nUniversities aren't terribly progressive institutions nor are they terribly amazing at this thing to begin with, so I seriously doubt you're going to be seen as stretching it. I've worked a number of university positions focusing in this exact field and you don't necessarily need a tragic or overwhelmingly challenging situation.\n\nIn your case, it can go a long way to use this to demonstrate how maybe your time caregiving helped you re-evaluate some preconceived assumption you had before. Obviously I don't know the exact phrasing of whatever prompt you have, but look at it as \"what insight did I take from this experience I had and how is that relevant or interesting to the reader as to what it says about me as a candidate?\"",
