The postdoc I was a research assistant for wanted me to write down my hours, but only because he had no idea what was doable. So for that job I needed to be \"on point\".  \nThe other people I worked with were all super relaxed and generally were/are more interested in how much I get done, not whether or not I work a certain number of hours.  \nIf I leave my current lab at, say, 3p.m. noone bats an eye. I usually don't work on weekends, if I have to, it's just the bare minimum (so one day, max 3 hours).  \nI might work between Christmas and New Years Eve, to keep my experiments running, but again, I'll just do the bare minimum, not working a full day. If I would take vacation, noone would say anything (but then my experiments would pause). In fact, most people will be on vacation themselves.",

If some people develop depression that makes them less productive, this harms their output. If some people even completely burn out, this harms their output. If people need too drop out, this harms science. The resources for the dropout might have been used for someone who stays in science. So even without individual assumptions of 'Oh just imagine what all those people might have been able to achieve' there were time and resources invested in someone who produces nothing. \n\nSo nice try, but I am not the one who misses the point of his thread. \\^w^",

Do not place your self-worth into how your research is going and don't allow your PI to convince you that this is the case. You are a graduate student doing research, you're human and have so much more to your identity than simply the number of hours you put in.\n\n2. Keep a work-life balance by setting boundaries. Happy grad students are productive grad students, and separating work from the rest of my life really helped with that. While I still might think about a research problem at home, I've made it a point not to go into lab on the weekends.\n\n3. Recognize that this is YOUR grad school experience. Not your PI's, not your cohort's, yours. You may share this experience with all of them, but you ultimately have a great deal of control in how this will end up.\n\n4. Document everything. Your PI sounds quite abusive, and I would definitely make sure I had everything filed. It helped me when I moved forward with a complaint later on.\n\n5. Recognize the problem is with your PI, not with you. If your PI is unable to deliver concrete examples of how you're failing, then you probably aren't. \n\nHow early on in your grad school career are you? If you are early on and feel like you want to quit, I would switch labs ASAP. \n\nI wish you the best of luck.\n",

It will only get harder for you to switch again if you switch to a lab and find it just as bad. Find out how hands on or hands off the professor is, how helpful the staff are, what sort of hours are expected of you if any, how often the students interact with the professor, how the professor usually acts if results are no as expected, whether or not the professor sends students to conferences, and how long students usually take to graduate. Once you find a good lab which is doing research you are interested in, email the professor. Express you are interested in switching labs and you would like to join theirs. If you can pitch an idea to them which they would like, perhaps utilizing your experiences and expertise on a topic the prof is interested in, then you will have the most chance of success. Don't be discouraged if they don't have space, most labs operate near capacity. Talk to as many profs as you can. When you do speak to the professors try not to come off as desperate or bitter, most profs aren't interested in taking on reclamation projects. Instead try to come off as an enthusiastic student who the prof would love to poach from the other lab and would fit in well. \n\n\nResearch can be fulfilling and at the same time you can have a normal life.

                  "text": "Great question; \n\nSome things I recommended to others are:\n\n1. Are you placed in your rotations or do you have a choice? If you have a choice, sit down with the PI and have a meeting about expectations.  What they expect of you, what you expect of them. This starts off in the most transparent method as possible.  Now, you probably shouldn't just go in and say \"I don't want to work weekends or past 5\", but you should have an honest conversation about expectations from both angles.  Talk to other grad students in your rotations and ask them how their experiences have been.  Watch the subtleties in the lab during the rotations. Are interactions positive? Does the PI generally have a good rapport with the students? They can bring in a whole lot of money, but be awful bosses!\n\n2. Be proactive about your mental health. Towards the beginning, you will think you have it all under control; hey, I passed the quals, no problem! Why did people think this was so hard? But it is the creeping, minor things that pop up later.  You stay a little late because you really want that piece of data, you work until 2 because you want to perfect that abstract. These things come at a cost over time! It is okay to do this every now and again, but lots of students (me included) seem to want to be in the lab 24 / 7 to hit the ground running and start generating that data for an awesome publication. It is an exciting time to start your research, but in that fervor it is easy to forget to take care of yourself.\nGoing along with this, and it may go against what some say, but don't be afraid to say NO. As time goes on, people will want you to help them, \"just with a small thing\". You'll think, \"of course! another co-authorship!\" But five people asking for those small things can eat up a lot of your time. \n\n3. Have regular meetings with your PI, keep them updated on what's going well, what isn't and maintain a documented set of things you do throughout the week. If you feel like you are being overworked, you need to have some sort of evidence to suggest that.  Give them the schedule you follow, but rather than ask them to fix it, provide a solution that you would be amenable to. \"I've been swamped with this analysis of X and just can't seem to find the time to do Y. Given that I do Z 3 days a week and Y isn't an immediate concern, maybe that experiment could be held off until X or Z are finished, then have it take priority.\"\n4. While it sounds like I'm repeating myself, pay attention to the warning signs. Things don't seem to bad at the start; you'll get deep into the program and think you got this. One day will be bad; you'll brush it off... then maybe another, then another, then a failed experiment... before you know it, months have gone by where you have not felt good. I made this mistake and brushed it off for the longest time, way longer than I should have. If you feel like you are losing a grip, talk to people. Find students you can confide in and be open to, talk to your PI if you think your relationship is good enough with them, and don't be too hesitant to seek grad counseling if you feel like things are bad.\n\nI've been very fortunate to get into the lab I am in.  I feel that my PI could not be a better fit, and though there were some instances of rockiness at the start, we have become excellent friends. We tend to think a lot alike, he knows I can get incredibly busy, but that I can also deliver value.  To that end, when he sees that I take a day for myself, he understands! And that reminds me...\n\n5. be open about your goals with them. Maybe others will tell you otherwise, but hiding that you don't want to be in academia only causes problems. They can't help you along your journey if you don't tell them the path you are on.  And if they get mad about that, you have to consider whether they are a good fit.  A great PI will want to help you succeed, no matter what your dream is.\n\nIf you ever need to talk, you are always welcome to send a PM!",

Strict rules about how I approach work, weekend work is only on something I absolutely need to do, or if I just feel like doing (interesting stuff that you just can't wait to test). If my boss complains about this, I cut them off as it is none of their business what I do out of designated working hours. Lo and behold, already have several publications and a couple more to come before I finish early next year. ",

My supervisor wasn't fond of this and told me that \"the org chem students were putting in many more hours\" than I was. I answered \"good for them\" and didn't  change anything and the subject was never brought out again. If you can do your job in 10 hours, there's no reason to stay for 12. You only have to be sure to bed focused and productive while in the lab. Some people do a lot of hours but take four long coffee breaks everyday, in the end they're not doing more work. There are other ways to show dedication than putting in hours just for the sake of it. ",

I declined so many invites that eventually, some friends stopped inviting me and basically wrote me off. I used to mark undergrad students' homework until 1 am on campus while being sometimes ignored sometimes scolded by my PI. One time, I got to the lab on a Friday morning and didn't leave campus until Sunday afternoon.",
