While I still might think about a research problem at home, I've made it a point not to go into lab on the weekends.\n\n3. Recognize that this is YOUR grad school experience. Not your PI's, not your cohort's, yours. You may share this experience with all of them, but you ultimately have a great deal of control in how this will end up.\n\n4. Document everything. Your PI sounds quite abusive, and I would definitely make sure I had everything filed. It helped me when I moved forward with a complaint later on.\n\n5. Recognize the problem is with your PI, not with you. If your PI is unable to deliver concrete examples of how you're failing, then you probably aren't. \n\nHow early on in your grad school career are you?
