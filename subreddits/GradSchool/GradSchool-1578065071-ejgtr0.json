I just finished writing my final chapter. Seven chapters. 205 pages. Two. Hundred. And. Five. F***ing. Pages.\n\nThere's still so much to do--references, another round of comments, getting it through the external, and of course defense--but this feels like such a huge weight lifted off my chest. I remember sitting down in May and writing \"CHAPTER ONE\" at the top of a blank Word document and wanting to cry because of how much space I knew I had to fill.\n\nMay my small victory and tempered joy digitally spread to you, wherever you may be.\n\nEDIT: Your support and messages are moving! Thank you all. If I can do it, so can you! \n\n-Yes, I wrote 7 chapters in eight months. However, I spent about two months before that planning out each chapter in pretty significant detail. So all the work isn't reflected in there.\n\n-Rest assured, it is backed up in three places, including the cloud and physical media! Thank you for the warnings :) \n\n-The way I got through it was by reassuring myself that I just needed to get *something* on the page. Get a draft down. It doesn't have to be groundbreaking. It doesn't even have to be good. It just needs to be *done*. Other things will come out in the wash.", "author": "purple_ombudsman", "created": 1578065071, "retrieved": 1632953735, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 470, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"fd1evqz": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ejgtr0/final_sentence_just_typed_205_pages/fd1evqz/", "text": "Woah, you write 205 pages and didn't include references, yet?", "author": "LittlePrimate", "created": 1578130598, "upvotes": 2}, "fczpqfk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/ejgtr0/final_sentence_just_typed_205_pages/fczpqfk/", "text": "Congratulations dude!
