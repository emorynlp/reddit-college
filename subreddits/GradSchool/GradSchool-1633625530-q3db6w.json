  "text": "The office is nice, if a little untidy. The other PhD students weren't very chatty and didn't seem to take well to me being there even though our desks are allocated.\n\nIT still hasn't provided my equipment so I was working with my ancient HP laptop which was less than ideal.\n\nIn all honesty, I prefer working from home despite complaining that I wanted to go on campus. It's pretty mediocre all things considered. \n\nThe only benefit was I got to see my supervisor face to face and it's so much better than MS teams...\n\nAnyone else feel this way?",

I have no problem wearing a mask, but I don't want to do it all day so I'm not going to bother schlepping all the way to campus to work with a sweaty face when I can sit in my bed and get my work done without having a sweaty face. \n\nI feel bad for some of the newer students who are missing out on that in-person interaction because I ended up meeting one of my closest friends because we shared an office but, at the same time, I don't see any sense in making myself uncomfortable for several hours just because a newer student might, potentially, want to ask me a question. Also, the department only has really old Mac Desktops which are pretty slow and I find them to be a PITA to work on.",
