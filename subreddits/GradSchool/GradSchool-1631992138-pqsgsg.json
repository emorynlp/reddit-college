While I was there for the 1st three years I lived with a relative who didn\u2019t make me pay rent. Only helped with utilities  which I was thankful for. The last 2 years I had my own apt. I had part  time jobs the enter time I was in school.  \n\nNow I have been working for the Federal Government the last almost two years. I make $50k. I have $20k saved up. However I want to go back and get a masters. \n\nI would return to the school I got my bachelors from but it\u2019s out of state. I could move back in with my relative. \n\nIs this a good idea? \n\nI know I could do an online Masters at a different school and still keep my current job. My job will reimburse me for any courses I take. But Idk. I think I\u2019m still going through \u201cpost grad depression\u201d because I\u2019d like to actually go to classes on campus. Kinda live the college lifestyle again. \n\nIf I quit my job I could either try for scholarships and pay for the masters out of pocket and loans (I\u2019ve already paid my $10k student loan in full at the beginning of this year). \n\nI\u2019d like to get a Masters in Cybersecurity. \n\nI currently live with my mom. I moved in after I graduated so I can save up to by a home. The only real bills I have are a car payment, car insurance, subscription services and cell phone. \n\nShould I quit my job to pursue a Masters and become a full time student  again or keep my job and be a part time student getting my masters?", "author": "2lit_", "created": 1631992138, "retrieved": 1632844155, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hddarfk": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pqsgsg/should_i_quit_my_job_to_go_back_to_school/hddarfk/", "text": "Well, I faced something similar. After getting my bachelor\u2019s degree I started to work for a Software company, I got a promotion during the first year, my responsibilities increased but my salary remained almost unaltered. I liked the job, but I considered to get back to school since from my point of view it was funnier than being stuck within an office. So I quit before starting the applications to grad school so as to focus on sitting the required tests, unfortunately the pandemic started and I had to undertake graduate studies online, I spend almost a year without earning money (I quit in Nov 19 and started grad school in Sep 20), considering that the classes will be in person the next term I do expect to have the whole student experience. So, my only regret is to quit before grad school started, I should have quit in Aug 20. So far I have enjoyed the experience.
