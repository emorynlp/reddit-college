I really hate competition, so I struggled a lot to find a topic that was fairly obscure and approach it from a novel theoretical angle. I finally found a configuration I was really excited about, and I've been working on that for the past couple years. Things have been going slowly because of covid-relatex anxieties and issues, but the one thing I have never had any doubts about has been my topic.\n\n... That is, until about an hour and a half ago when an acquaintance at a different university in another country sent me an emails saying \"By the way, I just found these two dissertations written last year on exactly your topic.\". As you can imagine, my heart immediately dropped. My mouth went dry, my vision blurred... Had I not been sitting down at the time, I might have genuinely fainted. I really hesitated to open those two PDFs, but I held my breath and dove right in.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad I did. Yes, those dissertations deal with much the same dataset, and yes they look at some of the same issues, but they use an approach that is considerably broader and more general, whereas mine is a very detailed focus on a specific subset of the phenomena they observed which they don't investigate in any detail. Even the parts where we genuinely look at the same stuff, we have very different theoretical frameworks, goals, and even some different conclusions. That means that I'll be able to engage their theses without worrying that I'm stepping on toes or reinventing the wheel.\n\nI struggle with a massive lack of self-confidence, so being able to realise and accept this is a big step for me, and I dare say I'm even a little proud of myself for not spiraling down into a pit of despair because of this. Gives me hope I may even finish!\n\nTL;DR - Thought not one but *two* people had already written my dissertation, but it turns out there's less overlap than I thought.", "author": "nijat_arslanov", "created": 1619307468, "retrieved": 1632845385, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 500, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "comments": {"gvuor3a": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/mxvwko/brief_someone_already_wrote_a_dissertation_about/gvuor3a/", "text": "Massive sideeye at the acquaintance saying the work was on \"exactly your topic.\"  What a panic-inducing way to say it.
