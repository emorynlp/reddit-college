  "text": "Introvert here. I am currently in my first semester of grad school for my MPA. I seem to have a hard time speaking up in class, unless I'm called on. Basically, contributing to discussion in front of the whole class gives me anxiety. I am prepared for class and have no problem contributing in smaller groups. Not sure if anyone has tips on how to speak up, gain more confidence, etc. Slowly working on it, but sometimes I feel like I'm not getting anywhere, especially in classes where participation is a part of the grade.",

      "text": "I am painfully shy and I get anxiety/turn bright red when I even think about asking a question.\n\nThis is going to sound weird but the trick for me was to just get over myself. Nobody cares what I have to say, no one is judging me, just like I'm not judging anyone for asking a question. I care about the participation marks, and asking a dumb question still gets you the participation points. You'd also be pleasantly surprised just how many times a \"dumb\" question is taken extremely seriously by the prof or other students.\n\nIt also helped that the first conference I ever gave I was jet lagged, my comp crashed and I hadn't backed up my presentation cuz I was still working on it. I survived and it did wonders for my anxiety. Like the worst thing that could happen being alone publicly speaking for a full hour happened and the earth did not open up and swallow me whole. \n\nYou got this.",

It got easier after the first few times and I was able to engage more as I got more comfortable speaking. Still don\u2019t speak a lot but will speak up if I have a meaningful contribution.",

      "text": "The only thing I may be able to offer is trying to change your own perspective. Not too far off, but I am finishing up my MPP. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try and think of participating as seeing how much I know (especially about the subject matter in class). Like, if every time you participate, you have the right answer, you can be confident that you are learning what you need to. On the other hand, if you always seem to be wrong, then maybe you might need to read more closely, or spend more time writing a paper, or meet/talk with the professor directly. \n\nBasically, think of participating as a \"gauge.\" However, this obviously does not work too much in discussion based/more subjective matter. But, in those cases, then it might be more important that you say something rather than worry about the what to say.",

All throughout my undergrad I never contributed to the discussion and I would always beat myself up about it afterwards. Now during grad school (clinical mental health counseling) pretty much all my classes are discussion based so I\u2019ve really had to work with myself to speak up. My technique I\u2019ve been using is when I\u2019m reading class material I write down my questions or thoughts I have while reading so I already have points to add to the discussion. Also if someone says something during the discussion that instantly sparks a contributing thought in my head I immediately raise my hand so I can add to their thought. This causes me not to second guess myself and chicken out in my mind. \n\nI\u2019ve always thought people will judge me for asking a dumb question but I\u2019ve never thought that about anyone else\u2019s questions, so why would they think that about mine!",
