Long nights, no work/life balance, profs that don\u2019t care. But I couldn\u2019t have had a more different experience. \n\nMy profs go out of their way to make online learning easier, they provide such detailed feedback on all assignments, and they make themselves so readily available for questions and concerns.\n\nAlso, I just love my courses. I was worried that my program would end up not being what I expected, but this is exactly what I wanted when I signed up. Everyone in my classes genuinely cares and works really hard in group projects, much unlike undergrad. I feel like I\u2019m finally taking courses that will be applicable to real life. No required bullshit electives for the hell of it. \n\nAs far as my schedule goes, I exercise every morning before work, I work my hours, and then I study the rest of the night. All with time to cook three meals and relax in the evening. I did not expect to have a more convenient schedule than I did in undergrad. And it\u2019s nice to be making decent money for once. My school is very good at giving graduate assistantships, so I was also able to avoid debt. \n\nI\u2019m just happy with where I am and I wanted to share. And hopefully this lets other applicants know not to worry so much. As long as you do the work and take care of yourself, you\u2019ll be fine.
