On a day I had planned to get a bunch of stuff done, I was so fatigued and had what felt like a persistent headache, I ended up just bagging it and rested the whole day. If you can afford to do the same, I would really recommend it.\n\nListen to your health! Wishing you the best.",

Save energy on the things you need to do on your own. I.e. if you have a presentation or a test, put your energy towards that when you have it. If you feel it do your reading but you could always do it later. Get 8+ hours of sleep a night and take warm showers.\n\nYou're gonna do great and feel better soon, but you should shift your thinking to doing less and caring for yourself. Stress will make it harder to get over this cold.",
