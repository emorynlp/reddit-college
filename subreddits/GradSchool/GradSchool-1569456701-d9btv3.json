  "text": "I just started my PhD program a month ago and I find myself going through cycles of getting some things done, then spending days in my cubicle in the shared office space getting absolutely nothing done. I leave things for the last minute all the time. I go home early. I\u2019m halfassing basic things. I can\u2019t find it in me to care. \n\nThis is what I want to do. I\u2019ve worked so hard to get here. What is going on with me?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the really kind comments and messages. The support has been great. But I just wanted to say that I wrote this comment while in a really bad mindset and it\u2019s not representative of how I always feel or exist. This shit just gets hard and I\u2019ve worked so hard to get here that I am exhausted so it fucks with my head when my background/age/race is thrown in my face to make me feel like I\u2019m not doing enough or as much. It\u2019s horrible. \n\n\nIf I want anyone to take anything away from all of this, it\u2019s to be kind to your cohort members because this PhD shit is hard. Also make everyone feel welcome regardless of their background, because you have no idea what they\u2019re dealing with and kindness can do a lot to improve the culture of your program. \u2764\ufe0f",

When you feel like you're behind, there's often a danger of slipping into a cycle where you're thinking about work all the time and feeling guilty for taking time off. You need to avoid that and make sure you carve out time in the evenings and weekends when you don't think about work at all, e.g. by doing a hobby that occupies all your attention. I found that creating this separation meant that I was much more productive overall and in a sustainable way, because I was working much more effectively when I was at work.",

      "text": "Hey fellow human. That was absolutely me for most of my program. I made it through. \n\nOne thing that really helped me was that I started running for leisure. I'd listen to audiobooks and podcasts while I ran. It was a great way to escape from work for a bit without feeling guilty, and the exercise endorphins or whatever were enough to get what I now realize was depression to a manageable level. I saw some other comments worrying about whether depression is sinking its claws into you, and I agree. Avail yourself of your school's counseling services; they can give you strategies to help cope and if you need medicine there's no shame in that\n\nAs for the \"leaving things for last minute\", I'm still bad at that, but one thing that did help was to start using the pomodoro technique. Sometimes I'm still unproductive, but setting small tasks and getting them done during a 25 minute session helped me make small progress. \n\nOne final thing was changing my environment. If I got stuck, I'd print out some papers or take a notebook and go somewhere different - Starbucks or Chipotle or something - and treat myself while working on reading the paper or planning out my next programming task. \n\nOf those things, though, adding exercise and mental leisure time made the biggest difference. If you're not physically active right now, I *highly* recommend it (the couch to 5k program was a good way to ease into running for me, and don't be afraid to run super slow (I started out with 13-14 minute miles and I have *long* legs); the exercise is what matters, not how many times Usain Bolt would lap you if he was there). And make an appointment with your University's counseling center - it will help. \n\nGood luck. You got this <3",

There's outlines of the program, including two weeks that you can use to lead to into week one of the program if you don't feel like you can run the distances prescribed. It's possible /r/running or /r/fitness have more info on beginning physical activity smoothly. The biggest thing for me was being sure to run *slowly* - you should be able to hold a conversation while running; doing so helped me not wear myself out and/or develop shin splints.\n\nDepending on how overweight you are, just walking some distance (maybe start with a mile and build up to larger distances) might be better - walking isn't hard on your joints, and the real point is to get moving, to get exercise, and to get time to yourself; walking while listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks (or just with your own thoughts, if you can avoid stressing about work during your walks) totally counts for all of those purposes.",

I felt very inadequate and like a fraud. Until I tried the fabulous method of non-zero days I saw on Reddit. Basically, to not feel like a failure, just do one thing in your day. Doesn't need to be huge. Can be something as small as printing something or read one page. Usually, doing one thing gets you going and you end up doing a lot. But if not, at least you did one thing. Thus the non-zero days and a slightly higher self-esteem.\n\nIt worked quite well until I noticed days with fewer tasks were the \"I kept going\" kind and when my list was too long, it was one thing not work related (buy milk or clean the table). It was not efficient enough for what was needed to be done.\n\nI then tried to divide into minitasks everything and told myself: in the next hour you must have done two of those mini tasks. Just to not feel overwhelmed and be goal oriented.\n\nIt worked for a week or two.\n\n\nI then tried to create a flow of minitasks and build a schedule consisting of doing task A then B then C etc... to have a thread keeping me going. Works some days but I was kinda back on square one with an artificially bigger task list...\n\nThen I tried working at the library. To remove myself from all distraction. Worked the first day but I noticed every small noise or people moving around were distracting me. I discovered I had to have a baseline noise. Youtube was too distracting but nothing at all was even worse.\n\nSo I tried Pavlov method and started going at my favorite chocolate cafe. A few hours of work, because there is nothing else to do + I get to explore their menu. It worked. Then, I started going to other coffee shops, anti-cafe, bistro, etc to work. Seriously, life changing. It forced me to face my work and there is no other thing to do than to read or write! I could work for 4 to 6 hours straight. I was not doing this everyday because money and bad food but it changed my life.\n\nWhen I need to focus on one big task, I go out. The rest can be handled at home.",

I'm trying real hard to learn and use different coping skills to manage it (thank god my university has good mental health resources), but I'm not very good at it yet. Sometimes it all just becomes too much and I hide from it all and don't get out of bed for a week (which of course is the most counter productive thing ever...stupid brain). Luckily that hasn't happened in a while thanks to counseling and meds, but if you feel yourself getting to that point, definitely consider seeking out mental health resources around you.

              "text": "My first two years of grad school were periods of time in which I \"tested my capacity\" time and time again (e.g. was overextended beyond help).  What I've learned from others, as well as through my own experience, is what is planned on paper often seems feasible, but in reality there are any number of \"wrenches\" (e.g. detours, unexpected interruptions/distractions, etc.), that, once you're in a place in your program where you have the luxury (if not now), try to account for how a lot of tasks might actually take time-and-a-half or double the amount of time you initially thought it reasonably would.  \n\nIn other words, if you can't finish everything you've scheduled, that suggests you may need to account for more \"buffer time\" or \"wiggle room\" on tasks.  That way, at least you can finish the majority of what you have planned for the day.  If things go well and you're running ahead, then there's always plenty more you can fit in, and if you don't get to everything, then at least some of it got out of the way.\n\nDefinitely easier said than done.  But, if you aren't busy putting out fires (or are), and have long-term deadlines you're working towards, it can help to narrow your daily agenda into maybe 12 items max, broken into up to 9 smaller/medium size tasks (e.g. email so-and-so regarding x follow-up, zoom meeting w/ advisor, etc) and up to 3 tasks that require dedicated, sustained, focused windows of 90+ mins to several hours per session to make any meaningful progress (like coding, writing, grading etc).  Kind of a ramble, but I hope this sheds some insight.\n\nIt might seem counter-intuitive, at first, to scale down the volume and scope of your daily agenda, but it definitely beats the alternative of an \"air-tight\" schedule that bursts at the slightest mishap.  The idea is to distribute your progress in feasible daily chunks, so you can still have time to breathe each day as well.  Again, not always possible, but not necessarily an unattainable ideal either.  It took me three years to get to this point, and I will try to maintain this balance.  But, I'm also fully aware it will not always be possible in the future.",

I definitely would feel better if I didn\u2019t disappoint myself every day by creating infeasible to-do lists, lol.\n\n\nHonestly, I think I unintentionally put more than I can handle on my to-do list because I have a deep fear that I\u2019ll get lazy and become a failure if I don\u2019t push myself hard enough. I worry that the moment I feel good about myself, it means I\u2019m going too easy on myself. I worry that if I put 4 things on my list and finish them all before 5PM, I\u2019ll call it a day and watch Netflix until I sleep instead of working on another task. I\u2019m so burnt out from undergrad (I started grad school the same month that I finished undergrad because I am an idiot lmao) and I try to be understanding to myself but I honestly feel angry that I\u2019m not excited about grad school.

I also went straight into grad school from undergrad and was pretty burnt out already from right out the gate having finished my undergrad internship requirement the summer/same month of starting my program as well as my first RA and TA roles that fall.\n\nMy previous post is where I knew I need to get to for quite some time, but, admittedly, it took a solid couple of years of winging it with very rough planning/structure that never seemed to pan out the way intended.  Grades went okay with only a couple below A, but I never felt quite good about most things in general when it came to classes and doing research.  My teaching is one of the areas that has improved enough to my liking, however since I have yet to figure out how to balance teaching several sections with making meaningful (enough) progress on research, I opted to take an \"informal sabbatical\" (e.g. passed on teaching/tutoring opportunities) this fall in order to catch up on my thesis and other research.  \n\nThe process is not the most fun a lot of the time, but I still consider my program to be one of the best ways I could have used my time over the past few years in spite of it being somewhat of a mixed experience a lot of the time.  Anyhow, best of luck with figuring out your balance.  It comes with a lot of trial and error, so as difficult as it may be, you just have try and be flexible and roll with the punches as you trek on through.",

In my experience, I know that days where I don't simply \"don't care\" are days when I feel the worst, the most down. Also, the \"cycles\" are familiar to me as well.\n\nDon't know anything about your mental health or your situation so excuse me if I'm overreaching, but I wanted to offer a perspective that I hadn't seen mentioned yet (surprisingly, honestly). Hope your productivity rebounds if it is indeed that simple, or that you get the help you may need if it's more than that.",

If some productivity strategies and counseling don't help, see a psychiatrist about depression, anxiety, or (if this has been something you've always struggled with) ADHD. Remember that depression isn't \"being sad,\" it's a chemical imbalance in your brain that zaps your motivation and makes you feel bad. Something about grad school (ahem, overwhelming stress?) seems to induce depression in a lot of students, especially those who are more prone to it (i.e. family history).",
