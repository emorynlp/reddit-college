That was absolutely me for most of my program. I made it through. \n\nOne thing that really helped me was that I started running for leisure. I'd listen to audiobooks and podcasts while I ran. It was a great way to escape from work for a bit without feeling guilty, and the exercise endorphins or whatever were enough to get what I now realize was depression to a manageable level. I saw some other comments worrying about whether depression is sinking its claws into you, and I agree. Avail yourself of your school's counseling services; they can give you strategies to help cope and if you need medicine there's no shame in that\n\nAs for the \"leaving things for last minute\", I'm still bad at that, but one thing that did help was to start using the pomodoro technique. Sometimes I'm still unproductive, but setting small tasks and getting them done during a 25 minute session helped me make small progress. \n\nOne final thing was changing my environment. If I got stuck, I'd print out some papers or take a notebook and go somewhere different - Starbucks or Chipotle or something - and treat myself while working on reading the paper or planning out my next programming task. \n\nOf those things, though, adding exercise and mental leisure time made the biggest difference. If you're not physically active right now, I *highly* recommend it (the couch to 5k program was a good way to ease into running for me, and don't be afraid to run super slow (I started out with 13-14 minute miles and I have *long* legs); the exercise is what matters, not how many times Usain Bolt would lap you if he was there).

I felt very inadequate and like a fraud. Until I tried the fabulous method of non-zero days I saw on Reddit. Basically, to not feel like a failure, just do one thing in your day. Doesn't need to be huge. Can be something as small as printing something or read one page. Usually, doing one thing gets you going and you end up doing a lot. But if not, at least you did one thing. Thus the non-zero days and a slightly higher self-esteem.\n\nIt worked quite well until I noticed days with fewer tasks were the \"I kept going\" kind and when my list was too long, it was one thing not work related (buy milk or clean the table). It was not efficient enough for what was needed to be done.\n\nI then tried to divide into minitasks everything and told myself: in the next hour you must have done two of those mini tasks. Just to not feel overwhelmed and be goal oriented.\n\nIt worked for a week or two.\n\n\nI then tried to create a flow of minitasks and build a schedule consisting of doing task A then B then C etc... to have a thread keeping me going. Works some days but I was kinda back on square one with an artificially bigger task list...\n\nThen I tried working at the library. To remove myself from all distraction. Worked the first day but I noticed every small noise or people moving around were distracting me. I discovered I had to have a baseline noise. Youtube was too distracting but nothing at all was even worse.\n\nSo I tried Pavlov method and started going at my favorite chocolate cafe. A few hours of work, because there is nothing else to do + I get to explore their menu. It worked. Then, I started going to other coffee shops, anti-cafe, bistro, etc to work. Seriously, life changing. It forced me to face my work and there is no other thing to do than to read or write! I could work for 4 to 6 hours straight.
