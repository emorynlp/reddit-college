  "text": "I'm researching and working on assignments from 9-5 M-F but I keep hearing other new grad students saying that they work 9am-9pm on both research and classwork everyday. Am I not working or studying enough? I definitely still have to work on some things over the weekend but I've been trying to make sure I spend my evenings focusing on myself. I'm trying to treat grad school like a job where I occasionally need to work overtime, but everyone else is making me feel like I'm not working enough.",

      "text": "Having a healthy work-life balance is important and looks different for everyone. Currently, I work 9-5 M-F on research, classes, and teaching duties. After I get home, I will spend from 5-8 finishing things as needed, but I do absolutely nothing after 8. Weekends are my days to relax and keep my space livable and enjoy myself, but sometimes when my experiments really pick up, a bit of work is needed. Flexibility is key, but ALWAYS make time for yourself. Create a schedule that works for you and your advisor, and don't let anyone tell you to do it differently.",

          "text": "I've heard a lot of grad students say that it's important to make time for yourself especially for a PhD because you're in it for the long run. I just feel a lot of pressure to be doing more from my peers when I hear them say they're logging 60 hour weeks.  Do you find yourself constantly comparing yourself to your peers too?",

I have a chronic illness which keeps me from working as much as other workaholic grad students, so I've had to learn how to be okay with my output. I'm starting my 4th year and you know what? No one has come to me and told me I'm not getting enough done.",

I noticed at the beginning of my post grad that the people I thought had it all figured out were incidentally the people who ended up dropping out. Might be a coincidence but I think people talk themselves up to make themselves look and feel better (although I have to admit I\u2019m currently on Reddit when I should be working on writing up my thesis intro \ud83d\ude02)",
