  "title:": "Tips on how to deal with a professor who's difficult in a way I feel isn't constructive at all?",
  "text": "For what it's worth, I've had some TOUGH professors over the course of my education, but I've never really dealt with one like this and it's throwing me for a loop. Basically, my strictest professors usually operate from a place of very high organization and if you follow their general rules/rubrics, you're not in any real danger of not passing their class. Sometimes the sheer workload is the issue (re: sometimes I'm just too burnt out to be on top of my game), but the expectations themselves are nearly always clear enough, and I overwhelmingly do well in my classes. Not the case with this one. The workload is manageable, but the way they grade is extremely, bizarrely stringent and their feedback/expectations don't coincide with the actual grade given. For example, the professor will tell me I did/am doing well during a presentation and act positively engaged the entire time...then I'll get my presentation back with extremely minimal feedback (nothing really constructive or that I can truly use, it's incredibly vague or nonexistent), coupled with a very low grade. In contrast with previous \"strict\" professors, a bad grade was nearly always paired with *detailed* feedback on exactly how I didn't meet expectations and how exactly I could improve. I consequently never felt a sense of injustice or extreme confusion in response to receiving those low marks (unlike now), and was always able to markedly improve on follow-up assignments.\n\nI already asked this professor for help after the first time they did this (we had a conversation in office hours I thought went well) but I was thrown off to see this week's assignment got the exact same result, despite me putting more effort into this assignment and following the rubric and taking them up on some of their suggestions we discussed (the ones I could apply to this assignment). I'm now genuinely at risk of not passing this course and am incredibly frustrated at this professor and their approach. I'd appreciate any advice on how to deal with this situation. Thank you all in advance.",

      "text": "I don't know if this would be the best approach, but I would meet with them every single time and ask them to go over why they took off points for what they thought I did wrong. If it requires multiple meetings for one assignment, oh well. The opportunity cost of them having to explain everything in detail is going to be more than making everything clear from the beginning. \n\nI don't think this is so much a case of a strict professor as much as it's a very bad instructor. It takes much more time to have to explain in person or via email why you took off points than it does to 1.) have very clear assignment instructions, 2.) provide detailed feedback, and 3.) provide feedback that matches the grade. \n\nI'm also not sure how much your department pays attention to evaluations, but mine does so I'd keep track of everything and provide a measured and fair, but honest, account of this in the course evaluation. Even better if other students in your class do the same. In the meantime, maybe ask a bunch of questions before the assignment is due (via email) trying to get the best sense of what their expectations are in advance. You could also consider asking some classmates who got better grades if they'd be willing to show you their assignments so you can compare. If there's no substantial difference between a good grade and a bad one, that's a problem.",

      "text": "I'm not sure what makes them do that. I have had the same experience with my teachers and professors. I often wondered why I liked strict teachers more than those that looked very nice and friendly and reading your post made me realize - this is why. I think it could be because they are not very serious about their job and grading is based on their opinions about the students rather than the actual work. I don't really know how to handle such situation. I personally stay away from teachers who seem really nice because it is very difficult for me to understand their expectations. Like you said, it's very easy to follow and keep up to the expectations of a strict teacher because they are straightforward about it. For your particular situation, I would say try not to take it personally and see if your classmates are also graded in this way or talk to senior students who had taken this professor's courses and try figuring out the rubric. It is also possible that such teachers may have hard time to communicate their expectations or rubric because of their personality traits but I'm not really sure of the why. I am in a similar boat as you and I will be following this post to see what others have to say.\nEdit: grammar and missed words",
