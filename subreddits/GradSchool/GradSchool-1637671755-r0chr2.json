  "title:": "Which MS in Software Engineering program is best?",
  "text": "I just got accepted into ECU, Penn State, and Kennesaw State for their Masters in Software Engineering programs starting in spring 2022. I did a simple google search to figure out they're all good schools before applying, but I'm a little lost at which one to choose since I just have about a week or so to decide.\n\nMy current employer is paying for tuition, and I'm doing it fully online, so money/location is not a factor in my decision. All will be completed part-time in 2 years and seem to have very similar curriculums, minus Penn State not doing electives.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has any experience at any of these places or knows anything particular about their reputation. I've heard nobody really cares where you get a masters degree as long as it's a masters degree, but I'd hate to blindly choose a place and later on figure out one of the other programs was supposedly way better.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit to add: I didn't specify that my title is already software engineer at my current job, and I plan to remain an employee here for the foreseeable future. I'm just taking this opportunity since they're funding it and it'll help me brush up on some skills and eventually let me get promoted to levels I'm unable to without an MS.  Just mainly trying to see if one of these schools looks way better on a resume.",
