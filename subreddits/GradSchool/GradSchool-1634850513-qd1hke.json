  "text": "I'm thinking about a few options to take a gap year or two before grad school:\n\n\\- Apply for PhD program in my senior year -> take a gap doing SWE job -> grad school\n\nI'm thinking about this because I want to take a gap between academics and actually work for a bit, but do ppl going to grad school usually do that, since SWE is not really related to research?\n\n\\- Graduate -> do research for a year -> apply to grad school\n\nI'm thinking about this because that gives me more research experience before applying, although I kinda want to get done with the application process sooner during undergrad lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny other options for a gap year before grad school?",

      "text": "I went straight from undergraduate to graduate school, and one thing I noticed among my peers was that those who took gap years were better equipped to cope with the stressors and rigor of grad school. I didn't have much time to consolidate all that I had learned in college, and also lacked experience with the professional environment that graduate school entails. Furthermore, I felt the lack of a break from the hardcore academic mindset made me more prone to burnout - I often feel like I've been going for a decade straight with few breaks.\n\nThat break also provides perspective - you can take your head out of the racetrack and take time to examine what it is you want, from a degree and for your life. The luxury of time to reflect on these things goes a long way in grad school, where you often have to advocate for your own needs and professional development. I found it very difficult to let go of the perspective of \"I'm a student\", which made me more vulnerable to power dynamics and less likely to establish firm boundaries around my time and energy.",

It can help solidify what you want out of school and it gave me more confidence in my own intelligence. I don\u2019t struggle with imposter syndrome nearly as much as in my undergrad. It also taught me a lot of interpersonal work skills and people management that helped after school as well, so even if you don\u2019t work in research there\u2019s still a lot you can learn. I would recommend if you\u2019re on the fence, it can also help you get a start on loans/saving up.",

Keep in mind that if you want it to be only 1 year, you\u2019ll probably be applying before you\u2019ve had much employment/research experience. And you can\u2019t assume a program will allow you to apply during senior year and defer for a year. Not all schools have funding structures that support that.",
