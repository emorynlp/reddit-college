  "title:": "Today is my last day in lab",
  "text": "After being in the lab in some capacity for a decade, through undergrad and grad school and a short postdoc, today is my last day. I start a non-academic career next week and while I am excited and glad to be getting out of the lab, it's really the end of an era. It's bittersweet, to say the least. Like anyone else, I had my extreme ups and downs in grad school, but overall I had a good experience and work in a good environment with a great PI. But alas, I will not miss being overworked and underpaid, or really any aspect of the lab, so cheers to that. \n\nHere's to the end of an era, and to new beginnings.",

Every aspect of my life has improved by taking a non-academic science position. Congrats OP - I think you're going to love what's waiting for you :)\n\nEdit: Just saw you said you're in medical writing - that's what I switched to as well! It's great so far :)",
