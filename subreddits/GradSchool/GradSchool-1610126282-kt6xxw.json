I start a non-academic career next week and while I am excited and glad to be getting out of the lab, it's really the end of an era. It's bittersweet, to say the least. Like anyone else, I had my extreme ups and downs in grad school, but overall I had a good experience and work in a good environment with a great PI. But alas, I will not miss being overworked and underpaid, or really any aspect of the lab, so cheers to that. \n\nHere's to the end of an era, and to new beginnings.", "author": "Team_Cap", "created": 1610126282, "retrieved": 1632845762, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 448, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"gintj5v": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/kt6xxw/today_is_my_last_day_in_lab/gintj5v/", "text": "I left the lab and my postdoc position in October for a non-academic science job and my life is SO much better.
