  "text": "I've finished my applications for both GTPE and PWL and I'm waiting on their responses.  From what I can tell both programs offer similar core and elective coursework.  And it looks like both programs offer career services.\n\nThe biggest difference I can see are the tuition prices.  GTPE is about $9K and PWL is about $30K.  This is a huge price difference especially since I'll be paying for it out of pocket and/or with financial aid.\n\nIs there anything that PWL offers that may justify it's higher price?\n\nEDIT: Both programs are online.",
