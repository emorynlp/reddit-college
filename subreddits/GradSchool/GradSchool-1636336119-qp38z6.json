I think you are within the bounds of appropriateness to mention to your recommenders that you are interested in a specific topic, believe it will look positive on the letter and, if they feel comfortable, could they write a sentence explicitly on it?My recommenders took that initiative themselves to adapt their letters to specifically do that so I would image yours know it would be beneficial",

He asked if I will be applying to any other interest other than probability, so that he can change the letter accordingly. I told him no and just told I will mention, in my sop, that I enjoy analysis along with probability. He\u2019s a big shot himself, so I won\u2019t mess him.",
