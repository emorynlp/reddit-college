This degree will let me get into my idea field of medical device research and particularly brain computer interface devices. However, from my understanding, there is a sort of ceiling at research team leadership positions without specific training for management. Perhaps this conception is wrong - if so, let me know!\n\n**Option:** Apply for local MBA (decent chance of acceptance), start in Fall 2022, finish Fall 2023 or Spring 2024. Some of this time will overlap with PhD research and be difficult, but what is life without challenges. All in all, this extends my time in studies (making negative money..) by a year at most but seems to greatly boost my possible starting positions and potentially remove the position/earnings ceiling entirely as it would make me eligible for general management and up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, my goals involve getting into industry research leadership in the BCI field and soon after kicking off my own startup that has been brewing for awhile. I think the MBA would provide a lot of value both in industry and learning true leadership and management for a startup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The big questions:**\n\n1. Have I evaluated the value of an MBA correctly?\n\n1a. If so, is it really worth the pretty big extra debt for the delayed career boost?\n\n1b. If not, what is the right way of looking at this opportunity?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for any help and suggestions!", "author": "FastdrawOutlaw", "created": 1632772757, "retrieved": 1632951994, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hej9kof": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pwp6d0/is_adding_an_mba_to_phd_in_biomedical_engineering/hej9kof/", "text": "Don't apply yet. There are some things about leadership and management that you can learn from a class, but ultimately it comes down to experience and developing your own leadership style. Get into the industry, kick off your startup, get some experience first. MBAs really only provide value after you have the experience.
