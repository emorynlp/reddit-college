  "text": "I know that no job is great but I sometimes I wish I choose a different career. One that had me on a strict 9-5 day or something like that. I wanna go home and be able to turn it off. I want weekends off without feeling guilty.\n\nShould clarify, I do all the typical things like stop checking emails after 5 and on weekends etc etc but when the work never seems to be done, it\u2019s hard to not feel guilty for that, esp as a social science PhD who studies things that directly effect me and the people I love. \n\nLol just let me rant yall. I\u2019ve heard it all before. Doesn\u2019t make it any easier",

      "text": "Simple my friend.\n\n1. Shut off notifications on your outlook on your phone. If something is THAT urgent it shouldn't be an email, it should be a phone call. This keeps \"URGENT\" problems from flooding you with concern, further when people talk face to face there is less of the culture of \"I forwarded x email where I explained y to you\"\n\n2. Weekends and evenings are sacred. I always ask people when it's near the end of the day, \"what time would you like to pick this up again tomorrow?\" Does two things, encourages them to plan a time to work with me tomorrow, and tells them I'm done working for the day. I don't care if people think I'm lazy, I'm efficient with the time I am working and if you can't be then sucks for you.\n\n3. Only answer emails if possible at lunch and right before going home, this allows you to sign off for the day and handle any big problems at noon.\n\n4. Make others prioritize what they are bringing to you. When it comes to your success, the ones doing the \"most\" work aren't often doing the best work. If someone wants to die on their hill of righteous indignation that they are \"so productive\" or \"so busy\" let them, it's not you setting yourself for a heart attack and divorce.\n\n5. Reserve your lunch time for lunch, don't eat at your desk, network, go on a walk, break up your day so that it doesn't break you.\n\n6. Finally, you don't have anything to prove to anyone but yourself, life is a marathon, don't try to sprint every day in an effort to beat yeaterdays personal best, be gentle with yourself when you need it and be tenacious and unyielding when available.",

What helped me feel like an actual person again was treating grad school as a full-time job.\n\nChanging email habits doesn't seem like a big thing but it was so helpful for me. Not having those reminders pop up made it easier to compartmentalize everything I was dealing with. And there's the added benefit of not having a clue if some particularly aggressive professor is sending emails at 10:30 pm or whatever, so I don't have to worry about whether they expect a quick response.\n\nAnother thing that helped a lot was just becoming more apathetic about a lot of what I'm doing. Not everything has to work out right. I'm still making progress, more on some days than others but whatever. My research is not equivalent to my value as a person.",

There's so much pressure from peers and colleagues to do otherwise, not just in the form of social pressure / scorn for failing to do so, but real, material consequences like losing out on authorships, promotions, tenure, etc. I don't think any of those things are worth making yourself miserable and I think you can be successful without destroying yourself, but it often does come with sacrificing a bit of career success. The problems of academia are super systemic, and no amount of better individual choices is going to avoid that.",

I do know a lot of people with regular \"9-5\" jobs who end up getting a lot of work sent home with them though. \n\nThe way to not feel guilty is by remembering that you are a human being. You will probably burn out and your work will eventually suffer for it. By allowing yourself to turn off work brain outside of work, you are both letting yourself maintain your mental health AND the quality of your work! Also huge problems are never solved by one person, only parts of them are. You aren't going to save the world or protect your friends and family by killing yourself working on the issues you study.",

It felt like every industry other than academia threw their hands up and said \"okay we'll wait it out,\" while the messaging from my institution was *very* clear that lockdown was a great distraction-free time to get serious work done. \n\nAnd I get the pressure. Sure you can stop checking emails after 5, and yes you can make it clear that you don't work evenings or weekends. But that doesn't mean they won't schedule your classes in the evening, or have evening seminars, or evening meetings. Conferences are almost always on weekends. \n\nYes, you can say no to some things (many things!) but you can't say no to too much or it will start to have a negative effect. So I totally get it. My partner works regular hours and it baffles him that I work during the day, and then have weekly seminars that start at 7pm, and regular departmental lectures that start at 8pm. It's tough to maintain a 9-5 when there's so many commitments outside of those hours.",
