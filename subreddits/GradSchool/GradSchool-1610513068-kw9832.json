Currently crying.", "text": "Thank you for all of your posts in this sub that helped me get through the toughest few months of my life. You all formed the community that I was missing with starting grad school in a pandemic and having to be fully virtual. It felt like an endless battle and I know many of you have been in the same boat. Reading about your accomplishments, your grievances, and your advice has helped me immensely. I just found out I got all As and I couldn't be more proud of myself. I definitely spent many sleepless nights thinking about dropping it. The stress feels worth it now. But this is my promise to treat myself better next semester and prioritize my health first. I can't believe the break is almost over, but I'm feeling motivated to tackle this next semester. Best of luck to you all!
