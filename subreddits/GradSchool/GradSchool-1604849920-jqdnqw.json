I'm overwhelmed many days right out of bed at the thought of what all needs to be done. Every time I heard someone doing well it felt like a personal attack on my capabilities, and that's when I realized I'm going at it wrong. I am here because I love the field and I enjoy my work and there is no external aspect to it. Everytime I catch myself feeling this way, I repeat to myself, \"out of love, not fear\". As cliched as it sounds, the mindset realignment really helped me.   \n\nI want you to know that there is no one else who knows what you go through everyday to be where you are so the only person you have to try to be better than is you. Portion out work into small things and allow yourself to feel good about doing those small things. Grad school is hard as heck, and you're really brave for being here. But it's also okay to be scared and tired and overwhelmed and seek help and not get things done someday. It's a marathon and every step you take counts, even the days you are resting. If you need to take a long break and reset your mind, that's okay too. There are people in the world who are glad you're here, and people who think about you and smile. And there are so many things to look forward to. Just remember that there will be a point you will look back at this time and not hurt and not feel bad. It will just be a small part of your life like the last time you felt like you made a life-size error. It just doesn't matter in the long term. You survived everything life threw at you till now, and looking back now, those things didn't destroy you no matter how much you thought they would.

This semester more so than last I\u2019ve noticed creeping pressure to be back to normal levels of productivity, but it\u2019s not like anything\u2019s changed to make that possible for most people. Because you are struggling right now does not mean that you are unfit for grad school. I\u2019ve been struggling with depression for years, and it takes tons of effort and intention to manage it in normal times and right now, I just literally cannot access any of my typical coping mechanisms and I was forced back into an unhealthy living situation because of the pandemic.  I have not found a way to manage my mental health that works right now and I\u2019m not going to be at my normal functionality until after the pandemic is over. Period. And that is what it is. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a bad grad student or unfit and it doesn\u2019t mean you are either. These are extraordinary times.

Because these are extraordinary times. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work in the future. Fortunately, I was able to get on some medication that was moderately helpful when nothing else was working for me. It\u2019s always worth a shot when nothing else seems to be helping to start getting out of a negative spiral. Remember that the pandemic IS going to end someday and when that happens you WILL feel better and you WILL be in a better position to assess your life.

I know that no one wants to hear this when they're in the thick of it, but it WILL pass. \n\nOn the logical side, I advise \"sitting\" with these feelings... what is really the problem? Do these problems have solutions? Yes. Is suicide one of them? Yeah, it always is... but it's not worth it, and there WILL be moments - whether they're a month from now or a year from now - that will make you feel ridiculous that you ever thought of it. All of these items you have mentioned can be fixed. Ask yourself what it would take to leave your living situation. Ask yourself if there's someone to help with the bullying. Each of these issues... ask yourself why, how, and when. Take it issue by issue. \n\nOn the emotional side, I advise rest. I advise doing something non-academic that is just purely YOU, even if it doesn't bring joy. For instance, I live alone as a result of my bad behavior in relationships. I feel constant guilt, and I miss my ex. So what do I do to reconnect with myself? Something that he always refused to do with me: watch a horror movie. I dance to music I love but no one else does. I pamper myself with long, yummy-ass self-care routines and make my makeup perfect (just for me!). I take time to be selfish. Be kind to yourself, and treat yourself as you would treat your best friend. TALK to yourself. If the aforementioned issues prevent you from doing anything for yourself, try to handle one before the other. \n\nFeel free to DM me or anyone else that's offered here.
