I find the insane amount of unfortunate events, expectations, and insanity somewhat humorous. I'm impressed with the minor miracles that I pull off , and, well that I haven't died from exhaustion yet. There's pockets of beauty in some of the students I get to teach-- try to find such social networks that ignite that spark again.\n\nWe are primates, already terrible creatures, can't be trusted, and everyone does the primate \"take it on the other guy -thing\".\n\nAcademia is not a bulwark of mental health to start, add a pandemic, and a bunch of faculty that lack leadership faculties (there are good among them, but a lot of piss-poor ones), TAing suicidal students (one at my school did as much a few days ago), and you're average grad student is in no man's land. My family sucks (hence academic heaven full of hopes and dreams) so I'm with you on this. Some simply won't understand the isolation and negative effects of this.\n\nIn short, we're caught in the barbed wire, trying to enjoy the small moments of seeing a mate run past here and there. I'm on the wire too, this was me a month or so ago. I'm so tired of even explaining it to folks who have eyes and ears but see and hear not. I'm also over the suffering. Here are some ways of attempting a way out. At the very minimum, this is quality material!\n\nDM if you need OP.

      "text": "Hey, I'm at grad school and feel the imposter syndrome constantly. I'm overwhelmed many days right out of bed at the thought of what all needs to be done. Every time I heard someone doing well it felt like a personal attack on my capabilities, and that's when I realized I'm going at it wrong. I am here because I love the field and I enjoy my work and there is no external aspect to it. Everytime I catch myself feeling this way, I repeat to myself, \"out of love, not fear\". As cliched as it sounds, the mindset realignment really helped me.   \n\nI want you to know that there is no one else who knows what you go through everyday to be where you are so the only person you have to try to be better than is you. Portion out work into small things and allow yourself to feel good about doing those small things. Grad school is hard as heck, and you're really brave for being here. But it's also okay to be scared and tired and overwhelmed and seek help and not get things done someday. It's a marathon and every step you take counts, even the days you are resting. If you need to take a long break and reset your mind, that's okay too. There are people in the world who are glad you're here, and people who think about you and smile. And there are so many things to look forward to. Just remember that there will be a point you will look back at this time and not hurt and not feel bad. It will just be a small part of your life like the last time you felt like you made a life-size error. It just doesn't matter in the long term. You survived everything life threw at you till now, and looking back now, those things didn't destroy you no matter how much you thought they would. This is one of those.       \n\nHang in there, and if you need to talk, there are many of us willing to listen, including me.",

This semester more so than last I\u2019ve noticed creeping pressure to be back to normal levels of productivity, but it\u2019s not like anything\u2019s changed to make that possible for most people. Because you are struggling right now does not mean that you are unfit for grad school. I\u2019ve been struggling with depression for years, and it takes tons of effort and intention to manage it in normal times and right now, I just literally cannot access any of my typical coping mechanisms and I was forced back into an unhealthy living situation because of the pandemic.  I have not found a way to manage my mental health that works right now and I\u2019m not going to be at my normal functionality until after the pandemic is over. Period. And that is what it is. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a bad grad student or unfit and it doesn\u2019t mean you are either. These are extraordinary times. Therapy hasn\u2019t helped me at all right now either because I\u2019m still in the middle of dealing with traumatic things and I cannot significantly make changes to improve my circumstances right now. Because these are extraordinary times. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t work in the future. Fortunately, I was able to get on some medication that was moderately helpful when nothing else was working for me. It\u2019s always worth a shot when nothing else seems to be helping to start getting out of a negative spiral. Remember that the pandemic IS going to end someday and when that happens you WILL feel better and you WILL be in a better position to assess your life. Don\u2019t try to figure out if you\u2019re fit or capable enough for the career you want until AFTER these extraordinary times end because this is NOT reflective of normal life.",

I know that no one wants to hear this when they're in the thick of it, but it WILL pass. \n\nOn the logical side, I advise \"sitting\" with these feelings... what is really the problem? Do these problems have solutions? Yes. Is suicide one of them? Yeah, it always is... but it's not worth it, and there WILL be moments - whether they're a month from now or a year from now - that will make you feel ridiculous that you ever thought of it. All of these items you have mentioned can be fixed. Ask yourself what it would take to leave your living situation. Ask yourself if there's someone to help with the bullying. Each of these issues... ask yourself why, how, and when. Take it issue by issue. \n\nOn the emotional side, I advise rest. I advise doing something non-academic that is just purely YOU, even if it doesn't bring joy. For instance, I live alone as a result of my bad behavior in relationships. I feel constant guilt, and I miss my ex. So what do I do to reconnect with myself? Something that he always refused to do with me: watch a horror movie. I dance to music I love but no one else does. I pamper myself with long, yummy-ass self-care routines and make my makeup perfect (just for me!). I take time to be selfish. Be kind to yourself, and treat yourself as you would treat your best friend. TALK to yourself. If the aforementioned issues prevent you from doing anything for yourself, try to handle one before the other. \n\nFeel free to DM me or anyone else that's offered here.

I think my point was saying that it\u2019s okay to know that you do have an out if you feel that you need one. I think other people in the thread have also suggested taking a break from grad school as well, which I think would be better if it\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know OP\u2019s situation but I think when you get to a point where you\u2019re having suicidal thoughts it\u2019s important to remember that your life is way more important than grad school.",

So don't use the pandemic as an excuse but rather a reality. Do your best, sometimes life just doesn't work out how one thinks it should. Give it your all though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure how many biologists are here but I think of it simply as, \n\nwild things go about their ways, not complaining.

Perhaps because I wasn't willing to accept an option.  But when I hit my breaking point (I had told my advisers I just didn't think I could prepare a proper literature review for group meeting the next week. And then shortly after they asked me to take some time off), I buckled down in 6 weeks to write an MS thesis and left. I am 100% way better off having left my program. I enjoy my job, co-workers, bosses, etc. \n\nLeaving may not be the best option for everybody, but when it gets to the point OP is at and they're already getting professional help, it is an option to consider. Or at least bring it up with their professionals.\n\nWhen OP says \"therapy isn't helping,\" that can be a sign that they really do need a change in environment.",

According to the Dunning-Kruger effect, this would actually put you in line with many world-class experts, who are often less confident about their total knowledge of the field than beginners might be.  Those who are not nearly so trained may feel nothing but confidence-- or might even bullshit they know more than they do.\n\nHowever, people who are versed enough to understand the sheer depth of their discipline will eclipse the efforts they'll be able to achieve in their lifetime... those are the actual experts.  They recognize any contribution they'll have isn't going to be knowing or learning everything.  They'll just be a piece of the puzzle.\n\nSo.  If you have imposter syndrome, anxious over the fact you don't know, you're in good company among very smart people.  The key is to recognize that this is a sign of talent and self-awareness... and then compartmentalize that feeling as 'just the cost of doing business, moving humanity's collective knowledge forward.'",
