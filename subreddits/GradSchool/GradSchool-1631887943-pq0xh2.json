I've had jobs in biochemistry, microbiology, and analytical chemistry. Now I'm in a phd program for computational genetics. To jump fields, you just have to do a little research on what skills the new field values, as well as key terms they like to use. From there you can highlight your relevant experiences in their preferred terms.   \n\n\nFor example, I was initially disregarded as an analytical chemist due to my biochemist background until I realized I could be vague about my label and just talk about my skills directly. I just said I had \"experiences in chemistry\" and then talked about  all the chromatography work/mass spec work that I did. This helped me escape whatever assumptions the employers thought of biochemists. To switch to Microbiology I didn't talk about my job title at all, I just talked about my cell culture work I'd done. To switch to computational genetics, I took a coding class, wrote a few scripts, and then just talked about how I did that.", "author": "FlopperPants", "created": 1631893960, "upvotes": 6}, "hd7wfc9": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pq0xh2/does_your_phd_research_limit_your_career_research/hd7wfc9/", "text": "Pivots are common post-PhD -- not many people find and stay in their lanes forevermore after graduation. Your main hurdle will involve convincing a postdoc PI to gamble on you being able to train up in whatever new field. One way to improve your chances there would be to emphasize carryover in skills across fields / subfields, and maybe cite a side project or two that are more directly relevant. Ideally if you could either get introduced by a mutual friend or get you foot in the door at a conference etc. you should be able to get eyes on your profile, vs. straight-up desk rejection lol.\n\nMy own jump was from paleontology / anthropology for my PhD -> biomedical informatics in a postdoc, which is probably a bigger jump than cardiology -> epidemiology or pathology or w/e.", "author": "--MCMC--", "created": 1631893316, "upvotes": 22}, "hd7vwqn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pq0xh2/does_your_phd_research_limit_your_career_research/hd7vwqn/", "text": "I think that if you have specific career research goals, you should look for ways to build skills that are relevant to that research area even if you aren\u2019t directly working on it.
