I'm not sure what your reasoning is for posting this, but I'll make a (hopefully incorrect) assumption that it's because you think there are too many of this kind of post. \n\nI participate in another subreddit that frequently sees this \"I just finished my [relevant skill] license!\" type of post. Having finished my own license years ago, I *could* get all grumpy and hostile about them.\n\nInstead, I choose to be happy that people are still choosing to enter that hobby despite its steep costs. The more of us there are, the better it gets for everyone.\n\nOnly just now beginning my PhD track, I notice a lot of the similarities between this subreddit and that one. I certainly hope the attitude here remains positive and inclusive of posts like this, rather than one that attempts to corral all the instances of success in a throwaway bin that would be your suggested megathread. \n\nJust my two cents. Keep on keepin' on, /u/ZenGuruji.",
