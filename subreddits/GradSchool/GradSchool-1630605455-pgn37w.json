I got an okay degree, but I have no extracurricular achievements whatsoever, I invested everything I had into my job which included decent international experience - problem is that I don't really get points for that. **Seeing that my chances are bad right off the bat I'd like to inquire from those who got in the past how many points they scored.**\n\nI know these most likely change over time, the target University could influence the required limit and a plethora of other factors. I'd just like a ball-park number to know if I have any chance at all or if I should re-focus. Unfortunately I can't improve my past achievements but I do want to aim high regardless and do anything I can.", "author": "GARL1CD0G", "created": 1630605455, "retrieved": 1632845143, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 1, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {}}
