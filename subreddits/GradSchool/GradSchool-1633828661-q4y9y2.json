  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am preparing to apply to a few Masters program in the next month or so and I wanted to ask if anyone found a good hybrid template to use?\n\nI don't want to submit a single page resume that I have used for internships but rather a 2 page or longer one where I can dive into details about work and also talk about my publication and research.\n\nPlease let me know your suggestions, thank you!",
