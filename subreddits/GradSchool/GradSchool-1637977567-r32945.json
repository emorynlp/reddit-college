  "text": "Hello guys, \n\nI am posting this here, because you're all experienced with the process. Kindly don't hate me for this.\n\nI will be applying in the next cycle, so I have some time to improve my profile. I need help in deciding what's best for me and what will look good in my application.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt present, I am working at an MNC doing **Data Engineering**. It involves the \"hottest\" tech in the domain. This work experience, even if it won't give me an edge, will def improve my application.\n\nBut then again, ML/AI/Data Science/Anything related to data is not my cup of tea. I initially jumped into the bandwagon due to the hype but later realized that it's not for me.\n\n**Here's my thought:** In the meanwhile, I want to gain even more **dev** experience in the **backend**, do some projects and hackathons, as that's what interests me, **grind** LeetCode and CodeForces, and if everything goes well, **switch** to a popular product-based company. I want to stay in my current company for like \\~8 months before switching. *(By the time I apply, I'll have \\~10 months exp. By the time I go, I'll have \\~1.6 yrs)*\n\nI was told that work experience doesn't matter. But the relevant exp does matter.\n\n  \nWill this be a good decision? Or should I stay here before doing MS and hope that I'll get into a good company in the US?\n\nKindly help.",
