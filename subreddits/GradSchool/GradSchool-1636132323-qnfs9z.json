  "text": "Hi all, I am a current second-year master's student who made the decision to defer my Ph.D. applications by one year. It is completely heartbreaking, and I feel like such a failure. I know it is the best decision for me, but I am wondering a) if this is common and b) how I continue to do my own research without being affiliated with an academic institution. Any help is appreciated.",
