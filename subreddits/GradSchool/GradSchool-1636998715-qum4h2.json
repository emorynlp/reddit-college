  "title:": "Asking for flexibility on job offer if Master\u2019s thesis research might get extended?",
  "text": "Hi all\n\nMy GF is currently a masters student in EE doing her research for a thesis masters and was expected to graduate in May. She has been interviewing like crazy for the last two months and is expecting an offer today for an opportunity she\u2019s expecting to accept. Throughout the interview process she has been stating that she\u2019s been expecting to graduate in May of next year and could start after that.\n\nWithin the last few days she has been gearing up to submit her timelines for thesis defending and proposals and such and her professor told her to ask for flexibility with the job start date because he feels that the timeline is a bit tight; basically he\u2019s being very noncommittal about her graduating in May and is saying that there is a chance she would have to continue doing research through next summer to finish, and that\u2019s \u201cthe nature of the work\u201d.\n\nShe\u2019s pretty anxious that now she has to go back to this job offer and say \u201chey I know I said May this entire time but it could actually be September provided blah blah blah\u201d and she\u2019s worried they will take find her wishy/washy or otherwise have a reason to rescind the job offer.\n\nI think she\u2019d be fine to ask about flexibility, I think that most companies know that a student doing their thesis masters have to defend and such and anything can happen, but I haven\u2019t been able to find much info anywhere on any experience with a situation like this.\n\nShould she accept the job offer and only ask them about change of estimated start date once she firmly knows it would or wouldn\u2019t be May? Should she ask about it before signing the offer? She said there\u2019s the chance that in May that she could get told that she still needs to do a few more months, so what about that point? Then she hasn\u2019t interviewed anymore and she\u2019s kind of stuck at the company\u2019s mercy.\n\nJust looking to see if anyone had any sort of experience of relevant info for something like this and what she should do.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "It is common for students to take longer writing up their thesis than they initially expect. Nobody can promise a for-sure date this far in advance, and employers are aware of that.\n\nThe worst choice is to try finishing the thesis and working at the same time. That looks attractive on the surface but usually results in months of extreme stress and frustration, and poor performance on both the thesis and the job.\n\nTo avoid appearing wishy washy, let the employer know that she will start as soon as the completed and approved thesis is submitted.",

          "text": "Yeah I kinda figured that they must have some assumption that thesis can be variable end date. I assume she\u2019ll talk to them and they\u2019d be flexible, but she\u2019s very nervous and doesn\u2019t want to have to start interviewing again. At the end of the day all she can really do is tell them if it\u2019s gonna be an issue, they\u2019d find out either way but I think they\u2019ll be flexible. She\u2019ll just have to talk to them about it. \n\nYeah I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be trying to do both in any circumstance.",
