I'm not suggesting for a moment that grad school *doesn't* have the power to make the most confident person doubt themselves at times, but the constant wailing and gnashing of teeth about waking up and going about one's day AS A GRAD STUDENT (always, always dropping that into conversation, lest you forget) was just exhausting. And because I had a family, I was treated like a circus freak, someone who could not possibly be taking this as seriously as someone who GAVE UP HER WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS, OMG. Never mind the fact that I threw my entire family into financial upheaval to pursue this dream while McKenzie gets to skate by on daddy's trust fund. But the behavior was always rewarded.
