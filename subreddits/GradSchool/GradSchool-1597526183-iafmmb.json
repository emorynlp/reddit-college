You can easily breeze through classes and focus more on research. Put the lecture video on 2x the speed and replay segments that you don\u2019t understand.\n\n2. You can organize your schedule in any way you want. Since classes are asynchronous for me I just do all my class work in the morning. I can get it over with immediately and concentrate on other things.\n\n3. No administrative drama or distractions. \n\n4. You can drink alcohol anytime during the day. Makes lectures/seminars much more enjoyable. \n\nI know the situation still sucks and I want more than anything for everything to go back to normal but hey it actually isn\u2019t that bad! Hopefully this helps cheer some people up", "author": "squareearthers", "created": 1597526183, "retrieved": 1632846084, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 322, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "comments": {"g1rj976": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/iafmmb/some_positives_for_online_grad_school/g1rj976/", "text": "It's a big problem with synchronous classes though.", "author": "GianChris", "created": 1597606709, "upvotes": 2}, "g1qk7gu": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/iafmmb/some_positives_for_online_grad_school/g1qk7gu/", "text": "I second the comments about commuting.
