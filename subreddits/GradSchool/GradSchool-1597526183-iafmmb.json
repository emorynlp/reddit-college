  "title:": "Some positives for online grad school",
  "text": "I know a lot of people are disappointed by the fact that they are missing out on the in person experience for grad school this year but I started my PhD last week (all my classes are online) and here are some amazing things about the online format:\n\n1. You can easily breeze through classes and focus more on research. Put the lecture video on 2x the speed and replay segments that you don\u2019t understand.\n\n2. You can organize your schedule in any way you want. Since classes are asynchronous for me I just do all my class work in the morning. I can get it over with immediately and concentrate on other things.\n\n3. No administrative drama or distractions. \n\n4. You can drink alcohol anytime during the day. Makes lectures/seminars much more enjoyable. \n\nI know the situation still sucks and I want more than anything for everything to go back to normal but hey it actually isn\u2019t that bad! Hopefully this helps cheer some people up",

I didnt drive to campus but just taking away my trudge up the hill and the drama surrounding getting dressed for a sweaty walk + looking ok to teach has totally changed my work day and my concept of getting ready. I go on more pleasant walks instead for the sake of it now, and getting ready means reading etc. rather than getting dressed.",
