I have done a sufficient amount of article reading this summer and began writing introduction and methods sections this month. \n\nThe first problem is that my supervisor is not on campus, he is in his home country because of quarantine restrictions. Therefore, I do not have an actual lab. Secondly, the meetings are so rare, if I remember correctly, I have had 3 meetings over the summer months. \n\nWe are expected to finish the thesis by the end of April 2022. Should I change my topic or am I digging a deeper hole for myself? I also don't want to get an extension for my thesis over the 2022 summer months.
