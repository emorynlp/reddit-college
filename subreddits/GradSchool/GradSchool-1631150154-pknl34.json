I am just looking for someone to give me a realistic expectation. I just submitted my application to the Global Securities Masters w/ Intelligence Certification at John Hopkins. \n\nI am an admitted attorney in the state of NY and passed the bar exam on my first attempt. However, my law school GPA equated to a B and this scares me for a school with the prestige of John Hopkins.\n\n I am a good writer. I feel like my statement of purpose, and required research paper are good. I have had them looked over by law school career development office as well. What scares me is my law school ranking printed on the transcript. I am about the top 60%. While my GPA for law school (2.9) correlates to a \"very good\" law school GPA according to my transcript, I was in a very competitive class and graduated law school at 22. I was young and my last semester did not count. Unofficially, had it did, my final law school GPA would have been a 3.1. \n\nAnyways, this is a snapshot of my resume I sent (ommitting names of schools) : \n\n   \n\n**EDUCATION**\n\nLaw School, New York May 2020, GPA: 2.9\n\nJuris Doctorate\n\n**Leadership:**  *First Place*, Dispute Resolution Society; *Member,* Securities Arbitration Clinic; *Member,* Corporate and Securities Law Society; *Member,* International Law Society\n\n**Honors:**  Internal Dispute Resolution & Arbitration Competition, *First Place* \n\n**Thesis:**  *Slaves to the Modern Gig Economy: The Rise of Non-Union Labor Organizations; Examining Their Impact on Modern Labor Laws and Recidivism Rates* \n\n**Publication:**  *Finra Comment, 2019, Investor Rights of Seniors (omitting link for identification purposes but provided one on resume )*\n\nUndergrad **,** May 2017\n\nBachelor of Science in Business Administration and Accounting, Concentration in Finance, GPA: 3.9\n\n**Honors:** \n\nSumma Cum Laude; Dean\u2019s List; Presidential Scholarship; Thomas A.

I know none of you can tell the future, but I am so scared my law school career is going to destroy my chances at this program. Am I right to think so or am I being a pessimist. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDLR: great undergrad record at a not-impressive school; mediocre law school performance at a top 35 school; What are my chances of getting into a masters program at Johns Hopkins?", "author": "heyimok2020", "created": 1631150154, "retrieved": 1632952752, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hc4wveb": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pknl34/stellar_undergrad_half_decent_law_school_gpa/hc4wveb/", "text": "Why do you want to go to more school?", "author": "jalapeno-popper72", "created": 1631154139, "upvotes": 2}}}
