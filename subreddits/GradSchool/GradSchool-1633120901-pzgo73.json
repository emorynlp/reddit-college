  "text": "I started my PhD this fall and moved cross country. I left behind a really good job in mental health to start a PhD in psych. I am struggling with a few things, namely just adjusting to working literally all of the time but never feeling caught up, living in a new city, moving from making the most money I\u2019ve ever made in my life (and money has been a historic struggle), to pulling out loans and being broke all over again. I\u2019ve just finished week 5 and I already feel depressed as fuck. FOMO is at an all time high, but not only that, I worry if this is even a financially sound choice or not (my program\u2019s GA covers my tuition and gives a small stipend, but not enough to even cover rent, so I\u2019m pulling out loans). \n\nI\u2019m already thinking of dropping out, but I don\u2019t know what I would do instead. Did anyone else feel like this? In my 30s.",

      "text": "Congrats on starting your PhD! Suffice it to say that each one of these changes is big enough to cause disruption in your life, but together, it\u2019s a huge deal. I\u2019m sure that given a few months, your situation will have settled down and you\u2019ll have found a way to cope with your new circumstances. Failing that, you\u2019ll be in a better position to make an informed decision on your future. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty much a given that you never feel caught up during a PhD. One person cannot read all published literature in a specific area, nor will every task be completed absolutely. Take the hits where you can and accept that not everything will be perfect; it doesn\u2019t make you any less of a researcher. Maybe talk with your supervisor about prioritising tasks to optimise your research. \n\nObviously I can\u2019t speak as to your financial situation; only you know how you can make this work, but again, chat with your supervisor to see if you can apply for grants/fellowships to ease the burden. Despite the prestige of the academy, graduate students and ECRs are woefully catered for in the vast majority of circumstances, so whilst it is not especially comforting, you are not alone.",

      "text": "That is a lot of change, it is natural to feel overwhelmed with all the adjustments. Try to take it a day at a time. Meet your basic needs first. Many people borrow loans to get through school, it doesn\u2019t mean you are a failure or any other negative things. There are financial subreddits like personalfinance, frugal, eatcheapsndhealthy that might be useful for you. Take a social media break, it does more harm than good. Also useful to remember that everyone shares their highlight reel of life on those sites and hides the dark moments like 3rd vacation of the year!!!-funded at 27% apr on a credit card. \nTry to form some friends in your program, you all are going through the same thing, plus maybe you can find study groups or people to explore your new city  together. Take time to explore your new city, walk the parks and trails, go to farmers markets, check out the local recommendations, make it your city. \nMake sure you are not setting yourself up for unreasonable expectations of yourself. Make a schedule for your class, research, whatever required expectations you have. Put in dedicated time for stuff like errands, exercise, homework. Prioritize required, recommended and relevant, recommended when it comes to readings. Some weeks you may not do it all. Quitting after 5 weeks seems extreme to me, try and adjust some but if you are truly hating it long term make the best decision for you.",
