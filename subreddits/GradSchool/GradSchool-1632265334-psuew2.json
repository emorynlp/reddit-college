She is energetic, explains comprehensively and I might ask her for a rec letter at the beginning of November. I know I would have only known her for 2 months but she is the only the other major specific professor I like. I have two strong letters already and this would be the final. \nShould I go through with it or ask a different professor from my other major? I know the other prof for a longer time and we have had more interaction but unrelated to the major I am applying to grad school for. \n\nI feel like I am so down thinking about this process \ud83d\ude29", "author": "cuassant", "created": 1632265334, "retrieved": 1632844085, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hdt7qjs": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/psuew2/asking_a_professor_for_lor/hdt7qjs/", "text": "I'd say wouldn't hurt.
