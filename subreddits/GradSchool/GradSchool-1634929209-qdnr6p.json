  "text": "I am at the phase of agonizing over the details of my application for my top school. I want to give my recommenders a few ideas of how to address the letters. Should they be addressed to the specific department,  \"To the University X Department Y Admissions Committe,\" and is it appropriate for them to address the department chair directly, \"Dear Dr. Smith, Department Chair of Department Y.\" \n\nOne has already been submitted with \"Dear Admissions Staff\" which I think is fine, but I think more tailored options may be better. Thank you in advance for your suggestions.",
