  "text": "\nI feel ever since covid, my productivity has decreased enormously. The good side is most of my professors and cohorts have been supportive and providing me extension. But I just can\u2019t really put myself into work somehow\u2026Previously, a deadline could make me do productive and I could just go on write maybe 10 pages a day but now I am sitting in front of my laptop struggling with just an outline and another 5 pages essay.\nIs there a way to get out of this stagnation? How to make deadline meaningful again?",

Just start drafting whatever. Don't worry about an introduction.\n\nOnce you get several pages of text, then think about writing an outline and redrafting.",

I tried to force my way through and that just made everything a lot worse.\n\nAnecdotally, I've heard giving yourself an intentional break (i.e. telling yourself for a few days \"today I am not going to work on my research\" and doing things that relax you instead) can help as well. Best of luck, and I hope you are able to resolve this soon.",

      "text": "I've also struggled with motivation, but the thing that has helped me is to write a little at a time as far in advance as possible. It's harder for me to write when I have short deadlines because it just seems overwhelming, but if I start with an outline on day 1, maybe just that can be my goal for that day. Then the next day, maybe it's write one page. I often find that when I start writing, I can end up going longer than what I thought I could. \n\nIf I am feeling particularly unmotivated, I will set a timer for maybe 30 minutes or so and write at least half an hour. If it goes off and I am not at a good stopping point, I continue until I am. Websites like Trello can also be helpful for breaking up projects into smaller, more digestible tasks. If I have to write a literature review, for example, that can seem daunting at first, but breaking it down into multiple subtasks makes each seem more manageable.",

It was because I wrote for a couple of months, stopped writing abruptly because I had to prepare for other administrative things with PhD. I thought so much about getting back into writing. One thing that helped me was to realize that writing is an incremental process. I told myself I'll write whatever I felt like writing and I could always come back to redo, reedit accordingly. It worked well.",
