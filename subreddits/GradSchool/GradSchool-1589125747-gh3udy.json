  "title:": "I quit and I\u2019ve never been more relieved!",
  "text": "After one year, I quit my PhD program last week and promptly cried happy, relieved tears. The decision to quit hit me and it was a gut feeling. After much reflection, I realized I had signed up for the PhD for the wrong reasons (basically social status-my family was SOOO proud when I said I enrolled, didn\u2019t want to disappoint them- and it would give me more \u2018clout\u2019 when asking for internal funding at my job), and after a very strange year of seeing how academia functions \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d I decided it wasn\u2019t for me and that I was much happier at my current engineering job with just my MS degree.\n\nTo everyone who is thinking about quitting or feels shame over wanting to leave: ITS OKAY TO REALIZE ITS NOT FOR YOU! I\u2019m glad I tried it. I was also so surprised at how supportive everyone was of my decision (lab mates, PI, co workers, etc). \n\nMy PI and I are on good terms, and he wants to collaborate in the future as two professionals, which I\u2019m very much looking forward to and am so relieved there are no hard feelings. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave me advice on my numerous posts over the past few months. I appreciate you all!!!",

I did it because my grandparents had been pressuring me for not having a \u201creal job\u201d and I thought this would get them off my back. I didn\u2019t realize that for a master\u2019s, you needed a better idea of what you wanted to do for a job when I just didn\u2019t know. So I withdrew after a few weeks, started working (not in my field of choice but it allowed me to pay off my bachelor\u2019s degree by the time I was 27), moved to Israel to teach English for a year while I had my quarter life crisis and then decided to try graduate school again when I was 28. By then, I knew what I wanted to do, I saved enough money to avoid taking out any loans and received a 4.0 GPA. Sometimes it was hard being one of the \u201colder\u201d people, but I was more ready then compared to at 23. While I am still not working in my field of choice\u2014and with Coronavirus, who knows what will happen?\u2014I am glad I withdrew from my old program at 23. Going back to school for when it was right for *me* was the most important thing. So good for you!",

They are working full time, some are married and some have kids and they choose to do schoolwork on top of this. I admired them for bettering themselves. Unlike in college, you can\u2019t bribe your way into graduate school. You get kicked out if you maintain a grade lower than a B, at least at my school. No one cared if you weren\u2019t a partner, weren\u2019t rich or a social butterfly. You went to class, did you thing and went home. I much preferred it to college! My GPA won me a scholarship to do a course in Ireland, a place I had always wanted to explore. That was not something I was able to do as an undergrad. I think I appreciated it more at 29 than I would\u2019ve when I was in college!",

Furthermore, there are tons and tons of industrial opportunities for engineers with higher education. Ultimately it\u2019s about what your passion is but to say that you would be in a similar spot to a freshly graduated bachelor\u2019s student is naive. In the US, up to 66% of PhD candidates end up in industry positions. In certain European countries, it\u2019s difficult to get an engineering position without an MS or PhD. \n\nI completely understand where the idea that Engineering students are wasting time by doing Masters and/or PhDs comes from. I had the same message spread to me by students, parents, and even some profs throughout my undergrad. That message is motivated by how much money you can make as an engineer in North America with just a bachelors (could be true elsewhere as well). It\u2019s a damaging message for people who truly have a passion for engineering academics. Spreading the message could be the reason an engineer closets their passion and enter an industry they don\u2019t enjoy. Generalizations like your message deserve a grain of salt rebuttal so that people know that both sides of the coin are valid options.",

Also, most engineers can get their PhD right after undergrad and be done by the time they're 28. \n\nBut you're right in that the gain may not be as great for engineers as it is for other fields since there is an abudance of well paying jobs for BS/MS level engineers.

Now I\u2019m wrapping up my first year, and have like 3 projects going by my own design that are supported by my PIs. It\u2019s intellectually engaging and fun. I advocate for myself in regards to self-care and don\u2019t overwork, so that has really helped my perspective. There are many reasons to do a PhD.",

When the experiments fail they don\u2019t blame the successful PIs but instead the poor grad students ground into dust.

The next promotion wouldn\u2019t have come for another 5 years or more because it would be to a scientist role (typically held by PhDs). \n\nThere\u2019s no looking down from my experience. Some PhDs in my group frankly sucked really badly at their jobs. Not all PhDs are created equal. That\u2019s the one thing that got me - I outperformed PhDs but would never make as much. If you can stomach that, then not a big deal. But, like, massive earning gap. Difference between 5 and 6 figures over a career adds up. \n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to be in industry without a PhD. You\u2019ll make a good living, get benefits, and if you work hard/smart, and advocate for taking any opportunities you can get ahold of while you\u2019re there - it\u2019s a good place to be. When job searching, definitely ask questions during interviews about what roles RAs typically take on in the group, and talk to the RAs. Make sure they aren\u2019t hidden from you. How independent are RAs? What caliber of projects? Also Qs like - are there academic collaborations (keeps things interesting)? Does the group publish (mine didn\u2019t and I have no papers to show for 5 years in industry)? Etc etc. That will give you a good idea of culture so you can make an informed decision.",
