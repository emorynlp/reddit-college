The decision to quit hit me and it was a gut feeling. After much reflection, I realized I had signed up for the PhD for the wrong reasons (basically social status-my family was SOOO proud when I said I enrolled, didn\u2019t want to disappoint them- and it would give me more \u2018clout\u2019 when asking for internal funding at my job), and after a very strange year of seeing how academia functions \u201cbehind the curtain\u201d I decided it wasn\u2019t for me and that I was much happier at my current engineering job with just my MS degree.\n\nTo everyone who is thinking about quitting or feels shame over wanting to leave: ITS OKAY TO REALIZE ITS NOT FOR YOU! I\u2019m glad I tried it. I was also so surprised at how supportive everyone was of my decision (lab mates, PI, co workers, etc). \n\nMy PI and I are on good terms, and he wants to collaborate in the future as two professionals, which I\u2019m very much looking forward to and am so relieved there are no hard feelings. \n\nThank you to everyone who gave me advice on my numerous posts over the past few months.

I didn\u2019t realize that for a master\u2019s, you needed a better idea of what you wanted to do for a job when I just didn\u2019t know. So I withdrew after a few weeks, started working (not in my field of choice but it allowed me to pay off my bachelor\u2019s degree by the time I was 27), moved to Israel to teach English for a year while I had my quarter life crisis and then decided to try graduate school again when I was 28. By then, I knew what I wanted to do, I saved enough money to avoid taking out any loans and received a 4.0 GPA. Sometimes it was hard being one of the \u201colder\u201d people, but I was more ready then compared to at 23. While I am still not working in my field of choice\u2014and with Coronavirus, who knows what will happen?\u2014I am glad I withdrew from my old program at 23.
