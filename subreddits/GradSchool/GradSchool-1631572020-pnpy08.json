One of the doctors that I\u2019m pretty close to offered to write me a letter of rec (and proof of medical history) for my grad school apps. For me, I think it would speak volumes of my character and the doctor is extremely prestigious (head of dept at Uni and director of hospital). I really appreciate the offer, but I want to be sure it\u2019s allowed? Since it\u2019s definitely different than getting one from a professor or a manager. I\u2019d really like some input before I go ahead and ask the doctor to follow through with the letter of rec.
