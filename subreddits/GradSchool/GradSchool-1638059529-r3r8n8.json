      "text": "Master's thesis, I assume? And if the thesis entails data collection, the data collection is complete?\n\nI think it will be a miserable 6 weeks and you'll need to stop all other work (eg. Side projects), but yes I think you can do it.\n\nWrite the methods first (because that's the easiest). Then write results. Then write Into and finally, discussion. That's my advice for getting it done quick.\n\nAs a side question, when does your committee need the thesis by? I think for mine, I had to send it to everyone 2 weeks before the defense day but I imagine every institution is different.",

(I'd tell myself, if I'm paying $5 for coffee, I'd better make it worthwhile). Take it one day at a time and one section at a time so you don't get overwhelmed, but keep plugging away at it. You're so close, it's the final stretch!\n\nAlso I found it really helpful to have an accountability partner. Me and another grad student would message each other our writing progress at the end of each day. It helped knowing we needed to \"report\" to someone.",

For my MSc, my thesis had to be approved by my advisor before I could send it to my committee. The committee members were then allotted 2 weeks to read it. Once they approved it, then it was submitted to the school and sent to the external examiner, who was also allotted 2 weeks to read it before the actual defense. That means my thesis was fully complete just over 1 month before my defense. This was after several months of back and forth with my advisor for edits, and everything would have been pushed back if the committee members didn't all agree that it was a defensible thesis.",
