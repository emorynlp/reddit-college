How do you ask questions that really increase participation? I typically use a PowerPoint, which I'm not a huge fan of, review concepts covered in lecture by asking students to tell me about them, and take advantage of partner/small group discussions so that students can learn from their peers. Any advice is appreciated.", "author": "Remarkable_Flight709", "created": 1632623949, "retrieved": 1632952029, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 5, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hebfjs8": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvl4f7/tips_for_leading_discussion_tas/hebfjs8/", "text": "We provided a set list of questions that students knew would be brought up (at least some of them). We never do PowerPoints because they're kind of a discussion killer. Students are also required to write reflections as their weekly assignment so they come in already having some thoughts ready. We started doing this thing where students had to include questions they had for the author/about the reading for each of the texts they were given so we use those too. We also spend some time talking about current events (the students are required to bring their own news articles) and loop content in that way. If you want students to participate and talk a lot then you have to basically center the class around that entirely. It's a little hard without knowing the set up of the course generally though.", "author": "RILES2987", "created": 1632637713, "upvotes": 3}, "heaunqv": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvl4f7/tips_for_leading_discussion_tas/heaunqv/", "text": "Don\u2019t be afraid of silence, lots of times it\u2019s students thinking or the silence helps push someone to speak up.", "author": "Unofficial_Overlord", "created": 1632625583, "upvotes": 12}, "heatgmn": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pvl4f7/tips_for_leading_discussion_tas/heatgmn/", "text": "I usually make a worksheet of example problems and then take them through it.
