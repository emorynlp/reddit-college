  "title:": "I Mastered out of my PhD. Here's What My Job Search Looked Like.",
  "text": "Sankey graph of my job search [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/naaj72/i_mastered_out_of_my_phd_heres_what_my_job_search/) since r/GradSchool doesn't allow images.\n\n (Sorry for the clickbait Buzzfeed-esque titled, I couldn\u2019t resist lol)\n\nHi everyone, I wanted to make this post because I have been seeing posts about \u201cmastering out\u201d of a PhD program, what that looks like, and what the job search looks like. So I decided to make a \u201cSankey graph\u201d of my job search to hopefully help demystify the concept. Sankey graphs are pretty popular on r/dataisbeautiful for visualizing a job search.\n\nMy background: I\u2019m currently mastering out of a PhD in neuroscience (I will be receiving a MS in neuroscience). I never really thought that I would be the one, out of my cohort, to leave the program. But, I started getting more and more disillusioned with my prospects as an academic researcher pursuing the tenure-track path, and starting looking into \u201calt-ac\u201d careers (still, with the intention of pursuing these careers with my PhD in hand). I eventually settled on nonprofit work\u2014either as a program coordinator/administrator, data analyst, or grant writer. As I researched these types of positions, and reached out to my network (which was sort of scary but definitely the smartest move I made!) to talk to people I know already in the nonprofit world, it quickly became apparent that my PhD wouldn\u2019t matter much, if at all. Unless I wanted to be the chief science officer at an international science/disease focused nonprofit, the PhD credential would not provide me with any sort of \u201cleg up\u201d\u2014experience seemed to matter the most. After learning this, I simply couldn\u2019t rationalize staying in my PhD program\u2014with its long hours, no real vacation, and low pay\u2014pursuing a degree that I would never need. So, I decided to master out. (My experience telling my PI is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/kwmjst/update_i_told_my_pi_im_mastering_out_it_went_well/)).\n\nI would definitely say I was surprised by the number of applications I sent out that ended up being  \u201cghosted\u201d. Some job ads specifically said they would not initiate contact except to schedule an interview, which like\u2026fine\u2026but I was still surprised! On r/dataisbeautiful, having about half of your applications (if not more) be entirely ghosted (ie, no response whatsoever, not even a rejection) is about par for the course. I suppose I thought I would be different\u2026I also noticed that, for every 3-5 interviews a person had, there was one job offer. I found this to be true for me as well (out of my 41 applications, I moved to the first step (either a technical or phone screen) for only 3).\n\nAs far as explaining why I was leaving my PhD program, I only had two phone screens where I could have potentially discussed it\u2014but it was basically a non-issue (YMMV depending on the field you\u2019re going into). In my first phone screen, the person I interviewed with was actually a fellow master-outer! And for the job offer I got, the person I interviewed with was also someone who felt jaded by academic research and went into the nonprofit world. My story was definitely not unique, and certainly no one seemed to hold me leaving my PhD program against me! If anything, I was complimented for knowing what I wanted to do and being willing to make a big change.\n\nSo\u2026should YOU master out? It FEELS like a personal decision\u2026but I encourage you to think about it like you would any other career decision. You do not OWE anyone anything\u2014not your PI, not your parents, not your lab mates, not your 10-year-old self who dreamed of being a scientist one day. It is critical that you do what is best for you\u2014your mental health, your career aspirations, your wallet. (And yes, your wallet matters.)\n\nHappy to take questions/commiserate.",

I\u2019ve expressed to my PI that I\u2019m perhaps not best suited for the PhD, but I feel almost guilty about applying to other jobs since I haven\u2019t explicitly told him I\u2019m planning on mastering out (although we\u2019ve discussed it as a possibility). Also did you mainly stick to your direct field or did there seem to be opportunity to branch out a little bit when you applied for jobs?",

          "text": "I started applying for jobs only once I told my PI/department. As far as job searching goes, I did that waaay before I ever thought I would actually leave, just to see what was out there. This is really key to finding out if a PhD is even needed (or even desired) for the types of positions you\u2019re interested in. I will say that, at least for the nonprofit jobs I was applying for, applying > 2 months before I would actually be available was probably too much time. And, if you\u2019re offered a job, most places will want you to start 2 weeks to a month at the latest from the offer date, so that might not be enough time to get the mastering out paperwork and assignments rolling depending on your program. \n\nMy field is very niche lol so I definitely branched out a bit. Especially if you\u2019re interested in data analyst positions, as long as you can convince the organization/company that you\u2019re good with data (no matter what kind or where it came from) that\u2019s very important. The job I got is in an area where I\u2019m familiar with the work because of volunteering I\u2019ve done in the past, not because of research.",

I'm currently having the same thought process...the more I look into the 'alt careers' I'm interested in (currently in a STEM field) the more I come across that the PhD isn't really relevant...it's experience that matters (and you can swing grad school so far as a solid x amount of years of experience). I actually have my first thesis committee meeting in a week and i'm a nervous wreck because I still don't really have a clear point for what I want to do with my research...I like doing experiments and getting data, but constantly worrying about fitting it into a neatly wrapped thesis 'story' is stressing me out, it's clear I don't have the same 'passion' as others in my cohort does. I would love the stability, structure and mental health alleviations that come from a more 'normal' job, where all of my other friends can 'turn off' work when they leave but it's always looming on my mind or I always have some sort of work/reading to do  :/ Honestly my meeting may be my inflection point/wake up call depending on how it goes. So it's reassuring that you have been successful in making this switch!! :)",

          "text": "If you or others are considering it, I would also encourage people to take a shorter view of time than academia encourages as a way to be kind to yourself about mastering out. You really don't have to commit to ANY one path, for any period of time.\n\nIf you're a first year master's student planning to be a professor, you're mapping out anywhere from the next 8 - 12 years of your life just to get to that point. Taking the very long view, and trying to squeeze life around the commitment, is the norm in academia, and there's this idea that you're stepping away from a huge life commitment and can never go back.\n\nIn many sectors of the non-academic world, people think on much shorter cycles: around five years. I tend to think three years ahead max these days. While a boss might be sad to lose you when you move on, it's going to be very rare to hear someone say something like you're throwing your life away by moving on or making any sort of big mistake. Moving on is normal. It's healthy. Bosses who guilt trip you are bosses you definitely want to escape.\n\nSo instead of viewing it as making a life changing decision, when I mastered out I chose to view it as what's next for me in my life: maybe I'll get a job, take a break from academia for 3 - 4 years, and see what's next after that: a PhD? A different job?",

              "text": "It's a very long story.\n\nThere were two major factors that moved me. One was an accruing body of experiences that made me feel like the majority of academic research in my field was frivolous. I thought that grant funded research was a form of public service. It's not and most of those researchers subtly look down on the American public as repugnant and unredeemable. Yet they'll bend the applicability of thier niche research over backwards ten times to make the NIH think their work could benefit that same society. There are tons of excellent, highly moral, researchers in the field who drive most change. If you're not incredibly skilled though, you'll never catch a minute of thier time and you'll certain never get an offer to join those labs. \n\nSecondly, I had a sadistic PI in my PhD who opened my eyes to just how depraved one can be and still garner departmental support. They published as second author once a year by running a reaction and sending the crude product to a friend's lab where it would become a single data point in the friends publication. They pulled in as many young female students as they could, but never gave them real projects. Instead they took them out drinking with colleagues twice a week groomed them for sexual misconduct. And at the end of their time they'd get glowing letters of recommendation. Some of them even got degrees. I watched someone get PhD from my PI off of ~5 reactions. The defense ended 10 minutes in when the student couldn't explain electron density changes in thier small molecule after derivatization. That's an undergrad topic.\n\nTurns out that a bunch of labs in the department were similarly hosting grad students so that the department could have cheap undergrad lab instructors. Lots of good students getting horrible support on projects that will never go anywhere. Lots of bad students getting too much support. Lots of lying, cheating, despicable behavior all over the place just so that a bunch of 50+ white dudes could cling to thier egos and lifestyles. \n\nI mastered out after 2.5 years. Getting a degree that I couldn't back up with experience and knowledge didn't seem like a good idea. I got a job and within 3 months I'd done more experiments than I did in my grad program and undergrad combined.  The value of academic education didn't even come close the information density housed within industry.  You can get by as a lazy person in industry,  but if you want to achieve more, the support is there.",
