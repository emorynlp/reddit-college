Here's What My Job Search Looked Like.", "text": "Sankey graph of my job search [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/naaj72/i_mastered_out_of_my_phd_heres_what_my_job_search/) since r/GradSchool doesn't allow images.\n\n (Sorry for the clickbait Buzzfeed-esque titled, I couldn\u2019t resist lol)\n\nHi everyone, I wanted to make this post because I have been seeing posts about \u201cmastering out\u201d of a PhD program, what that looks like, and what the job search looks like. So I decided to make a \u201cSankey graph\u201d of my job search to hopefully help demystify the concept. Sankey graphs are pretty popular on r/dataisbeautiful for visualizing a job search.\n\nMy background: I\u2019m currently mastering out of a PhD in neuroscience (I will be receiving a MS in neuroscience). I never really thought that I would be the one, out of my cohort, to leave the program. But, I started getting more and more disillusioned with my prospects as an academic researcher pursuing the tenure-track path, and starting looking into \u201calt-ac\u201d careers (still, with the intention of pursuing these careers with my PhD in hand). I eventually settled on nonprofit work\u2014either as a program coordinator/administrator, data analyst, or grant writer. As I researched these types of positions, and reached out to my network (which was sort of scary but definitely the smartest move I made!) to talk to people I know already in the nonprofit world, it quickly became apparent that my PhD wouldn\u2019t matter much, if at all. Unless I wanted to be the chief science officer at an international science/disease focused nonprofit, the PhD credential would not provide me with any sort of \u201cleg up\u201d\u2014experience seemed to matter the most. After learning this, I simply couldn\u2019t rationalize staying in my PhD program\u2014with its long hours, no real vacation, and low pay\u2014pursuing a degree that I would never need. So, I decided to master out. (My experience telling my PI is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/kwmjst/update_i_told_my_pi_im_mastering_out_it_went_well/)).\n\nI would definitely say I was surprised by the number of applications I sent out that ended up being  \u201cghosted\u201d. Some job ads specifically said they would not initiate contact except to schedule an interview, which like\u2026fine\u2026but I was still surprised! On r/dataisbeautiful, having about half of your applications (if not more) be entirely ghosted (ie, no response whatsoever, not even a rejection) is about par for the course. I suppose I thought I would be different\u2026I also noticed that, for every 3-5 interviews a person had, there was one job offer. I found this to be true for me as well (out of my 41 applications, I moved to the first step (either a technical or phone screen) for only 3).\n\nAs far as explaining why I was leaving my PhD program, I only had two phone screens where I could have potentially discussed it\u2014but it was basically a non-issue (YMMV depending on the field you\u2019re going into). In my first phone screen, the person I interviewed with was actually a fellow master-outer! And for the job offer I got, the person I interviewed with was also someone who felt jaded by academic research and went into the nonprofit world. My story was definitely not unique, and certainly no one seemed to hold me leaving my PhD program against me! If anything, I was complimented for knowing what I wanted to do and being willing to make a big change.\n\nSo\u2026should YOU master out? It FEELS like a personal decision\u2026but I encourage you to think about it like you would any other career decision. You do not OWE anyone anything\u2014not your PI, not your parents, not your lab mates, not your 10-year-old self who dreamed of being a scientist one day. It is critical that you do what is best for you\u2014your mental health, your career aspirations, your wallet. (And yes, your wallet matters.)\n\nHappy to take questions/commiserate.", "author": "lauriceman", "created": 1620775185, "retrieved": 1632845758, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 449, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "comments": {"gy09oan": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/naaofi/i_mastered_out_of_my_phd_heres_what_my_job_search/gy09oan/", "text": "Congratulations, this all seems like a huge relief!
