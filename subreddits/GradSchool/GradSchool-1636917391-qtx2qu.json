  "title:": "Do you have time for your interests/hobbies outside of grad school?",
  "text": "I\u2019m a first year graduate student in mathematics and reading a lot of these posts has really helped me deal with feelings like the never-ending stress and pressure of grad school. However something that has made me feel very uneasy is the complete lack of time for other things that I enjoy. I love reading books outside of my field, mostly sci-fi and philosophy and I used to like playing video games from time to time but lately it feels impossible to justify these activities. I already have to force myself to set aside time for exercise but there\u2019s always something for me to work on whether it\u2019s research or classes. Sometimes I feel so stressed that I just waste an hour or two on my phone and it becomes hard for me to shift to work. I\u2019m already seeing a therapist for these kinds of things (might get tested for ADHD) but I was wondering how y\u2019all deal with these feelings and if you have any advice for how to manage your other interests or if I should really just start accepting that I have to let go of them if I want to be successful.",

This is mainly due to the difficulty of the content forcing a curve based on class performance. It\u2019s so stressful because I know the content well enough to use it but I\u2019m sure some of my classmates are much more tryhards than I am.

      "text": "Just finished graduate school, and for the most part, I had time for hobbies! I also consider myself fairly successful (three first-authors, job offer in industry, finished in five years), so I don't think hobbies/success are mutually exclusive. I rock-climbed and swing-danced during my PhD, and also played a lot of board games with fellow grad students. I think it's good to set a schedule, as others have said already. It also helps to reframe your hobbies as high priority and try to see them as important for your overall happiness/well-being rather than being non-research/a waste of time. Definitely easier said than done, but it's great that you're asking around to see what other grad students have done. Good luck!",

I am as well struggling having time for my hobbies. I found my rythm with the mindset that I do every day a small bit, and in the long run I will improve in them. If you would have a full day off, how many hours would you spend on your hobbies and how many hours on the phone? I would spend almost the whole day wasting (without pressure). So, I follow my biggest hobby every morning for one hour. I get up one hour earlier.\n\nBut I can only speak for myself. It is not easy and stressful, and sometimes unpleasant. But I hope that I will have more time for them after graduation/job time.\n\nSorry, this is perhaps completely unrelated to your written problem. But maybe a different point if view helps.",

      "text": "In my experience it is normal to not have time for your pre-grad school hobbies until you hit comps. It freaked me out too because I always sought a work-life balance as self care. So, when I started to struggle during my first year of grad school, I went to the chair of my Dept and she gave me advice I\u2019ll never forget: \u201cnow is not the time for balance. You\u2019ll only be here a couple of years, and while you should be careful of minding your limits, getting the most out of this time is what should guide you.\u201d It floored me at the time (because work life balance!!!), but she was right. I went all in after that conversation, and cost/benefit, it\u2019s been worth it to me.\n\nYour self care routines will look a little different until you graduate, and this might include finding new, different hobbies that fit better with the demands of grad school. Keep in mind the switch is temporary, and that you absolutely can and should take breaks to do what you love sometimes. However, there are some things I loved to do that I\u2019ve had to let go\u2026 it\u2019s been like 8 years since I could enjoy fiction, rode a horse, kayaked, hell I even get haircuts less often. But it won\u2019t always be like this- the sci-fi will still be there when we\u2019re done \u2764\ufe0f",
