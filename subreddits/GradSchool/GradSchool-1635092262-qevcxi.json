  "title:": "How do I gently inform a professor I\u2019m grading for that the tests are unreasonable?",
  "text": "I\u2019m grading for a professor in STEM. They\u2019re very kind and understanding, and they give good lectures. But holy hell are the tests ridiculous. We\u2019re talking 10 broadly worded essay questions, and the answer key I was given was 25 pages long. Apparently this test ran an hour over a 2-hour class time because nobody finished on time. There are normally 15ish students in this class, but this year there are more than 40. Each of these answers has paragraphs and paragraphs of text, and if the students don\u2019t get all of the concepts that are in the answer key then I have to take points off. I also have to give them bonus points on cherry-picked concepts if they bring them up.\n\nI have spent 9 hours grading these behemoths and I\u2019m not even halfway done. The grades are awful, and these folks are going to hate me for it. The professor didn\u2019t take any of our feedback from last year that the grading felt arbitrary and overly stringent based on how open-ended the questions were. Now, I\u2019m inflicting that on the new people. I have a friendly but not close relationship with this professor. I\u2019m definitely planning on bringing up my concern that this is way, way more than they described to me (\u201cno more than 4 hours to grade the tests!\u201d), but how should I bring up my feeling that these tests aren\u2019t fair to anyone?",

I don't know if you're limited to a certain number of hours for this professor but you could say that you're not able to provide homework support because this is taking up all of your 20 hours for the week ( or whatever).\n\nMaybe you could suggest swapping out a third or a half of the essay questions for multiple choice. So if the textbook he's using already has a test bank pointing that out might make it easier for him to say yes.",

She said if the prof says anything about it just say [advisor's name]'s office is down there, please talk to her if you have any issues.\n\nFor RAing it was a little blurrier. My MS thesis was loosely using some instruments from a pilot project that never moved on the next phase. The move to RA was more she wanted to pay so I did not teach and could focus FT on research, which she could roughly say was a deliverable from other projects. Only thing, since I was technically working 20 hrs for her, she would occasionally throw some data analysis to me for her papers. This was rare and not time consuming, and was given easy co-authorships. Any summer RA work, got paid extra + co-authorship.\n\nSimilar with my PhD, fellowship so had FT to research. Any time advisor wanted help, it was in exchange for co-authorship, and if a lot of work or summer additional money.\n\nTo answer your question, first step would be to talk to your advisor. They want you to succeed and publish. If you are spending too much time with TA duties, you are not able to work on your research, which they do not want.",

Since you are working in this class, is the department paying your stipend and tuition benefit? If not, why are you doing it? If so, give them the 20 hrs per week of TA work and nothing more and if they ask where the tests are, tell them that, since you only work 20 hours per week, you haven\u2019t been able to finish them yet. Also, STOP working 40 hours a week in the lab. If you are teaching, you should ONLY be working on your thesis work (no project work/lab management that isn\u2019t related to your project) in the lab. If you are going to tell off your advisor (you should) make sure you document it. Send it in an email, that way if they fire you you can sue the shit out of them for wrongful termination.",

The best solution here in my opinion is to be lenient to students that had clearly shown they understood the material and did a rigorous effort. I would personally take the very pragmatic approach of making your own answer model as a summary of the original model. Then skim answers for key elements, arguments, etc. and try to model them into your own criteria. When in doubt, take the higher level of the criterion. \n\nFrom experience, there will be much more complaints and headaches if you go along with this type of deal instead of trying to take charge and bring the schema into reasonable standards. Professors are busy and make mistakes, and sometimes passionate teaching assistants are more in tune with actual teaching. A good exam should test for understanding and scientific rigour, and not for trivia or endurance. Of course this takes a lot of responsibility, and if you do not feel comfortable with that simply inform your professor how you feel. Unless he/she is acting as your PhD supervisor, there are little consequences to being straight up honest.",

      "text": "Omg I literally just finished grading tests for my PI's class, and I thought you might be my partner TA at first until I saw that you said you had a 25-page answer key.\n\nI don't really have much of a solution, but I'm in solidarity with you. My PI can be really stubborn and defensive at times, and I really think the questions are too open-ended and not very clear in expectations. (For example, sometimes the question says \"describe as much evidence as you can,\" but sometimes the student only thinks of 1 or 2 and it fucks up the whole grade.) Also, the questions this year were harder because it's an open book exam, but like, it's to the point where it's ridiculously hard for my fellow TA and I to grade too. Like 75% of the class failed the short answer, and it took us both 3 days to grade (and we had to work over the weekend too, but that's partially our fault for not starting sooner). But every time I bring up suggestions for how to improve the class or test, the prof doesn't want to change it until \"next year\" or thinks that the questions ARE fair, because the number of points in the grade is supposed to give the students a guideline for how much they need to write. \n\nI don't hate my PI, and I think are generally really kind and helpful, but it's just hard to give feedback sometimes.",

      "text": "I kinda have a similar experience. The essay directions are often worded in a way that prompts a lot of students to write about the topic in a way i don't think the professor is intending. It's very small details like the use of a word or phrase or not including a specific phrase one part but it's in another part talking about something else. Sometimes most people don't pick up on it but i can tell the ones who do and how it's affecting the paper. I don't want to give them a bad score just because the instructions could have been written more clearly or differently (my opinion). I've brought up a specific instance once. He doesn't grade these so the senior TA replied saying the instructions clearly stated that...  Well, no. They actually didn't but i didn't know what to do at that point and a lot of work to do. I gave them the full points anyway and made comments similar to how i would grade someone who assumed what the question meant but didn't give a full answer. \n\nI would also classify as more neurodivergent so probably spot these things more quickly than others. I find that there's a lot of assuming that every student is going automatically knows exactly what is being written and that's just not the case. This is probably extra but i put on people's papers that I'm happy to take the time to go over a paper with them if I think that could help them.",

That's why framing it as a grading issue is far more productive than making it just about the students.
