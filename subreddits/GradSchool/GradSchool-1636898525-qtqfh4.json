  "title:": "Is it normal for PhD students to be _constantly_ stressed ?",
  "text": "Hi everyone! A loved one has just started a PhD that will last three years (at least) and there are, quote, \u201clots of bitty things to do that ensure that I am constantly stressed\u201d. Is this normal? I always knew that PhD students had to be under a lot of stress and pressure, but for it to become a part of one\u2019s identity? \n\nI guess my question is: how to be of good support in these times? They do not really voice out their frustration as it\u2019s part of their personality so how do I know what is too much and what\u2019s not enough to support them? I\u2019d like to offer help to relieve the pressure but don\u2019t know what to do. Thanks in advance! And good luck to all in academia!",

      "text": "Yes, some amount of stress is expected. High levels of stress is common. It's not super constant, it's more that there are high stress and lower stress periods while we go back and forth between deadlines. I could certainly see the stress becoming a part of someone's identity, I've seen similar things happen. It's not healthy, but we're surrounded by very capable people in an extremely competitive field, so it happens.",

      "text": "Unfortunately yes, this not only normal, but also pretty much the baseline expectation. A PhD is deeply personal, and what you get out is closely related to what you put into it. Unlike an undergrad degree where lectures dictate the pace of progression, in a PhD it may feel like your pace is throttled *only* by your own effort and intelligence. As a result, it can bring intense anxiety and unease - even guilt - associated with the feeling that you could/should be working on that one little thing right now. Just like in undergrad, it is the *process of struggling* that imparts learning, and changes who you are. For someone with a negative PhD experience, some elements of that process can be negative or even traumatic (e.g., gaslighting). It could take years to recover, but some parts of the experience will be with them forever. \n\nYou can help your loved one by accepting at face value that they are as stressed as they say, by listening when they are ready to vent, and by helping to shoulder some of the tasks taking up emotional and mental bandwidth in your relationship or lives. That could include things like shopping, meal-prep, planning dates, selecting movies, suggesting to go for a walk or hike, making tea and encouraging a yoga/meditation session, organizing brunch with friends, whatever it is. Don't take it personally if they are unable to fully disconnect from the work to engage in activities, just make sure they know they option to disconnect for a few minutes/hours is available and that there is no pressure associated with doing so.\n\nIf they aren't ready to do an activity, don't push them - they may have a deadline coming up that is too stressful or difficult to even articulate (i.e., *I have to give a 30 minute practice talk, and yes its just practice but in reality its a 2 hour grilling session on my worth as a researcher that will shape how my advisor interacts with me for the rest of our working relationship and will determine if I can give the actual talk at a conference or if I'll just have to submit a poster or pull out entirely or...* etc)",

I'm getting a lot of hints of codependency in this dynamic. Don't overextend yourself, make sure you take care of yourself, too, for instance by not trying to do the impossible task of mindreading someone else's wants/needs. They will need to tell you - either that their needs are already met and they don't need any extra help, or if they do, they'll need to tell you what it is they need. If they won't express what they need, that's a them problem. We can't read their mind, either. I'd honestly suggest couples therapy.\n\nEdit: just realizing that this person is a friend, not a romantic partner. In which case, scratch the recommendation for couple's therapy. But still, you are not a mindreader. If they tell you they don't need anything, I would take them at their word. If there's something they need that they are not articulating, that's a them problem. They will have to learn to express their needs. You can't make them do this.",

We have remained in good terms and even expressed the wish to still be there for each other if need be, as we both still care very much for one another.

It\u2019s just that we\u2019re very close and even tho we\u2019re not lovers anymore, I still believe he might need support and encouragement through this and I want to support him, even if indirectly, even if non-romantically. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for advice here but you\u2019re right, we can all try and guess but only _he_ knows and I can\u2019t read his mind. It\u2019s just that I know PhDs can be very stressful and I couldn\u2019t just cross my arms and do nothing seeing him like this. He will not ask for my help because he\u2019s the kind of person who will not want to seem like a burden but also because of the new nature of our relationship. But he\u2019s still someone I cherish very much and I hate feeling helpless. (Sorry it started as practical advice and it became very emotional lmaooo)",

I\u2019d take that as a sign that he wants to move on and doesn\u2019t want to be close friends, at least for now.\n\nBreaking up with someone and never seeing them again is hard enough. It\u2019s much, much harder when you have this kind of weird \u201care we friends or are we still dating\u201d dynamic. He\u2019s living in a new country, surrounded by new people. Talking to your ex and being tethered to an old life that doesn\u2019t even exist anymore is confusing and stunting. He\u2019s not going to be able to make friends, date people, or get any work done if he\u2019s stuck in this contradictory relationship limbo with you. \n\nI think if you truly care for him, it\u2019s time to step back and give him space. Let him decide for himself what kind of friendship he is okay with, if he\u2019s okay with any at all, and let him set his own boundaries. You may not be the sort of person in his life who gets to offer support, and that has to be okay. You\u2019re just friends now, and friends can drift apart with distance. Trying desperately to hold on when the other is trying to let go won\u2019t give you the result you\u2019re craving.\n\nYour post history says that you\u2019re absolutely still pining over this person, crying over them pretty much daily. You cannot be their friend while you\u2019re still grieving your relationship. You\u2019re not their friend while you\u2019re still deeply in love with them.",

It isn\u2019t always easy to read but tough words need to be said sometimes. \n\nSmall corrections tho I believe: knowing him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s rebuffing _me_ as in _me_. It\u2019s his personality not to really ask for help, from anyone. Be it family, friends or professional help. He\u2019s willing to help others through fire but not always willing to let others help him. He\u2019s often very avoidant of the pain and just says he\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not very productive and that\u2019s for him to resolve but knowing this part of his personality, I still wanted to be of help. \n\nHe\u2019s also from the UK, and he\u2019s been studying at Cambridge since undergrad, so not a new country/new city for him. This new setting is actually very familiar to him, but I get that with the PhD he\u2019s had to make adjustments for this new life. He\u2019s got friends and activities for sure, which maybe help him through it, and maybe that\u2019s where I should let him be, it\u2019s not like he is completely alone and dying. I just wanted to make sure that he takes care of his mental and physical health. \n\nOn another note, we\u2019ve also given each other time, and space, meaning we don\u2019t really talk anymore. Except for those very few times (once every three weeks or so) when we both give small small updates and he\u2019s vulnerable enough to admit to being constantly stressed and not sleeping well, we don\u2019t talk. And that\u2019s why I posted here actually. It\u2019s like for the times when we don\u2019t speak and communicate, we\u2019re both giving each other space and I\u2019m fine with it, we both have to heal separately. But for the few times when we do speak and he says that, how can I be of objective help and support? I also get that I must not be his preferred helping person at this moment in time as it is confusing and you\u2019re right, that has to be okay. Yeah it just\u2026 sucks. But thanks for reading me and for taking the time to help me figure some things out, it\u2019s very nice of you!",

Having someone who never doubt that I can finish phd program was crucial for me to get through. having someone who support what/why I'm doing it was really helpful.

So whenever my partner keep encouraging me to do those things regularly and checking my mental health it was really helpful.",

              "text": "...ah Cambridge, that makes sense.\n\nThe academic culture at Cambridge is pretty brutal. There's a lot of academic incest here, so many people have come from Cambridge (or Oxford) undergrad and have had predictably privileged upbringings. That doesn't mean they're *better*, but it does mean they've been taught under a very specific model that focusses on very specific topics/skills and that creates an assumption that all new students will also know these topics/skills. And there's also a strong culture of independent learning, with a large focus on independent study in one of the 150+ libraries. Everything you want to know, you have to teach yourself.\n\nThere are also no classes and no qualifiers, so the moment you walk through those doors on the first day, your only goal is to submit your thesis. There can be little sense of community with your cohort without a common project, especially in a field like History where PhD students may not even have an office in their department and so have no common \"stomping ground\" to meet and talk to their peers. \n\nThe expectation that you already know x,y,z and the lack of meaningful academic contact beyond your supervisor equals a whole lot of pressure on one person's shoulders.\n\nCambridge expects to be the sum total of your life while you're a student and they are rather hostile to any suggestions or attempts to do other things. Hence why working (beyond supos) is banned and students have to live within 10 miles of the Great St Mary's Church. The stress is something they impose on you but you (your friend) also have a choice to refuse. You don't have to play their little games.\n\nIn terms of practical advice, your friend should make themselves very familiar with the bare minimum requirements to pass their degree because Cambridge will push them to do far more and it will be up to your friend to set their own boundaries.\n\nEdit: but you also need to be aware, this is not simply \"3 years minimum\". It is also **4 years maximum**. Unlike programmes in e.g. the US, there is far less flexibility in the UK and none at all in Cambridge. Either your friend graduates in 4 years (or drops to part time and loses funding etc) **or they are expelled**. So you should probably not tell them \"just take it easy for a few weeks\" or similar when they get stressed because that isn't any kind of solution and will often cause more problems for someone, and it just stresses you out 1000% more. Even medical intermission is a serious step with serious consequences and isn't something to be done lightly.\n\nI'm also at Cambridge and am managing pretty well (on track, have a happy relationship, am healthy and not very stressed), so you can DM me if you wanted to chat more about that setting.",

For me, I have kept some friends at arms length from my PhD. Firstly because I don\u2019t like constantly moaning, and secondly because it is nice to have people around you who are talking about other things a lot because they don\u2019t realise how embedded in your work you are. Don\u2019t get me wrong I also have friends I have cried to and complained to constantly, but I value both types of friends in different ways and for different reasons. As long as your friend knows you are available to be a \u2018PhD moaning\u2019 friend, if they are choosing not to then maybe it\u2019s because they enjoy talking to you about other stuff and it might be that this is really helpful to them.",

Some grad students PI\u2019s expect them to work 50+ hours a week, for 5+ years... and if that\u2019s the case, then that person has to be damn near 100% invested mentally, socially, and lifestyle-wise for the stress not to overwhelm them and potentially cause greater damage in said persons life.  On the other hand, some grad students are given much more freedom with their time, which of course leads to less stress, but stress is stress.  It may not be as much, but all of us have to eventually learn how to cope with it and maintain a healthy life.\n\nThe most you can do is be a support, by offering your time and talking to them on a regular basis.  We all need friends, and to vent.  Realize though it may be too difficult for them to talk at times if they\u2019re busy atm.  They may even lash out because of the weight the stress is placing on them, so try and not take that personally.\n\nTLDR I guess we\u2019re all stressed, some more, some less.  But we all have to learn to cope and manage it in a healthy way, otherwise the repercussions of unchecked stress will be damaging.  A friend they can vent to, or can be a healthy escape, is a good friend indeed.",

If you are interested to know about stress from academic/research, stress is always present. The unstructured nature of most PhD programs can really make us feel like we're always not doing enough because there's no solid indicator along the journey, which indicates that we have done enough (something like grades during undergrad). As long as the stress doesn't hamper too much with one's ability to be objective, the stress is normal and should be expected.\n\nWhile there's isn't really a solution to helping your partner to eliminate the stress, I think that doing little things matter. For myself, there are days where I would just be so tired from the reading, writing, discussions and meetings that if someone did my laundry, prepared lunch etc it would make such a big difference. Also, for PhD students it is very easy to stay stuck in our bubble of continuing to do research without any real breaks. So, inviting your partner to go on a quick day out or even a simple dinner, is much appreciated. So, yes my two cents is that the little things matter.",

Have you been able to find some things here and there to relieve the pressure (and possibly do them more often if they make you feel good)? I\u2019d suggest maybe trying therapy\u2026 again, I\u2019m so sorry. I do hope things get better soon for you and your mental and physical health!",

I took weekends off throughout the PhD and worked from home 85% of the time (only went to the school to hold office hours etc. because I TA\u2019d five classes). However, some people were quite stressed and it seems to be more common than not, even at a place like MIT.",
