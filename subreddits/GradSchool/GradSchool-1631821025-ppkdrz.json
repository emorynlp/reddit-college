      "text": "Thanks everyone, I really appreciate the feedback! \n\nSo far I've reached out to a handful of people, had a really good connection with one prof who said I could mention her in my application...hoping to have another couple options just in case, but I really want to work with her. Subject material, teaching philosophy, the way she runs her lab- it seems like a really good fit. Anyone here apply with only one advisor in kind?",

      "text": "Here are a couple things I would have liked to know before talking to \"prospective mentors\".\n\n1. The whole point is trying to figure out if you are going to jive with each other for the next *very long and often difficult amount of time* you will spend together. Build yourself a list of requirements that you feel you need to do well when under pressure and ask your prospective PI questions that will give you a good idea of how they do things. Get an idea of lab culture and what to expect from your PI before you go in.\n2. Is what's important to you important to your PI, the lab, and the school? As an example, if you like theory and you end up in a benchtop lab, you're going to have a hard time.\n3. Your PI will be trying to get a good idea of how *you* do things and if they will be able to handle *you* during your long and often difficult time in their lab. Be ready to answer technical questions from prospective PI's - about anything, but especially things you're interested in and things relevant to their field. My PI asked me technical questions about my work and my poor ability to answer on the spot was cause for concern, but they liked me so much they gave me a second chance. Treat it like a job interview, whatever that means.\n4. STEM Academia hates disingenuous bullshit as a default. The best way to turn people off is to actively try and sell yourself. Just be honest and transparent about why you want to do this, why their lab interests you, your abilities, and what you want. I've watched people get turned away because their entire interaction with the PI was essentially an advertisement. A good PI wants to know you. Attract a good PI by being genuine.\n\nAll this being said, just asking if they have a couple minutes to talk is always a huge plus. You would be surprised at how much showing interest makes a difference. When it comes down to it, a professor who knows your face and likes you will fight for you to be in their lab. Send an email, ask if they are looking for students, say you are interested in their work, and ask if they would like to talk about. It goes a long way.",

      "text": "\\#1 On connecting itself: With the e-mail basics down (e.g. promptness, politeness, and conciseness), it's more of a numbers game.\n\n\\#2 On choosing potential advisors: think back to why you wanted to do research--what excites you--and back to #1, but make sure you identify multiple people you would be happy with\n\n\\#3 On actual decision making: Ask current / former students to see the type of mentoring style, if they regret any (happiness is rare) and choose the mentor not the topic.\n\nOtherwise you are likely to be miserable the rest of your PhD.\n\nDid I ask: are you sure about this?",

Usually the program or department has list on the webpage of everyone in the department and the broad category of research they conduct.  Then you can go to their personal or lab page and see what they do.",
