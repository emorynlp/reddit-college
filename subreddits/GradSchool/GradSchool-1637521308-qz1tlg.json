  "title:": "Is it reasonable for my supervisor to be frustrated because I many questions?",
  "text": "The way my professor is as a supervisor is making me question applying to graduate school. \n\nBefore this year, I had done research with this professor before. I found him to be tough, but reasonable and helpful. Now I am doing an honours thesis with him for my undergrad, and I can't stand him. He gets mad when I ask for clarification for things, but also when I don't ask and don't understand something. I don't understand why he expects me to figure everything out on my own. He wouldn't even tell me where he kept a specific protein in his lab. He said \"figure it out\" when I asked where he kept it. Last time I met with him to discuss my research proposal, this is the actual conversation we had: \n\nHe told me I should have a graph for my expected results. I said I did make one but I didn't include it because I wanted to ask him a question about it first before I added it. He said \"no I want you to figure the graph out on your own\" and I was said \"yeah I did I made the graph on my own, but I wanted to ask for a couple of pointers. Can I show you my graph?\" and he straight up just said \"no\". So I said \"ok I don't really know what you want from me\" and he said \"I want you to come in here confident about what you're doing\" so I said \"yeah I am I just have one question\" he was like OK JUST ASK IT. \n\nHe doesn't explain anything. He expects me to figure everything out on my own by looking at papers. He didn't even tell me what my methods were, just that we were doing \"IEG runs\" and to look at some students papers to see how to do it. I had to write about it in my methods just based on other papers I found on my university archives, and I am not even sure if I used the right ones, but he won't tell me until I submit my proposal. I am also expected to go into the lab and perform the immunohistology without his guidance just based on the stuff I learn from papers. \n\nHe makes me feel inept and inadequate for asking questions. But then he gets visibly frustrated and upset and when I don't understand something. He expects so much out of us. I am expected to finish sectioning 20 brains by the end of December on top of the other work and writing my thesis and my classes. It takes 4 hours per brain. \n\nI have tried talking to people in my lab about him and they seem to think that while he is tough at times and can be rude on his bad days, every time they've met with him he has been really nice and he hasn't had any bad days this year. So I seem to be the only one in his lab who consistently gets him on his \"bad days\". I genuinely feel like he dislikes me more than the other students in his lab. \n\nI am independent but this stuff is completely new to me. I don't know how to quantify proteins under a microscope! I thought as my supervisor it was his job to show me how. And every time I ask him for clarification about something simple like \"would it be better if I did \\_\\_\\_\\_ instead of \\_\\_\\_\\_\" he gives me a long sigh and says something about how he is disappointed and wants me to start learning things on my own and trying to \"work harder on that front\". \n\nIs this what research will be like in graduate school? You just have to figure everything out by yourself and you aren't allowed to ask any questions? I don't know if all or even most supervisors are like this, or if maybe I don't have the right mindset for research, but my professor is genuinely making me change my mind about wanting to pursue research. I won't survive in grad school if my supervisor is like him. I can work hard on my own, but if I haven't done something before, it seems unreasonable for me to expected to just figure it out by myself.",

I think when advisors say you should know something they are just saying don't ask them.  Are there other students or researchers in your lab or department you could ask for help?\n\nIts completely unreasonable to expect people to learn things in a silo especially when it comes to research methods nor should you. Often times though if a PI is established they don't view themselves as that resource and mostly will only give feedback about high level concepts. Newer PIs will be much more hands on because they have more at stake. Find resources that aren't your advisor if you can.",

          "text": "Thank you I think you are right that he assumes I should be asking others. Unfortunately this is a small university and as such a small lab so there is only one master's student I can ask. This student doesn't know much about the particular areas I need the most help with because he did different methods than me. In fact, I am the first person to do this type of histology in his lab since 2016. So it is hard to find people who can answer my questions. \n\nHe is the one who wants us to meet regularly about the writing of my thesis, but I never know when I show up if he's going to be nice and helpful or rude and arrogant. He wants us to meet, but then when I ask him for his advice, he either gets mad at me for not knowing the answer or he tells me I need to be more independent. I don't understand at all what he thinks I'm going to get out of these meetings if I'm not allowed to ask questions.\n\nThe worst part is I feel like nobody else in my lab sees this side of him except his master's student occasionally. When I met with him the first time, he asked me a question about his research and I answered wrong, and he said \"I absolutely hate when students come into my lab and use that word, it just makes me so angry and disappointed\" (because I used the words \" systems consolidation\" and his research disputes this) another honours student in his lab said the same thing, and he just laughed! \n\nIt would be easier if I felt like I wasn't alone. But I really often feel like he has it out for me.",

              "text": "I understand if this might not be super helpful or easy to implement, but another thing to remember is that it probably feels really personal, but it likely isn't. A broken thing about academia is that PIs get to where they are because they are good at research not because they're good at managing people. They get to a point where they themselves are not researching but managing others instead and (most) are completely ill equipped on how to actually mentor and guide people.\n\nThat being said the advice is: i) don't take it personally (which I realize is hard). It sounds like your PI has the emotional intelligence of a tomato. ii) give feedback to them. Maybe don't be as honest or direct as this post but you can say \"I'm not finding these meetings helpful\", or \"how did \\*you\\* learn this concept or technique\", \"what resources do you recommend\". One thing I failed to do was not to \"manage-up\" or manage how my advisor advised me or tell them how you'd like meetings to go (which is required for many PIs and bananas that you have to do this).\n\nIf you are thinking of grad school, I'll just echo early career PIs are much more hands on and care a lot more. So if you realize you want to go to grad school and that's the style of mentorship you like, try finding labs with early career PIs that you can join. Unfortunately sometimes graduate school is getting the degree and finding the skills and mentorship style that works for you. If it aligns with your dream research that's great, but not usually the case. \n\nBest of luck!",

If you find you need a lot of reassurance you'd do well to join a lab with postdocs and senior students so you can direct a big part of the questions towards them rather than the PI. Hopefully they will be knowledgeable and happy to help you. \n\n\nAnother thing to consider is you and your PI might have different personalities and maybe you don't mesh well. This happens and it's not anyone's fault, just make sure you pursue grad school -if you decide to- under a supervisor closer to your style.\n\nI'm reluctant to call him an ass, given your story here and how others in the lab don't seem to have similar experiences at all. I also don't think you are wrong to ask questions and I understand it can be frustrating to be scolded for following directions that are unclear due to no fault of your own.",

His master's student is also not passive and will call him out when he's being unfair and that's part of why he also has these experiences with him too.",

      "text": "\\>  So I seem to be the only one in his lab who consistently gets him on his \"bad days\".\n\nIs it possible you're part of the problem then?\n\nI only say this because commenting something about 'sorry he does suck' doesn't solve anything. I hear my friends in academia and corporate life complain endlessly about new people incessantly asking questions. They don't try to google, they don't try to find stuff on their own, they just ask. It's really annoying and frustrating to see someone put no effort into learning something on their own and expecting to be handed everything on a silver platter. Often these people ask the same questions multiple times.\n\nGraduate school would require a lot of independence and initiative. It would require a lot of passion for the work, which would probably lead to figuring out a lot on your own.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh, but I can see why he's annoyed by you. Even in your own descriptions of events, which always tend to favor the writer, I can sympathize with him. He's being very clear in what he's expecting from you: confidence and independence. You're so afraid to make any mistake that you double-check everything with him. I am sure he has a lot of work to do and he can't be answering questions about every little thing all day.\n\nJust my .02.\n\nEDIT: I guess it's easier to live in an echo chamber of outrage instead of considering that maybe the undergrad shares responsibility in being the only person to have issues with this supervisor.",

Often, students new to research are afraid to mess up and seem incompetent to their PI or peers and so they second guess everything they do and ask questions about anything and everything, some of which might seem trivial or inane to the PI.

      "text": "In general as a grad student should try to figure things out yourself if possible, but it seems like your supervisor takes it way too far. Like, they really can't tell you where something is in the lab? Or at least direct you to someone who can? The graph thing I can kind of see because you can just look at good articles and do what they do, but they should still have a spare minute to take a look if you request. Sounds like he doesn't treat you very well. Maybe find another group or if you can't just ask the other students in the group for help when possible.",

In regards to the graph, I wasn't trying to ask him if I did it properly or to tell me if the entire thing was right, I just wanted know a question about one of the variables. I tried to find information about it online and in other articles, but there is extremely limited information about the protein I am using for my research and it is not something you would ever learn about in university classes.",

You could do research by yourself at home.\n\nThe reason you have a supervisor is that you learn the skills they have, but you don't, from them. And receive a little guidance so you don't waste too much of your time.\n\nI'd say they're being a bit of a jerk :)",
