  "title:": "Do you ever feel inadequate for grad school?",
  "text": "Ever since starting graduate studies I have felt like none of my work is something to be happy about. I'm always anxious and procrastinating work because I'm overwhelmed about how to even start. I have my qualification exam for my PhD in less than 12 hours (it's a presentation) and I'm still working on it. I often feel like, no I'm not actually qualified for this so I shouldn't pass, I should drop out. Yet I'm still here, stuck in a cycle of anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. Is this something others feel often?",

They were extremely encouraging despite my shitty results but I feel like an absolute fraud that doesn\u2019t deserve their support.",

      "text": "Feelings of inadequacy are completely normal, so don't worry! I always felt better after speaking to my supervisor as we could lay out plans for forthcoming work and discuss any concerns/worries that we may have. Remember that you are there because your supervisor thinks you can do the work and won't want to see you fail. Output, especially in the sciences, is highly variable, so your supervisor won't expect significant results every time. \n\nGood luck and try not to stress about your exams too much.",
