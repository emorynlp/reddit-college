  "title:": "On PhD, Covid, and Why You Shouldn't Buy a House While Writing Your Dissertation",
  "text": "Y'all, I'm so close. I defend on August 6th, but it feels like an eternity. I've been basically existing on coffee and anxiety. I turn in my dissertation in one week! \n\nAmidst this, my husband and I started looking at houses with intent to buy after I get settled into my job. Lololol we liked a house, put in an offer, and got it like idiots. Don't get me wrong, we're so lucky to have found a place, but the crazy market here made this happen much faster than we expected. My husband has been an absolute saint dealing with everything house related while I write/have panic attacks, but today the bank needed verification of employment from the university. I had just sat down to work when my (still saintly, if not poorly timed) husband reminded me. Thanks to Covid, the HR department was only open Monday and Thursday, so this had to happen today. I may or may not have had a panic attack getting ready to leave because I had work to do obviously! \n\nIt's just the absolute dumbest things that make me insane right now, and I'm pretty done with it. May my experience be a warning for you all. And may the committee gods be generous.",

      "text": "lol\n\nWe bought a house last year (closed in October) and then had to do extensive renovations before we could move into it. We moved in end of January and lived in the upstairs as the main floor continued to be worked on. The house wasn't done until May - well into COVID-19 closures. To make matters worse - when our main floor (where the kitchen is) was done - none of our appliances (dish washer, fridge, or range) worked!\n\nThat was all during my last semester of course work. Now I'm starting my dissertation, hoping to defend my proposal in October.\n\nI will add, having a house, picking out wall colors, cabinets, tiles, etc has been fun.",
