  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI  have good in-person rapport with this professor I worked under awhile ago. However suddenly over email he's being really short -- he had me write the letter, and now he's asking me to \"arrange a 3rd party to distribute recommendation letters\". I'm only asking him to send the same letter to three schools, and I've already had schools send out their requests to him.\n\nIs a \"3rd party service\" a thing? If not, should I tell him that or chalk this up as a complete loss?",

      "text": "Interfolio will do this for you, and there are a number of letters you can send for free. Very easy to use and highly recommend. You would sign up, and through Interfolio send your professor a link that he would follow to upload his letter. Then, you can direct Interfolio to release the letters to the schools you are applying to -- it is able to send the letter to an email address, upload to application systems, and more, all while keeping the letter confidential.",
