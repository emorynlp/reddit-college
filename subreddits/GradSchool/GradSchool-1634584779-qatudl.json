  "text": "I'm currently applying to Louisiana State University grad school for an MS in Oceanography and Coastal science.   \nThe grad school application requires 3 letters of recommendation. I have 2 professors in mind, but can't think of another for the 3rd. Is it okay if I ask a former employer in an unrelated field for the third letter of recommendation? Or do I need to wrangle up another PhD to write me one? Thanks.",

      "text": "Mine was two prof and an internship colleague (not my supervisor, but the person I worked closest with day to day and could give a genuine reference). A PhD is not a requisite to write a LOR.\n\nNot sure on an employer from another field. You could also look at TAs you had or post docs though.",
