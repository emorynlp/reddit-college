I should be ambitious and excited to study but I'm not.  I want to spend time with my friends and boyfriend all day every day and have literal depression at the thought of sitting and studying and going to class.  I don't know or expect if anyone has ever felt like this while in school.  I am barely scathing by with my grades ( you need a 3.0 to be considered in good academic standing) but have already completed 2/5 quarters (in my 3rd currently) I have every intention of finishing the degree but how do I pull myself out of this pity party? i think it makes it harder because my friends are all working 9-5 jobs and have that routine but I have all these classes in the weeknights (zoom of course because of covid, thats a whole other annoyance) and my boyfriend just finished med school so he has had a the last few months to solely chill and travel and I just get swept up in his free time as well. I know this is such a chaotic question and explanation but any advice on how to get excited about school and really force myself to commit to doing well.

You're not forced to do things on your own, and it can make you more lazy. There's a vicious cycle where not doing much makes you lethargic, which prevents you from doing stuff etc.\n\nI was in a similar situation actually, had one year+ where I didn't study at all basically. Staying at home makes it way harder, I guess all libraries are closed now, but going somewhere else other than your room to study can help a lot. For me, what happened was that at some point I just decided to stop being useless and just did all the work plus made up for the missed work, I don't know exactly how I got over that mental barrier, but once I actually started studying hard it was easy to continue. One thing which I think helped, and will probably sound silly, was to take cold showers. I did this cold shower challenge where you take a five minute _cold_ shower every day for 30 days (not a bit cold, not cold half the time, full cold the entire time). I kept it up for about a year actually. Anyway, it's surprisingly difficult to step into a cold shower, and it was similar to how I just couldn't start studying. At the same time, it's just a five minute thing, it's nothing, there's no reason (aside from heart problems) why you couldn't do it. Forcing myself to overcome that every day I think made me better at overcoming these mental barriers.", "author": "abloblololo", "created": 1620214718, "upvotes": 1}, "gx0imxt": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/n4admg/me_25_in_graduate_school_and_hate_it_i_am/gx0imxt/", "text": "I had burnout at the very end during my first attempt to do my Applied Research Project for my MPA.

I should practice what I preach, but here are some cool things I've learned: \n\n\\-Boundaries. Don't *ever* work past a certain point in the day. Be that 7pm, 10pm, whatever works for your biological clock. Give yourself a marker for the end of the day. Like -- drink a hot chocolate or something -- idk -- at the end of every work day to have like a transition from one mode to another. There are other kinds of boundaries (intellectual, physical, emotional) but this time-flavored boundary seems extra important to me. \n\n\\-Fill up your cups (as my therapist says). You might have a \"family\" cup, a \"spiritual\" cup, a \"hobby\" cup (it's turtles all the way down: physical activity cup, socialization cup, etc etc). Take time to fill up those cups and also whenever you take time to do those things, make sure you're actually doing those things (if you call your family and talking to your family is exhausting, then you haven't actually filled that cup).\n\n\\-Study buddy // accountability partner. Reach out to other students in your cohort/program and/or to your advisor/mentor/whoever. If there isn't any sort of writing or reading group then see if you can start one. I'm a total disaster and this helped *even me* (yes, me!). So. Yea.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm projecting pretty hard core onto you in this reply lol. These are all things I need to work on also.

My therapist told me that the method used to diagnose ADHD basically requires that anything else that could be causing the symptoms can be ruled out, such as anxiety or depression. Since those couldn\u2019t be ruled out for me, they couldn\u2019t diagnose with ADHD. So I\u2019ve tried to accept the fact that all of my ADHD symptoms are probably just anxiety presenting very close to ADHD.
