I need 3 letters for grad school, and I have 2/3 so far, but I\u2019ve been having a lot of trouble getting the third. I\u2019ve emailed my old boss, a grad student I was close with and lead a group for in their class, as well as a professor I had in a seminar with and none of them have responded back to me, which is really frustrating. I feel like I\u2019ve already exhausted my options for a letter so I\u2019m not really sure what else to do.  ( also- I can only send emails since I graduated in may and don\u2019t live on campus anymore)", "author": "nataliecherry", "created": 1631552320, "retrieved": 1632844595, "over_18": false, "upvotes": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "comments": {"hcpo348": {"link": "/r/GradSchool/comments/pnjirb/letter_of_rec/hcpo348/", "text": "How big was the class? Did you visit office hours? If you think that you made an impression in the class then it is worth asking. You can also use references from places other than academia, such as internships or labs. A well written letter from someone who can speak to your skills is sometimes better than an impersonal one from a professor who doesnt know you.", "author": "itwasoverthere", "created": 1631553214, "upvotes": 3}}}
